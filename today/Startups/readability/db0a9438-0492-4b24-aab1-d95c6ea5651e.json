  "text": "Pipedrive has released a new report, The Evolving Role of AI in Sales Workload Management, underscoring how artificial intelligence is reshaping sales roles and optimizing workload distribution. The report finds that AI is no longer just an automation tool but a crucial assistant that enhances sales efficiency and enables professionals to focus on high-value activities.According to the report, AI is increasingly being used to streamline administrative tasks such as data entry, lead enrichment, and CRM record maintenance.“AI is becoming the hardest-working assistant in sales, taking care of the repetitive administrative tasks that have long demanded valuable time from sales professionals—time that could be better spent building relationships, understanding customer needs, and closing deals,” said Sean Evers, VP of Sales \u0026 Partner at Pipedrive.Evers emphasized that AI acts as a “force multiplier, not a replacement for human judgment.” By automating key functions such as structuring data from sales calls and improving lead management, AI removes inefficiencies without disrupting sales professionals’ workflows.Key Findings from the ReportAI adoption is accelerating. The report reveals that 80% of sales professionals are either using AI or planning to adopt it soon, a dramatic rise from early 2024, when only 35% had integrated AI-powered tools.Shifting focus from volume to quality. AI users are spending more time on strategic sales activities, emphasizing effectiveness over outreach volume.Sales managers lead in AI adoption. AI usage is higher among sales managers (41%) than among salespeople (31%), highlighting a need for broader accessibility and training for frontline sales staff.Optimized workload delegation. 60% of sales professionals prefer to delegate data entry and administrative work to AI, freeing up time for customer engagement and revenue-generating activities.Pipedrive’s report reflects the company’s commitment to equipping businesses with AI-driven insights and tools that enhance efficiency and profitability. As part of its AI-first CRM vision, Pipedrive continues to develop solutions that adapt to the evolving dynamics of sales teams, ensuring they remain competitive in an increasingly data-driven industry.Image: EnvatoEditor's Picks Joshua Sophy is the Editor for Small Business Trends and has been a member of the team for 16 years.
