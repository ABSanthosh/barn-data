  "text": "December 13, 2024 3:32 PM The Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF) announced this week that it is expanding its Club Partner Program, its initiative to support the esports club ecosystem around the world. The program is expanding to 40 clubs, up 10 from its previous number, and has a $20 million investment to put towards this expansion. Interested clubs can apply for membership through January 10, and those accepted will receive six-figure funding to grow their organization. Out of the 40 slots, the EWCF plans to issue invitations to eight of the top clubs from the EWC 2024 Championship ranking while leaving the other 32 slots open to applications (member clubs have to renew membership annually). This year, it plans to target key growth markets in China, Southeast Asia, LATAM and MENA. Clubs have to have a track record of high competitive performance as well as an engaged fanbase on social media. Faisal bin Homran, the EWCF’s Chief Product Officer, said in a statement, “The EWCF Club Partner Program represents a significant step forward in our ongoing mission to foster a thriving ecosystem for esports Clubs worldwide while unlocking opportunities for organizations from some of the world’s fastest-growing esports markets, like China. Through this program, we enable partnered Clubs to attract fans with engaging content beyond the games, showcasing the personalities and talent of players, alongside their origin stories, while also developing their Clubs’ brands as fan-favorite powerhouses in esports entertainment.” Steve Arhancet, co-CEO of esports club Team Liquid, said in a separate statement, ““The inaugural program was an invaluable resource for our club, providing meaningful support that strengthened our decision-making to expand into new game titles. It contributed to one of the most successful competitive years in our 24-year history, including a strong second-place finish in the EWC 2024 Club Championship in 24′. We’re excited for the EWCF Club Partner Program in 2025 and the opportunities it brings while we continue to maintain our position as one of the most watched esports teams in the world.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
