VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. Learn more Google has released an updated preview of​​ Gemini 2.5 Pro, its “most intelligent” model, first announced in March and upgraded in May, as a preview, intending to release the same model to general availability in a couple of weeks.  Enterprises can test building new applications or replace earlier versions with an updated version of the “I/O edition” of Gemini 2.5 Pro that, according to a blog post by Google, is more creative in its responses and outperforms other models in coding and reasoning.  Our latest Gemini 2.5 Pro update is now in preview.It’s better at coding, reasoning, science + math, shows improved performance across key benchmarks (AIDER Polyglot, GPQA, HLE to name a few), and leads @lmarena_ai with a 24pt Elo score jump since the previous version.We also… pic.twitter.com/SVjdQ2k1tJ— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 5, 2025 During its annual I/O developer conference in May, Google announced that it updated Gemini 2.5 Pro to be better than its earlier iteration, which it quietly released. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the I/O edition is the company’s best coding model yet.  But this new preview, called Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking, is even better than the I/O edition. The stable version Google plans to release publicly is “ready for enterprise-scale capabilities.” The I/O edition, or gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, was first made available to developers and enterprises in May through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking can be accessed via the same platforms.  Performance metrics This new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro performs even better than the first release.  Google said the new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro improved by 24 points in LMArena and by 35 points in WebDevArena, where it currently tops the leaderboard. The company’s benchmark tests showed that the model outscored competitors like OpenAI’s o3, o3-mini, and o4-mini, Anthropic’s Claude 4 Opus, Grok 3 Beta from xAI and DeepSeek R1.  “We’ve also addressed feedback from our previous 2.5 Pro releases, improving its style and structure — it can be more creative with better-formatted responses,” Google said in the blog post.  What enterprises can expect Google’s continuous improvement of Gemini 2.5 Pro might be confusing for many, but Google previously framed these as a response to community feedback. Pricing for the new version is $1.25 per million tokens without caching for inputs and $10 for the output price.  When the very first version of Gemini 2.5 Pro launched in March, VentureBeat’s Matt Marshall called it “the smartest model you’re not using.” Since then, Google has integrated the model into many of its new applications and services, including “Deep Think,” where Gemini considers multiple hypotheses before responding.  The release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, and its two upgraded versions, revived Google’s place in the large language model space after competitors like DeepSeek and OpenAI diverted the industry’s attention to their reasoning models.  In just a few hours of announcing the updated Gemini 2.5 Pro, developers have already begun playing around with it. While many found the update to live up to Google’s promise of being faster, the jury is still out if this latest Gemini 2.5 Pro does actually perform better.  First hour with \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05\"Positives:– It's faster– It produces more output– It has a better macro play (multi file edits, better overview)– Output structure is better (readable)– It's more concise and LESS APOLOGETIC!!Before: \"You are absolutely…— Patrick Bade (@nishffx) June 5, 2025 you guys cooked, really enjoying the app builder. made a game and tested it out, it was using imagen to build assets on the fly ? and it's up, hosted, easy to share.
