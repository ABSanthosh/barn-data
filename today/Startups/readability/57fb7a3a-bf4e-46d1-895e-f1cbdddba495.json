  "text": "Franziska Iseli, an Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) member in Sydney, is an author, serial entrepreneur, and co-founder of Basic Bananas, which provides marketing mentoring for small businesses. We asked Iseli to share her observations after hosting an EO-member motorcycle adventure through Morocco. Fresh off the dusty trails of Morocco, I’ve got stories to tell that will hopefully make you giggle, ponder, and look deeply in the rearview mirror. There’s something pretty amazing about watching a group of entrepreneurs navigate winding mountain roads and face hot desert winds. Strip away the meeting rooms, LinkedIn profiles, and business attire, and you’re left with pure, unfiltered character with a side of dust.   After hosting an unforgettable EO motorcycle adventure through Morocco, fueled by copious amounts of mint tea and tagines, I observed something fascinating: How you ride is very much a reflection of your personality and leadership style. Keep reading to learn about the colorful cast of motorcycle archetypes and discover which one you identify with.  1. The Enthusiast: a heart bigger than their skills (for now)  They show up with tales of conquering mountains, dodging camels, and doing reverse wheelies. Then, they hit the gravel. They’ve got the stories to prove their skills: “Back when I was tearing up the San Gottardo mountain pass … ”  But when the rubber meets the road, they wobble through corners like a newborn giraffe on roller skates. They talk about lean angles and apex lines while taking curves at the speed of a cautious granny.  Behind the visor: You’ve mastered the art of the impressive elevator pitch, but you struggle when it’s time to execute. You know all the buzzwords, attend every conference, and have strong opinions about “synergistic opportunities.” Somehow, however, your quarterly reports always need “context.”  We love you, because we love all riders except for the jerks, and confidence is half the ride, right? If you find yourself doing more talking than doing, it might be time to zip it and lean into that next corner.  2. The Silent Ninja: grace under pressure  They barely say a word during the pre-ride briefing. While the Enthusiast is still talking, the Silent Ninja calmly checks their bike, adjusts their mirrors, and probably thinks about what they’ll have for lunch.  Watch them ride. They flow through corners with grace, make impossible passes look effortless, and somehow always end up at the front without your noticing how they got there. When asked about their technique, they shrug and say, “I don’t know. It just felt right.”  They also never miss a turn, a tea stop, or a chance to pull over and help without fuss. Legends. I’ve learned and still learn a lot from them over the years. I secretly aspire to be one!  Behind the visor: You are the leader everyone wants to work for. You don’t need to tell us you’re competent; people see it in everything you do. You listen more than you speak, make decisions with quiet confidence, and have this uncanny ability to be exactly where you need to be when things get challenging.  These riders remind us that true mastery whispers and doesn’t need to show off.  3. The Guardian Angel: excellence in service  Every group needs a Guardian Angel! They’re genuinely skilled and could easily lead the pack, but instead, they constantly look in their rearview mirror, making sure everyone’s OK. They’ll hang back with a struggling rider and somehow make everyone feel like they’re exactly where they need to be. If motorcycling had a Mother Teresa, it’d be this rider.  Behind the visor: You are one of the servant leaders, the ones who understand that true leadership is making sure no one gets left behind. You build teams that would run through walls for you, not because you demand loyalty, but because you’ve earned it through countless small acts of kindness.  In a world full of people trying to get ahead, these riders remind us that sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is slow down and help someone else.  4. The Red Zone Warrior: living life at 110 percent  This rider has one speed: flat out. They attack every corner like it owes them something, brake at the last possible second, and seem to think the “ride at 80 percent capacity” rule is for other people.  They can be skilled, though not as skilled as the previous two types. They constantly dance on the edge of disaster. Every ride becomes a high-stakes performance where they push both machine and physics to the limits.   Behind the visor: You are the high-octane leader who treats business like an extreme sport. You make aggressive moves, take massive risks, and push your team hard. You often achieve spectacular results, until you don’t. You’re either a hero or a lesson to others, with little middle ground.  There’s a fine line between courage and silliness; Red Zone Warriors often cross over into silliness.  5. The Curious Explorer: smelling the roses  While everyone else focuses on conquering the next section of road, the Explorer pulls over to photograph an incredible view, chat with a local shepherd, or investigate a bustling roadside market.  They’re not racing to get anywhere. They’ve mastered the art of balancing speed with savoring the journey. The Curious Explorer understands the journey isn’t just about the destination. It’s also about the stories you collect along the way.  Behind the visor: You understand that business is about building something meaningful, not just hitting quarterly targets. You remember to celebrate wins, notice when team members are struggling, and understand that sometimes a detour leads to the best discoveries. You trust your intuition to make big and small decisions.   You remind us that in our rush to get “there,” we might be missing “here.” Although sometimes you do get a bit sidetracked by shiny new objects.  6. The Steady Eddie: consistency wins the race  This rider will never win any speed contests and is perfectly fine with that. They’ve found their optimal pace—not fast, not slow, just consistently their own rhythm. They stick to it whether they’re climbing mountains or cruising through valleys because they have nothing to prove.  They’re like your favorite playlist: dependable, comforting, and consistent. While others burn out their clutches trying to keep up with the speed demons, Steady Eddie keeps humming along, mile after mile, never stressed, never frazzled. You never have to worry about Steady Eddie.  Behind the visor: You are one of the leaders who build sustainable businesses. You’re not chasing every shiny opportunity or pivoting every quarter. You’ve found your lane, know your values, and execute with commitment and consistency.  7. The Careful Calculator: safety first, adventure second  Day one: Every corner is an existential crisis. Every acceleration is a gamble. They love adventure, but their heart races a bit more than the engine. Sometimes they hesitate before corners, sometimes they need a gentle nudge to keep going. They know exactly how much fuel they have at every moment, they’ve studied the route three times, and they know the weather forecast for next week.  But here’s the beautiful part: What they lack in speed, they make up for in growth. Because by day five? They’re smiling, leaning into turns, and wondering why they ever doubted themselves in the first place.  Behind the visor: You are one of the leaders who keep companies alive during uncertain times. You manage cash flow, build emergency funds, and keep everyone employed. When you finally make that bold move, it’s calculated courage, and everyone cheers.  Which rider type are you?  More important, which do you aspire to be? And what must you adjust to get there? There’s no right way to ride, just as there’s no single formula for leadership. The thing that matters most is: Are you being authentic to who you are, or are you putting on a show? Are you growing, or are you stuck in patterns that no longer serve you and your team?  Courage isn’t about being unafraid. It’s getting up, turning on the engine, and riding the road less traveled even when staying put is the easier choice. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
