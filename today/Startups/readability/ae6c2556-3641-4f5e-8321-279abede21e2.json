Earlier this week, the company also announced a deal to buy data management company Informatica for $8 billion, its biggest acquisition since it purchased Slack for $27.1 billion in 2021.\"Sometimes you have a quarter when everything is going right for you,\" said Salesforce CEO and Board Chair Marc Benioff, 60, in an earnings call on Wednesday, per The Wall Street Journal.According to Salesforce's 2025 proxy statement, released in April, Benioff made over $55 million in the 2025 fiscal year, which ran from Feb. 1, 2024, to Jan. 31, 2025. His base salary was $1.55 million, and his bonus was $2,500, both unchanged from 2024. His stock awards increased by about $8 million, and his option awards by over $3 million from 2024. His $55 million compensation included over $4 million in personal security costs and over half a million dollars in aircraft usage. Meanwhile, Salesforce's median employee took home a total compensation of $178,949 in fiscal year 2025. Benioff made approximately 308 times more than the typical Salesforce employee.Related: Salesforce Has Used AI to Reduce Personnel Costs By $50 Million This Year.

The company's chief financial and operations officer, Robin Washington, said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that Salesforce has downsized \"some\" of its hiring needs thanks to AI. It's also hiring fewer customer service representatives and software engineers as its current staff use AI for greater productivity, but is growing its sales team by 22% this year.
