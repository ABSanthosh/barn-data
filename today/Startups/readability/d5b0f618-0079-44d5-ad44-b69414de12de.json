But as the industry’s grown, so has its environmental impact, with fossil fuel-powered ships now generating 1,000 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. Enter French startup Neoline, which is harnessing sailing technology to chart a new course and steer the maritime sector towards a more sustainable future. Neoline’s approach combines traditional sailing propulsion with modern engineering with a vessel that’s mainly propelled using the power of the wind, massively reducing the reliance on unclean fossil fuels and the associated emissions. The startup complements wind power with conventional energy sources to ensure the vessel can maintain commercial speed, safely complete necessary port manoeuvres, and produce enough onboard electricity. According to the company, if the vessel sails at a reduced speed of 11 knots – slower speeds are increasingly being adopted anyway across the industry in a bid to cut emissions – the technology uses half the energy required by conventional cargo ships. Neoline’s long-term plans aim to replace mechanical propulsion with renewable alternatives, bringing the company closer to zero-emission transport. The company’s innovation not only reduces emissions but also ensures dependable service on the high seas. For North Atlantic routes, its pilot vessels promise a reduction of 80-90 per cent in bunker fuel consumption compared to traditional shipping methods. Currently, Neoline is in the process of launching its pilot vessels to demonstrate the viability and scalability of its solution. With ambitions to offer a wider array of maritime transport options by 2030, the company is on a mission to redefine global shipping practices.
