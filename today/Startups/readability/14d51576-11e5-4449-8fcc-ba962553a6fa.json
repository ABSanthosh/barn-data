  "text": "Recently, I wrote an Inc. column about how Hailey Bieber built a lustful consumer community around her startup beauty brand, Rhode. In less than two years, she sold it to E.l.f. cosmetics for a skyscraper amount — $1 billion.  Bieber used the power of celebrity to take on big beauty, but not everyone is a force multiplier like her. However, that shouldn’t discourage you. AI creates immediate and profound opportunities to start, launch, and build new companies and brands with an astounding integration of research and data, plus creation and execution tools, all at supersonic speed.   Nothing like this has ever been seen before. The traditional notion that brands are built in years, if not decades, has lost all meaning. Just about anyone with the requisite ambition, creativity, and some money—not millions—can identify a market opportunity. They can build a direct-to-consumer brand and seize it with startling immediacy. Call it the democratization of disruption.  With AI as your business brain and a vast ecosystem of available tools, here is how to build a personal brand that follows Rhode’s success.  Create an innovation gap score A celebrity brand can afford to be somewhat generic because personality becomes the differentiator. Mortal, un-followed souls need to find open territory. This can come from brands that are failing to meet consumer needs or from the development of completely new categories.  The way for you to get to innovation is to engage AI in a three-step process to find the gap (with apologies to the U.K. tube system), size it, assess it, and unpack the competitive pressure. Then, prompt AI to synthesize those metrics into a single, consolidated opportunity score. A team of high-paid analysts couldn’t do it as fast as you can.  Scrape for success One of AI’s many superpowers is its ability to crawl, analyze, and surface white space across whatever categories you assign to it. I gave ChatGPT a very broad prompt: to design consumer startup opportunities that reflect unmet needs and frustrations across 25 consumer categories. ChatGPT is smart and experienced enough to investigate data sets that include categories with low-scoring consumer reviews and complaints on Amazon, Walmart, and forums like Reddit and Quora.  It connects those findings—which are proxies for consumer dissatisfaction—to other demographic and psychographic data. It also chases down Google search trends, looking for revealing language like “alternatives to {whatever}” as a signal of opportunity.  After prompting, ChatGPT provided me several potential opportunities, but the one I’ll use, illustratively, is a “Sensory-Friendly Laundry Soap.  The LLM gave me this cogent summary: “Neurodivergent shoppers often react to scent and texture. AI surfaced this by scraping autism forums and Amazon reviews complaining of ‘scratchiness’ or ‘overpowering perfume.’ Enter gentle‑scent, customizable-intensity detergent pods.”  Size the market ChatGPT scoured data about the size of the neurodivergent market, the skin-sensitive market, and the current laundry category and came up with the total addressable market of $10 billion for the overall sensory-challenged universe. The smaller market size of those with severe conditions was $1 billion. Not shabby.  Of course, if Procter \u0026 Gamble were scoping the market, then they’d have a boatload of primary data and millions of dollars for research. However, for nothing and in seconds, this is truly amazing and enough for an entrepreneur to make decisions.  Assess competitive density To compute your innovation gap score, you also need to understand how competitively active the category is. ChatGPT can give you data, including the number of SKUs launched in the last year, how much venture capital has been raised, trademark filings, and ad spending, along with other market metrics.    Compute your innovation gap score Based on those three component scores, ChatGPT created a weighting of all the new product ideas it generated, as follows: unmet need equals 45 percent; market growth equals 35 percent; innovation density equals 20 percent.    Among the opportunities presented, the laundry detergent for the neurodivergent had the highest composite score. It ranked above the second contender, a male-targeted microbiome snack bar, and way above number 25, bioactive peptide recovery bars.  Now, build it Building my new detergent would once have been complex and time-consuming. Now, ChatGPT radically compresses the development cycle. It can formulate products and find co-packers to manufacture them, and it can estimate unit costs at varying levels of scale, as well as estimate lead times.  ChatGPT can also generate names based on very specific criteria. For example, I want a name that is friendly, not too scientific. However, it should also communicate empathy with the neurodivergent community. ChatGPT can also design my package, create an e-commerce strategy, and build a Shopify site—complete with homepage, product pages, and optimized SEO.    Just as quickly, it can create a virtually unlimited range of paid acquisition ads for Meta and TikTok, targeting the neurodivergent market. Similarly, imagine a set of 30 targeted posts built on sentiment analysis, a library of competitor testimonials, and real-time cultural trends. In parallel, ChatGPT can generate an entire life-cycle marketing campaign. If you need to raise money through crowdsourcing, your AI collaborator can also work you through that.  I’ve radically truncated the process, but you get the idea. The traditional route to creating a new product—consultants, ad agencies, package designers, digital marketing experts—has been obliterated. It’s the difference between driving cross-country, or even flying cross-country, and a Zoom call.   Choose your analogy and choose the future. My neurodivergent laundry product diverges from the 100+ year history of product development, and so can your product. With thousands doing their own innovation gap analysis, legacy institutions have a lot to lose sleep over.  The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
