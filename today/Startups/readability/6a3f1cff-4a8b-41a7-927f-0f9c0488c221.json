  "text": "Donald Trump’s second term as U.S. president hasn’t even begun and already states are planning how to counter his administration’s possible attacks on climate policy—including one that takes an apparent stab at prominent Trump supporter Elon Musk and his electric vehicle-maker Tesla.California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday announced he would reinstate state-level clean vehicle rebates in the event that the Trump administration were to successfully eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credits available under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. A new version of the state’s “Clean Vehicle Rebate Project” would include “changes to promote innovation and competition in the [zero emissions vehicle] market,” according to Newsom’s announcement. Bloomberg reported proposed limitations on eligible vehicles, based on market share, currently exclude Tesla vehicles from rebate eligibility.A spokesperson for Newsom clarified to Inc. on Tuesday that a market cap could potentially exclude Tesla, but could also exclude other automakers, adding that those limits would have to be negotiated in the state legislature. Such limits, the spokesperson said, are meant to encourage competition and innovation in the zero-emissions vehicle space.Some have taken this as an outright attack on Tesla, including Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster, who told Bloomberg it is a “slap in Tesla’s face.”Then there’s Musk himself. The Tesla CEO took to the social media platform he owns, X (formerly Twitter), to sound off on the update.Referencing the Bloomberg report, he wrote: “Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.”But Sean Tucker, lead editor of creative development at Kelley Blue Book, says an important distinction to note is that the proposal is “not specifically excluding Tesla.”“Which automakers qualify and don’t qualify would likely shift over time,” Tucker says. “Tesla has been steadily losing market share for the last couple years as more competitors have released EVs. It’s possible that they would qualify with time if their market share fell beneath the value.”If California’s possible future rebate program looks anything like the version that ended in 2023, it could offer tax rebates for qualified purchasers of electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, as well as zero-emissions motorcycles, while taking into account household income. The now-closed program also offered prepaid charge cards to use at public EV charging stations. California reports the program helped to fund close to 600,000 vehicles and reduce nearly 4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.“We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California. We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future — we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute,” Newsom said in a statement on Monday.There’s been a lot of speculation about what might happen to EV tax incentives under the Trump administration, particularly with Musk at his side. Experts note that Trump lacks the power to unilaterally roll back IRA-related tax incentives, and that it would require an act of Congress to do so. Trump’s transition team has, however, confirmed he will come after the $7,500 tax credit as a part of broader tax reform, and Musk apparently supports the move, arguing on X that “it will only help Tesla.” Kelley Blue Book’s Tucker says Musk’s confidence could be stemming from Tesla’s position of dominance in terms of EV market share, as well as its “loyal fan base,” but that a scenario in which “every single electric vehicle in the market suddenly gets $7,500 more expensive,” won’t likely benefit any EV-maker. Even given Tesla’s hypothetical exclusion from California’s rebate program, Tucker says the automaker faces more serious obstacles. “Most of the challenges that Tesla faces right now, they’re going to face with or without that credit, in that they just have more competition every single day and an aging line of products,” Tucker says.",
