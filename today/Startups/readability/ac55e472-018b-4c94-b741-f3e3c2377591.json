  "link": "",
  "description": "This time around, we have a bit of a different format, featuring the book that started it all, The 4-Hour Workweek, which was published in 2007. It’s crazy to think that the 20th anniversary is around the corner. Readers and listeners often ask me what I would change or update, but in my mind, an equally interesting question is: what wouldn’t I change? What stands the test of time and hasn’t lost any potency? This episode features three chapters from the audiobook of The 4-Hour Workweek that are time-tested. They represent tools and frameworks that have changed my life and that I still use today.The 4-Hour Workweek: Expanded and Updated is written by Timothy Ferriss and narrated by Ray Porter. The audiobook, produced and copyrighted by Blackstone Publishing, is available wherever audiobooks are sold. You can find it on Audible, Apple, Google, Spotify, Downpour.com, or wherever you get your favorite audiobooks.Sponsors:Seed's DS-01® Daily Synbiotic broad spectrum 24-strain probiotic + prebiotic: https://Seed.com/Tim (Use code 25TIM for 25% off your first month's supply)Helix Sleep premium mattresses: https://HelixSleep.com/Tim (20% off all mattress orders and two free pillows)AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement: https://DrinkAG1.com/Tim (1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase.)Timestamps:[00:00] Intro (D is for definition).[05:43] Beating the game, not playing the game.[10:11] Challenging the status quo vs. being stupid.[11:48] Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance.[13:40] Interest and energy are cyclical.[15:06] Less is not laziness.[16:24] The timing is never right.[17:24] Ask for forgiveness, not permission.[18:01] Emphasize strengths, don’t fix weaknesses.[18:57] Things in excess become their opposite.[20:02] Money alone is not the solution.[21:24] Relative income is more important than absolute income.[24:13] Distress is bad, eustress is good.[25:59] Questions and actions.[27:45] Dodging bullets: fear-setting and escaping paralysis.[32:51] The power of pessimism: defining the nightmare.[36:59] Conquering fear = defining fear.[39:55] Uncovering fear disguised as optimism.[42:00] Someone call the Maître d'.[45:02] Questions and actions.[49:45] System reset: Being unreasonable and unambiguous.[53:13] Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic.[55:41] What do you want?
