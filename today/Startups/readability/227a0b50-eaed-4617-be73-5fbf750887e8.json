That could prove a difficult task, given that traditional energy distribution and charging infrastructure upgrades can be slow and expensive. Startup ElectricFish has an alternative – AI-powered, intelligent grid edge infrastructure. ElectricFish offers battery-integrated EV chargers that deliver high-speed charging without costly grid upgrades, making it easier for fleet operators and businesses to electrify their transportation systems. Instead of pulling power from the grid whenever a car plugs in, ElectricFish’s device uses a large battery. The battery charges when excess renewable energy is available, detaching the EV charging load from the grid. Anurag Kamal, the company’s CEO, told Springwise that the chargers offer 350 kilowatt hours of energy storage for 350 kilowatts of charging power – “40 per cent faster than Tesla’s Superchargers and 50 times quicker to install than other fast-charging options.” Kamal highlights that the technology also reduces lifecycle emissions by 40-60 per cent, significantly lowering the carbon intensity of EV charging. Notably, ElectricFish is committed to expanding access to underserved communities, because, as Kamal points out: “minority neighbourhoods are 30 per cent less likely to have public chargers”. In addition, during outages, the system can help stabilise the grid, ensuring that all communities benefit from clean energy. ElectricFish is currently working to scale its operations, with plans to expand its manufacturing operations, reduce charger costs, and improve the reliability of its technology. Earlier this year, the company announced it had been awarded a grant from the California Energy Commission, and it is now raising equity financing to support production. According to Kamal, “Expansion into new markets, alongside bolstering partnerships and pilots, is a key part of the company’s next steps.” Written By: Lisa Magloff 10th October 2024 Email: hello@electricfish.co Website: electricfish.co Contact: electricfish.co/contact-us",
