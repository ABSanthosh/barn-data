But Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Dannce.ai is aiming to change that process by applying artificial intelligence to quantify movement.“There’s so many fields that have been revolutionized by data science and advanced analytics capabilities, but movement-disorder care is really one of the last frontiers,” says Dannce.ai CEO and co-founder Rob Baldoni, who is just 25 years old.The DANNCE.AI team (from left to right): Tim Dunn (Chief Scientific Officer \u0026 co-founder), Suraj Dhulipalla (Software Engineer), Shereen Shermak (Chief Operating Officer), Rebekah Griesenauer (Head of Data), Joe Chan (Chief Technology Officer), Rob Baldoni (Chief Executive Officer \u0026 co-founder), Jesse Marshall (co-founder).

It all starts with capturing a patient’s movement during routine motor testing with a clinician by using as many as six cameras. Employing computer vision to analyze the video, the company’s algorithm identifies the patient’s body in space and samples their movement profile, based on a number of different inputs including the location and movement of joints. The AI-powered system then analyzes the movement to identify thousands of discrete behaviors, and track them over time.“We cluster these observed behaviors in this kind of map with hot spots on it,” Baldoni says. “A hot spot could correspond to a behavior that a patient exhibits a lot during the window of observation, and that behavior could be correlated with Parkinson’s, for example.”Furthermore, gathering this data over time can be especially useful for monitoring the progression of disease or determining the efficacy of a drug therapy or treatment. In fact, drug development is another important potential application of the company; it’s also a potential revenue stream with a shorter runway than clinical applications, which typically require lengthy trials. Baldoni says the company is currently working on a paid pilot, sponsored by a biopharmaceutical company, but declined to share which one.Baldoni says that Dannce.ai has the potential to increase access to specialized care, which can be especially crucial for individuals coping with aggressive conditions like ALS. Baldoni says that the movement specialists Dannce.ai works with report wait times for new patients that range from nine to 18 months.“Even in well-funded metropolitan areas in the United States, it’s really difficult for patients to see a movement disorder specialist,” he says. But Dannce.ai says its technology can be deployed to settings where specialists aren’t necessarily available, like primary care facilities, and could then deliver care via telehealth. Baldoni also envisions applications beyond movement disorders to neuropsychiatric disorders that involve movement, such as autism, ADHD, and tardive dyskinesia.For now, the team of just seven people is focused on clinical and technical validation of the platform, as well as an ongoing study on Parkinson’s and an upcoming one on MS.",
