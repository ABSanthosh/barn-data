  "text": "This column is part of The First 90 Days, a series about how to make 2025 a year of breakout growth for your business.Storytelling is an essential skill for leaders, especially in fast-changing environments where innovation and disruption are the rule, not the exception. Storytelling helps leaders communicate big concepts, motivate people to act, build trust, and establish consensus for an objective.Here are seven ways that you can put storytelling to work for you as a leader.1. Understand the power of narrative.Storytelling is a deeply human trait—embedded in our DNA. Stories give meaning and context, helping us make sense of the world and relate to other people emotionally. Those leaders who know how to use narrative are able to harness this primal human ability to shape and motivate others. Remember, the route to the head passes through the heart.2. Craft your story.When you create your story, consider these vital elements: Context: Talk about the future in a visionary way, where change creates opportunity. Emotion: Embrace empathy by talking about the distance between wish and challenge. Facts: Provide facts that prove the value of your idea. 3. Embrace vulnerability.Genuine storytelling requires leaders to be vulnerable and to tell their own stories. When leaders reveal their true inner selves, they connect with and build trust with their audiences, making them more open to their message.4. Make sure your message resonates widely.Make sure that you tell a story that resonates with the vast majority of people in your audience. If your story is directed only to a select few, then everyone else will tune you out. You need to be really familiar with your audience—their wants and their thoughts—to achieve this goal. You also need to tell a story that is strong, understandable, and appeals to their emotions.5. Think big.As a leader, you need to get past the small-scale stories that don’t amount to much individually and instead consider larger narratives. These narratives tie together the threads at a grander scale, stitching stories together to convey a bigger picture and show us why it’s important.6. Move forward in an age of change.Storytelling is more important than ever in today’s rapidly changing, chaotic world of business. To get the most out of storytelling as a leader, learn to change your narrative to reach an audience that is overloaded with data and that might be distrustful of authority figures.7. Make storytelling a core organizational capability.Coach and equip leaders and team members at every level to become great storytellers as you build storytelling into the culture and processes of your organization. Building narrative intelligence into your organization will put it firmly on the path to success.Through the art and science storytelling, leaders can improve their influence, innovate, and create a better future for their companies and employees.
