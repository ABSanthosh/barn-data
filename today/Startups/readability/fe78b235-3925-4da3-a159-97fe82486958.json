  "text": "Senior Manager, Advocacy \u0026 Community Marketing, Intercom @KateSugrue You satisfy your customers, but can you satisfy our curiosity? With Ehsan Rishat, Head of Customer Success at REsimpli. Please tell us a little bit about your company and what you do there. At REsimpli, we’re all about making life easier for real estate investors. We provide the tools they need to scale efficiently, close more deals, and focus on what really matters. As the Head of Customer Success, I get to connect our product’s potential with our customers’ goals. What word or phrase in customer service jargon should be retired? “Let me reach out to the backend.” It makes it sound like there’s a huge divide between the customer service team and the technical team – like we’re passing the buck. Which celebrity would be really great at your job, and why? Keanu Reeves, hands down. He’s cool under pressure, incredibly humble, and always puts others at ease. Plus, his calm and collected vibe would be perfect for handling tricky customer situations with grace. What’s the most valuable thing that working in customer service has taught you? It’s taught me that empathy and patience can work wonders. Even the toughest situations can turn into trust-building moments if you approach them with care and understanding. It’s not just about fixing problems – it’s about showing customers they matter. Describe the essence of great customer service using only three words. Listen, solve, delight. Which movie robot would you choose as your AI sidekick, and why? Baymax from Big Hero 6. He’s smart, resourceful, and deeply empathetic – everything you want in a sidekick. Plus, who wouldn’t want a robot that can solve problems and give big warm hugs when needed? What can you do that a bot will never be able to replicate? Connecting with people on a personal, emotional level. Bots can provide answers, but they can’t celebrate a customer’s success or genuinely empathize with their frustrations. Those human moments are where the magic happens. Do you identify more with the title “customer support,” “customer service,” “customer success,” or “customer experience,” and why? I identify most with “customer success” because it’s all about being proactive. It’s not just about solving problems but about helping customers achieve their goals and get the most out of our tools. It’s a mindset shift from reactive to impactful. What’s the one piece of advice you would give to your peers in the customer service industry? Track your team’s performance and celebrate their wins. Recognizing achievements – big or small – keeps your team motivated and engaged, and that positivity translates directly into better customer experiences. A happy team that feels valued will always go the extra mile for your customers! What’s your greatest productivity hack? Time blocking for specific tasks is my secret weapon. By dedicating focused time slots for emails, project planning, and team check-ins, I can get more done and stay sharp throughout the day. What book are you reading at the moment? The 80/20 Principle by Richard Koch. It’s a fantastic deep dive into how 20% of efforts often drive 80% of results. It’s changed how I prioritize everything – focusing on what truly makes an impact instead of getting stuck in busy work. What’s the best thing a customer has ever said to you? One of our customer support agents, Jay, received this feedback recently, and it really stuck with me: “Jay was great – super helpful and ready to bring the solutions I was looking for. [They] went above and beyond to make sure everything was resolved. The support REsimpli has is unmatched!” Hearing something like this reminds us why we love what we do – creating experiences that truly make a difference. What gif best describes your mental state right now? Where do you get your support leadership news? I’m a big fan of CSM Practice newsletters by Irit Eizips. Her insights into customer success strategies and leadership are incredibly practical and always relevant. They’ve helped me refine how we deliver value and stay ahead of industry trends. What do you wish people knew about working in customer service? It’s one of the most creative and rewarding roles out there. You’re not just answering questions – you’re solving puzzles, building relationships, and shaping how customers see your company. It’s a dynamic mix of strategy, empathy, and execution. If you wrote a book about your experiences in customer service, what would the title be? “Guiding with Value: How Customer Support Drives Smart Decisions.” The book would focus on how support isn’t just about fixing issues – it’s about guiding customers toward smarter choices, building trust, and ensuring their success every step of the way. What’s the strangest thing a customer has asked you? Someone once dropped into our live chat and casually asked, “What’s your churn percentage?” They might’ve been curious, a competitor, or just trying to keep me on my toes! What’s your most used emoji in customer chats? 🙌 because it’s perfect for celebrating wins, big or small. Whether it’s a customer closing a deal or resolving a tricky issue, it’s my go-to for spreading positivity! Conversation closed… for now 😏 If you’re interested in being featured in our Response Time series, you can share your insights on customer service – and what your greatest productivity hack is – with us here.
