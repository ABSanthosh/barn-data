  "text": "Entrepreneur Carlos Watson was sentenced to 116 months in prison on Monday for his role in the collapse of Ozy Media, the once high-flying company he founded in 2012. In July, jurors in Brooklyn federal court convicted Watson, 55, of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft because of actions he took as the founder of Ozy Media. Ahead of his sentencing last week, Watson spoke exclusively to Inc., insisting he was innocent and targeted by a justice system biased against Black entrepreneurs. Watson is expected to appeal. But government prosecutors successfully argued that Watson was singled out because of his criminal behavior. He along with his deputies, Samir Rao and Suzee Han, stood accused of falsifying documents and, in a particularly notorious incident, impersonating a YouTube executive to defraud investors out of tens of millions of dollars. (Rao and Han, who testified against Watson, will be sentenced in January.) Ozy Media had been a success story in the 2010s digital media landscape, inking deals with NPR and the Oprah Winfrey Network. It’s signature Ozy Fest that drew the likes of Deepak Chopra and Stacey Abrams. Prior to his sentencing, Watson was held for several weeks in New York’s notoriously dangerous Metropolitan Detention Center. “It’s a terrorizing place,” he told Inc. “You can never know how bad it is until you’re there.” He tried to lend an ear to fellow inmates, he said, and spoke of turning his experience into something positive in the future. “Maybe I’ll learn something and maybe I’ll be better able to help other people.” In handing down the sentence, Judge Eric Komitee called the case “a tragedy of Mr. Watson’s own making,” according to The New York Times. Watson will begin his sentence on May 28, 2025.",
