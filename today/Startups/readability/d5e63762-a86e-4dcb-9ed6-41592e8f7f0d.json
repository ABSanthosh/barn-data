  "text": "As part of his plan to dismantle the Education Department,  President Trump on Friday announced that federal student loan management will move to the Small Business Administration. This on the same day that the agency tasked with serving the country’s entrepreneurs announced that it was slashing its headcount by 43 percent.  “I have decided that the SBA headed by Kelly Loeffler will handle all of the student loan portfolio,” Trump said on Friday. “We have a portfolio that’s very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal. And that’s coming out of the Department of Education immediately.” That’s going to be quite an added load on SBA, which has long been seen as understaffed. But Loeffler outlined on Friday that her agency was trimming around 2,700 positions from its workforce of about 6,500 employees. That reduction will encompass those who voluntarily step away as well the end of pandemic-era appointments. In addition, the agency said there would be a “limited number of reductions in force.” In reducing its headcount, the SBA said it would return to pre-pandemic staffing levels. The agency says the measure will save taxpayers more than $435 million each year by fiscal year 2026 (which begins next October 1) since the average employee earned more than $132,000 annually. For its revamped priorities, the agency said it intends to shift resources to expand “capital formation functions,” in addition to beefing up fraud prevention measures.  But the SBA did not include managing the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio anywhere within its memo announcing its restructuring.  Trump’s maneuvering is an attempt to hollow out the Education Department while staying within the law, since only Congress can eliminate it. He also moved programs for students with disabilities to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The shift of loans to SBA was immediately criticized by Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), who also is the ranking member on the House Committee on Small Business, who said that entrepreneurs will lose support from the agency should the plan proceed. “The decision is made even more absurd by the fact that SBA just released a reorganization plan that cuts nearly half its workforce and makes no mention of taking on responsibility for student loans,” Velázquez said in a statement. “SBA does not have the personnel or the resources to take on this massive responsibility.”  SBA Administrator Loeffler on Friday said in a statement that the prior SBA had been “plagued by mission creep,” a nod to the voter registration agreement that the former administration inked with the state of Michigan. Republican lawmakers argued that it was a politicization of the agency, even though the effort would have signed up those from any political party.  For now, she doesn’t seem concerned with operating with less staff. “Just like the small business owners we support, we must do more with less,” Loeffler said in a statement announcing the restructuring. “By eliminating non-mission-critical positions and consolidating functions, we will revert to the staffing levels of the last Trump Administration.” During fiscal year 2024, the Biden administration’s SBA dispersed $56 billion worth of capital, which was 22 percent higher compared with the prior fiscal year. The restructuring comes in the wake of other moves. In recent weeks, the SBA moved its offices away from six so-called sanctuary cities–including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City, and Seattle–to “less costly,” yet unspecified areas. Democratic lawmakers argue that doing so is also rooted in partisan politics.  It’s unclear which office within the SBA will devote itself to managing the student loan portfolio and how thinly spread the agency will be as it tries to devote attention to both the nation’s entrepreneurs and millions of student loan borrowers. The SBA did not immediately respond to Inc.’s request for comment.The preferred-rate application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is this Friday, March 21, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
