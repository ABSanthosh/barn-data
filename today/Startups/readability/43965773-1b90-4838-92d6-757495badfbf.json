  "text": "Employee ownership is gaining traction and fast. Much of that momentum can be credited to KKR executive Pete Stavros and his nonprofit organization, Ownership Works. It has brought widespread attention to the power of giving employees a financial stake in the businesses they help build. However, there’s more to employee ownership than stock options or equity shares. Since 1993, my work has focused on fostering what’s known as psychological ownership—an approach that allows employees think and act like owners, regardless of whether they hold equity. When paired with financial ownership, it becomes a transformative force to improve business results and the lives of the people who drive those results. Why psychological ownership matters Most companies operate top-down. Leaders make decisions; employees execute them. However, this traditional structure can suppress initiative, stifle innovation, and erode employee engagement. Psychological ownership flips that model. It’s bottom-up. It asks: Who knows how to do the job better than the person doing the job? When employees are empowered to solve problems and improve processes, they not only perform better; they also begin to see themselves as stewards of the business. That was the guiding philosophy of my early partner, Jack Stack, and it still holds true. Research backs this up. Bo Burlingham recently noted that this is what sets family-owned and employee-owned businesses apart for the most special kind of success—longevity. Proven success at companies large and small In my decades of business coaching, we often begin with just a short employee survey:  How can we better serve customers to increase revenue?   What should we do to improve operating efficiency?  When leaders listen to and act on these suggestions, psychological ownership and financial performance both tend to soar. Ideally, results are tracked, and when improved results generate profits, a portion is shared with the people who made it possible, making the link between behaviors and outcomes clear as day. This culture of shared accountability often means employees are retained even during downturns. Companies including Nucor, Costco, Abbott, and Southwest Airlines have long embraced this model (I worked with the latter years ago). But from my experience, it’s particularly effective in smaller private businesses, where psychological ownership can spread rapidly, even when equity or profit sharing isn’t on the table. Recognition of employee-led improvements inspires others to contribute, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of engagement and performance. At larger firms, we’ve replicated this by segmenting the organization into smaller operating units, each with its own P\u0026L, goals, and accountability (we did this with Capital One). Regardless of size, the principle held true: give people a voice, measure results, and recognize their impact. Employee ownership isn’t just a legal designation. It’s a mindset. The role of financial ownership While psychological ownership drives performance, financial ownership distributes the rewards. One path to achieving this is through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), with employees receiving equity. Companies including Trinity Manufacturing, MSA Safety, and SRC Holdings have seen long-term success by first building psychological ownership, and then adding equity ownership. Most of my clients have taken the same path, with success. However, it’s important to distinguish between equity as a transaction and equity as part of a cultural transformation. As Corey Rosen and Michael Quarrey have written, simply giving out stock doesn’t drive performance. Transactions don’t change behavior. Employee ownership must be earned in action before it’s granted on paper. Investing in employee ownership—literally Some companies go even further by enabling employees to purchase equity. When I worked with Universal Engineering, for instance, employees used their retirement savings to buy shares through a phantom stock plan. Because psychological ownership was already strong, the appetite to become literal owners was high. Years later, when the company sold, each employee earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock returns. Southwest Airlines pilots struck a similar deal in 1995, trading future wage increases for stock options. Many large public companies such as Apple and Microsoft offer employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), which allow workers to buy shares at a discount. These programs allow employees to put skin in the game or not. Employees make the decision. However, participation tends to be limited, often because many workers simply don’t have the extra cash. The good news is that employees can become owners without making an investment. Given that most employees lack the funds to buy equity, this is key. The ideal ownership model This is how the financial equity model championed by Ownership Works offers a compelling alternative. Their approach grants equity—typically 3 to 4 percent of total company stock—to all employees at no cost. The dilution for traditional investors is modest, but the payoff in goodwill, morale, and positive press can be substantial. Private equity firms have a lot to gain from such reputational upside. However, the most effective strategy isn’t psychological ownership or financial ownership. It’s both. Psychological ownership ensures employees are engaged, proactive, and aligned with business goals. Financial ownership allows them to share in the value they help create. Together, they align the interests of owners, managers, employees, and customers—fulfilling the kind of marketplace harmony envisioned by Adam Smith. Our Harvard Business Review article, “More Than a Paycheck,” showed that companies embracing shared ownership enjoy higher engagement and retention rates. Employees stop acting like passengers and start acting like pilots—driving results, taking initiative, and sharing the success they help generate. The efforts of Ownership Works and others have brought financial ownership to the mainstream. But don’t forget the foundational role of psychological ownership. One without the other is a missed opportunity. Together, they can help close the wealth gap, drive exceptional performance, and build businesses that everyone has a reason to care about. It’s together that ownership works. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
