  "text": "President Trump last week announced he’s “pretty much” secured a U.S. buyer for TikTok. And TikTok itself seems to have accepted its fate, as it is reportedly building a U.S.-based version of its app that it will port users to.Anyone who remembers Tumblr, and what became of the blogging site when Yahoo purchased it in 2013, might also wonder what sort of changes—good and bad—a new owner might make to TikTok. And for the millions of businesses that depend on it for marketing, community engagement, product testing, and sales, the stakes have never been higher.If the company does sell to a U.S.-based firm, it could end up the property of Oracle or Amazon, both of which have been prominent suitors in a saga with more twists and turns than an episode of The Bachelor. If the TikTok buyer to which Trump refers is Oracle or Amazon, how could either of these two potential new owners change TikTok?Amazon to the rescue? For small companies, a sea change would come if Amazon became the new owner—and not just to save the app and build a reliable infrastructure. According to Roxi Nicolussi, a futurist and digital strategist at The Big Bold Company, if Amazon makes a successful bid, we’d likely see a big push toward “social commerce,” where it would be possible to make purchases from smaller firms through the app. “That would make it incredibly easy for small businesses to sell products right where their audiences are already scrolling,” she says. “Adding Amazon’s deep experience with AI and personalization could mean creators and brands getting real-time data to optimize their content and conversion rates.” In other words, the rising tide of Amazon would lift all small boats, making it easier to attract new customers to a stable and reliable e-commerce platform.  It’s easy to envision how this might work. Today, social commerce is still in an infant stage and is not at all commonplace or intuitive. Resellers on TikTok sometimes use Shopify or their own store to sell products, and sometimes they link to Amazon or other e-commerce shops. With Amazon as the TikTok parent company, the integration would be much tighter and all of the tools available to sellers would become integrated into the TikTok app itself.   Imagine a startup that makes custom clothing for Gen-Z—it would be able to monetize its social-media presence and sell directly through TikTok. Amazon would provide all of the tools and enterprise-grade security needed to make it all happen.  Tenyse Williams, a Digital Marketing Adjunct Instructor Specialist at the University of Central Florida, echoed the same sentiments. She says an Amazon-owned TikTok app could help foster better social-media-influencer relationships, in part because Amazon could provide more incentives for partnership and more exposure and financial help. With Oracle, the analytics could improveBoth Williams and Nicolussi mentioned another big win for entrepreneurs if Oracle is successful in buying TikTok: much better analytics. As any small company knows, using data to make informed decisions can help your bottom line, but the challenge comes in trying to act like a major enterprise when you have the resources and experience of a smaller firm. “Oracle’s expertise in cloud computing and data management could bring robust data security and advanced analytics to TikTok,” says Williams. “This would be a great tool for businesses utilizing the platform, offering them insights into consumer behavior and content performance. Startups could leverage this data to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively.”  “Oracle has a strong foothold in cloud infrastructure and data security, so the platform could become more compliant, more reliable, and more trusted for startups working in sensitive sectors,” adds Nicolussi. “For example, startups could use better analytics to track how their content performs or which audiences engage most—valuable insights that can guide strategy.” Why innovation will be critical “If TikTok were acquired by a company like Amazon or Oracle, we’d likely see a major shift in how the platform supports business innovation, particularly for startups and smaller players,” says Nicolussi.  Of course, even if a major company like Amazon or Oracle does purchase TikTok, there’s one missing piece to the puzzle. The main innovation—in fact, the reason for TikTok’s success—might be conspicuously absent if a sale goes through. ByteDance is the current owner, and this Chinese firm has said the “heartbeat” of the app, known as the algorithm, is not for sale.  You may not know the term or why it’s so important, but you have likely experienced it many times. The TikTok algorithm is highly proprietary. When you scroll through short videos, even pausing for a microsecond tells the algorithm you are slightly interested in that topic. Hundreds or thousands of calculations occur when you use the app to make sure you stay interested.  The TikTok app uses its algorithm to keep us hooked, and it’s working. TikTok has almost 2 billion users worldwide, and the glue that keeps people from leaving the app is the magical algorithm, which seems to know what we like on a second-by-second basis.  Any new owner will have to figure out how to maintain that interest, and that missing ingredient is what could cause problems for entrepreneurs. If the app itself loses stickiness with users, it means startups will have to work harder to attract customers.  In the end, TikTok’s future is murky. We don’t know if the ban will go into effect and we don’t know if a new owner can solve the algorithm problem. Entrepreneurs already have enough stress and anxiety about keeping a small company afloat without an added dilemma.  The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
