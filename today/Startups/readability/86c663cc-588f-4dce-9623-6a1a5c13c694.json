  "text": "Shortly after 9 AM on May 5, 1961, Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. became the second person—and the first American—in space, rocketing to a height of 116.5 miles inside his Mercury capsule. Unlike Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first person to fly into space and complete an orbit just a few weeks before on April 12, Shepard’s mission lasted just 15 minutes in a quick up-and-down arc. Nevertheless, Shepard was clearly made of the right stuff. His Redstone rocket was derived directly from a ballistic missile, and he actually took the controls of his tiny capsule as it reentered in a fireball. His mission was hailed as a success and paved the way, just 8 years later, for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to walk on the surface of the moon.So prominent was Shepard’s flight that it’s now marked by National Astronaut Day. President Trump commemorated the occasion in an official White House release yesterday, noting how this “brave American” was “ready to face the unknown” in a mission that marked “groundbreaking achievement, national pride, and a future defined by American leadership in space.”But it’s 2025 now, and a lifetime after Shepard’s quick trip into the void, is that “American leadership” assured? Or is the state of the U.S. space industry something to worry about—a business that’s lost a sense of excitement and much of its public appeal?Given the very public, mocking backlash against a recent space tourism flight by Katy Perry and four other women (on a trip aboard a Jeff Bezos rocket that roughly echoed Shepard’s flight) you might think so. That’s one big ‘step backwards’Just a few days ago, the White House released its budget plans for NASA, triggering immediate consternation in the industry. In line with its DOGE-led plans to slash federal spending, the Trump team’s plans call for a 24 percent cut in NASA’s budget—which currently stands at $24.8 billion a year.The budget also seeks to downsize U.S. operations on the International Space Station, and to cancel the giant SLS rocket that’s the core of the current Artemis plan to land astronauts on the moon sometime after 2027. SLS is just too delayed and too “grossly expensive,” the White House says.This plan to brutally slash NASA’s funding was called a “historic step backward” by science personality Bill Nye, Reuters reports. And Nye was backed up by many experts, including the Planetary Society, which said it would “urge Congress to swiftly reject this destructive proposal.” Nye and other science advocates are unsettled that the White House specifically targeted science missions for cuts. Reuters notes the plan would also “upend active contracts defended for years in Washington by an array of established NASA contractors and overturn missions and programs in which U.S. allies play key roles.”One of these famous contractors has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons over the last year. Boeing’s repeated failures with its Starliner space capsule have been taken as a sign that when it comes to space tech, the company is adrift. Boeing has spent billions, and so far the most famous achievement of the Starliner program was to leave two astronauts aboard the ISS for nine months longer than their planned week-long stay.The Red Planet may represent a silver liningThe one boon for NASA in Trump’s new budget proposal is an additional $1 billion specified for “Mars-focused programs,” which supports a long-term goal of landing astronauts not just on the Moon, but also on Mars. By a curious coincidence, landing humans on Mars is also a long term goal of Elon Musk—Trump confidant, DOGE head, and rocket company owner.Musk’s SpaceX—a modern commercial space company that operates much more like a startup than giant aerospace firms like Boeing—is perhaps the brightest star in the American space industry’s sky. The company’s reusable Falcon 9 rocket has upended the space launch business, and the fleet of vehicles is set to launch some 150 times this year, far outstripping any other company, and indeed any other nation’s space effort. Meanwhile, SpaceX is developing the giant Starship rocket, which may lower the cost of flying 200 tons of satellites to space to as low as $90 million. This experimental vehicle is set to have its ninth test flight in a week or so. Though you can think of Starship as the equivalent of a giant haulage truck, great for lifting huge, heavy cargos to orbit, its ultimate destination is Mars—and SpaceX’s website even has a page explaining how.The other big upside for the space industry in this second Trump administration could be dozens or maybe even hundreds of small, new commercial space companies and startups. The idea of promoting a new “space economy” that supports newer, faster-moving enterprises instead of large, traditional aerospace companies is very much supported by billionaire entrepreneur and astronaut Jared Isaacman. Isaacman has been nominated by Trump to be the next NASA lead, and his nomination has recently been forwarded for full Senate approval, where it’s largely seen as a given.Where do we go from here? It’s clearly not all doom and gloom. The brutal White House NASA budget proposal is just that—a proposal. NASA’s actual budget has to be approved by Congress, and there’s every sign that key cuts will face significant pushback.Commercial space companies are also experiencing amazing successes. A fleet of spacecraft are attempting robotic landings on the moon, SpaceX competitors like Blue Origin and Rocket Lab are experiencing their own successes, and even the Space Force is pivoting toward the idea of awarding contracts to small space companies and startups.There’s perhaps a little less glamor in the space business than there was back in Shepard’s day, when his flight was a part of a national space program. What would he think of the state of the space race today? Shepard has been described as being direct to the point of indiscreetness, so he’d likely have some choice curse words to say about the idea of cutting NASA’s budget by nearly a quarter. But he was also said to be humorous and charming too, and was known to be excited by people who could push things forward. It’s easy to imagine him cracking a joke at Musk and Trump’s expense, then climbing into the latest rocket.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
