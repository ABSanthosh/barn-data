  "description": "I am dealing with a delicate problem concerning my housemate who has recently had a very serious mental health breakdown.This man is my friend of a decade and a housemate for 5 (uneventful) years. He began behaving erratically last week, and got progressivlely worse over the last weekend to the point where he was not really making any sense at all anymore. (\"Reality is an illusion - but he knows the truth now\" type stuff). He was not sleeping and began talking to himself.I no choice but to call his family and also a mental health crisis team. The crisis team arrived first with police and forcibly entered his space.This made him very angry, both at them and me, and he was forcibly removed to a hospital where I understand that he is refusing any sort of treatment and cannot be forced.His family arrived to pack some things for his stay and found a half-written suicide note in his room. He is claiming it is \"creative writing\".My flatmate is fiercely intelligent, and very highly educated. He is a professional working scientist and way smarter than me, or almost anyone I know.He is insisting on returning to our house (as his legal right) but obviously I am very worried about him and terrified of making wrong decisions for both myself and him.I know am not responsible for him, but his family are not really helping him properly (imo) either and he is my friend.Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before? I am lost and desperate for advice.dang: please delete this post if you deem it inappropriate. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42121630 Points: 6 # Comments: 1",
