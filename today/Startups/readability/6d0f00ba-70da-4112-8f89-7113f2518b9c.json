  "text": "In the world of online gaming, keeping players engaged is crucial. To keep the game going – and maximize revenue opportunities – operators need to provide players with instant, personalized, 24/7 support on any channel, and in a way that feels completely seamless. Traditional support systems have struggled to meet such high-pressure demands at scale, which causes frustration for players and potential drop-off as they move on to find better experiences elsewhere. But the limitations game operators face are increasingly becoming a thing of the past as LLM-powered AI agents like Intercom’s Fin transform support operations and enable VIP-level service for every player at scale. “With Fin AI Agent, we’re streamlining players’ support experience” This is something the team at Hi-Rez Studios, the video game developer and publisher behind popular titles like Smite, Paladins, and Rogue Company, has experienced since implementing Fin. “We’re always looking to make player experience as seamless as possible,” shares Ashley Schultz, Customer Support Team Lead at Hi-Rez Studios. “With Fin AI Agent, we’re streamlining their support experience. Players can get answers instantly, reducing the need for them to reach out to the human support team.” Thousands of global companies use Fin to deliver industry-leading customer service. Here, we explore the key areas that make Fin the standout AI agent for gaming operators in both regulated and emerging markets. Provide VIP support for every player, all the time Nothing makes a player more frustrated than having to wait for a response – especially in a high-stakes environment where timing is everything. Making it as easy as possible to get help when it’s needed goes a long way towards building trust and securing player loyalty. Whether you’re dealing with someone who needs immediate in-game support, or someone who’s setting up their account for the first time, Fin makes it easy to provide everyone with VIP-level attention. By personalizing interactions using real-time player data and adapting responses across all your channels, Fin helps maintain consistent, high-quality support that builds trust and keeps players engaged. Here are just a few ways Fin helps provide the best experience: Instant localized support: Deliver real-time responses in 45 languages, ensuring every player receives support in their preferred language with region-specific knowledge of gaming regulations and policies. Omnichannel brand consistency: Maintain your brand voice and support quality whether players reach out through live chat, email, social media, or in-app messaging, creating a seamless experience across all touchpoints. Data-driven personalization: Tailor support using player history, preferences, and account status to provide relevant assistance, from deposit handling to bonus eligibility and gameplay questions. Around-the-clock availability: Ensure players receive immediate assistance at any hour, across all time zones, maintaining response quality during peak gaming periods, tournaments, and major sporting events. Engage players and drive revenue In such a competitive market with endless options and decreasing player loyalty, passive support is not enough anymore – gaming operators need to proactively engage players at every step of their journey, anticipate their needs, and create personalized experiences that keep them coming back. “This proactive approach doesn’t just improve the player experience – it drives measurable business results too” Fin can help deliver proactive, personalized support that actively keeps new and established players invested through: Smart onboarding journeys: Guide new players with interactive walkthroughs, personalized setup tasks, and in-app highlights that help them get started with confidence. Proactive engagement: Reach out to players at key moments with relevant promotions, game suggestions, and recommendations tailored to their preferences and history. Cross-channel communication: Maintain consistent messaging across web, email, and in-app channels, ensuring players never miss important updates or opportunities. Targeted promotional support: Help players understand and activate relevant bonuses, special offers, and promotions that match their interests. This proactive approach doesn’t just improve the player experience – it can drive measurable business results too. As Tony Jones, Lead Producer, Player and Customer Experience Strategist at Hi-Rez Studios notes: “We’ve been experimenting with feeding Fin AI Agent specific product data – not just for support, but to help players engage more with our games. Now, Fin can answer gameplay questions like, ‘What god should I pick for this type of battle?’ It also pulls in the latest updates from our site and app, saving time for our community managers.” Stay compliant and protect your reputation In the gaming industry, maintaining compliance isn’t just about following rules – it’s about protecting players and your brand’s reputation. Traditional support systems often struggle to balance rapid response times with proper handling of sensitive situations. When a player shows signs of distress or risky behavior, every moment of delay or misstep in escalating the problem can have serious consequences, potentially affecting both the player themselves and your operating license. Fin helps you maintain this crucial balance by adapting to evolving regulations and policies, and treating delicate conversations with care. It also automatically implements compliance requirements by region, so you can be confident that you’re consistently applying responsible policies across all of your support channels. Here’s how Fin helps protect your players and reputation: Intelligent escalation protocols: Automatically identify and route sensitive conversations to your human team, ensuring players who need it receive appropriate care and attention immediately. Region-specific compliance: Apply the right regulations and policies based on player location, maintaining compliance across different jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks. Documented player interactions: Maintain detailed records of all player communications and escalation procedures, helping you demonstrate compliance during audits. Adaptive policy implementation: Stay current with evolving regulations through regular updates to response protocols and compliance requirements, ensuring your support always meets the latest standards. Seamlessly manage multiple brands and regions For gaming operators, managing support across multiple brands and jurisdictions can be a logistical nightmare, making it hard to maintain consistent quality. Fin helps solve this challenge by providing intelligent support across your portfolio, adapting its responses and approach to match each brand’s specific needs. Here’s how Fin helps with multi-brand management: Brand-specific responses: Adapt tone and responses to match each brand’s unique voice and requirements. Intelligent routing: Automatically identify and escalate conversations to the right team based on brand context. Consistent quality: Maintain high-quality support standards across all your brands and markets. Scale effortlessly during peak periods In gaming, support volumes can spike dramatically during tournaments, game launches, or special events. When this happens, gaming operators using traditional support systems have a difficult choice to make: spend on additional headcount to handle the surges, or risk player satisfaction and retention with long wait times. “Fin is helping us deliver faster responses while keeping our team focused on high-value interactions” Fin prevents this dilemma by scaling instantly to meet demand. It handles volume spikes across all channels while maintaining consistent quality and compliance standards – no matter how busy things get. This was a benefit the team at Hi-Rez Studios experienced instantly after turning Fin on. “With Fin AI Agent handling between 3,000 to 5,000 resolutions per month, we’ve been able to scale efficiently without adding extra agents,” says Ashley Schultz from Hi-Rez Studios. “It’s helping us deliver faster responses while keeping our team focused on high-value interactions.” Here’s how Fin helps you scale effectively: Peak period management: Handle support surges during tournaments, game launches, and promotional events without adding team members or compromising service quality. Consistent performance: Maintain rapid response times and accuracy even during the highest-volume periods. Resource optimization: Free up human agents to focus on higher-value issues that require deeper investigation while Fin handles the bulk of support queries. Smart queue management: Automatically prioritize and route conversations based on urgency. Mebit, the company that provides critical services like customer support, VIP hosting, know your customer (KYC), and compliance to the largest online casino, Stake.com, has enjoyed a similar experience to Hi-Rez Studios since they started using Intercom. As Milan Jovancevic, Director of Operations at Mebit for Stake.com, shares, “Our performance has jumped significantly since we started using Intercom. Previously, each of our agents could handle a couple of emails at a time. Now, they can handle 10 conversations simultaneously. That’s a huge jump and means we can help many more customers – faster.” Transform your player support with Fin Exceptional player support is no longer a “nice-to-have” – it’s essential for gaming operators to survive and thrive. Fin helps you deliver the kind of fast, personalized, and reliable support that turns players into loyal fans while protecting your brand and optimizing your operations. Whether you’re looking to scale your support during peak periods, ensure compliance across multiple jurisdictions, or provide every player with VIP-level service, Fin has you covered.
