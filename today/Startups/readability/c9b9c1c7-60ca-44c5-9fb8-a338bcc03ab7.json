This isn’t just an issue for individual drivers – owners of large commercial fleets must also keep charging front-of-mind when it comes to managing electric fleets or considering making the switch to EVs. Now, Synop wants to ease that anxiety. The US startup has developed an all-in-one platform that makes it easy for customers to manage all aspects of their electric fleet, integrating with vehicles, chargers, and utilities. The AI-powered, automated software aims to make it easy for owners to electrify and manage their fleets, optimising fleet uptime and minimising costs. For one, Synop offers real-time data on the charge and battery status of every vehicle within a fleet, helping operators monitor the location, range, and mileage of its EVs, as well as plan routes and track carbon savings. Similarly, the platform also monitors the health and status of individual charging points, allowing users to schedule charges when energy costs are lower and balance power distribution among multiple EVs. The company’s energy management software also allows customers to optimise their energy sources, whether that’s from renewable sources like solar, batteries, or the grid. The predictive load-balancing capability means Synop automatically adjusts to grid events, and the platform also allows customers to take advantage of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) opportunities, where vehicles give energy back to the grid and generate extra revenue. Applications for Synop’s offerings include electric school buses, drayage trucks, last-mile delivery, and ride-hailing fleets. Last month, Synop was selected as the official charging management solution for Bus2Grid’s Renew America’s Schools Grant to help optimise the charging infrastructure for electric school buses.
