  "text": "HandsFree Labs, the parent company of sneaker brand Kizik, said on Thursday that it had filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Skechers, accusing the casual sneaker giant of lifting technologies related to step-in sneakers. In a court filing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, HandsFree Labs accused Skechers of knowingly infringed on its patents in developing its Hands Free Slip-ins line, which accounts for about a third of Skechers’ offerings. According to the suit, Skechers executives regularly point to hands-free sneakers as driving its growth, with retail sales hitting a high of nearly $9 billion in 2024. (Inc. has reached out to Skechers for comment and will update this article if the company responds.)Salt Lake City–based serial entrepreneur Mike Pratt founded HandsFreeLabs and Kizik in 2017, based on technology he and his team spent more than a decade developing. The shoes allow wearers to step in and out of the sneakers like a slip-on, but provide the support and fit of a lace-up sneaker. The innovations proved so effective that Nike licensed Kizik’s technology and invested in the brand. Last year, Kizik hit #407 on last year’s Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies in America and was generating $100 million in annual sales. At the time Pratt told Inc. that HandsFree Labs has more than 200 patents approved or pending related to the design of the sneakers. Kizik’s Athens sneaker, for example, has a plastic lattice on the back that took two years to develop. Other styles have a titanium rod wrapped around the heel that snaps back into place when the wearer steps in. The company employs a full-time patent attorney to protect the IP coming out of its Utah innovation lab. According to the trade publication WWD, HandsFree Labs previously sued Drew Shoe maker Tishkoff Enterprises for patent infringement. That suit was dismissed in March. Los Angeles–based Skechers is a three-decade old brand that’s publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In May, it announced an acquisition deal worth $9 billion with private equity firm SG Capital that would take the company private. It’s the third-largest sneaker brand in the U.S., after Nike and Adidas. So far, Skechers has not publicly commented on the suit. “The IP we’ve created at HandsFree Labs is the foundation of our brand and our business,” HandsFree Labs CEO Gareth Hosford told Inc in an emailed statement. “We’re not just another footwear company; we’re a company of inventors. Our patented technologies…represent years of R\u0026D, engineering breakthroughs, and millions in investment.” “We understand that copying happens in fashion, but this isn’t about trend inspiration or lookalikes,” Hosford continued. “When a multibillion-dollar company like Skechers enters the category we created and builds a flagship product line using our protected technology, we have to act. At the end of the day, this isn’t just about protecting our company. It’s about protecting the value of original thinking. ” Update, July 25, 2025: This story has been updated with a quote from HandsFree Labs CEO Gareth Hosford. Previously: Is Kizik Building the Next Billion-Dollar Sneaker Brand?  The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
