Belfast-based Studio Ulster said it is celebrating its launch today as the world’s most advanced virtual production facility spanning 75,000 square feet. Studio Ulster is designed to support productions at every scale, from blockbuster films and high-end television to AAA game development and world-class animation. The facility integrates real-time engines, in-camera visual effects, volumetric capture and motion tracking into a seamless, sustainable pipeline that redefines how stories are created, rendered and delivered. Studio Ulster is the result of a £72 million investment, part-funded through the Belfast Region City Deal. Developed by Ulster University in partnership with Belfast Harbour and supported by Northern Ireland Screen, the facility offers large-scale virtual production stages that set new global standards for real-time filmmaking. It is designed to elevate the UK and Ireland’s capacity for commercial studio production using advanced in-camera visual effects, establishing a world-class benchmark for the industry. Studio Ulster is also home to the CoSTAR Screen Lab, one of five national research labs created under the UK-wide CoSTAR initiative. This program, backed by £75.6 million in funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and £63 million in new industry investment, positions Studio Ulster at the forefront of global R\u0026D in screen and creative technologies. Studio Ulster is a virtual production facility. “From the docks that built the Titanic to the LED stages that now build entire universes, Belfast has always punched above its weight. The launch of Studio Ulster marks a new chapter, one where cutting-edge virtual production, motion capture, and digital scanning converge to give filmmakers, game developers, and creatives the power to shape worlds in real time” said Professor Declan Keeney, CEO of Studio Ulster and BFI Board Member, in a statement. “We’ve taken the spirit of Belfast’s shipyards, precision, ambition, and pride in what we build and applied it to the future of storytelling. This isn’t just a studio. It’s a global platform for imagination, powered by some of the most advanced creative technology anywhere in the world.” Northern Ireland continues to position itself as a premium production destination, bolstered by the UK’s generous screen sector tax reliefs for high-end TV, film, animation and video game productions. Combined with world-class infrastructure and a skilled local workforce, the region is fast becoming a go to hub for global content creators. Studio Ulster is the only purpose-built virtual production campus of its kind on the island of Ireland. Its integrated ecosystem includes everything from 3D/4D scanning and motion capture to full-scale LED volume stages and post-production suites all under one roof. “Virtual production has truly come of age at Studio Ulster,” said Richard Williams, CEO of Northern Ireland Screen, in a statement. “While many filmmakers are aware of the basics, few fully grasp how radically the technology has evolved. Studio Ulster is a genuine game-changer, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on screen and enabling directors to bring any imagined world to life, right here at Belfast Harbour. Northern Ireland Screen is proud to support this landmark facility, which redefines the studio offering not only in Northern Ireland but across the UK and Europe.” Virtual production technologies are reshaping how stories are told, enabling filmmakers to create limitless worlds on a single site. Beyond creative freedom, these tools offer significant cost and time efficiencies by reducing the need for physical sets and location travel, while also supporting vastly more sustainable production practices. “Studio Ulster is a transformative investment for the screen industries of the UK and Ireland,” said Professor Paul Bartholomew, Vice-Chancellor of Ulster University, in a statement. “This incredible facility is more than a milestone, it’s a launchpad for the next generation of creators and storytellers. By bringing cutting-edge virtual production capabilities to Belfast, we’re enhancing the region’s global competitiveness and creative potential, in turn creating jobs and economic impact. As a university, we are immensely proud to have developed and delivered this ambitious new enterprise at the heart of Northern Ireland’s creative economy.” Laura Livingstone, VFX Executive at Netflix, said in a statement, “This is a pivotal time for our industry, where innovation is not just accelerating but fundamentally reshaping how we create and experience stories. On a recent tour of Netflix-owned Eyeline in LA, I saw firsthand how advancements from a world-class studio directly inform the techniques we adopt in visual effects and beyond, helping storytellers bring creative visions to life. It’s more than just a facility; it’s a bridge between visionary creators, the local community, and global opportunity. Studio Ulster has the potential to shape the next generation of storytelling and I’m proud to have helped launch this studio.” Kyle Olson, Head of Virtual Production at Studio Ulster, said in a statement, “Having worked on virtual production stages around the world, I can confidently say Studio Ulster is a standout. The scale and sophistication of the space is remarkable, but what truly sets it apart is the world-class team. There’s a rare mix here of cutting-edge technology, creative innovation, and a collaborative spirit that’s second to none. With this studio, Belfast is positioning itself as a global competitor.”",
