  "text": "Today we unveil the world’s most advanced AI agent for customer service: Fin 2. This latest generation of Fin AI Agent combines our highest resolution rates with powerful new capabilities to deliver human-quality service to your customers. These new abilities are in four categories: Knowledge: Fin can learn your knowledge faster than before and provides customers with the most accurate, thorough answers to help resolve issues more efficiently. Behavior: Fin speaks in your tone of voice, is fluent in 45 languages, and follows your guidelines, policies, and procedures to deliver the best customer experience, every time. You can always rely on Fin to make the right decision. Actions: Fin can take actions on behalf of your customers by accessing information from your data sources and systems in order to personalize its service for your customers across channels. Insights: Al-generated insights give you the tools to monitor and improve quality and performance for Fin and across your entire support organization. All of this combined means you can depend on Fin to manage your frontline support, freeing your team to focus on higher impact solutions for your customers. The best AI agent just got better When we launched Fin AI Agent in March 2023, it was the first AI-powered agent designed specifically for customer service. From the outset, Fin’s performance blew our minds – just using a company’s existing help center content with little optimization, it could answer over 25% of customer questions. “We’re launching a suite of new capabilities that allow Fin to answer more questions, in more ways, in more places” Since then, we’ve been working tirelessly with our customers to improve both Fin’s performance and accuracy. Now, we’re proud to share that customers using Fin 2 see an average resolution rate of 51%, with an accuracy rate of 99.9%. However, in order to deliver truly human-level support, we’re launching a suite of new capabilities that allow Fin to answer more questions, in more ways, in more places, while giving you complete control over the quality of Fin’s service. Knowledge Fin 2 can learn everything about your product by connecting to various sources, whether internal content, external websites, PDFs, or databases. The Knowledge Hub makes it easy for your team to control, update, and maintain all of the content Fin learns from one centralized location. This means you only need to train Fin once – it automatically stays updated with the latest information, never forgetting or using outdated responses. Fin 2 also has the ability to combine knowledge from multiple content sources to create tailored answers for your customers – just like a human would. This enhances Fin’s ability to solve more complex questions than any other AI agent on the market. Behavior Support conversations are an extension of your brand, and now you have even more control over how Fin communicates with your customers. Customize Fin’s tone of voice by choosing from five presets. You can also decide between shorter, direct responses or longer, conversational ones – ensuring a consistent and on-brand support experience. It also supports multilingual interactions, automatically translating your content in real-time to match the customer’s language. This dramatically simplifies customer support for businesses operating in multiple regions and helps you scale your support content. With AI Category Detection, you can set topics you would like Fin to detect and handle in specific ways. If, for example, a customer asks about refunds, cancellations, reports a bug, or event seems frustrated based on the conversation, Fin automatically categorizes those conversations and will route them according to your settings. This is easy to set up with natural language commands – it’s as simple as typing “Hey Fin, if a customer seems frustrated, apply the negative sentiment category.” With Workflows, you can make sure Fin routes these conversations to the right team so they are handled with care. You can also create a range of rules for how Fin shows up for your customers based on attributes such as segment, channel, or region. This is an exciting step forward that combines the incredible capabilities of generative AI with rules-based human control. Finally, while we’ve learned that many customer service leaders equate AI with the chat channel, Fin is omnichannel, working equally well across chat, email, WhatsApp, and more. Actions Now Fin can access your external data sources in order to personalize its service for your customers. Fin can retrieve customer data and provide answers specific to each customer, like checking recent orders. Fin can also perform tasks for your customers by updating customer records on their behalf, like changing a customer’s shipping address or adjusting their subscription. You can create actions for Fin with just a few clicks using our action templates. You can configure what access you want to give to Fin, and then use natural language to give Fin guidance and instructions on when to use this connection to take actions for customers. Insights CSAT is a metric that is both incredibly valuable and incredibly flawed, representing only a fraction of the total customer conversations your team handles. This gives CS leaders a very narrow view of the health of their support operation and prevents them from improving their service. AI Generated CSAT will change how you see your service. Now you can have full visibility across 100% of your customer conversations, both human and AI. This AI-powered analysis tracks CSAT across all of your team’s conversations, allowing you to monitor and optimize the quality of your service across the board. We have also developed a new AI-powered Conversation Quality report, which surfaces topics of high and low performance so you know where to invest in better content, or better training. Finally, we just released a new Holistic Overview Report which unifies all insights into a single dashboard, providing you with the full picture of your entire support operation across both human and AI. You’re in full control You can easily control where Fin shows up. Try Fin in different channels, with different segments of your customers, or in different regions. However you want to segment your customers, you can turn Fin on for any of them. New capabilities, same price So how much does all this cost? The same as it always did – $0.99 cents per resolution. We only charge you if Fin delivers a resolution. If Fin can’t answer, Fin is free to use. “Very soon, AI Agents like Fin will handle the majority of customer support queries” If you have Fin today, you get all these upgrades for free. Some of Fin 2’s features are available today, and we’re rolling out the rest through the end of the year. There is no doubt that the future of customer service is AI-first. Very soon, AI Agents like Fin will handle the majority of customer support queries, improving the customer experience with immediate answers and actions, and enabling support leaders to scale their support without scaling their team. To learn more, take a look at all of Fin 2’s features and capabilities here.",
