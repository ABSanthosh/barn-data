Lee/Photomochi Studio Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More The Innovation Showcase is back at Transform: The Orchestration of Enterprise Agentic AI at Scale, in June 2025 in San Francisco.  We’re on the hunt for the 10 generative AI products most likely to disrupt the enterprise. If you think your technology fits this bill, we’d like to invite you to present its impact on the main stage at Transform. Those selected to present will do so in front of an invite-only audience of 400 industry decision-makers, and will receive direct feedback from a panel of enterprise tech analysts, brand executives and others. Every presenter will receive exclusive editorial coverage from VentureBeat, getting your company out in front of our millions of monthly readers. Who should apply? Dynamic companies with compelling new gen AI technologies eager to present on stage. All finalists will be winners (since we’re being selective). We will award winners in three categories: most likely to succeed, best technology, and best presentation style. In total, up to 10 candidates will be selected from what is sure to be a multitude of qualified applicants. Candidates must offer new enterprise AI solutions, and we will select five early-stage companies (seed to early-stage Series A that have received $50M or less) and five later-stage startups (series A or later companies that have received more than $50M). If you represent a unit that is part of a mature, large company, please enter as a later stage. If have a story to tell and an AI product or service that offers up real business results and use cases, please submit your application by 5 p.m. PT on March 31, 2025.Read about the winners from VB Transform 2024: SambaNova, Instabase and Tabnine.
