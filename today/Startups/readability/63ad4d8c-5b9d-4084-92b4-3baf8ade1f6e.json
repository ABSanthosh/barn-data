  "text": "Yesterday, Perplexity, the fast-growing AI platform, soft-launched Comet, a new web browser meant to compete with Google Chrome and Safari. In many ways, Perplexity Comet functions similarly to other browsers; you can search the web, open tabs, and create bookmarks. What makes Comet different is its Assistant button, which, when clicked, pulls up a chatbot. This chatbot has two big features: It can analyze and answer questions about the contents of your browser, and it can open up its own sub-browsers in which AI agents can actually take actions, like adding items to a cart or composing a tweet. In a video shared by Perplexity, a user navigates to a Reddit AMA with Keanu Reeves. The user presses the Assistant button, asks the chatbot to summarize the answers, and the chatbot quickly writes out a brief summary of Keanu’s answers. Perplexity also showed how users can ask Comet to shop online for them, parse through browser-based email clients, and make travel plans by launching multiple agents simultaneously. Comet also includes a method for searching the web with your voice. In the video, a user selects the voice mode and asks Comet to “pull up the clip of Jensen demoing Perplexity Labs.” Not only does Comet pull up a video of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang presenting a keynote at a tech conference in Paris, but skips to the moment in the video where Huang demos a Perplexity feature. Perplexity isn’t the only AI company getting into the browser game. Reuters recently reported that OpenAI is planning on releasing its own ChatGPT-powered browser in the coming weeks, and startup The Browser Company recently launched Dia, a browser that uses AI to answer questions about all of your tabs at once. Another competitor in the space is 30-year-old browser company Opera, which has recently announced several AI tools and services. Perplexity Comet is slowly rolling out to users for free, but those with a $200-per-month Perplexity Max subscription can get immediate access to the browser.To learn more, watch the video below: The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
