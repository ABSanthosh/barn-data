  "text": "Microsoft is adding AI video generation capabilities to Bing, its longtime Google search competitor. In a blog post, Microsoft announced that anyone with the Microsoft Bing Search mobile app can now generate their own AI videos—for free. The new feature is powered by Sora, OpenAI’s top-of-the-line video generation AI model, which typically requires a ChatGPT subscription to use. AI-generated video has come a long way in a short time, and is now being used by major businesses, including Coca-Cola and Toys R Us, in their branding and advertising. However, most AI video generators are quite expensive, which has slowed adoption by businesses. The Bing app isn’t intended for enterprise use, but it enables anyone—entrepreneurs included—to experiment with the technology and get a sense for how it could be used in their work. Here’s how to use it: If you have a Microsoft account and the Bing mobile app, you can start generating videos by selecting “Video Creator” from the homepage, or simply by describing the video you want to generate in the search bar. Currently, videos can only be generated in the 9:16 “vertical video” aspect ratio, used on social platforms like TikTok, and can only be five seconds long. Free users will get to generate 10 videos at high speeds, which takes roughly a minute. After generating 10 videos, free users will be forced to use the standard speed, which Microsoft says can take several hours to create a single 5-second video. Since Bing is a consumer-level platform, you won’t be able to do more advanced stuff like connecting your company’s logo or branding guidelines. This means it can’t make ads featuring your exact products, but it can help you experiment with new brand aesthetics and create animations, either for advertising or for a pitch deck. In short, it may just be a fun way to punch up a presentation. When asked to develop an animated logo for a fictional business—in this case a digital marketplace for babysitters named Babysat—Bing’s video generator created a kid-friendly logo complete with bubbly font, building blocks, and a teddy bear. There were still some problems though, mostly that the building blocks were chaotically bouncing around the screen. It represented a good start, but probably needs a few more rounds before getting posted. If you’re prepping to pitch investors on your company, Bing could also help to spruce up your presentation with animated elements, but maybe don’t get too ambitious. We asked Bing to generate an animated icon for a pitch deck featuring a money bag that rockets from Earth into space, passing by monetary figures, to symbolize the potential growth of the company. Bing’s creation fell short in a couple ways.This collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI shouldn’t come as a surprise. Microsoft is by far OpenAI’s largest investor, having spent $13 billion on the company over the past decade. As a result, new OpenAI products often appear early on Microsoft platforms like Bing and Azure. Paid ChatGPT subscribers can also access Sora directly on OpenAI’s website. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
