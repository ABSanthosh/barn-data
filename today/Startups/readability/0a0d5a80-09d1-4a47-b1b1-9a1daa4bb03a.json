  "text": "When he first entered politics in 2016, Donald Trump said he would run the government like it was a business. At the time, Trump’s ascension was new and bewildering to many Americans, but the idea of instilling corporate efficiency within the federal government was then already an old cliché. With Trump’s second inauguration in sight, the government-as-corporation model seems to be reemerging in the amorphous image of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The group will be led by the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, an unabashed Trump acolyte whose business empire has deep ties to the government, including tens of billions in federal contracts. Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotech executive who ran for the Republican party nomination in 2024, will co-lead the endeavor. DOGE is not actually a government department, despite its name. DOGE claims to be a vast cost-cutting effort on par with a McKinsey \u0026 Co. audit that will rid the federal bureaucracy of monetary bloat. Specifics are scant, and the thrust of DOGE seems to thrive off a blatant “you’re fired” energy reminiscent of Trump’s turn on the Apprentice. All signs indicate the initiative will set Musk up to inflict his brutal management style upon civil servants. Musk said the group plans to slash $2 trillion—roughly one-third—from the federal budget, which would mean eliminating critical services related to healthcare, housing and other government programs. Musk has acknowledged that such a drastic reduction in government would “necessarily involve some temporary hardship.” (Not for him, of course.)Ramaswamy recently told Fox News that entire federal agencies will be “deleted,” but did not offer details about how DOGE would accomplish such an end. DOGE is named after a meme-coin cryptocurrency that Musk has vocally endorsed, often using his X account as a bullhorn to promote the coin. That eventually resulted in a class action lawsuit from investors who accused him of artificially inflating the coin’s share price. (The suit was dropped last week). DOGE—represented across the internet by a caricature of a winking shiba inu—is supposed to be a joke, but the group’s intentions within the federal government are decidedly unfunny. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who bankrolled Trump’s campaign with $132 million, has spoken about wiping out the Department of Education. Throughout the course of his very public career, Musk turned firing people into a spectacle. After buying Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, he walked into the lobby holding a sink—an apparent reference to letting the new reality of his ownership “sink in.” Musk then proceeded to cull Twitter’s staff by about 80 percent, including one lead engineer for publicly correcting him in a tweet. Twitter/X’s value, though, has sunk by 80 percent, to $9.8 billion, since he took over. Ramaswamy has talked about slashing 75 percent of the federal workforce, which equals roughly 1.65 million layoffs, the New York Times reported. For contrast, Ramaswamy’s former company, Roivant Sciences, has 908 employees. Ramaswamy suggested reshuffling many government agencies that have very little shared purview. For instance, he’s called for shutting down the Department of Education and moving its workforce training programs to the Department of Labor, in addition to eliminating the FBI and shifting its agents to other agencies, CNN reported, citing a white paper Ramaswamy wrote on the program. The very nascent DOGE initiative raises a lot of questions about how such a severe reduction can be instituted by two corporate leaders with no formal government experience. Musk is looking for help: He asked his X followers if there were any “super high-IQ revolutionaries” willing to enlist in the DOGE effort for 80-hour work weeks at zero pay. It will be a major undertaking to unleash the kind of austerity that could wreak havoc on the lives of many Americans. “You could only propose $2 trillion a year if you are not interested in living within reality or if you are completely callous to the major harmful effects that doing that would entail,” Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress told CNN in the same report. Many experts and other reports have pointed out that it would be nearly impossible to wipe $2 trillion from the federal budget without impacting Social Security and Medicaid—arguably the two most important pillars of the nation’s’ already modest social safety net. Even if nothing more concrete emerges from the bluster surrounding DOGE, the initiative is at least giving Musk a very expensive seat in Trump’s White House. He won’t be there as a government official or agency chief, but acting in the capacity of a corporate executive who is there to fire people. That at least, won’t be new.",
