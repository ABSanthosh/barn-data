You not only want your team to hit its targets, but you also want it to develop into a close-knit unit over time. Here are some tips to help you find and lock down the best candidates:  Recruiting There are many websites that you can use to look for talent, but how efficient they are for you depends on whether or not you can find qualified candidates without having to sort through countless irrelevant applications. LinkedIn, Indeed, and Monster Jobs tend to be great options. You can also consider job fairs, agencies, social media, recruitment software, and even employee referrals.  Interviewing  Running successful interviews is one part art, one part science. Make sure you do your homework ahead of time so that you show up with a list of questions that are pertinent to the job. You should also bring a positive attitude and a full understanding of the profile you are looking for.  Some important interview questions to ask when hiring call center agents (of all kinds) include:  What is your experience with [call center software] and other similar tools?  Can you describe a time when you were able to execute a flawless upsell of a product or service?  Can you describe a time when you’ve made a sale after it looked like there was no chance? How do you handle difficult customers and unexpected technical issues during a call?  What techniques do you use to make it easier for customers to understand when you’re providing them with technical instructions? What do you think are the most essential characteristics of a successful call center agent?  Signing After you’ve conducted enough interviews to know who you want to hire, the next steps include designing a contract, finalizing the details of the role, negotiating salary and benefits, determining a start date, making an offer, and signing it into existence.  Of course, all of this is easier said than done, but at least you can get a headstart by stealing one or all of the job descriptions above.",
