  "text": "The crypto industry made a giant bet on political lobbying in the 2024 election. That wager was enormously successful: Crypto executives and venture capitalists behind three Super PACs spent $133 million to elect crypto-friendly candidates. The cash spearheaded the ouster of Ohio’s Sherrod Brown, a longtime Democratic stalwart in the Senate, and converted Donald Trump from a skeptic into a cheerleader for Bitcoin. In 48 down ballot races, crypto candidates from both major parties won every single time. Crypto’s powerbrokers now get to execute their main goal, which is to shape the rules and regulations of an industry that for years has been marked by criminal hacks, theft and financial implosions. Chief among their gripes is the lack of clear rules regulating how crypto functions as an element of the U.S. financial system—something that industry leaders say Joe Biden’s White House refused to deal with. Things are understandably looking up for Silicon Valley’s Bitcoin evangelists. President-elect Trump launched a crypto venture in September, and even before that, the GOP’s 2024 platform crystallized the party’s full embrace of crypto by saying it would “defend the right to mine Bitcoin.” Going mainstream might fly in the face of crypto’s contrarian underpinnings, but Trump has floated a national Bitcoin reserve. “There’s undoubtedly a great deal of optimism that there’s potential for a complete sea change in the way regulation is undertaken in this new administration,” Yesha Yadav, an associate dean at Vanderbilt University Law School, tells Inc. Trump’s inauguration will mark a new era for crypto, but what that means remains unclear. Skeptics keep warning repeatedly that a crypto-friendly administration will mean consumers get fleeced. “Crypto really borders a line between speculation and gambling, and the American people have a really high disposition toward gambling,” says Stephen Diehl, a computer programmer and crypto critic based in the United Kingdom. “There are two objectively true use cases that I don’t think anybody would doubt [about crypto], which is speculation..[and] the second one is crime. I fully expect there to be a lot more retail investors who get absolutely skinned,” he says.  Crypto bros are likely celebrating the moment, because there will undoubtedly be things about the new regulatory regime the industry likes. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler is universally reviled among crypto’s true believers, and he’s due to resign. Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and president of the Gemini crypto exchange, called Gensler “evil,” in a recent post on X. Under Gensler, the agency sued Gemini for selling unregistered securities, forcing a $21 million settlement. The unregistered securities rap is a hallmark of Gensler’s SEC, which brought 46 enforcement actions against digital asset companies in 2023, and 30 in 2022, according to Cornerstone Research. The number of financial penalties and investigations will likely slow under the forthcoming chair. “The commission is going to revisit its enforcement strategy, in all likelihood,” Zachary Fallon, a former SEC attorney and partner at Latham \u0026 Watkins, tells Inc. The agency will still be inclined to investigate fraud, but will pump the brakes on levying a multitude of non-compliance charges for failing to register tokens as securities, Fallon says. It’s important to remember, though, that cryptocurrency is not a monolith. Establishing “rules of the road,” which Gensler advocated at a recent Manhattan event, can be a moving target, at least in some ways. “It’s basically an infinite number of tokens that can exist,” says Diehl. “It’s really unclear how this should fit into the existing regulatory framework. It’s not a commodity, in the sense that there’s no consumptive value of the asset. [Crypto is] basically just created out of thin air from nothing,” he says. Congress hasn’t passed any laws that specifically apply to digital assets. The House passed a bill in April that would provide a framework, which Gensler criticized, saying it would allow companies to skirt SEC enforcement by declaring themselves issuers of commodities. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act hasn’t been voted on by the Senate. “What has filled me with rage for the last couple of years, is the inability of our regulators to come up with basic rules for the crypto industry,” Yadav says. There is hope among a bipartisan range of legislators that consensus can be reached. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said it could happen this year. Yadav argues it’s vital, largely so consumers don’t lose big in another meltdown, such as the FTX collapse in 2022. “This is about…the capacity to become more mainstream, to convince folks that there’s going to be the possibility for them to actually have value from this industry and to keep assets safe.” Even if Congress doesn’t act, it’s likely that regulatory enforcement will ease. Crypto advocates have long argued that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should regulate the industry. The CFTC regulates derivatives–once considered an exotic financial instrument–and spot markets. If the CFTC were to formally regulate crypto, it would take a lighter approach than the SEC, one that might leave consumers exposed, says Diehl: “They’d have market oversight protections, and they’d have some registration requirements, but there’d be very little consumer protections in terms of segregation of customer funds, disclosures about risks, or rules about deceptive marketing.”  If that winds up being the case, the regulatory environment will have been largely paid for by the crypto industry itself.",
