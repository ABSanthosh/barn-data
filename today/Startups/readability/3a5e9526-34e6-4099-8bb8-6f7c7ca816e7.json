  "text": "Wall Street, over the past several days, has become nearly as volatile as the crypto world. That’s making a lot of startups that were considering going public delay their plans.More than a half dozen companies have paused their initial public offerings in recent days, including businesses that were expected to be among the biggest IPOs of the year.  StubHub and Klarna, which have both already filed their prospectuses with the Securities and Exchange Commission, have both delayed their plans. Fintech company Chime, meanwhile, which reportedly was on the verge of revealing its SEC filing, changed its mind at the last minute last week.Other companies that have halted public offerings since Donald Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on dozens of countries include trading platform eToro Group, adtech company MNTN, and Ategrity Specialty Holdings, an insurance company. (eToro had been scheduled to begin its investor roadshow next week.) Bloomberg also reports that Medline Industries, a medical supply company, has postponed its listing as well, which the company had hoped would result in a $50 billion valuation.The S\u0026P 500 has lost 11 percent of its value since the start of trading last Thursday, the day after Trump made his “Liberation Day” proclamation. The Dow is down the same amount and the Nasdaq Index and Russell 2000 index have both fallen 12 percent.Monday saw more chaos and confusion on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw trading range from 36,705 to 39,198- a nearly 2,500-point swing after a report indicating Trump could be open to a 90-day delay in starting the tariffs circulated, and was later denied.Tariffs have been an ongoing threat since Trump entered the Oval Office in January and had already caused other companies to rethink their plans. In February, AI chip company Cerebras decided to stay public for the time being and car rental startup Turo withdrew its registration statement entirely with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Officials at the New York Stock Exchange said last December that they were expecting a busy year for IPOs thanks to lower interest rates and then-lower odds of a recession. That followed a 2023 which saw an increase in IPOs, but not at the level investors were hoping for.All totaled, there were 150 IPOs in 2024, raising $29.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital—better than 2023 (when 108 IPOs raised $19.4 billion), but below the historical average of 254 IPOs per year. Delayed interest rate cuts and market volatility kept companies on the sideline in recent years.Even companies that had not announced IPO plans, but were widely expected to do so this year have made it clear they’re steering clear of Wall Street for now. Stripe, which has been teasing a public offering since early 2023, announced in February it had opted to raise money from private sources and allowed employees and shareholders to sell their stock via a tender offer. And AI company Databricks, which raised$10 billion in December, followed the same path.A growing number of economists are predicting higher chances of a recession due to Trump’s tariffs. Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its odds to 45 percent, the second increase in a week. And JP Morgan, last week, increased its odds to 60 percent, up from 40 percent just three weeks ago. On Sunday, Moody’s Mark Zandi raised his prediction to 60 percent as well.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
