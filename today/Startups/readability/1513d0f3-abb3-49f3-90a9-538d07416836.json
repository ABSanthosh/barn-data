Now, the company is offering executives massive stock grants if they can help make it happen.The stock grants have a $6 million target value, Bloomberg reports, and are based on performance. In a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Starbucks said the restricted stock units are eligible to vest after the company's 2027 fiscal year, or in late September 2027.Related: Starbucks Is Hiring a 'Global Content Creator' to Travel, Drink Coffee, and Get Paid Six FiguresNiccol's wants his \"Back to Starbucks\" plan enacted \"as quickly as possible,\" the filing says.The company is also hiring 3,000 more baristas as part of Niccol's plan to improve sales after five consecutive quarters of declines.
