  "text": "When Lee Tilghman saw E.l.f. Beauty’s recent Instagram post announcing it was raising the price of all products by $1 in August, she was disturbed. But not because her favorite lip liner or mascara would become more expensive in a few months. The brand’s apologetic and “emotional bestie-in-a-crisis” tone, Tilghman writes in her Substack Offline Time, “took me right back to 2018 to when I was canceled for raising my prices.”  Seven years ago, Tilghman, who is known online as Lee From America, had nearly 400,000 Instagram followers and was making six figures as a full-time influencer. Brands used to pay her $20,000 for a single post, she told The New York Times. Then, the wellness influencer announced that she was hosting a three-city matcha-making workshop series. When her followers learned that tickets cost up to $500, they shunned her. A few months later, she decided to step away from the social media limelight for several years. Now, Tilghman is back on Instagram to promote her upcoming book, If You Don’t Like This, I Will Die. “I had raised my prices substantially and expected some pushback, but nothing could have prepared me for the level of hate that followed,” Tilghman writes on Substack. The comments on Tilghman’s 2018 Instagram post range from tame disappointment—“This is out of my price range”—to sneering frustration—“‘These workshops are not for everyone,’ yeah yup you made that one pretty clear.” One commenter even accuses her of appropriating Japanese culture. Overwhelmed by the negative response, Tilghman began to block and delete critical comments. Her followers then noticed this and became even more vocal. A few days later, she posted an apology video. “I remember the pressure to speak to my followers/admirers/customers in the sweetest, softest, most apologetic voice I could muster,” she writes. “At that point, it wasn’t even pressure; it was survival. I was so desperate for everyone to like me. My brand depended on it.” This pressure, she adds, seems to “mysteriously” only affect brands founded by or aimed at women. “Is Therabody, maker of the Theragun, apologizing with childlike emojis to their followers when their prices go up? (No, they aren’t.)” When female-centric brands announce their price hikes in a less apologetic manner than E.l.f.’s, on the other hand, they experience much more backlash, according to Tilghman. She points to Saie’s “calm, businesslike, and far less emotional” Instagram post about increasing prices by $1 to $4 as an example. One commenter writes, “Profits over the people … very disappointing, Saie.” Another offers sarcastic business advice: “You could probably quit sending influencers on brand trips and sending them boxes and boxes of free products and expecting your regular customers to foot the bill.” Though there are similar comments on E.l.f.’s page—like, “How about paying your CEO less?”—many more of its comments praise the brand’s transparency and authenticity. Tilghman writes that she’s “not against good customer service or clear communication.” Still, “there’s a difference between being communicative and being performatively sweet.” “I don’t like the begging, the placating, the need to be soft and sweet to be heard,” she adds. “And I don’t like being spoken to like a child. E.l.f. has positioned itself to ask for permission, just like women so often feel they have to—while male-led brands don’t. They just say what they need. No emotion. No googly eyes.” The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
