  "text": "Vivek Ramaswamy has his sights set on electric vehicles. Ramaswamy, who President-elect Donald Trump chose to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk, took to Musk-owned social media platform X to call out recently announced government funding for EV companies.“Biden’s midnight spending spree is illegitimate \u0026 should be rescinded,” he wrote. “DOGE will carefully scrutinize every one of these questionable 11th-hour transactions, starting on Jan 20.”His post specifically referenced two transactions: a $7.5 billion loan to electric vehicle battery manufacturer StarPlus Energy, a joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung, and a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian. If finalized, the StarPlus funding, announced Monday, would support building two lithium-ion battery plants in Indiana. Rivian announced the conditional loan funding in late November, and said that, if finalized, it would be used to finance construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North in Georgia, where it will likely build its next-gen R2 vehicle.Ramaswamy added on X that the Biden Administration has allowed “~$55BN to be squandered (“loaned”) under the Inflation Reduction Act.” Despite his apparent disdain for the spending, the sums he referenced are in fact loans, meant to be repaid. “These are loans that get paid back, and they will get paid back,” says Robby DeGraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific. “Tesla has taken government loans, so it’s hypocritical.”  Some have been quick to attribute Ramaswamy’s actions as a possible swipe against Tesla rivals, given that he is co-leading DOGE with Musk, who heads Tesla. And when California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a state-level EV rebate that could exclude Tesla, some commentators conversely claimed it represented an attack on Tesla. Musk has acknowledged that some proposed changes under the incoming administration, like eliminating the $7,500 EV tax credit, will hurt other EV companies more than they do Tesla, Business Insider reported.Although Tesla is slowly losing market share, DeGraff says that the EV-maker is still “at the very top of the totem pole” and likely isn’t under much threat from companies like Rivian for now.“The purpose of DOGE, I think, is going to be to have loud, angry scrutiny of anything related to the Green New Deal, or climate, or alternative fuels and EVs,” says DeGraff. “There’s so much talk—and I don’t think we’re going to actually see any action coming from this—but that talk is going to be excessively loud and full of misinformation for the next several years.”",
