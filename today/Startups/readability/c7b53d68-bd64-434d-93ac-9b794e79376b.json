  "text": "Every person has a limit on how many connections they can manage at one time. This is why Dunbar’s number theory rings true—the average person is able to maintain a meaningful relationship with 150 people and can recognize around 1,500 individuals.  This obviously creates a problem for business owners who need to manage hundreds of contacts. Maybe many more! This is why customer relationship management (CRM) software was developed—to make it easier for companies to organize and manage meaningful relationships en masse.  Even if you aren’t familiar with CRMs, you’ve probably heard of them. Zoho, Salesforce, and HubSpot are some of the most popular CRMs, and some like GoHighLevel specialize in small business CRM needs. Hopefully you are already using one, because they offer so many tools that can help your business be more efficient.  You don’t use a CRM? But I realized recently that half of small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) aren’t using a CRM! We survey every client after they finish a marketing campaign with my business, PostcardMania (most of them are SMBs), and we recently added this question to the survey: “Which CRM do you use?” Out of 446 survey respondents, 56 percent chose “none” as their CRM. I was gobsmacked! Honestly, I could never have scaled my business without one. If I could wave a wand and magic one thing into every business owner’s possession, it would be a CRM. Here’s why: A CRM is like a having personal assistant and marketing coordinator 100 percent dedicated to your business growth. What CRMs do CRMs are master organizers. They organize all of your business contacts and can create useful categories, such as a new lead, new customer, VIP, and more.  You can also group contacts based on behaviors, purchase history, and other demographics like age, income, location, and more.  After organizing your data in a way that makes sense for your business, your CRM will manage that customer data for you. It’s a smart database for business—one that can accomplish tasks on your behalf. You can use your CRM to automate marketing tasks (so they run on their own), such as welcome messages, follow-ups, phone call reminders, order confirmations, and more.  I’ll say that again—your CRM can track what your business needs to do and then do it for you. Rather than manually changing a new lead to a new customer, manually inputting their order value, manually sending a confirmation email, it’s all done automatically through your CRM. Yes, you will need to spend time setting it up, but after that, it’s on autopilot!  A CRM is a business organizer and optimizer. There are certain tools you can implement to really supercharge your business growth. Add a physical touchpoint My best advice on marketing with a CRM: Add a physical touchpoint to your follow-up. A CRM connects your business to a wide range of marketing tools, like your website, email marketing, SMS (text) marketing, and more. But the one you may not have heard about is CRM-based direct mail marketing, aka physical mail pieces sent to individuals in your CRM based on certain triggers.  Imagine this: A new lead is created in your CRM, and boom—24 hours later, they get a postcard in the mail highlighting your best products or services and several 5-star Google reviews. Or maybe a hot lead goes cold; you can program your CRM to automatically send a postcard with a nice message and maybe a family photo to cold leads after two weeks of no contact to generate a little more goodwill. (These are just ideas of course. You can be as creative as you like.) Physical mailers—something people can hold in their hands and read in the comfort of their own homes—offer some key advantages over digital methods. For one, there’s less competition in the mailbox—marketing mail volume decreased 40 percent between 2008 and 2023. This makes it easier for your mailings to stand out. Some big brands have already caught onto this. You may have heard that J.Crew relaunched its print catalog last year to much fanfare, and IKEA also got back into the print game after nixing its iconic catalog in 2022.  At same time, digital fatigue has hit new heights, with email and text message marketing ranked as the most irritating channels by consumers. This all culminates in a big advantage for direct mail: better response rates (5 to 7 times better), better ROI, and a potentially big boost for your business with minimal effort. One client of mine used a similar approach by sending triggered postcards to website visitors. He mailed just 111 postcards, and ended up closing a deal worth $70,000 as a result. That’s an ROI of 10,710 percent. There are a few direct mail platforms out there that will allow you to connect your CRM directly. I encourage you to shop around and find one that suits your needs without overcharging you on tech fees. Ideally, you should only pay for the mail you send. Working with the right mail house will make CRM automation easy and affordable so that you can increase your return on investment. Start now and it could be a game-changer for your business. The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
