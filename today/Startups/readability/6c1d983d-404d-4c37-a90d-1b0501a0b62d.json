The movie was released in 1968, a year before the lunar landing, and it foreshadowed a world in which robots surpass, outsmart, and eventually replace us. That trepidation is as palpable today as it was decades ago when the movie premiered.Why?Haven’t we learned by now that artificial intelligence isn’t the enemy? Yet more than half of U.S. workers say they are more worried about AI than hopeful.I believe we missed the plot of the movie entirely.AI was never the competition; it was a collaborator. At times, HAL was useful to the astronauts, but deep inside us, we created this belief that AI might fail us. The astronauts in 2001 didn’t fail because AI is super powerful. They failed because they treated AI as an enemy. HAL was never the enemy.Who is the enemy?There is a fundamental fear that humans will lose control of something we created. But who was the real enemy in the movie? It was space itself, with its vast deepness and darkness.Similar questions are being asked in human resources departments: Who is the enemy? Is it AI? Or is it something else? The answer is there are multiple enemies—diminishing budgets, a shrinking workforce, dwindling resources, and unrealistic expectations.Business strategy is outrunning HRInternal Phenom data shows us that there were 20 million HR professionals worldwide in 2023 and 3.5 billion employees. That ratio breaks down to one HR professional for every 200 employees. Those odds are worse than 300 Spartans going after 10,000 Persians.Rapidly shifting talent demands triggered that imbalance. In 2020 HR was all about speed. Two years later the priority was quality, and then in 2024 it shifted to cost. Market needs changed so often that HR professionals were left spinning dozens of plates at once.I have met with more than 700 customers and prospects across the globe during the last two years and there is one commonality I have observed: Business strategy is moving faster than HR can keep up.Before each customer visit, I look at each organization’s data in two key areas. The first is around hiring (the jobs they posted, which areas they’re filling roles in, etc.) and the second is the skill evolutions the company is going through in terms of workforce planning and workforce intelligence. It is important to understand how customers are thinking about retention and professional development.Parsing through the data and reflecting on my conversations, I’ve learned that there is often a 12- to 18-month lag in hiring, and it’s creating turmoil. Typically, companies respond to the crisis by bringing on a new chief executive officer, changing products, or undertaking an organization restructuring.Here’s where AI can helpThere’s a better way. For the first time, alignment between HR and business strategies is achievable with software using ontologies and AI agents. In the past, this would have been impossible. HR data, by its nature, is complex and unstructured, because the data itself is extremely large. Building inference and reasoning is difficult. Business strategy data requires massive computing power so everything had to be done manually, which costs time and money.Fortunately, rapid technological advancements are producing AI-powered ontologies that allow organizations to: Convert intelligence into language in minutes. Convert language into insights in seconds. It works by collecting data on how a company is operating in the background. It connects the dots between business strategy and HR in an efficient format, so the lag disappears and brings alignment between individual contributors, managers, and leaders.    Before ontologies, HR had to painstakingly figure out the right roles to meet business objectives by sitting down with different managers throughout the organization, identify skills gaps on the team, and then decide how to fill those gaps.There was no automatic guidance that states if this is the business strategy you want to execute on, here are the skills you need to do it. Maybe an organization has some of those skills internally already. Maybe it needs to look externally for the right talent. For the ones that need to be source externally, what jobs should be posted? For roles that will be filled internally is there a development plan to get employees up to speed?Numerous companies are already benefitting from AI and automation to shrink the gap.For instance, a major international postal service, orchestrates a massive hiring surge every holiday season, bringing on 40,000 additional workers in a matter of weeks to ensure parcels reach their destinations. The talent logistics challenge is as complex as the delivery network itself—recruiting, screening, and onboarding candidates fast enough to handle the package crush. The challenge spans vastly different skill sets—from frontline postal workers to cybersecurity experts—each requiring tailored recruitment approaches.AI and automation helped the organization decrease the time it took candidates to complete a job application from 30 minutes to about three minutes, increasing job seeker traffic by 40%, and converting 79% of applicants into hires.Meanwhile, specialty sports retailer Rally House is rapidly expanding from 140 stores to nearly 300, requiring thousands of new hires. This explosive growth makes hiring more complex, as the company must recruit at scale while maintaining quality across diverse locations and timing demands.AI is now helping HR streamline candidate sourcing by spending less time on manual hiring tasks. Rally House cut costs by 122% by reducing its reliance on job ads and third parties, and by saving 10,000 hours by automating interview scheduling.In today’s fast-changing markets, companies must stay nimble and relevant. Those that don’t will have more to fear from irrelevance than any talking spaceship robot could ever inspire.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
