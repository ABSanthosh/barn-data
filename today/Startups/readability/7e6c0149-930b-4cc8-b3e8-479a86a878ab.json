  "text": "Electronic Arts had its official at Star Wars Celebration in Japan for Star Wars: Zero Company, a new single-player tactics game set during the twilight of the Clone Wars. It will release in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Respawn, which developed the Star Wars games Jedi: Fallen Order and Jedi: Survivor, is developing the game with Bit Reactor, a studio made up of Firaxis veterans. Firaxis has major tactics chops thanks to its work on the XCOM series. “Our vision for Star Wars: Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay,” said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor, in a press release sent to GamesBeat. “It’s our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation.” The Clone Wars is a popular era for Star Wars fans, set between the events of the Episode II and Episode III films. It’s also the setting for a popular animated show of the same name. The game will have players take on the role of Hawks, a former Republic officer. You’ll be able to customize Hawks to your liking, “Tailor squadmates’ appearances, load-outs, and abilities across a wide variety of character archetypes, including Clone Troopers, astromechs and even a Jedi,” notes the press release. “While in the field, members of Zero Company will forge bonds between them to unlock powerful combat synergies that can turn the tide of battle. With near-endless possibilities and high-stakes encounters that could change the fate of the galaxy, players will need intense preparation, adept strategy, and the right squad to succeed.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
