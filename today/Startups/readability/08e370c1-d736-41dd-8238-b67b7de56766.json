  "text": "Ayesha Curry’s husband Steph might be a famous basketball star, but she’s a bit of a point guard as well. The founder calls the shots at her company, Sweet July, a many-armed lifestyle, skincare, culinary, editorial (via a publishing partnership with indie publisher Zando), and content production company. She spoke about onstage at the Inc. 5000 conference this week in Palm Springs about her business, and her partnership with her husband, who plays for the Golden State Warriors. The best-selling cookbook author and actor said Sweet July is her “fifth child,” which had fellow mom and Inc. editor-at-large Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, asking “How on earth do you do it all?” The answer? “Community and chaos,” says Curry. She started building a community early on as a content creator on YouTube, making videos about her life as a new mom, sharing recipes, and parenting advice. Curry says she started with an authentic desire to post what she loved, and that a community of like-minded people began to coalesce around her—something she says has been a must as she grows her brand. “I surround myself with a lot of people who have the same core values and same goals as me,” Curry says. But she also recognizes the need for “people who think bigger” than yourself, she says. “I’m more of the creative mind, the big ideas girl behind Sweet July,” Curry says. “And then I have my wonderful team around me to be like ‘Pump the brakes, girl.’”  Curry says she has a similar dynamic with her husband Steph Curry. “I come with the big ideas,” she says, “he’s the one that’s like, here’s how we’re going to do this, and here’s what it could look like.” For other perspectives, Curry says they both rely on a community of smart people and aren’t afraid to delegate. But one thing they can’t delegate is holding each other accountable. “Even if the truth hurts or it’s gritty, we’re not afraid to vocalize what we’re seeing from afar or what we feel internally,” she says. Speaking of smart people, Curry, who grew up in a Jamaican family, says that growing up, she often heard her grandma, mom, and aunts talking about natural simple remedies from the kitchen. “And I would never listen to them,” she says. But after many years of struggling to find products that work, she set out to create her own and discovered, those remedies weren’t just old wives’ tales. That’s why her food-based skincare brand is created with Caribbean ingredients. For example, its Good Youth Sleep Serum contains lavender and turmeric. Curry says they took their time with R \u0026 D, conducting skincare studies, getting the proper accreditations, product tooling and developing packaging. “We don’t have to go backward,” Curry says, “because we never tried to run a race.”Stay tuned for more coverage from the Inc. 5000, which includes insights from business owners like Courtney Cox (who has a “no asshole policy”), La Colombe co-founder Todd Carmichael, and Sweetgreen’s Nicolas Jammet.",
