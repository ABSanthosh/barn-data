  "text": "Google Ads is set to implement a new data retention policy, limiting historical data access to 11 years. As data privacy concerns continues to grow, tech companies may need to adjust their data retention policies. This move by Google aligns with broader industry trends towards more defined data lifecycles. Details. The policy goes into effect Nov. 13 and: Applies to data accessed via Google Ads API using GoogleAds.Search or GoogleAds.SearchStream. Data older than 11 years from the date of the API request will not be returned. Why we care. This change affects all account data, including performance metrics, billing information and historical reports, potentially impacting long-term trend analysis and reporting for advertisers. What to watch. Advertisers and agencies with needs for longer historical data should act before the implementation date. What they’re saying. Google advises users who need data older than 11 years to retrieve and store it before Nov. 13. Bottom line. Most users won’t need to take any immediate action, but this change could affect long-term reporting and analysis strategies for some advertisers.
