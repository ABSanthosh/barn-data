  "text": "Fashion lovers can now have their own version of Cher’s iconic closet from 1995 cult classic film Clueless, thanks to AI and the plans of a startup called Alta. New York-based Alta announced the official launch of its AI-powered styling and shopping app Monday, alongside $11 million in seed funding from a star-studded array of investors.  “I view Alta as your style companion,” says founder Jenny Wang. “You have your AI, your little Alta, that knows you and your taste and is a safe, fun, and exciting playground to try new things and to discover new things. And it’s trained on you.” The app gives users a number of ways to upload clothing items from their actual closets and then picks outfits based on a number of conditions, including weather, the occasion for wear (black tie gala versus business lunch, for example), and whether or not a user has worn the clothing items recently. Plus, the app offers personalized shopping recommendations in case a user’s closet doesn’t have the right item for a particular occasion. The goal, says Wang, a Harvard-trained engineer, is to make the often arduous process of picking out an outfit not only easy, but also fun. Wang says she was inspired by Clueless when building Alta, but the technology was also born out of personal need to solve what Wang calls the “n-dimensional problem” (a problem with an unspecified number of parameters) of outfit choice. Users are encouraged to upload clothing in their closets by taking photos of items they already have, searching in the app, or even forwarding receipts from a purchase. If the app knows how much a user paid for an item, it will also show the cost-per-wear, depending on how many times it’s been worn. Users can make a personal avatar by uploading a photo of their face and then inputting their height, weight and body shape so that the app can show what an outfit might look like on a their body. Users can then train the AI model by saving a look they like or by disliking it. They can also leave feedback. The app has a trip planner function that can help someone decide what to pack if, for example, they’ll be city-hopping in Europe and attending a fancy dinner one day and going rock climbing the next. It also takes into account a user’s luggage size. Users can even share looks to coordinate with friends, whether they have an Alta account or not. “I used to be the type of person who would try to plan out what I was going to wear, be organized, use a spreadsheet. It was just too much work,” Wang says. “I always felt like there should be an AI to do this for you.” The shopping component of the app also serves as a revenue source for Alta. Wang says that Alta will mostly pull items from users’ closets on a day-to-day basis, but will surface shopping recommendations for events that are further into the future. If, for example, you have plans to attend Beyonce’s Cowboy Carter tour, and don’t own cowboy boots, the app might slot in some recommended styles. Alta plans to make affiliate revenue from items sold through its app. “The way that we shop is going to change in the next few years. The current paradigm of having 30 different tabs open and screenshotting people on social media—you feel overwhelmed, drinking from the fire hose of TikTok,” Wang says.  “The future of commerce and shopping is a highly personalized experience that is mixing things you have with things you can buy. And it’s also relevant to your lifestyle,” she adds. It’s clear from the investors and partners that Alta has on its side that the problems Wang is looking to address through Alta are not unique. Alta’s seed round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Aglae Ventures, which is backed by the Arnault family who runs LVMH; Benchstrength Ventures; Phenomenal Ventures, the VC firm founded by Kamala Harris’ niece, Meena Harris; and others. A group of AI experts, founders, and celebrities that includes DoorDash CEO Tony Xu, models Karlie Kloss and Jasmine Tookes, and stylist Meredith Koop—perhaps best known for working with Michelle Obama—also participated. Alta also has a partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America. “Many of these investors are individuals I’ve known for many years, and they have become great friends and mentors,” Wang says. “They really see the future of how technology and AI can empower shopping and make it such a fun and empowering experience.” Recreating the closet that Cher from Clueless consults each day to put together a stylish and unique outfit (here’s a clip if you need a refresher) has long been a goal for fashion forward founders—but none have really stuck. Summer House star Danielle Olivera, for example, launched an app called Donne in 2023, but to-date the app has only 15 ratings on Apple’s app store and a meagre 2.4-star rating.  Wang says she tried previously to build a version of Alta, but failed because “the AI just wasn’t good enough.” But recent advancements in the technology inspired her to try again. Alta, Wang says, is powered by “a dozen different underlying models pieced together” including computer vision and proprietary models. Alta is currently available for download and free to use. The company is planning an official consumer launch later this summer, when the company will announce new features and partnerships including a social feed that allows users to recreate outfits from influencers, celebrities, and brands, based on items in their own closets or items for purchase at varying price points.  “Alta is utilitarian in the sense that we help you pick out what to wear, but it’s also fun and inspirational,” Wang says. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
