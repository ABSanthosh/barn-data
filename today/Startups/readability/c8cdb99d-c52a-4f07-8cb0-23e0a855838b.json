  "text": "The expansive budget bill that President Trump signed into law on Independence Day has a lot for small-business owners to like, from the extension of various first-term Trump tax cuts to higher deductions for both qualified business income as well as state and local taxes. The best part, however, may be the expansion of the small-business stock exclusion, a tax break on nearly all the capital gains enjoyed by startup investors and equity holders when they cash out their stock. The policy, which has been expanded multiple times before, benefits venture capitalists as well as founders themselves. It’s such a good deal that, The New York Times reports, some Silicon Valley stakeholders are still pinching themselves that they bagged it. “Everyone was like: ‘Are you joking?’” San Francisco lawyer Christopher Karachale told the Times. “These founders and early employees, they’re already getting a huge benefit. So if anything people are thinking: ‘Wow, it’s remarkable the statute got opened up all this [much] more.’” Or, as Bobby Franklin, chief executive of the National Venture Capital Association, more succinctly put it: “Every once in a while you get lucky.” Small businesses fail all the time, of course, but when one does grow from a small garage operation to a massive publicly traded behemoth, the stock exclusion means early shareholders can claim millions in tax savings, the Times reports. Under the prior version of the law, individuals who had a stake in a business when it had less than $50 million in gross assets could skip over their tax obligations on the first $10 million they earned from cashing out shares. (Some exclusions applied: The company couldn’t be an accounting or banking interest, and the stocks had to be held for at least five years.) Now, the benefit can kick in earlier—partial savings will begin after three years—and will cover investors in companies with $75 million, rather than just $50 million, in gross assets, the Times reports. The expanded tax break will also cover up to $15 million in capital gains rather than just the first $10 million. In a boon to institutional investors, the tax break can also be used to cover earnings of 10 times the value of an initial investment, meaning an initial stake of $10 million could allow for $100 million in tax-free gains later on. “The tax break overwhelmingly benefits the richest Americans,” the Times reports, citing a recent Treasury Department report which found that “people making more than $1 million a year had netted more than 70 percent of all the tax-free dollars claimed through the tax break between 2012 and 2022.” Low-income Americans, meanwhile, face an estimated $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid under the new budget bill, including through work requirements and diminished federal support. One recent study estimated that the austerity measures will lead to over 1,000 extra deaths, and almost 100,000 more hospitalizations, every year. The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
