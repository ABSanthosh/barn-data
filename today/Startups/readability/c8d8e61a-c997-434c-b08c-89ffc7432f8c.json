  "text": "It’s easy to procrastinate. To overthink. To plan a little too long and call it “strategy” when really, it’s just a delay tactic. I know the pattern because I’ve lived it. Case in point: It took me weeks to write this article. When I want to gain momentum, I start by unloading everything onto a to-do list. It’s a full-on brain dump—tasks I need to do, want to do, should do… or definitely shouldn’t do. And here’s the paradox: The list gets massive, which feels counterproductive, but somehow, it works. The more I stack on my plate, the more I power through. Because here’s what I’ve learned: Doing more—even if it’s not perfect—always beats standing still. My approach is simple:   Think.   Move.   Deliver.   Repeat.  Choose action over analysis It’s not about chasing perfection. It’s about building progress. The work isn’t always flawless—neither are my push-ups, by the way, but consistency is where the real wins happen. I choose action over analysis, execution over endless planning every day. Not because I don’t care about quality—I do—but because waiting for the “perfect moment” usually means you’re waiting forever. Spoiler alert: The perfect moment never shows up. You just have to show up. There are times when an estimate or legal document demands my full attention—like editing this article, for example. The deadline is there, but I try not to focus on it. Instead, I clear my morning of meetings and carve out uninterrupted time to power through. That way, I simply get it done—no distractions, no excuses. If not, I very well know that my word doc will remain open on my computer, until I find it, randomly, one evening. Look for the doers This mindset isn’t just personal. It’s professional. I want people around me who make things happen—not just talk about how great things could be. I need drivers. People who push projects forward without needing a committee or a perfectly aligned moon cycle. People who show up, own it, and deliver. When I’m hiring or coaching, I like to challenge the doer within.  Everyone—no matter their role—wants to make an impact. What does a junior painter have in common with a seasoned project manager? Their ability to DO: To spot what needs to be done and get it done. In construction, that’s everything. We’re here to build—which means moving tasks from “to-do” to “done,” whether it’s painting a wall or managing a schedule. My most effective employees have this mindset hardwired: They list out their tasks each morning and track their progress by day’s end. That level of ownership is what drives real results. Plan for everything At Steady Solutions, as you can tell, project management isn’t just part of our process—it’s in our DNA. Gantt charts, schedules, Plan A… plus Plans B, C, and D, if needed. We prep for anything. But let’s be clear: that work doesn’t happen in a boardroom. It happens in the field, on the front lines, by people willing to move mountains—not just suggest how others might do it. How many times have we paid a premium for a first-thing-in-the-morning delivery—only for it to show up 24 hours late, damaged… or not at all? Three weeks ago, we “lost” two trucks of concrete. MIA. Gone. Nowhere to be found. Fortunately, we had backup options in place to keep a critical concrete pour on track. Without that, we would’ve been in serious trouble. Talk has its place. But in the end? Outcomes matter. Progress matters. And progress belongs to the ones who show up, roll up their sleeves, and get it done—even when it’s not perfect. Somewhere out there, two concrete trucks are living their best lives. If you spot them, remind them they’ve got a job to finish—and help me finally check that one off my to-do list. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
