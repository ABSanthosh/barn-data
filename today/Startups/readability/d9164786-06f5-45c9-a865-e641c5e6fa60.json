Photo: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to bump household energy prices up.As a result of the bill’s passage, national average household energy prices are expected to rise by $78 to $192 in 2035, according to a report from research and analysis firm Rhodium Group. Furthermore, some billions of investments in clean energy infrastructure are at risk of delays or outright cancellation, and greenhouse emissions are expected to rise.As much as half to two-thirds of the cost increases for households are expected to be driven by increased spending on fuel, including gas, diesel, and electricity for EVs, according to the report. Rhodium anticipates fewer EVs on the road due to earlier termination of EV tax credits, and a subsequent rise in gas consumption of as much as 11 percent. Increased gas use is projected to drive up gas prices by as much as 3 percent in 2035. The report attributes as much as one quarter to half of the rise in household energy spending to rising electricity rates, which are expected to jump 2 to 4 percent in 2035. Meanwhile, a separate report from energy and climate thinktank Energy Innovation anticipates household energy costs rising an estimated $170 per year by 2035. Rhodium’s report also estimates that “a meaningful portion of $522 billion worth of outstanding clean energy investments remains at risk.” That includes investments in clean electricity facilities, clean industrial facilities, and manufacturing plants, meant to build clean energy tech, that have not yet begun operating. And of that figure, some $222 billion is linked to wind, solar and storage facilities that have not yet broken ground.“All told, the law puts more than half a trillion dollars of clean energy and transportation investment at risk of cancellation,” the report reads.These facilities are at risk at a time when energy demand is rising due to population growth, rising global temperatures, electrification, and big tech’s fast-based investment in AI data centers. Energy bills are likely to rise with increased demand and increased reliance on natural gas, CNBC reported.Beyond just household expenditures, industrial energy expenditures are expected to rise in 2035 by about three to four percent due to higher rates for electricity and elevated natural gas consumption.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
