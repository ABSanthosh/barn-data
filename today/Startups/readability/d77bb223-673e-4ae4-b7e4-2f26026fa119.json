However, producing this hydrogen still requires a large energy input, which has prompted Wild Hydrogen to search for alternative methods of producing hydrogen cleanly. Wild Hydrogen’s RiPR technology could be a game-changer for the industry by producing cost-effective, carbon-negative hydrogen from a wide range of feedstocks. Using supercritical water gasification (SCWG), the startup converts wet biogenic material – such as waste wood, plants, and compost, as well as potentially plastic waste and seaweed – into what the startup calls ‘clear’ hydrogen. The initial output from Wild Hydrogen’s process is a blend of gases, which can be used as is or split again into its component gases: hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and biomethane. This method allows the CO2 to be captured and sequestered, meaning the carbon cycle is interrupted and carbon-negative (clear) hydrogen is created. Unlike green hydrogen, which is produced through electrolysis, the company’s RiPR reactors don’t require large amounts of green electricity and can even operate without a mains grid connection. The process uses a fraction of the energy produced to sustain itself, meaning carbon-negative hydrogen can be generated at a competitive price. Wild Hydrogen is now planning to build its first commercial demonstrator to produce hydrogen at scale. To enable this, the company is working on raising £6 million in its third seed round, with £2 million already secured. The company is also seeking an industrial partner or off-taker to support the company in its mission to scale up clear hydrogen technology.
