If you purchase them, Entrepreneur may get a small share of the revenue from the sale from our commerce partners. The trend of modern software requiring a constant paid subscription has hit businesses hard. When you need apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on every computer in your office, that usually means paying subscription fees across the board. It adds up, and you're never done paying. The alternative is to make a larger investment on day one to avoid the constant cost later on.Microsoft Office 2024 has a lifetime license with no recurring payments.
