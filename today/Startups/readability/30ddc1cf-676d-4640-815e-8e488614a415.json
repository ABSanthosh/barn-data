  "text": "I’ve been in the freight game long enough to know one thing for sure: Change is the only constant. But what we’re seeing now? It’s not just change—it’s a full-on reset. After years of pandemic chaos, geopolitical curveballs, tech breakthroughs, and shifting tariffs, we’re stepping into what I’ve started calling “the new normal.” It’s a wild mix of challenges and possibilities, and I’ve been digging into it lately in different conversations.  In January, I hopped on a live stream with Lee Klaskow from Bloomberg Intelligence and Scott Luton from Supply Chain Now (you can catch it here if you’re curious). We got into the nitty-gritty of today’s freight landscape. Four big shifts in the freight business standout for me right now. 1. Global trade isn’t what it used to be  The days of everything flowing seamlessly across continents are fading. Companies are pulling back, focusing on regional supply chains—think nearshoring​​​ ​​​​(​moving production or sourcing to a nearby country to reduce time and costs.) or friendshoring​​​ (sourcing products from countries with friendly political or trade relationships to avoid trade tensions.)​. Tariff policies and trade tensions are driving this shift, and it’s less about chasing the cheapest option and more about keeping things steady when the world gets messy. 2. Capacity is flipped upside down  Remember in 2021 and 2022 when you couldn’t find a container or a ship to save your life? Now we’ve got the opposite problem—too much capacity, especially in ocean freight. Rates are dropping fast, which is great if you’re a shipper but tough if you’re a carrier trying to stay afloat. 3. Tech is no longer optional  Digital platforms, AI, and predictive tools are everywhere. I’ve seen firsthand how they’re changing the game, and it’s not just the big players benefiting. Smaller outfits are jumping in too, and it’s exciting to watch.  If you’d told me a decade ago how digital freight would look today, I’d have raised an eyebrow. We’ve gone from basic tracking to insane ecosystems tying everyone together—shippers, carriers, forwarders, you name it. Data’s the star here. It’s not just about keeping things moving; it’s about seeing around corners. Predictive analytics can tell you when a truck’s about to break down or reroute a shipment before a storm hits. What’s cool is how this levels things out. Small players can grab tools that used to be out of reach, and suddenly they’re competing with the giants. I’ve seen it happen, and it’s shaking things up in the best way. 4. Sustainability matters Freight’s a big piece of the global emissions puzzle—about 8 percent of CO2 emissions worldwide—and the pressure’s on to clean it up. It’s not just regulators cracking the whip either. Customers want greener options, and investors are asking hard questions. I’ve been talking to fellow industry leaders, and the shift is real. Sustainability used to feel like a box to check; now it’s a make-or-break strategy. Companies investing in electric trucks, alternative fuels, or even smarter routing aren’t just cutting emissions; they’re winning business and saving cash long-term. It’s a grind to get there, but the ones moving first are the ones I’d bet on. My prediction for what’s next I also recently spoke about tariffs at the Pacific Global Association logistics network, and as I told them, I’m feeling a mix of caution and hope. We’ve got headwinds—overcapacity, shaky rates, trade tensions, tariff fluctuations, and that massive decarbonization hurdle. But those same pressures are sparking some of the smartest ideas I’ve seen in years. The winners in this new normal? They’re the ones who don’t fight it. Flexible operations, tech that works hard, and a real commitment to sustainability—that’s the playbook. Freight’s always been about adapting, and this moment is no different. It’s a lot to take in, but I think it’s a chance to build something better, not just ride it out. If you want to dive deeper, that livestream I did with Lee Klaskow and Scott Luton is a good place to start. It’s a candid chat about all this and more. For me, this isn’t just industry noise, I’m in it every day, and I’m betting on those who see the new normal as something to shape, not just survive. The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
