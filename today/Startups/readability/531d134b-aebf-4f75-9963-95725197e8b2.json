  "description": "As Chinese AI developers send shockwaves through Silicon Valley, and Elon Musk spats with President Trump over AI policy, Reid Hoffman returns to Rapid Response to explore today’s AI landscape, and the secrets behind a concept he calls AI ‘Superagency’. Hoffman shares his vision for what an AI-infused workday will soon look like, how we address society’s greatest fears about technology, and more.
