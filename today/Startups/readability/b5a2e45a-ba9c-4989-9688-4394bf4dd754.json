Hang up the phone and report the scam to the proper authorities.READ MORE: Do You Need IT Support for Your Small Business?Common Tech Support Scams Businesses FaceBusinesses that both offer and use technical support services are often the targets of scammers. Let’s take a look at some common scams businesses face and should be aware of.Online Ads \u0026 Listings in SERPSScammers will place online ads and listings on search engine results pages (SERPS), often using the name of a legitimate company. They may also create a fake website that looks like the real company’s site.When potential customers click on the ad or listing, they’re taken to the scammer’s site or given a fake phone number to call. The scammer then tries to sell the customer unnecessary support services or software or convince them to give up their personal or financial information.Scam ProgramsScammers will create fake versions of legitimate software programs and offer them for download. These programs may contain malware that can infect your system, or they may be completely useless. Either way, the scammer is trying to get you to install their software so they can either steal your information or sell you unnecessary support services.Suspicious or Unknown Pop-up WindowWhile browsing the web, a pop-up window suddenly appears, prompting you to call a phone number for tech support. The message may claim that your computer has a virus or that there is an issue with your account.Don’t call the number! These fake alerts are a scam designed to get you to give up your personal or financial information.Phishing Emails or Text MessagesScammers will send a phishing email or text message that appears to be from a legitimate company. They may say there’s a problem with your account or that you need to update your information. The message will often include a link to a fake website that looks like the real company’s site.Don’t click on the link! If you do, you may be taken to a site that will ask you for your personal or financial information. Or, the link may download malware onto your computer.Scam WebsitesScammers often set up counterfeit websites that closely resemble legitimate ones. They might use a domain name similar to the authentic site or introduce a minor misspelling. Alternatively, they may establish a subdomain of the actual site (for instance, support.example.com). When you access the site, you may be prompted to provide your personal or financial details. You might also be presented with phony support services or software to download. In any case, the goal of the scammer is to steal your information.Tech Support Phone ScamsThis scam works by the scammer placing unsolicited phone calls to a business and pretending to be a computer technician from a tech support company. The scammer will then tell the business that they are experiencing problems with their operating system and that they need to take action immediately.The scammer then provides the business with one of the scam phone numbers to call. The business calls the number and reaches a person also pretending to be from tech support. The person on the other end of the line will then tell the business that they need to pay for tech support in order to fix the problem. The business will then be scammed out of money.Remote Desktop Software ScamsScammers frequently instruct victims to download and install remote desktop software, claiming it will fix a computer problem. After the software is installed, the scammer obtains complete access to the victim’s computer, which can lead to the theft of sensitive information or the installation of malware. Additionally, they may request payment for the “service” they offer.Social Media Tech Support ImpersonationScammers are increasingly using social media platforms to impersonate tech support from well-known companies. They respond to your tech queries or complaints on social media and then direct you to fraudulent websites or phone numbers. Through these channels, they might offer to fix nonexistent problems for a fee or install malware on your device.Fake Tech Support Job ScamsThese scams target individuals looking for tech support jobs. Scammers post fake job listings, and when applicants respond, they are asked to pay for training, certification, or a startup kit. The job doesn’t exist, and the scammer walks away with the money and personal information provided during the application process.Voicemail Phishing (Vishing)In this scam, victims receive a voicemail purportedly from a legitimate tech support company, warning them about a security breach or software issue. The voicemail includes a callback number, and when the victim calls, they’re pressured into providing sensitive information or allowing remote access to their computer.Overpayment Tech Support ScamIn this situation, a scammer impersonating a customer reaches out to a tech support service provider for assistance. Following the service, they deliberately overpay—often by a substantial sum—using a stolen credit card or a fraudulent account. They subsequently request a refund for the overpaid amount, typically directing it to a different account, which allows them to launder money through the business.Fake Antivirus Software AlertsScammers use pop-up alerts on websites that warn you about viruses supposedly found on your computer. These alerts look legitimate and prompt you to download antivirus software, which is actually malware. Alternatively, they may direct you to a fraudulent website where you’re asked to input credit card information to purchase the fake antivirus software.How Bad is the Problem?Tech support scams are a problem that is increasingly becoming more significant. Elderly adults are especially vulnerable to these scams, as they are often targeted by tech support scammers who pose as legitimate tech support staff. Victims of tech support fraud lose an average of $200, though some have lost thousands of dollars.Tips for Avoiding Tech Support ScamsHere are four tips to help you avoid tech support scams:Initiate Communication Caution: Remember that legitimate tech companies never initiate unsolicited calls for tech support. If an unknown caller claims to be from tech support, it’s wise to hang up. Scammers often employ this tactic to catch you off guard, so remain vigilant and skeptical of uninvited communications.Research Reputable Companies: Go the extra mile by conducting research before engaging with a tech support provider. Visit the official company website to identify authorized phone numbers. In the digital age, caller ID can also aid in verifying the authenticity of incoming “tech support” calls. This diligence ensures you deal exclusively with trusted entities.Guard Your Personal Information: A cardinal rule in navigating tech support is never to share sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers. Genuine tech support will never request such information. Exercise caution when divulging personal or financial details to unfamiliar individuals, thereby mitigating potential risks.Fortify with Updated Antivirus Software: Staying one step ahead is paramount. Regularly update your antivirus software and perform routine scans. This proactive approach guards your system against malware that scammers may attempt to implant. By maintaining an active line of defense, you enhance your computer’s resilience against cyber threats.StrategyDescriptionInitiate Communication CautionLegitimate tech companies never initiate unsolicited calls.
