  "text": "Utility software company Neara makes 3-D grid modeling technology that analyzes power grids to identify risk and monitor disaster recovery. Clients like Southern California Edison use its simulations for routine utility checks, which have become quite important in an era of increasingly severe weather events. The company just raised a $31 million Series C last week. The timing, according to CEO Jack Curtis, was a “no brainer.”This recent fundraise was led by global investment company EQT with additional funds from private equity companies Partners Group, Square Peg Capital and existing investors Skip Capital and Prosus Ventures. The funding will be used to expand its grid modeling and simulation capabilities to additional critical infrastructure verticals, like telecom and public transportation, and to further accelerate Neara’s expansion in the U.S. and Europe, as utilities worldwide continue to navigate resilience challenges from the global clean energy transition.Mitigating Grid Disasters Neara’s virtual grid network simulations include digital illustrations of a physical area, including hills, trees, and power lines, and uses AI to identify risks to grid function, like overgrown tree branches (a fire hazard), or electrical equipment too low to the ground (a flood risk). According to the company’s press release, it’s mapped “1.5 million square miles of electricity infrastructure and 12 million infrastructure assets.” In addition to preemptive risk identification, Neara’s AI-powered detection is particularly handy after natural disasters, which more small businesses are finding themselves at the center of. During an event like Hurricane Beryl, for example, one of the biggest pain points was not being able to communicate where power was out along the grid and when it was restored. Curtis says that’s why Houston-based energy company CenterPoint Energy formed its partnership with Neara in October this year—to solve that problem so it doesn’t happen again. “Being able to improve that communication with the consumer about the impact of these upstream events and how the electricity company thinks about it is super important,” he says. The Sydney-based company, which was named one of Fast Company’s most innovative companies of 2024, is also able to trace weather effects in near real-time and analyze additional risks. The Murray River in Australia flooded in 2022, for example, drenching 400 miles of powerline and nearly 4,000 power poles. The local utility provider SA Power Networks was monitoring the area with Neara and was able to keep power on longer or restore lost power more quickly as a result. Pitching ProblemsAs Neara leverages itself to more utilities, being able to provide transparency, visibility, and communication to consumers is its main selling point. “Every business, every consumer, is now existentially reliant on electricity,” he says. “In a pretty complex domain, you have to start with pretty digestible problem statements,” he says.For example, energy has never been more expensive, which both consumers and business owners are increasingly mindful of. The average American household utility bill rose nearly 8 percent in 2024 year over year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The monthly cost of electricity between June and September averaged $719 per household, about $200 more than a decade ago. “The reality that it is critical infrastructure delivering critical commodities to consumers has become more and more resonant with consumers,” he says, specifically due to extreme weather events that leave communities without power. “What we’re seeing now is a much greater downstream impact on consumers, how they think about interacting with energy.” Better managing energy infrastructure inevitably turns into a cost-benefit, which is another element he uses to educate investors and customers.Pitching to investors is also relatively straightforward, Curtis says. “We suffer from being pretty pathologically blunt and transparent. So we will say to people out of the gate, look, this is what we do. It’s not for everyone. It’s not, product-led growth flywheel, consumer SaaS,” he says. And if it doesn’t fit an investment, “let’s give everyone back 24 minutes.” Neara got plenty of practice forming this approach as it pitched to 70 funds this round.The emphasis of his selling point remains the same, and that is the impact on every kind of consumer. “I think that these problems are not just the problems of industry, they are everyday live problems now,” he says. “Increasing the communication around it, the understanding of how it can start to be done better, because it’s a long journey, I think that’s really the thing that we’re starting to focus a lot on.”",
