Listen to episodes here. How to Unlock Healthcare Access for Millions with Brian Whorley of PaytientAfter a career spent in the hospital setting, Brian Whorley witnessed firsthand the growing number of patients burdened by high deductibles. But Whorely understood that when people have better financial tools to afford care, they seek treatment sooner, leading to improved health outcomes, and in 2018, he co-founded Paytient, a company that empowers people to pay for care over time with no interest and no fees. Fast forward seven years, and Whorley’s vision is becoming a reality. Starting in 2025, every single Part D health plan in the U.S. will be required to offer plan members the option to spread their out-of-pocket pharmaceutical costs over time with interest-free monthly payments. Given this new regulation, Paytient is expected to help nearly 25 million Americans more easily access and afford care next year. Whorely shares why he believes founders are forged as children, how he built a business among a sea of skeptics, and why he thinks that healthcare entrepreneurs have to partner with America’s existing health system stakeholders to implement the most impactful change.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
