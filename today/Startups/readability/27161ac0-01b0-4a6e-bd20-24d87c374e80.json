  "text": "I’ve been enjoying doing podcasts again on the Techstars Give First Podcast. When I went into hibernation two years ago, David carried the weight of the podcast and kept it going. But, … I’m back (for what it’s worth), at least for a little while until I turn into a pumpkin.I had a delightful conversation with Seth Godin. We’ve been friends for 30 years through an initial connection from Charley Lax as part of a diligence project that introduced me to Jerry Colonna and Fred Wilson around an investment that Jerry, Fred, and SoftBank subsequently made in Seth’s company, Yoyodyne (which was acquired a few years later by Yahoo!)While we start with some history, we delve into deeper topics, which is the delicious part of being friends with Seth.I picked up a new phrase from this discussion: “Immediate Yes.” Historically, I’ve used the concepts of “Default Yes” and “Default No” to define modalities I’m in. For example, today I’m in Default Yes; when I was in hibernation, I was Default No.Seth introduced the concept of “Immediate Yes,” which overrides the Default Yes/No setting and applies to a small number of people within one’s relationship hierarchy. I’m one of those people for Seth (and he’s one for me). When I think of my list, it’s less than 20 people. But these are people I know will be careful when they ask me for something, so when they do, it’s an immediate yes. I’ve got more thinking to do on what that means and how I apply it, but it was a fun new idea to consider.More fun stuff is coming – Adam Grant is up next on the Give First Podcast, which you can subscribe to at the following links:Techstars Podcast WebsiteSpotify Apple PodcastYouTube",
