  "text": "The Kansas City Chiefs had a disappointing evening on Monday when their undefeated streak this season finally came to an end. The Buffalo Bills beat the Chiefs 30-21. The Chiefs are now 9-1 on the season, with the Bills just behind them at 9-2.As always, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce reviewed the game with his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce on New Heights, the podcast they co-host. Travis Kelce, of course, may be best known for his romantic relationship with Taylor Swift, and his growing career in entertainment. But his analysis of the game was all business. And it’s a lesson for any leader or entrepreneur in how a failure can set you up for later success.Kelce began by praising the Bills for the great team that they are, and acknowledging that they had outplayed the Chiefs. “They were fundamentally more sound in a lot of different areas,” he said. He went on to say that the end of the Chiefs’ undefeated streak was no big deal in itself. Head coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes had made similar comments in their press conferences. After all, the team has a bigger long-term goal: to be the first ever to win the Super Bowl three years in a row, or “three-peat.” Instead, Kelce saw the loss to the Bills as an opportunity for the Chiefs to improve their own game. Neither the Chiefs nor he himself had played their best, he said. “You know, a lot of this…it’s very fixable,” he said. “And I got all the faith in the world in this team.”It’s very fixable. As a leader, there’s almost nothing better you can say to your team, or to yourself, after a disheartening setback. Things went wrong, perhaps you or they didn’t perform as you might have wished. But there are things you can do to fix it so that next time will be better. And I got all the faith in the world in this team. You know your team can triumph, and you’re making sure they know it too.A blocked field goal against the BroncosAlthough the Chiefs won all their games this season up until they played the Bills, they were not clearly dominant in all those games. In particular, last week’s game against the Denver Broncos looked very much like it would be the Chiefs’ first loss of the season when the Broncos kicked what should have been a game-winning field goal from the 35-yard line in the last second of play. It took an improbable field goal block from Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal to save that win.And so, Kelce said, it may well be that the loss to the Bills was just what the team needed. “Sometimes I need that smack in the face to lock in and know that this is an ‘Any given Sunday’ type league,” he said. That phrase is a reference to former NFL commissioner Bert Bell, who once observed, “On any given Sunday, any team can beat any other team.”That may be the best way to recover from a failure. See it as a necessary reminder that success is never guaranteed. Take the opportunity to look at what your team did wrong and how you can do it better. And then head back out there with all the confidence in the world.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
