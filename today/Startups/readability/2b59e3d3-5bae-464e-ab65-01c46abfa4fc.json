  "text": "Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference (GTC) takes place in San Jose next week, not terribly far from San Franciso concurrently hosting the Game Developer’s Conference in the heart of the city. Despite geographic proximity, the subject matter of both conferences will likely be a world apart, as Nvidia CEO Jen Huang seems to be aiming for less of a talk about what Nvidia will do for gaming and more what it will do for AI. In Nvidia’s GTC session catalog, the keynote is described succinctly: “Don’t miss this keynote from NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang. He’ll share how NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform is driving the next wave in AI, digital twins, cloud technologies, and sustainable computing.” With the recent launch of the 5090, it makes sense that Nvidia would be somewhat mum about new graphics capabilities for the latest games. At this point, improvements are likely to err more toward an incrementalist game of inches than a massive revolution every few years. But it does indicate that Nvidia is aware which audience is buttering their bread right now and is aiming their focus toward that. Moreover, Nvidia and Huang likely feel they desperately need to win back the faith of the AI market. The picture of AI has changed dramatically since DeepSeek was revealed a few months ago, making Nvidia’s argument of being the best requiring expensive hardware straight from the source feel a bit shaky and that feeling was born out by the stock market. Nvidia is going into GTC looking for a win and it is more likely to get that from AI enthusiasts and investors than gamers. This is not to say the company will not have any new information about how to get the best graphics out of all of 2025 and beyond’s shiny new titles, but the core focus lies elsewhere for the keynote at least.
