  "text": "I’ve got a business story to tell. At least I think it’s a business story. It’s about missteps, quick steps, chickens, and cheesecakes. It’s about Peloton, product, passion, and people. About a year ago, I jumped into the fray at Kernel Foods. By then, the company had spent two years crafting an automation-centric restaurant concept. One location had been open for about six months, serving an exclusively vegan menu in a Jetson’s-meets-automat-feeling space in lower Manhattan. A second restaurant was under construction and the location for a third had been identified.It was an exciting juncture point for the company and for me. But in many ways, we were getting ahead of ourselves. So when I joined, instead of maturing the team and technology, and scaling the operation, my job was actually all about getting back to basics and putting first things first. One year in, here’s what that looks like: First Things FirstUser experience is a term that gets bandied about in various industries. Indeed, I’m a big bandier of the term myself—and with good reason; obsessing over user experience is the right obsession for any product-centric business, including Peloton and Kernel. At Peloton I defined the user experience as the ‘product’ we were selling. In the early days of Peloton, the primary user experience was the act of clipping into our sleek bike to take a class and become immersed in the music, instruction, and rhythmic cadence of the ride. But we quickly broadened our focus to every aspect of the end-to-end experience: from the simplicity of the buy-flow to the quality of delivery, to that first ride—and from one ride to the next—including the planning and celebratory steps in between. We did all this long before we knew how we would scale the operation—when putting first things first, you have to nail the product before you can even think about scaling it.For Kernel, much of the early innovation and obsession centered around operational efficiencies that might eventually have value for scaled restaurants. This manifested in a manufacturing line-style system designed to toast buns on demand, load and unload an oven repeatedly, and dispense salads to weight. However, all this technology was developed before the user experience was crafted or tested with real customers. Worse, it was designed around rigid parameters that limited what Kernel’s chefs could do, instead of enhancing their capabilities.To help Kernel’s early restaurants take off—and eventually solve the real challenges of scaling—we had to first create an exceptional user experience: one that would draw people in, deliver delicious food quickly, and leave them craving more. Operational efficiencies would have to come later. So, we pivoted our team and plan. Here’s a no-shit statement: We’re running a restaurant—nothing is more important than the food.That means obsessing over every detail: the appeal of the menu, the quality of our ingredients, how the food is made, how consistently it’s crafted, how easy it is to buy, how fast it’s prepared, and ultimately, the value and satisfaction every customer feels with each bite.Six months into helping run Kernel, we realized the original concept missed the mark in terms of user experience. Steve Ells, who poured his own time and money into Kernel to launch it, was confident enough to recognize what was and wasn’t working—and to pivot. We made the decision to close the two restaurants, made a wholesale change to our staff, and put the third restaurant on hold. We also eliminated the automation from the restaurants, elevated our culinary team, and refocused on the basics of food and service. Our goal was to prioritize quality and create a user experience centered around the food we genuinely loved, in a store environment that reflected our team’s true essence.Product Is Brand Is CultureI’ve seen companies try to fabricate a brand identity on paper—often before they have the foundation of a product. But a brand isn’t something you can create in isolation.A brand is the experience around your product. Your culture is the magic that fuels both. These are deeply interrelated, with a clear, perceptible thread connecting product, brand, and culture—a thread that ultimately reaches the customer.At Peloton, we set out to build an exceptional product—and a team deeply invested in one another and in the purposeful way we served our customers. The brand and company culture grew from that foundation, propelling a tiny startup into the public markets and creating a beloved brand along the way.From day one through IPO, we were building something we all wanted to use ourselves. And we were fueled by stories of real people finding powerful physical and emotional value in the experience we had a hand in creating.That passion—alive in the culture and in how we operated—showed up everywhere: in a hightouch, service-first delivery experience, in personal-feeling connections with instructors, and in IRL events that brought the virtual community into real life.In later years, as new management brought more corporate rigidity and less product passion, the culture shifted—and so did the brand, and the way customers experienced the product. Corporate technocrats aren’t naturally inspiring leaders. And when inspiration fades, culture weakens—and the products and services you ship start to feel that way too.The food we serve at Counter Service is the food our chefs (and the rest of the team) genuinely love to eat. At the core of the Kernel team culture is a love of real, fresh, quality food and time-honored culinary techniques. Wrapped around that core is a belief that efficient processes can elevate fast food to a much higher level. This is rooted in the art of ‘mise en place’—the French culinary practice of preparing and organizing a kitchen in advance, so that excellence can happen at speed.In short: our Kernel pivot was culture-driven. A shared internal passion for next-level food helped the company recognize where it had drifted off-course—and guided the team toward a winning pivot, which in turn gave birth to a new and much more genuine product—our restaurant, which we call Counter Service.Operating Counter Service in New York for just one quarter of 2025 (with limited hours and pickup and delivery-only operations) has already generated as much revenue as all of Kernel’s restaurant operations across 2024 combined. So you could say it’s resonating with customers.  Our automation systems are now software tools behind the scenes that we iterate on quickly to empower our chefs, cooks, and prep teams—not constrain them.And most importantly, our team has a strong bond: jumping in to help when needed, and naturally recognizing when a project doesn’t align with our underlying philosophy.Full CircleWhen I first jumped into Kernel, I thought I was stepping into a story about automation, operations, and scale.It turns out, it was a story about people. About passion. About culture. About the product. At Counter Service, Chef Andrew Black and Chef Neil Stetz have unleashed their culinary passions and built a menu that has the (fortunate) problem of creating operational challenges thanks to unrelenting sales volume. We whole-roast chickens and meticulously break them down into sandwiches because it’s better that way—even if it’s not easy.We bake the chefs’ favorite cheesecakes and cookies fresh every morning — even though we’re a sandwich shop, and daily baking will make scaling… interesting.But you can taste the love that went into every recipe.Meanwhile, our operations and engineering teams face real-world challenges daily—and those challenges are giving birth to unique industry solutions that could one day help restaurant operators everywhere.Getting the core right—putting first things first—allowed everything else to follow. That’s how you build something authentic, with staying power.We’ve still got a lot of work ahead. Statistically, failure is still in the cards. But when you build from a strong cultural core, you create great products. When you create great products, you build brands that feel real and earn loyalty.At Kernel, just like at Peloton, we’ve seen it firsthand: Product is Brand is Culture—and the customer feels every bit of it.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
