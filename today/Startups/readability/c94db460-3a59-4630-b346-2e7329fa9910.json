Here are 10 tips that can help optimize your pop-up event and impress your guests. Start with the “why” Nail down your main goal: Are you driving sales, building brand love, or launching something new? Keep that “why” front and center—it will shape every decision you make. And once you know the why, it’s also easier to communicate to your agency, your team, and any other stakeholders. Find the perfect spot Go for a high-energy location that your target audience frequents. Think foot traffic, think visibility, but also think unexpected. Surprise and delight are your friends here! And if you have other partners you can collaborate with for this pop-up, even better. Just make sure they have similar target market. Design an unforgettable experience Make every moment count. Use immersive elements like interactive displays and sensory experiences to pull people in and keep them there. Make it fun, make it engaging, make it memorable. Consider the attendee journey. What do you want them to experience during your event? If it’s a beauty event, a fun idea would be to have a charm station so they can design custom charms. Personalization activations go a long way. For a hotel opening we did, we had a custom key chain station. It was buzzing from the beginning to the end of the event. One time we even had a brand ambassador playing a guitar while attendees waited in the registration line. It was so fun that people almost wanted to stay in line longer. Another time, we passed out chocolate while folks were waiting in line. Surprise and delight can start early in the event experience. Maximize social buzz Start promoting early, and keep the hype train rolling. Use influencers, teaser campaigns, and live social content to build excitement. Create a branded hashtag and encourage sharing to get that organic reach. On the day of, make sure your hashtags are on various signages to further engage and encourage live social posting. Create FOMO (fear of missing out) Play up the limited-time-only vibe to create urgency. Whether it’s RSVP-only, exclusive discounts, or a “first 100 guests” offer, make sure people feel they need to be there. In the past, we have created a golden ticket moment as well, and we did it at the end of the event. It was super engaging and created a lot of FOMO. Capture those leads Collect attendee info for future outreach—emails, social handles, the works. Give them a reason to share (hello, giveaways or discounts!) and build your contact list. Leverage QR codes to make this easy for you and your team. Make it accessible and don’t make the lead capture page too long. The shorter the better, actually. Really think about what data you want to capture and why. Make it share-worthy YES, YES, YES! Design the event for social media gold. Think Insta-worthy backdrops, interactive installations, experiences and moments people can’t wait to share. Branded hashtags should be everywhere. Create moments that attendees will just naturally share because it’s so amazing. Recently I attended an awards event where the organizer partnered with one of their major alcohol brands. They engraved each the winner’s name on a mini size bottle. It was so different and unique of course I posted about it. At the same event, they had two step and repeat moments instead of just one which I thought was so clever, give attendees space to take lots of engaging photos with the event backdrop. The entire time I saw the step and repeat very busy. It was inside the event space rather than outside. The same concepts can be used for pop-up events. Stay nimble Expect the unexpected and be ready to pivot if needed. Pop-ups can be unpredictable, so keep a flexible mindset and have contingency plans ready for anything. This is especially true if you are doing a multicity campaign or involving outdoors. Have a backup plan. Bring the energy with your team Your staff and brand ambassadors are the face of the event. Make sure they’re trained, enthusiastic, and ready to engage every guest with genuine excitement and knowledge. Pump them up. We love it when the brand ambassador has something fun to wear: an apron, t-shirt, buttons, etc. Also the team just looks more cohesive as well. For night time events, consider light up items (for hair, rings, etc.). It definitely catches more attendee attention. Follow up like a pro Don’t let the momentum die. After the event, send a thank you note, a quick survey, or a special offer. Measure success with KPIs like foot traffic, social engagement, and most importantly, the leads and sales you captured. Remember, the magic of a pop-up is its ability to create a moment that people talk about long after the doors close. So go bold, be unforgettable, and make sure every second counts. When you focus on delivering an experience that excites, engages, and leaves people wanting more, you’ll turn a pop-up into a brand-defining moment. Utilize on site photos and videos to continue to create FOMO and conversations. Now, go out there and make some noise!",
