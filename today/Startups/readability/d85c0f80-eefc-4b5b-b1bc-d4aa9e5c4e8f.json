Now, one Dallas-based startup says it is preparing to unveil a sound that has probably been heard by humans before—but not for around 10,000 years or more. Colossal Biosciences plans to release the sound of a dire wolf howl as soon as later this year. Colossal co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm teased the release during a panel at SXSW London alongside Sophie Turner, who played Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones, the show that brought dire wolves into the collective imagination, TechCrunch reported.Colossal Biosciences made a name for itself in April when it announced the births of three wolf pups with dire-wolf DNA. The dire wolf was a canid that roamed parts of North and South America during the Pleistocene Epoch, but has been extinct for more than 10,000 years. In order to conduct this so-called de-extinction event, scientists at Colossal extracted DNA from a 13,000 year-old dire wolf tooth and a 72,000 year-old ear bone, and sequenced the genome. They then edited the genetic code of a dire wolf relative, the gray wolf, to reflect that, and used domesticated dogs as surrogates for birthing the dire wolf pups, Time reported.“We have two dire wolf specimens, the only dire wolf specimens that have ever produced viable DNA, and there’s 60,000 years of genetic divergence between them,” Lamm says, referring to the tooth and ear bone. There has been some controversy over whether Colossal’s dire wolves reflect an actual de-extinction event or genetically-modified gray wolves. But Lamm says it isn’t Colossal’s job “to persuade anyone,” but rather to “be transparent and educate people on what we did.”As for the howl, Lamm says the dire wolves sound distinctive from other wolf species, likely because they are “larger and they’ve got larger heads and larger, thicker necks.” Colossal has been monitoring the wolves since their birth, and has started to record acoustic patterns and compare them throughout different points in the wolves’ growth and to other wolf species.“To the common person, like a non-wolf expert, a lot of wolves sound the same,” Lamm says. “But when you look at them acoustically, they sound different.”Colossal is currently pursuing two bioacoustics projects through its Colossal Foundation, the conservation-focused nonprofit arm of the business. One of them is focused on using AI and machine learning to learn more about wolves, track them, and even differentiate among individuals in packs. It is with that technology that Colossal has been monitoring the dire wolves. Although early videos of the wolf puppies yelping and howling racked up hundreds of thousands of likes on various social media platforms, Lamm says he was still surprised how excited people got when he teased releasing the sounds of the more mature wolves.“We’re going to try to track it for a couple more months and just see like if the reverberations or anything change in the next few months, but if it stays consistent at their current age and scale, then we’re gonna release it, because that can be kind of cool,” he says.Alongside the dire wolf de-extinction project, Colossal successfully cloned four critically endangered red wolves in order to help preserve the species. The company also birthed “woolly mice” as part of the validation process for de-extinction of woolly mammoths, and has its sights set on de-extinction of the mysterious dodo.Colossal Biosciences closed a $200 million series C round of funding in January that valued the roughly 4-year-old company at a colossal $10.2 billion.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, June 27, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
