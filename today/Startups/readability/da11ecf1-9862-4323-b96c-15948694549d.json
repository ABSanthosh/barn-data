  "text": "Passes, the creator startup launched by Scale AI co-founder Lucy Guo, has been accused in a class action lawsuit of distributing child pornography.  The suit, filed last month in federal court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges that the company, Guo, and two other defendants knowingly disseminated and sought to profit from the distribution of pornographic content of minors on the Passes platform.  “This lawsuit is a misguided attempt to defame our company for monetary gain, and any suggestion that Passes’ conduct was wrong or improper is false,” a Passes spokesperson told Inc.  As a platform for creators to share content directly with fans for a subscription, Passes is part of the burgeoning influencer industry, which has been the focus of venture capital activity in recent months. Passes raised $40 million in Series A funding last February, led by Bond Capital, and has sought to capitalize off the changing landscape of name, image, and likeness rules surrounding college athletes, signing a partnership with the University of Michigan in November.  In the complaint, it’s alleged that Passes “expressly marketed to and allowed for Creators between 15 to 17 years old to join,” and names OnlyFans model Alice Rosenblum as the lead plaintiff. Rosenblum was 17 years old during the time specified by the suit, which was filed jointly by the law firms Clark Smith Villazor and Schwartz Breslin.  The civil complaint seeks a jury trial, undetermined damages, and injunctive relief for a plaintiff class of undisclosed size. “Passes has at least 1,000 creators and allowed minors between 15 and 17 years old to join as Creators between April 27, 2022, and February 24, 2025, establishing the numerosity requirement,” the complaint says.  The two additional defendants are Alec Celestin, a 27-year-old self-described angel investor, tech CEO, and DJ, and Lani Ginoza, a former director of talent at Passes, who previously reported directly to Guo while at the company, the suit maintains.  Celestin and Ginoza are accused of encouraging Rosenblum to upload sexually explicit content of herself to a part of the Passes platform used for data storage called “The Vault.” Both Celestin and Ginoza marketed and sold the explicit content on Passes’ internal messaging system to subscribers known as “big spenders” and “whales,” the suit alleges. Nofhotos, a company run by Celestin, also “marketed and distributed child pornography through the Passes direct messaging system and platform,” the suit alleges. Ginoza has also served as Celestin’s assistant at Nofhotos.  The complaint asserts that both Celestin and Ginoza were “agents” of Passes, and alleges that Guo understood Rosenblum was underage and enabled the duo’s actions, saying: “Between July 2024 and September 2024, Guo personally intervened to override Passes’ strict internal safety controls tailored for creators of social media content aged between 15 and 17 years old to strip and deprive Plaintiff of any protections offered by Passes against the exploitation of a minor.” In order for a minor to become a creator for Passes, various forms of parental consent and verification are required, such as a video conference and proof of parental identification. “As a brand-friendly platform, Passes maintains best-in-class safety and privacy standards, and we have strict policies against the exact type of alleged content included in this complaint,” a Passes spokesperson told Inc. “There is no record or recollection of Lucy Guo ever interacting with the plaintiff. There is no evidence in the complaint that links Passes or our founder to this prohibited activity. Passes does not allow nudity whatsoever,” the spokesperson continued.  Prior to launching Passes, Guo co-founded Scale AI, a $14 billion company that helps clients such as OpenAI and the Department of Defense train AI programs with contract labor. Guo left Scale in 2018 and has since become a well-known figure in the creator economy and in Miami nightlife. She was named among Forbes’s richest self-made women in 2023 with a reported net worth of $360 million. She founded the Miami-based Passes in 2022.  The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
