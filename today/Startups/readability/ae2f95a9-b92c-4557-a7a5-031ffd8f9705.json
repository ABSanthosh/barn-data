  "text": "The Small Business Administration is no longer allowing new lenders into its Community Advantage loan program and will up the ante for existing lenders by requiring them to expand their capital reserves. The agency on Monday said it was overhauling the CA Small Business Lending Company program, an initiative designed to expand access to capital for those in underserved areas by working with mission-driven lenders. The program focuses on new companies in addition to women-owned small businesses, minority-owned small businesses, and veteran-owned small businesses. But the CA program’s loan portfolio is “disproportionately stressed,” the SBA said, pointing to the combination of a seven percent default rate over the last year; a number of these lenders are seeing early problem loan rates exceed 30 percent. “Community Advantage is a perfect example of how the last Administration weaponized government programs to tip the scale against deserving small businesses and toward preferred groups and political allies, even when it meant greater risk to American taxpayers,” SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler said in a press release, later claiming that the last administration was “selectively certifying groups” like the Progress Fund and the Black Business Investment Fund. The SBA in its Monday press release also took issue with the Biden administration’s attempt to back climate-focused projects. In response, the Progress Fund said in a release posted onto its webpage: “Disappointingly, [the SBA’s] statements about us were false, and rather than praise us for the small business lending we do throughout rural Pennsylvania and West Virginia, they named us as a target for the Administration’s distain of lenders supporting environmental projects undertaken by small business owners.” The CA loan program was first introduced in 2011 as a pilot with just five lenders. But over the years, the program was renewed as it slowly expanded its footprint. Between fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2023, the program underwrote 8,248 loans totaling $1.1 billion, data from the Federal Register shows. The Trump Administration issued a moratorium on approving new CA lending licenses in 2018, citing the increasing risks. Both fiscal 2018 and 2019 also happen to be the two years the program had the highest number of lender participation with 75 CA lenders issuing loans during both years. (The data covers fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2023.) By 2023, the program dramatically expanded when the SBA, led by then-Administrator Isabel Guzman, approved 143 new lenders to boost access to capital. Boost it did: by fiscal 2024, the program issued $196 million worth of government-backed capital, up 40 percent compared to the prior fiscal year. As the program expanded, it wasn’t a surprise that defaults would increase in a program serving higher-risk borrowers, given that mission-based lenders typically assume greater volumes of risk. But a seven percent default rate is high when compared with the program’s past performance. For perspective, quarterly default rates from March 2013 to March 2018 for CA loans hovered at around two percent, from the smaller pool of lenders. Monday’s announcement is the latest move from the current administration’s decision to roll back Biden-era underwriting policies. Doing so will surely tighten a capital environment that’s already faced considerable strain. The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
