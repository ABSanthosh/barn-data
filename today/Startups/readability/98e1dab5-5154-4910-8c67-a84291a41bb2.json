EO asked Bensonoff to share how real estate investors might pivot in the face of climate change. In 2024, natural disasters occurred nationwide. Hurricanes ripped through North Carolina and Florida. Violent storms hit the central and southern regions. Devastating wildfires ravaged California and relentless floods swept through Kentucky in 2025. Natural disasters have left a lasting mark on the real estate market, with billions of dollars in damages and thousands of homes lost. Communities now face a long, difficult rebuilding phase. The uncertainty has created ripple effects across the housing market. Homeowners, renters, and investors alike face rising insurance costs, evolving regulations, and shifting property values. As a real estate professional, I’ve noticed a shift in how properties are moving in California, with the fires impacting this. According to Realtor.com, homes are now staying on the market for up to 46 days—the same as in 2023. While demand is still outpacing supply, driving short-term price increases, certain areas are seeing values decline overall. This is because of the heightened wildfire risk. The challenge isn’t just about buying and selling properties anymore. Instead, it’s about adapting to a new reality shaped by climate change. It’s also paramount to respect the thousands of people whose lives and properties have been dramatically altered.  With the ongoing threat of natural disasters, real estate investors must learn strategies to future-proof their investments against climate change.  Navigating real estate in a changing climate According to Realtor.com, close to 50 percent of all homes in the U.S. could face extreme environmental risks. In high-risk areas, real estate values tend to decline as insurance premiums rise. With weather-related disasters becoming more common, insurance rates in some parts of the country increased by as much as 34 percent in 2024, which may not bode well for home values in these areas.  Follow eight key strategies for mitigating climate risks moving forward. With Mother Nature forcing climate change to the forefront of our minds, what’s next for real estate? Diversify your portfolio. This is often the key to dealing with increased risk. It’s a good idea to purchase properties in lower-risk areas as an addition to your portfolio to balance your risk. Target long-term growth markets. Focus on areas with strong long-term growth potential. These are likely to experience higher property appreciation over time and help offset potential losses in higher-risk locations. Assess municipal financial health. Before committing to an investment, closely evaluate the financial health of municipalities and potential infrastructure investments in each area you’re considering.  Invest in sustainable communities. Invest in areas that strongly support sustainable development with solid community ties. This is a good way to ensure that residents aren’t being priced out through gentrification, which means that properties you may invest in won’t be overpriced.  Explore creative financing methods. Alternative financing options, like private lenders, may be a good solution for those who can’t qualify for bank loans when investing in certain areas.  Use rebuilding as an opportunity. If you have properties within your portfolio that must be rebuilt due to damages, use the opportunity to integrate modern amenities and eco-friendly systems to improve long-term value.  Incorporate climate risk assessments. Utilize available tools to analyze climate risks as part of your due diligence process before purchasing new properties.  Prioritize government-backed recovery zones. If you’re investing in real estate in an area that’s being rebuilt, focus on regions where the government is actively supporting recovery efforts and where there’s clear potential for long-term growth. Rising investor interest in green-certified and climate-resilient properties. The recent wildfires, hurricanes, floods, and mudslides further highlight the importance of sustainability and resilience in the real estate industry. Thanks to these shifts brought on by climate change, investor preferences are swiftly moving toward green-certified properties and climate-adaptive strategies. The key features of these properties include energy efficiency, water conservation, eco-friendly materials, and innovative waste solutions.  Along with this, climate-adaptive features are becoming a critical consideration. Fire-resistant materials are now at the forefront, and there is growing interest in flood-resilient landscaping, including elevated foundations. Wind-resistant construction is also used to help homeowners and investors enhance the long-term value of properties by effectively adapting to climate change. As the demand for sustainable living and government incentives continues to rise, the investment landscape is full of potential. By investing in green real estate, we not only contribute to responsible environmental practices but also support the long-term well-being of those affected by climate-related disasters. These investments offer opportunities to reduce operating costs, benefit from tax incentives, and meet the increasing demand for sustainable housing—all while keeping in mind the importance of rebuilding stronger, more secure communities for the future.  The final word. After so many natural disasters, it has become clear that adaptive real estate investments that support future resilience are essential. Sustainability and climate change must be at the helm. Investors who prioritize green-certified and climate-friendly properties can safeguard their portfolios, reduce risk, and create long-term value. To stay ahead of a rapidly changing climate, we encourage real estate investors to take proactive steps towards future-proofing their portfolios by considering not just short-term gains but also long-term sustainability.  A more responsible real estate world awaits; are you going to be part of it?   The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
