And although manufacturers are well aware of concrete’s sizable environmental footprint, because of its strength and durability, it remains the world’s most widely used building material. Now, using a unique design, VAULTED produces strong floor structures with a fraction of the concrete – and carbon footprint. The Swiss startup, which was spun out of ETH Zurich in 2023, leverages over 10 years of research conducted by the university’s Block Research Group. Inspired by the vaulted ceilings of old Gothic architecture, the team creates bespoke prefabricated flooring structures that are carefully designed to use the least amount of concrete possible, without compromising on strength and load-bearing ability. The technology is called the Rippmann Floor System (RFS), and rather than using flat slabs of reinforced concrete and steel to create a stable floor, it relies on curved shells that naturally follow where compression forces want to be, absorb tension, and distribute loads across the floor. This innovative design means materials are only used exactly where needed, resulting in 70 per cent less concrete and 80 per cent less steel being required. VAULTED’s floors are made up of individual RFS plates, which are easily assembled on-site without the need for additional glue or connectors. This means they can also be easily disassembled and reused elsewhere. According to the company, RFS has 80 per cent less embodied carbon than traditional reinforced concrete flat slabs.
