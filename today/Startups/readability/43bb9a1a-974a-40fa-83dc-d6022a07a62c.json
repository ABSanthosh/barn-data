  "text": "The American Express Platinum card is a fairly common thing to find in a founder’s wallet. The card’s benefits and experiences have made it a preferred payment method for many in the startup world. Now American Express is making some changes to both its consumer and business platinum cards later this year.It’s the first major update to the card since 2021, and American Express says it’s the largest refresh in the card’s history. All of the details aren’t yet fully available, but here’s what you need to know right now about the new Amex Platinum.More flexibility in business spending limitsAmex says it plans to offer more benefits to business card holders that will help their companies grow. Among them is the ability to use a virtual card for vendor-specific or one-time purchases, eliminating the chances of the number being stolen by bad actors. Business platinum card holders also have access to a flexible spending limit that adapts based on purchase, payment, and credit history.Statement credits for business purchasesBusiness platinum card members are now able to unlock over $2,000 in statement credits and the company has added Dell and Adobe to its partner list. Cardholders will be eligible for a $250 statement credit once per calendar year after they’ve made $600 in purchases at Adobe. Members will also receive up to $150 in statement credits for eligible purchases with Dell Technologies, as well as an additional $1,000 statement credit after $5,000 in purchases are charged.That’s in addition to the existing credits with Amex partners like Hilton (which offers a $200 credit) and Clear (which offers up to $209 in statement credits per calendar year).More airport lounge accessMembers will have access to more than 1,550 airport lounges worldwide (in more than 500 airports). They also have access to the American Express-operated Centurion Lounges, which will number 32 next year, with new locations opening in Newark, New Jersey; Salt Lake City; and Tokyo.The cards are getting a physical refresh—and a price increaseThe days of paying $595 for an Amex platinum business card are over. You’ll have to shell out $695 moving forward.The card might have more heft, though. American Express said it was changing how the Platinum Card “looks and feels,” suggesting a physical redesign is in the works. That could appeal to Gen-Z.Additional options to support workersCard members can request an Employee Business Platinum Card, which comes with a notably lower $350 annual fee. Benefits on that card included access to the Centurion Lounges, 10 visits to a Delta Sky Club lounge, and gold status with Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors. Platinum members can also get an Employee Business Expense Card for staff members, which has no annual fee but limited benefits.Amex is making a big push to get new customersRaising the annual fee by 17 percent makes getting a business platinum card a harder choice for some business owners, so Amex is pulling out the stops to woo them. In addition to the new benefits, the company is currently offering 200,000 membership rewards points if new members spend $20,000 in the first three months of their membership. That’s about $2,000 in value.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
