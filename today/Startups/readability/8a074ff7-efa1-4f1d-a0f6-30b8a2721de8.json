  "text": "Some of the world’s most popular apps are likely being co-opted by rogue members of the advertising industry to harvest sensitive location data on a massive scale, with that data ending up with a location data company whose subsidiary has previously sold global location data to US law enforcement.The thousands of apps, included in hacked files from location data company Gravy Analytics, include everything from games like Candy Crush and dating apps like Tinder to pregnancy tracking and religious prayer apps across both Android and iOS. Because much of the collection is occurring through the advertising ecosystem—not code developed by the app creators themselves—this data collection is likely happening without users’ or even app developers’ knowledge.“For the first time publicly, we seem to have proof that one of the largest data brokers selling to both commercial and government clients appears to be acquiring their data from the online advertising ‘bid stream,’” rather than code embedded into the apps themselves, Zach Edwards, senior threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Silent Push and who has followed the location data industry closely, tells 404 Media after reviewing some of the data.The data provides a rare glimpse inside the world of real-time bidding (RTB). Historically, location data firms paid app developers to include bundles of code that collected the location data of their users. Many companies have turned instead to sourcing location information through the advertising ecosystem, where companies bid to place ads inside apps. But a side effect is that data brokers can listen in on that process and harvest the location of peoples’ mobile phones.“This is a nightmare scenario for privacy, because not only does this data breach contain data scraped from the RTB systems, but there's some company out there acting like a global honey badger, doing whatever it pleases with every piece of data that comes its way,” Edwards says.Included in the hacked Gravy data are tens of millions of mobile phone coordinates of devices inside the US, Russia, and Europe. Some of those files also reference an app next to each piece of location data. 404 Media extracted the app names and built a list of mentioned apps.The list includes dating sites Tinder and Grindr; massive games such as Candy Crush, Temple Run, Subway Surfers, and Harry Potter: Puzzles \u0026 Spells; transit app Moovit; My Period Calendar \u0026 Tracker, a period-tracking app with more than 10 million downloads; popular fitness app MyFitnessPal; social network Tumblr; Yahoo’s email client; Microsoft’s 365 office app; and flight tracker Flightradar24. The list also mentions multiple religious-focused apps such as Muslim prayer and Christian Bible apps, various pregnancy trackers, and many VPN apps, which some users may download, ironically, in an attempt to protect their privacy.The full list can be found here. Multiple security researchers have published other lists of apps included in the data, of varying sizes. Our version is relatively larger because it includes both Android and iOS apps, and we decided to keep duplicate instances of the same app that had slight name variations to make it easier for readers to search for apps they have installed.Although this dataset came from an apparent hack of Gravy, it is not clear whether Gravy collected this location data itself or sourced it from another company, or which location company ultimately owns it or is licensed to use it.Much of the location data attached to these app names does not have a time stamp. But there are indications it dates from 2024. One of the apps listed is Call of Duty: Mobile, and specifically its Season 5 iteration, which launched in May 2024.Gravy is a company that powers much of the rest of the location data industry. It collates mobile phone location data from various sources, then sells that to commercial companies or, through its subsidiary Venntel, to US government agencies. Norwegian outlet NRK and I previously revealed the flow of location data from a handful of ordinary apps to Gravy and then to Venntel. Venntel’s clients have included Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, the IRS, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration.Venntel has also provided the underlying data for another government-bought surveillance tool called Locate X. 404 Media and a group of other outlets showed last year how that tool, made by a company called Babel Street, could be used to monitor visitors to out-of-state abortion clinics.But the newly hacked data shows for the first time just how many apps could be part of a location data supply chain, even if their developers are not aware of it. Most app developers and companies included in the list did not respond to a request for comment. Flightradar24 said in an email that it had never heard of Gravy, but that it does display ads, which “help keep Flightradar24 free.”Tinder said in an email that “Tinder takes safety and security very seriously. We have no relationship with Gravy Analytics and have no evidence that this data was obtained from the Tinder app” but did not answer questions about ads inside the app.Muslim Pro, one of the Muslim prayer apps included in the list, said in an email that it was not aware of Gravy. “Yes, we display ads through several ad networks to support the free version of the app. However, as mentioned above, we do not authorize these networks to collect location data of our users,” the email said. That does not necessarily mean that a member of the advertising ecosystem can’t extract such data, though. (In 2020 I revealed Muslim Pro was selling its users’ location data to a company called X-Mode, whose clients included US military contractors; Muslim Pro stopped the practice after my reporting.)A Grindr spokesperson told 404 Media in an email that “Grindr has never worked with or provided data to Gravy Analytics. We do not share data with data aggregators or brokers and have not shared geolocation with ad partners for many years. Transparency is at the core of our privacy program, therefore the third parties and service providers we work with are listed here on our website.” Grindr was previously found to have allowed data brokers to obtain its users’ location data.It’s important that the data appears to be sourced through real-time bidding, because that dictates who is responsible (rogue members of the advertising industry and the tech giants that facilitate that industry), how users can protect themselves (attempting to block ads), and the fact that massive app publishers may not even be aware their users’ data is being harvested and therefore might not know how to stop it. An app developer will know if it implemented location-data-gathering code itself. It might not know that some company, somewhere, is silently listening in on the advertising process and siphoning data from their app.Surveillance firms can obtain RTB data by acquiring ad tech companies and posing as prospective advertisers. The spy-run location data company doesn’t need to successfully place an ad; instead, it is able to gather data on devices by simply being plugged into that industry. Location data in this case can also include a users’ IP address, which is then geolocated to give their coarse location.Last January, 404 Media reported on an Israeli surveillance company called Patternz, which was sourcing masses of location data through the RTB process.In an exposed training video, Patternz showed some of the popular apps it got location data from: 9GAG, Kik, sports app FUTBIN, caller ID apps such as CallApp and Truecaller; and various word, sudoku, and solitaire puzzle games. Every one of these apps are also in the Gravy data. This suggests that Gravy, or wherever Gravy got that data from, also sourced it from interacting with the advertising system rather than location-tracking code baked into the apps.404 Media shared some of the location data with another security researcher with knowledge of the advertising and location data industries. “It appears that at least some of this data would likely have been sourced from advertising related, real-time bidding,” Krzysztof Franaszek, founder of Adalytics, a digital forensics firm, told 404 Media after reviewing the data. He pointed out some of the user-agents in the file, which show how a user’s device connected to a service, referenced “afma-sdk.” That is a string used by Google’s Mobile Ads SDK (software development kit). In other words, in some cases, it is Google’s advertising platform that is delivering the ads that are eventually leading to this tracking by outside companies and potentially government contractors.Google did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. Neither did Apple.Franaszek also says that “a significant amount of this geolocation dataset appears to be inferred by IP address to geolocation lookups, meaning the vendor or their source is deriving the user's geolocation by checking their IP address rather than by using GNSS [Global Navigation Satellite System]/GPS data. That would suggest that the data is not being sourced entirely from a location data SDK.”“What we’re seeing here in this data appears to me to be a huge diversity of apps,” Edwards says. “That’s not what you see from an SDK ingestion; that’s what you see from bulk RTB ingestions.”In December the Federal Trade Commission banned another location data company called Mobilewalla from collecting consumer data “from online advertising auctions for purposes other than participating in those auctions.” In other words, the agency banned Mobilewalla from participating in the RTB process for building datasets on peoples’ devices. The FTC also said Venntel and Gravy collected data without obtaining user consent, ordered the company to delete historical location data, and banned it from selling data related to sensitive areas like health clinics and places of worship, except in “limited circumstances” involving national security or law enforcement.404 Media has verified the hacked Gravy data in various ways. Some files include credentials for Gravy’s Snowflake instances, a data warehousing tool. 404 Media checked that the URLs in the hacked files do correspond to real Snowflake instances. One file called “users” contains a long list of companies. Some of these firms denied having any relationship with Gravy; Cuebiq, another location data firm mentioned in the file, told 404 Media it “routinely evaluates available data in the market to determine if they are an appropriate fit for our business. Most do not make it past the evaluation stage to production, as was the case here. Cuebiq tested a limited data sample, which was never made available to our customers, and the data was deleted at the end of the limited trial.”404 Media also sent a section of the data to another data broker called Datonics. “We investigated the matter described in your email, and the segment IDs in those files are those of Gravy, not Datonics,” the company said in an email.Unacast, which merged with Gravy in 2023, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, both on the hack and whether it or any of its suppliers have derived location data from the real-time bidding process.",

He pointed out some of the user-agents in the file, which show how a user’s device connected to a service, referenced “afma-sdk.” That is a string \u003ca href=\"https://ads-developers.googleblog.com/2022/07/use-new-google-mobile-ads-sdk.html\"\u003eused by Google’s Mobile Ads SDK\u003c/a\u003e (software development kit).

Some of these firms denied having any relationship with Gravy; Cuebiq, another location data firm mentioned in the file, told 404 Media it “routinely evaluates available data in the market to determine if they are an appropriate fit for our business.
