  "text": "Companies today are almost universally interested in building and sustaining a strong culture. And for good reasons. A healthy company culture can help organizations build a strong employer brand, attract and retain top talent, reduce turnover, and sustain employee engagement—all of which leads to good connections with employees, stakeholders, and feeding the bottom line. A solid organizational culture can also help boost cybersecurity efforts. Cybersecurity breaches are increasing, causing financial losses, productivity declines, negative brand impact, and potential loss of customer trust. Cybersecurity: Technology versus people Organizations and their IT leaders focus a lot of their cybersecurity efforts on technology. Certainly, technical solutions are invaluable for protecting against cyberthreats. But technology solutions alone aren’t enough. People—in this case, employees—need to be added to the arsenal of tools to ward off cybercriminals and cyberattacks. We refer to this as human risk management, the human layer of defense. Without a human firewall, no matter how much you’ve invested in technological solutions or how advanced they are, organizations will be susceptible to data breaches and the business disruption they can cause. A typical phishing email, now powered by AI and error-free, contains links that lead to spoofed login or password reset pages designed to harvest user credentials. Signs your culture is in decline How do you know if your culture is in decline, poised to erode or degrade cybersecurity efforts? A poor work culture has the potential to produce low morale, disgruntled customers, challenges in attracting top talent, high turnover, and low engagement and productivity. A weak culture is one where employees spend a lot of time grumbling, pointing fingers at each other, engaging in counterproductive behaviors ranging from absenteeism, to bullying, to the theft of company equipment or intellectual property—even reported cases of employees selling access to company resources to hackers. Fortunately, there are several things organizations can do to build and sustain a strong culture—a culture that will contribute to your cybersecurity efforts. How to promote a security-supportive culture By serving as examples, C-suite leaders play an influencing role in building and supporting a strong culture. Modeling behavior from the top-down sets the stage and provides a mentor-like example of the type of security behaviors and accountability you want to see reflected in employees. It’s critical for leaders to: 1. Focus on communication and transparency When employees trust their leaders, they’re more likely to be willing to report mistakes and security threats. Transparency can help to ensure awareness of threats and the reaction for a faster response to thwart those threats. Transparent communication is foundational to building a productive and trusting culture. 2. Prioritize security awareness Beyond communication and transparency, it’s important for organizations to train employees regularly and frequently. Security awareness training needs to be designed to ensure employees understand not only what they need to do to help support cybersecurity efforts, but also why they need to do so; why their role is so important, and how their efforts can contribute. 3. Offer behavioral incentives In addition to being clear about the role employees play and the importance of that role in supporting cybersecurity efforts, there are other ways to incentivize their participation and build understanding. Behavioral incentives (like recognition and rewards) can be very powerful for creating engagement and strengthening accountability. For instance, practicing and passing phishing tests and rewarding employees who identify phishing attempts. Or, recognizing employees who routinely change their passwords before being reminded to. 4. Have a blame-free attitude Avoid creating a culture of blame or reprisal. Employees are not likely to report security threats or raise awareness of potential risks if they fear punishment or if they will be held up as “bad examples.” Foster an environment where employees feel safe to come forward without fear of negative repercussions. Leaders can support this kind of environment by being honest about their own security challenges and mistakes. 5. Promote cybersecurity culture through continuous improvement What are your goals for your cybersecurity initiatives? How will you define success? Setting clear and measurable objectives can establish a foundation for monitoring and evaluating outcomes. While it is important to celebrate achievements, it is equally vital not to overly focus on negative outcomes or failures to meet goals; instead, consider ways to make improvements. An additional benefit of these efforts is that they not only promote a robust cybersecurity culture but also help strengthen the overall company culture. The two work hand in hand.
