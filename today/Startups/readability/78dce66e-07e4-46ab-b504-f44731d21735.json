He took his sister Doris on as a partner and purchased three shares for each of them for $114.75.Unfortunately, the market hit a low that June, and Cities Service Preferred plummeted from $38.25 to $27 a share, a fact that Buffett's sister \"reminded\" him of every day, Schroeder writes. So, when the stock had recovered enough to net a small profit — $5 a share — Buffett sold.Then, Cities Service Preferred skyrocketed to $202 a share.Related: Warren Buffett Finally Reveals What Mystery Company Got a $6.7 Billion Investment from Berkshire HathawayBuffett tells Schroeder the experience was one of the most important of his life because it taught him three lessons about investing:Don't \"overly fixate\" on what you've paid for a stock.Don't rush to sell for a small profit.Don't invest someone else's money unless you know you can succeed.The lesson has served Buffett, now 94, well over the years. In August, Berkshire Hathaway surpassed $1 trillion in market value for the first time.",
