And this pollution isn’t only created while a vehicle is in motion. Long-haul drivers, who need to use things like a truck’s air conditioning for several hours while stopped, often need to leave an engine idling overnight, burning diesel in the process. Now, Blackburn Energy has an alternative. Instead of replacing a fleet with fully electric trucks, which would be an extremely expensive process, Blackburn Energy has created a technology that can be installed in a matter of hours to improve a vehicle’s fuel efficiency and provide a source of clean power. When vehicles are running, a great deal of energy is wasted during braking, idling, or gliding. Blackburn Energy’s device, called RelGen, makes use of that wasted power. The tech harnesses the spinning force of a truck’s drive shaft as it moves. A belt transfers this kinetic energy to an alternator, converting it into electricity that’s stored for later use. This clean stored energy can power auxiliary systems in the truck, like air conditioning, refrigeration, and lift gates, instead of drivers needing to keep the engine running. This significantly lowers carbon emissions and fuel consumption, bringing substantial cost savings to fleet operators. According to the company, the RelGen can eliminate up to 17 tons of carbon dioxide per truck every year.
