  "text": "February 25, 2025 12:32 PM As part of today’s vast and far-reaching closures of Warner Bros. Games originally reported by Bloomberg, numerous studios have had to end their ongoing projects and close up shop. By shutting down Monolith Productions, the developers behind games like Shadow of Mordor and older classics like No One Lives Forever, the anticipated Wonder Woman title in development at the studio has been reportedly canceled. Originally announced at The Game Awards 2021, the title has never been seen since, only emerging in the form of rumors and scuttlebutt indicating troubled development. According to WB’s own upload of the teaser trailer, the game was expected to implement the Nemesis System just like the previous two Mordor games. It is unlikely it will ever be publicly seen what kind of milestones the game hit before the studio was unceremoniously shuttered. It is possible that this canceled title will be the last vestige of said system, as Warner Bros. successfully applied for a patent for the mechanics of it in 2021 after six years of revisions. Assuming the company continues paying the associated fees despite Monolith Productions’ apparent closure, no other developer can freely use the Nemesis System until 2035. There has been no indication that any in-progress projects will be moved to different developers, and it is exceedingly unlikely that they will. GB Daily Stay in the know!
