This wealth of data allows the platform to analyze a business’s brand and competitors, generate photo-realistic posts tailored to platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook, and Threads, and identify strategies that maximize audience engagement.The platform’s AI-driven capabilities include:Instant Post Creation: Aggie auto-generates visually compelling posts for each day, displayed in a calendar format for easy review.Quick Approvals and Edits: Users can finalize content in as little as five minutes.Automated Scheduling and Posting: Posts are automatically scheduled for optimal times across multiple platforms.Personalization: Aggie customizes content to match a user’s style, learning and refining over time.Brand Analysis and Competitive Insights: Users receive detailed reports comparing their performance with industry benchmarks.24/7 Support: Human experts are available for additional guidance.Aggie’s launch marks Audience Genomics’ first foray into the mass market.
