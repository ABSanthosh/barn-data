From managing resources to keeping staff happy and delivering a consistently high-quality product or service, it's a constant effort that breeds many highs and lows.No matter how well you finish one year and start the next, it's vitally important to examine your business performance over the past 12 months. By celebrating the wins and critically assessing the shortcomings, you can develop a robust plan not just to survive but thrive.Make a list of what is and isn't workingTaking a good, hard look at your business strategy and deciphering what is and isn't working is the best way to eliminate the unnecessary and make way for the bigger and better. There will always be ups and downs, but how you manage them is what makes the difference. Reviewing your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the previous year, including financial, operational, sales, marketing and customer service goals, is a great way to identify your strengths and weaknesses and learn from them.Data is key during this analysis process.

A big, audacious goal is the kind of goal that is brave, bold, and compelling enough to empower your team to strive toward achieving it.This could be to hit one million followers on your social media platform, increase revenue by 50%, become the number one product in your industry market or reach capacity on client intake.A big, audacious goal looks different for every business, so there is no one set of rules for how it should exist or manifest throughout the year. The best way to create your ideal goal is to know what is realistic for your business, but still scary enough to push you and your people to make it a reality.
