  "text": "Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios revealed more details about their previously teased historical title, which was first revealed at last year’s Game Awards and codenamed Project Century. In a trailer shown at Summer Game Fest 2025, RGG revealed that the game is called Stranger Than Heaven. The title reveal trailer did not reveal any details about the game’s release date or platforms, but it did show a glimpse of its action gameplay. The game’s protagonist, who gives his name as Mako Daito, appears to be some sort of agent of subterfuge. He implies he may not be Japanese and has striking blue eyes that feature prominently in the character art. The trailer’s description also doesn’t reveal any details except that it offers “another glimpse into the game’s world.” For what it is, the teaser does give a glimpse into the neon-lit environments of 1940’s Tokyo, as well as Daito’s work as a detective. He can apparently investigate items and evidence, LA Noire-style, while also beating down thugs in the city’s seedier corners. One shot of gameplay shows that Daito can apparently show mercy (or not) to some of those thugs.",
