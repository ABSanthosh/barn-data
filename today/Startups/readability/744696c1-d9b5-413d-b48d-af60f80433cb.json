We will also talk about what (and how) we’ve learned from each other over the years and how we’ve worked constructively through disagreements, conflicts, and mistakes.Phil’s blog post Startup Community Leadership discusses many of the things he’s done to positively impact the Colorado startup community. My journey with Phil started in 1999 when he co-founded a new center at CU Boulder: the Silicon Flatirons Center for Law, Technology, and Entrepreneurship. While unfortunately named (I hate the name Silicon X for anything, and over the years, I’ve teased Phil many times about this), this began a collaboration between us that resulted in organizations like Startup Colorado and BEN Colorado. It also resulted in the New Technology Meetup, the Entrepreneurial Law Clinic, the Entrepreneurs Unplugged Series, and CU Boulder’s New Venture Challenge.If you’ve read my book Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your City, you know about the incredible impact that Phil and Brad Bernthal had on engaging CU Boulder with the Boulder Startup Community, starting around 2007. It meaningfully impacted how I thought about how the culture across a University could be changed around entrepreneurship and engagement with a local startup community. I attribute much of the early leadership here to Phil and Brad, who worked as incredible thought partners early on the new approach to developing startup communities I codified in that book, and it has now had a global impact.Given the other public conversations Phil and I have had, including one with Jamie Dimon at CU Boulder as part of Entrepreneurs Unplugged, I expect we will cover a wide range of topics. It’s a chance to get to know another side of Phil and better understand how we’ve learned from each other over the past 25 years on technology, entrepreneurship, startup community development, government involvement with technology and innovation, leadership, and mentorship.Anyone who attends will receive a copy of my newest book, Give First: The Power of Mentorship, which I will happily sign if they wish.",
