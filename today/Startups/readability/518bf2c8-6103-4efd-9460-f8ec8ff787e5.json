  "description": "Summary In this week’s episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Daniel Koonce are joined by Rachel Heisten and Alissa Owsley, founding partners of LifeWork Talent, a consulting service helping organizations unlock the power of their people by building a culture where individuals thrive, enjoy the best experience, and develop exceptional human skills.  Alissa and Rachel, who initially met while working in human resources in 2011, speak candidly about the challenges and rewards of practicing what they preach as business advisors, sharing the importance of taking time to appreciate the present and redefine traditional notions of success. LifeWork Talent focuses on customized talent management services, encompassing workshops, executive coaching, and strategic partnerships, to intertwine life with work and inspire positive change in organizational cultures. Additionally, Rachel and Alissa underscore the significance of flexibility, adaptability, and continuous learning in their entrepreneurial journey, rejecting the societal trope that entrepreneurship is an inherent quality. They also address imposter syndrome, urging listeners to embrace and navigate the challenge of enjoying work without it becoming their identity.  Throughout the episode, we dive into Rachel and Alissa’s inspiring journey of two close friends and former corporate professionals who transitioned from the structured environment of a large corporation to founding their own consulting business. Rachel and Alissa share their origin stories, the obstacles they faced during the pandemic, and how an intervention from friends and mentors pushed them to pursue their dreams. Furthermore, they offer valuable perspectives on personal growth, the challenges of starting a business, and the importance of staying true to one's values while navigating the business world.
