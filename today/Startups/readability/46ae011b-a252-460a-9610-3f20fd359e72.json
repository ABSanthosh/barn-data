This expands its global team and gives it access to talent in London, alongside its existing offices in Helsinki, Shanghai, Seoul and San Francisco. According to Supercell, the London team will work on both new and existing live service games, including its recently released title Squad Busters. Ilkka Paananen, Supercell CEO, said in a statement, “We believe the best teams create the best games, so we are really excited to find our place within London’s incredibly talented games ecosystem by joining forces with Space Ape. This move will bring in amazing new colleagues and make our games teams even stronger. With the best talent globally, we move faster on our mission of creating great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever.” As part of the announcement, Supercell also revealed that it raised its investment in subsidiary developer Space Ape to 100%. The former first acquired 62% of the latter in 2017 for the amount of $55.8 million. Since then, it increased its investment with $37 million in 2022, which gave it ownership of 75% of the studio. Now, for an undisclosed sum, Supercell will have full 100% ownership of Space Ape, with the acquisition planned to be completed sometime in 2025. John Earner, Space Ape CEO, added in the same statement, “We’ve loved working closely with Supercell for many years, and this move is the next stage in that partnership. I am so proud of Space Ape’s contribution to the gaming industry over the last twelve years. I am looking forward to this next step in our evolution as part of the Supercell team.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
