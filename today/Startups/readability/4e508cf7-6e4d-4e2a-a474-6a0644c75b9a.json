Learn More A new tool called AnyChat is giving developers unprecedented flexibility by uniting a wide range of leading large language models (LLMs) under a single interface. Developed by Ahsen Khaliq (also known as “AK”), a prominent figure in the AI community and machine learning growth lead at Gradio, the platform allows users to switch seamlessly between models like ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Meta’s LLaMA, and Grok, all without being locked into a single provider. AnyChat promises to change how developers and enterprises interact with artificial intelligence by offering a one-stop solution for accessing multiple AI systems. At its core, AnyChat is designed to make it easier for developers to experiment with and deploy different LLMs without the restrictions of traditional platforms. “We wanted to build something that gave users total control over which models they can use,” said Khaliq. “Instead of being tied to a single provider, AnyChat gives you the freedom to integrate models from various sources, whether it’s a proprietary model like Google’s Gemini or an open-source option from Hugging Face.” Khaliq’s brainchild is built on Gradio, a popular framework for creating customizable AI applications. The platform features a tab-based interface that allows users to easily switch between models, along with dropdown menus for selecting specific versions of each AI. AnyChat also supports token authentication, ensuring secure access to APIs for enterprise users. For models requiring paid API keys—such as Gemini’s search capabilities—developers can input their own credentials, while others, like basic Gemini models, are available without an API key thanks to a free key provided by Khaliq. How AnyChat fills a critical gap in AI development The launch of AnyChat comes at a critical time for the AI industry. As companies increasingly integrate AI into their operations, many have found themselves constrained by the limitations of individual platforms. Most developers currently have to choose between committing to a single model, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, or spending significant time and resources integrating multiple models separately. AnyChat addresses this pain point by offering a unified interface that can handle both proprietary and open-source models, giving developers the flexibility to choose the best tool for the job at any given moment. This flexibility has already attracted interest from the developer community. In a recent update, a contributor added support for DeepSeek V2.5, a specialized model made available through the Hyperbolic API, demonstrating how easily new models can be integrated into the platform. “The real power of AnyChat lies in its ability to grow,” said Khaliq. “The community can extend it with new models, making the potential of this platform far greater than any one model alone.” What makes AnyChat useful for teams and companies For developers, AnyChat offers a streamlined solution to what has historically been a complicated and time-consuming process. Rather than building separate infrastructure for each model or being forced to use a single AI provider, users can deploy multiple models within the same app. This is particularly useful for enterprises that may need different models for different tasks—an organization could use ChatGPT for customer support, Gemini for research and search capabilities, and Meta’s LLaMA for vision-based tasks, all within the same interface. The platform also supports real-time search and multimodal capabilities, making it a versatile tool for more complex use cases. For example, Perplexity models integrated into AnyChat offer real-time search functionality, a feature that many enterprises find valuable for keeping up with constantly changing information. On the other hand, models like LLaMA 3.2 provide vision support, expanding the platform’s capabilities beyond text-based AI. Khaliq noted that one of the key advantages of AnyChat is its open-source support. “We wanted to make sure that developers who prefer working with open-source models have the same access as those using proprietary systems,” he said. AnyChat supports a broad range of models hosted on Hugging Face, a popular platform for open-source AI implementations. This gives developers more control over their deployments and allows them to avoid costly API fees associated with proprietary models. How AnyChat handles both text and image processing One of the most exciting aspects of AnyChat is its support for multimodal AI, or models that can process both text and images. This capability is becoming increasingly crucial as companies look for AI systems that can handle more complex tasks, from analyzing images for diagnostic purposes to generating text-based insights from visual data. Models like LLaMA 3.2, which includes vision support, are key to addressing these needs, and AnyChat makes it easy to switch between text-based and multimodal models as needed. For many enterprises, this flexibility is a huge deal. Rather than investing in separate systems for text and image analysis, they can now deploy a single platform that handles both. This can lead to significant cost savings, as well as faster development times for AI-driven projects. AnyChat’s growing library of AI models AnyChat’s potential extends beyond its current capabilities. Khaliq believes that the platform’s open architecture will encourage more developers to contribute models, making it an even more powerful tool over time. “The beauty of AnyChat is that it doesn’t just stop at what’s available now. It’s designed to grow with the community, which means the platform will always be at the cutting edge of AI development,” he told VentureBeat. The community has already embraced this vision. In a discussion on Hugging Face, developers have noted how easy it is to add new models to the platform. With support for models like DeepSeek V2.5 already being integrated, AnyChat is poised to become a hub for AI experimentation and deployment. What’s next for AnyChat and AI development As the AI landscape continues to evolve, tools like AnyChat will play a crucial role in shaping how developers and enterprises interact with AI technology. By offering a unified interface for multiple models and allowing for seamless integration of both proprietary and open-source systems, AnyChat is breaking down the barriers that have traditionally siloed different AI platforms. For developers, it offers the freedom to choose the best tool for the job without the hassle of managing multiple systems. For enterprises, it provides a cost-effective, scalable solution that can grow alongside their AI needs. As more models are added and the platform continues to evolve, AnyChat could very well become the go-to tool for anyone looking to leverage the full power of large language models in their applications.
