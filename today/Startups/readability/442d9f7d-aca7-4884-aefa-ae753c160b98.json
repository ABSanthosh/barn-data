It's not that you're not using keywords — it's that you're probably using them wrong.Keyword optimization is one of the most misunderstood areas of SEO. When done right, it gets your content found by the right people at the right time. When done wrong, it can bury your site under a pile of irrelevant search results. Here are the four most common keyword mistakes — and how to avoid them.1. Stop keyword stuffing — it hurts both rankings and readabilityOne of the biggest mistakes in SEO is cramming your target keyword into your content over and over again. It's an outdated tactic that Google's algorithm now penalizes. Repeating keywords too often can make your writing feel robotic, repetitive and unpleasant to read — which turns off both readers and search engines. Instead, aim for natural language and smart keyword placement. Use your primary keyword in the title, first 100 words, one subhead and the meta description. Then support it with synonyms and related phrases that help Google understand your content contextually.Tip: Focus on writing high-quality, engaging content that actually answers your audience's questions. Google rewards helpfulness, not repetition.Related: How AI Is Transforming Keyword Research (and Why You Can't Afford to Ignore It)2. Use headings strategically to boost skimmability and SEOHeadings do more than break up your content — they signal to Google what your page is about. But if every H2 is a thinly disguised version of your keyword, it can hurt your rankings and confuse readers.Here's a better approach:Put your main keyword in the H1 (page title).Use H2s to introduce subtopics with related or supporting terms.Make sure your headings are useful to human readers, not just search bots.Think of headings like road signs — they should guide the reader through your content while reinforcing the overall topic to search engines. 3. Optimize for how people actually searchSearch behavior has changed. People no longer search using robotic phrases like \"pest control service NYC.\" Instead, they ask full questions like, \"What's the best way to get rid of roaches in a Brooklyn apartment?\"This shift means Google now ranks based on user intent, not just keywords.To win search results:Use tools like AnswerThePublic to find real questions your audience is typing.Match your content to search intent: Are they looking for a quick answer, an in-depth guide, or a product to buy?Bonus: Intent-based search helps you compete at the local level, where trust and proximity matter more than having the biggest site.Related: From Zero to Hero — How to Build an SEO Strategy From Scratch4. Use AI to find long-tail opportunities others missThanks to natural language processing (NLP), AI-powered search engines like Google now understand meaning, not just exact phrases. This opens a powerful opportunity for businesses: target longer, more specific queries that sound like real conversations.For example, instead of optimizing for \"best running shoes,\" aim for:\"What running shoes are best for flat feet and knee pain?\"Use tools like Semrush or ChatGPT to: Discover trending long-tail phrasesAnalyze top-performing competitor contentIdentify question-based keywords and semantic variationsAI-driven keyword research helps you stay ahead by focusing on what users really want — not just what they type.Final takeawayKeywords are still foundational to SEO — but how you use them has evolved. Avoid outdated tactics like stuffing and copy-pasting the same phrase in every heading. Focus instead on understanding search intent, writing for humans, and using AI to find high-value opportunities.Get those pieces right, and your content won't just rank — it will resonate.",
