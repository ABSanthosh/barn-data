  "text": "The U.S. Department of Labor investigation into Scale AI is also probing two of the company’s human resources partners, HireArt and Upwork. Scale, the $14 billion data-labeling startup that hires scores of freelancers to train AI models for clients in Big Tech and government, has been under investigation by the DOL since last October, according to an email seen by Inc. The company, which netted $1 billion in venture investment last May, is relatively unknown compared with the bigger players in the AI space. But Scale’s role is no less significant: Scale farms out contract work to legions of freelancers, who work for its subsidiaries Outlier AI and Remotasks. The work is referred to as tasking and involves refining AI tools such as chatbots and self-driving technology by correcting the raw models’ mistakes. The company’s labor force has helped mold the technology behind the commercial AI revolution, but Scale is also being sued in two separate class action complaints for a variety of labor violations and for subjecting workers to distressing content that caused PTSD in some cases. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang has been making inroads in Washington D.C., having recently met with House Speaker Mike Johnson. The DOL investigation stems from alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which provides worker protections such as overtime pay and the guarantee of minimum wage. The agency is probing allegations of unpaid wages, misclassification of workers and retaliation, according to communications reviewed by Inc. Both HireArt and Upwork are mentioned as part of the probe. Scale AI uses companies such as HireArt, a New York City-based HR-tech company, to manage its sprawling contractor workforce. Scale also finds contract talent—referred to internally as taskers—on Upwork, the gig economy platform. HireArt is backed by the prestigious startup incubator Y Combinator and was featured on the Inc. 5000 last year. The firm acts as an Employer of Record for its partner companies, meaning the HireArt platform handles the minutiae of employee management, such as tax forms and requests for time off. Behind the scenes, HireArt has reportedly done more than that. According to three people who worked as middle managers in Scale’s data-labeling group, HireArt altered their offer letters by tweaking language to reflect their status as contractors of HireArt, rather than its employees. Around 40 offer letters were changed without an announcement, the group says. Different versions of the documents seen by Inc show words such as “employment” changed to “engagement” and “employee” switched to “contractor.” “As a HireArt employee, you will be employed by HireArt but working with some of the most innovative technology companies in the country,” says a version of an offer letter originally sent to a Contributor Success Manager in early January. “Please review the below details of your employment and contact us if you have any questions”Contractors noticed a change in their offer letters’ language on January 13.A new version of the same letter uploaded to HireArt’s website—which houses records such as offer letters and W2 forms—reads differently (emphasis ours): “As a HireArt contractor, you will be supporting some of the most innovative technology companies in the world,” the more recent version says. “Please review the details below of your engagement and contact us if you have questions.” In a statement, a HireArt spokesperson said: “The contractors in question are W2 employees of HireArt, contracted to Scale AI…HireArt follows all applicable laws to ensure full compliance and we do not alter the terms of our engagements with workers without their consent.” While Upwork was mentioned in communication between a DOL official and former Scale AI contractors, it’s unknown to what extent the company is being investigated. Upwork declined to comment. Scale AI has been subjected to a chorus of worker complaints in the U.S. since at least last June, when contractors working for Outlier AI and Remotasks began detailing their experiences of failing to be paid hourly wages they were promised. Scale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne says the DOL investigation was launched under the previous presidential administration, which didn’t understand how AI programs are built and tested. Conversations between the DOL and Scale AI have been positive and productive, he added. Scale has grown along with the broader AI industry, supplying data to train major tools developed by Meta, Google, OpenAI and the Department of Defense. The company’s relationship with the federal government has increased recently as well: Last month, Scale became the first third-party evaluator used by the U.S. AI Safety Institute, meaning the company will be in charge of assessing the safety of government AI tools. The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
