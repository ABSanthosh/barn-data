  "text": "Adi Klevit, an Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) member in Portland, Oregon, is the co-founder of Business Success Consulting Group, which helps leaders create and document custom processes and tailor-made management systems. We asked Klevit how designating a Process Champion can work magic by keeping documentation fresh, useful, and always up to date.Well-established processes are the foundation of any scalable business. They allow a company to replicate successes, stamp out inefficiencies, and maintain consistent function. Proper documentation streamlines onboarding, supports employee training, drives growth, and enables a company to build a structured operational system.Move beyond one-and-done One common mistake that business owners make is treating process documentation as a one-time effort. When I begin working with a company, I always ask the leadership team to show me their processes. The response is typically something like, “Yes, we have processes,” and they dig out a document that hasn’t been updated in 10 years. As you can probably imagine, that documentation hasn’t been used during the intervening decade, either.To prevent this, I promote the idea of designating what I call a process champion. This is a team member who is responsible for maintaining, ensuring the use of, and updating process documentation. Without this role in place, many businesses simply allow their processes to stagnate.When process documentation becomes a bureaucratic burden rather than a helpful support to business growth, it’s time to make a change. There are many ways to transform your existing documentation into something useful and dynamic.Signs your documentation is outdatedOutdated processes are useless and a camouflaged hole in your company systems. Here are four key indicators that your processes are begging to be updated: Employees don’t know about (or do not refer to) existing documentation. Processes are performed differently from what the documentation describes. There is no onboarding and training documentation. Only a handful of employees understand key systems. Does your business exhibit any of these signs? If the answer is yes, then it is time to update your existing processes and document new ones.Your business is dynamic – as are your business processes. For your business processes to be useful, they must stay up-to-date. Here are five practices to ensure documentation stays up-to-date.1. Elevate someone to the role of process champion.A process champion is the team member responsible for updating documentation, recording changes, and encouraging a culture of improvement. While this person champions process documentation, it’s not up to them alone. They will work closely with your various teams to tackle the rest of the steps below.2. Review processes regularly.Create a structured review approach and framework for process updates and audits. You can create a checklist or leverage workflows to ensure the approach is systematic and efficient. Also, develop a cadence for process reviews so that they are completed regularly – every quarter or six months tends to work well for most of my clients.3. Involve employees in process maintenance without overwhelming them.Even with a process champion at the helm, including process documentation and maintenance into employee workdays can feel overwhelming. In most businesses, employees are doing their best at the job they specialize in while trying to continue their education and remain helpful to struggling team members. Adding one more thing to that task list can overtax your team.One method to ensure that employees and leadership are in sync when it comes to process improvement is for leadership to take charge. Leaders should ensure processes are part of everyday tasks. Bring processes up in management meetings. When an issue occurs, talk with employees about the process and identify areas where it can improve. A top-down approach works best when implementing and continuing to improve processes.4. Include debriefs and process reviews in retrospective meetings.When conducting a retrospective, monthly or quarterly review, or other review-type meeting, discuss the processes that were used. These meetings often share what went right or wrong, relevant metrics, and actions to consider for future improvement. Thus, they are the perfect place to bring up process improvement.5. Leverage technology to keep documentation relevant.Utilize automation tools and AI-driven technology to help keep your documentation up-to-date. You can automate process review reminders, use AI to search documents for outdated information, utilize process documentation platforms, and more. By integrating technology, companies can simplify documentation and reduce the risk of outdated procedures derailing operations.Keeping your organization’s process documentation relevant requires continuous effort, but the payoff is substantial. Businesses that prioritize updating their procedures, leveraging technology, and fostering a process-driven culture position themselves for long-term success. By making process improvement a core part of their operations, companies can enhance efficiency, improve customer satisfaction, and scale with confidence.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
