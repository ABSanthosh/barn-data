  "text": "His earlier and not always glowing career in real estate notwithstanding, Donald Trump owes his ascent to far larger fame and fortune to the success of his NBC show, The Apprentice. Now in office as president for a second term, thanks in part to the popularity the program afforded him, Trump this week was thrust into another reality-TV-grade spectacle: his open, loud feuding with former adviser Elon Musk—an acidic public spat that might be called Desperate Billionaires of Washington.Yet as sudden, shocking, and for some observers entertaining as the ex-allies’ meltdown has been, it carries a serious reminder to any company owners who may still view Musk as a wildly successful manager worthy of emulation. With Tesla, SpaceX, and his other firms now risking potentially disastrous damage from his battle with Trump, Musk has become an example of how any business leader who lives by the sword runs the risk of dying by it as well—especially when it comes to politics.Since taking leave of the White House and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) job last week amid warm praise from Trump, Musk has become increasingly critical of his former boss and political hero—with barbs now flying via television and social media. Big Beautiful BeefThe reason for the feud? Outwardly, Musk has recently attacked Trump’s signature “big, beautiful bill,” in which tax cuts far outweigh proposed spending reductions. Those cuts are expected to add what some estimates say could be $2 trillion to $5 trillion to the current $36 trillion U.S. debt. Musk has attacked that as being exactly the opposite of the austerity and taxpayer protecting virtues he’d staked his entire DOGE reputation on—deriding the legislation as “a disgusting abomination” on social media.But even before that, Musk was reportedly infuriated at Trump for withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman, the billionaire businessman he’d backed to lead NASA. According to The Wall Street Journal, Musk associates said he had railed last weekend at having donated over a quarter-billion dollars to Trump’s victorious presidential campaign, only to have his NASA pick withdrawn without him being consulted. That apparently uncorked Musk’s ire, and allowed his escalating attacks on Trump’s beloved bill to flow freely all week.“The Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!” Musk said in a pair of X posts Thursday. “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80 percent in the middle?”Later that day, after the Tesla CEO posted a social-media message intimating  Trump had something to hide in the continuing inquiries into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Trump fired back with some vitriol of his own.“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, suggesting Musk was a hypocrite for attacking a bill he’d known about and—through his broader backing of the president for months—accepted. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”As always, intimates and partners know where to hit each other where it hurts most once they become foes, and Trump is demonstrating that again with Musk.Trump’s bill has already earmarked cuts or elimination of Biden administration tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers that have fueled sales of pricy Teslas—another source of Musk’s fury. But the president’s Truth Social posts also nods at the billions of dollars from NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and other government contracts SpaceX could lose if Trump decides to claw them back.And that could really hurt.A report released Tuesday by progressive Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed to document “130 examples of unethical or potentially corrupt actions that benefit Musk or his companies.” That would presumably include billions of dollars in new contracts Musk businesses signed while he led DOGE—contracts he could lose if Trump decides to respond to his former supporter’s broadsides by canceling them.The retribution might not end there. According to Warren’s findings, Musk also used his political pull in the White House to stall or quash regulators’ “pending enforcement actions, creating at least $2.37 billion in potential liability for his companies.” Long a foe and more recently a slasher of those same regulating government agencies, the vindictive Trump could put them back in motion to pursue alleged legal violations by Musk and his businesses.It’s unlikely many people in or out of politics would object to that score settling, either. Though Trump’s approval ratings have dropped since he took office, he’s still largely supported by the majority of voters who elected him. Musk, by contrast, is deeply unpopular, provoking increasing resentment and disdain even among many Republicans.Because of that, Trump could do nothing and let Musk stew in the increasingly caustic consequences of his foray into politics, and his new betrayal of Trump as his leader in that.On the one hand, sales of Teslas continue to seriously suffer from boycotts and dealership demonstrations protesting Musk’s merciless DOGE slashing and fealty to Trump’s MAGA policies. That disruption of his business led to the company losing 50 percent of its market capitalization earlier this year. And since Musk began attacking Trump’s tax and spending bill this week, Tesla share prices have plunged another 18 percent. If that continues, Trump might decide to just sit back, stay mum, and watch as Musk is hoisted on his own sword of faithful service to the president he’s now abandoned.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
