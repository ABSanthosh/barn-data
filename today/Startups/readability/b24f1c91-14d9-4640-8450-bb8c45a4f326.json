  "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Jeff Amerine are joined by Rick West, chairman and co-founder of Field Agent, a company revolutionizing B2B retail solutions by offering an on-demand marketplace with efficient, cost-effective tools for retail professionals to evaluate in-store conditions, drive sales, understand shoppers, and generate ratings and reviews. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and affordable, allowing users to deploy solutions quickly. As an all-in-one retail toolkit, every solution in the Field Agent Marketplace can be launched with just a few clicks, in just a few minutes, for just a few dollars.  Furthermore, Rick explains his entrepreneurial journey, highlighting his early days growing up in Appalachia and his international stint with Procter \u0026 Gamble, which ignited his entrepreneurial spirit. He emphasizes that Field Agent operates in two economies: the traditional B2B model, where large companies like Walmart and Procter \u0026 Gamble hire them to collect data, and a B2C model, where everyday users download the Field Agent app to perform tasks and earn money. The company recently underwent significant changes, including a Series B funding round and acquiring Shelfgram, enhancing Field Agent's machine learning and AI capabilities. This acquisition enables real-time data collection and predictive analytics, providing clients with a competitive edge. Throughout the episode, Rick talks about the importance of relationships and mentorship in the business world, how he was able to develop an app that \"really pays to use,\" and how he is adjusting to his new role within Field Agent. Tune in to learn about what the future looks like for Field Agent and to hear how you can make cold hard cash while you shop!   Show Notes (0:00) Introduction (0:42) Rick’s Background and Origin Story (4:16) What’s Next for Field Agent (7:15) Stepping Back from Day-to-Day Work (10:58) About Field Agents and Its Recent Acquisition, Shelfgram (16:10) Using Historical Information to Be Predictive (21:23) The Role of Social Listening (26:04) Field Agent’s Process: Everyday People Reviewing Products (28:03) Rick’s New Role and What’s in the Future for Him (30:00) Closing Question   Links Daniel Koonce Jeff Amerine Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Rick West Field Agent",
