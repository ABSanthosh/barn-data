  "text": "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday it is increasingly important to see a resolution to a four-week old strike by 33,000 Boeing workers seeking a new contract from the planemaker. “The solution is going to be one that supports workers, that’s compatible with the business succeeding,” Buttigieg told reporters at the department’s headquarters. “We think both those things are absolutely compatible, and there’s a deal to be had.” Asked when the labor stoppage impact would cause concerns about the broader airplane supply chain, Buttigieg did not specify a date but said with “each passing day it becomes more important… for them to come to terms.” (Reporting by David Shepardson)",
