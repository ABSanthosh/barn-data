  "text": "Ulta Beauty is raising some eyebrows and concerns with its viral Mini Brands collection, which raises the question of whether makeup and beauty brands should be targeting young children as potential consumers.  The Mini Brands products—which launched in the fall—are packaged in opaque plastic eggs shielding customers from knowing what is inside, similar to the packaging of other kid-centric products such as Nestle’s 1990s-era Wonder Ball and L.O.L. Surprise! Dolls. Upon opening, customers will find miniature plastic replicas of actual beauty products sold at Ulta, including products from major brands like E.l.f., Drybar, Urban Decay, NYX, and Lancôme. The Mini Brands are produced by the Hong Kong-based Zuru Toys, which has collaborated with other household names like Disney, Hasboro, Hello Kitty, and Tamagotchi and sells its products in major retailers, including Amazon and Target. The Ulta collection has become an online sensation, regularly selling out and racking up tens of millions of posts and views on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. But the perfectly doll-sized duplicates are also facing some recent complaints online, particularly from parents who see the products as wasteful and inappropriately targeting children, Bloomberg reported this week.  In Ulta’s defense, this consumer playbook is nothing new. With a price tag of $9.99, the Mini Brands mystery balls are affordable for kids and tweens on an allowance or an occasional babysitter salary, and with 68 different minis, the product is designed to be collected. Kids have done this for generations, accumulating stashes of baseball cards, Pokémon cards, action figures, Hot Wheels cars, Barbie dolls, and comic books. For families that could afford to participate, rampant consumerism has always on display in childhood bedrooms and under the Christmas tree. Do we really need tiny, non-functional tubes of mascara or cans of hairspray? Probably not. But we didn’t really need a pink, plastic plane to match Barbie’s convertible either.  Perhaps what’s different about Ulta’s Mini Brands is the plain fact that Ulta is not a toy store. The chain, with more than 1,300 locations, sells makeup, hair care, skin care, and other beauty products, ostensibly geared toward an adult audience. While the Mini Brands includes plenty of inoffensive products that could fit perfectly within a doll house, such as sunscreen, hair dryers, hair brushes, and nail polish, the collection also includes butt polish—Truly’s Buns of Glowry Smoothing Butt Polish—which may surprise some parents who spring for the surprise balls in the checkout line. With the amount of pressure that adolescents already face when it comes to their appearance and the levels of youth anxiety on the rise, should companies be contributing to that cycle by indoctrinating kids to start thinking about makeup—or butt polish—even in their earliest days of elementary school? Ulta did not respond to Inc.’s request for comment, but if the market is any indicator, shares are up about 1.5 percent since October, when the Mini Brands collection launched. As CEO David Kimball said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call, “We launched an exclusive and a disruptive beauty offering of the beloved Mini Brands.” Kimball added, “These unique collaborations are driving strong sales awareness, traffic, and engagement, especially with Gen-Z and Millennial members.” Scroll on TikTok—it’s clear that includes Gen-Alpha too.",
