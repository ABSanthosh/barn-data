The platform announced on Thursday that half a million new users signed up within a day of X announcing that it would be changing up its blocking feature \"soon.\" Blocked users on X will be able to see public posts but not like, reply or engage with them in any other way.Although X said the change was to prevent people blocking others from sharing sensitive information about people they have blocked, X users stated that the move would support stalking, render the Block function useless and violate Google Play Store and Apple App Store requirements.
