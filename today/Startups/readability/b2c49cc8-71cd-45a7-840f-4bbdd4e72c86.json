  "text": "I learned how to do deals from Len Fassler. Last week, I got an email from Dustin Kloempken, who sent me a few quotes he wrote down from the Berkshire Annual Meeting. One of them jumped out at me.“Turn every page. One important ingredient in the investment field that very few people do. And those people who did read every page aren’t telling you what they learned. You have to read every page.“In 1996, I was sitting in a law firm conference room in NYC next to Len. We were working on the legal documents for Sage Hosting’s (which we renamed Interliant after we merged with a company named Interliant) first acquisition. It was tiny—a web hosting company doing maybe $100,000 of revenue annually. We had decided to buy this tiny company to get going.Len read every page of the legal draft of the purchase agreement and marked it up. After reading a page, he’d slide it over to me to read and see what he’d marked up. We had the disclosure document, so we went through those pages.By 1996, I’d done a lot of angel investments and a few VC investments, but only a few acquisitions. And, I’d deferred to the lawyers on the legal documents. While I generally knew what was happening, there was plenty of fine print that I hadn’t bothered to read or understand.After an hour, I asked Len why he was going through every page. He told me, “Brad, in any document you sign, you should turn every page. It’s good practice for any document you read, but even if you are skimming, turn every page to make sure you don’t miss anything.”I bought a green felt-tip pen and started doing this. As documents became predominantly online, I opened them and turned every page. I read every email I received. Even when I skim a book, I turn every page.Today, I received many Docusigns with just the signature page. This bugs me, and I often ask for the entire document before I sign. Given that I’ve looked at a zillion legal documents, I can turn every page pretty quickly. But I still turn every page in a board package, a legal document that is new to me, or a long paper (academic or white paper) that someone sends me.Fortunately, I’m a fast reader and have high reading comprehension. I can also read by paragraph (vs. by sentence), so skimming works for looking for things that are out of place.I love it when people put easter eggs in documents to see if they get read. For example, a set of Return Path board minutes from about a decade ago had something like the following paragraph.“After our lunch break, where we enjoyed Shake Shack, Mr. Feld drank two Shake Shack Chocolate Shakes in rapid succession. After a few minutes, he had to lie on the floor and nap for about 30 minutes.”Turn every page—great advice from Len Fassler and Warren Buffett.",
