  "text": "The Conclave is over. Pope Leo XIV has been elected. For the first time in history, the head of the Catholic Church is from the United States, and that can mean only one thing: The merch is dropping.  Within an hour of the news that Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost was elected the 267th pope of the Roman Catholic Church on Thursday, online sellers were already hard at work, selling stickers, prayer candles, T-shirts, hoodies, baseball caps, and tank tops on e-commerce platforms like Etsy and Redbubble to honor the occasion. The quick-turn product designs were mostly light on reverence and opted instead for more secular imagery. Think American flags, bald eagles, aviator sunglasses, Popeye-level biceps, U.S. Marine Corps tattoos, and plenty of references to Chicago, from which Leo XIV hails. A digital download of the design “Straight Outta Chicago and Into the Papacy”—stylized after N.W.A.’s first studio album—is available for $2. For $19.95, you can purchase a T-shirt that depicts the pope as a slice of pizza. In all the regalia and insignia, it’s hard to tell if the pizza is deep dish.  Podcasts are also getting in on the action: Chicago Sports Bums, which has released 230 episodes about the city’s beloved sports teams since launching in 2020, dropped a Pope Leo XIV less than two hours after the papacy was announced. “Daaa Pope,” the shirt reads, above an illustration of a mitre. Below the papal hat, it says: “Chicago.” Screen-printing history is not some new phenomenon. Shoppers have always had their pick of plates, coffee mugs, and knick-knacks to buy during presidential elections and royal weddings. But the sheer speed and creativity of these drops is notable. One Los Angeles based Etsy store called President Trump 24 seemingly rejiggered a “Make Alcatraz Great Again” T-shirt design into one celebrating the new Pope Leo XIV. President Trump’s sunglasses reflecting American flags in the lenses stayed, but his hair swoop got swapped out for a zucchetto.  While online sellers launch new inventory without fear of offending one of the 1.4 billion faithful around the world, local brick-and-mortar businesses do not often get the same leeway as the meme-riddled internet. When Inc. spoke with Transit Tees, a locally owned design studio with two stores in Chicago, and asked if the retailer planned to make any items honoring the new pope from the second city, the answer was no.  The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
