  "text": "StreamElements today put out its latest State of the Stream report for March 2025, where it detailed activity on Twitch for that month. The numbers show that Twitch’s viewership slumped in March, which is apparently typical for the platform — though the numbers drop to a happy normal rather than to a concerning low, according to StreamElements’ data. Monster Hunter Wilds also broke into the top 10 most-streamed categories for the month. According to StreamElement’s report, which was done in partnership with Rainmaker.gg, showed that Twitch had 1.68 billion hours watched total for March. This is higher than February’s 1.59 billion, though this is likely due to March having more days than February. In terms of daily hours watched, March had 54 million as opposed to January and February’s 57 million. This is the fourth consecutive year that March’s viewership count has been lower than previous months, according to Rainmaker.gg. In addition to the hours watched, StreamElements also reported on the top Twitch streamers of the month. Caedral was the top streamer for the month, which Twitch attributes to his streaming of the EMEA Masters and one of the matches of League of Legends esports team Los Ratones. Monster Hunter Wilds debuted in 9th place on the top 10 most-watched categories, not displacing major esports titles, but it did push Marvel Rivals down a slot. Or Perry, StreamElements CEO, said in a statement about the causes behind the dip in viewership, “Understanding the streaming landscape goes beyond just watching numbers rise and fall. On Twitch, things like major esports events and the time of year can make certain months look stronger or weaker on paper. If you’re not familiar with these contributing factors, it’s easy to misread what a peak or dip really means for the platform.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
