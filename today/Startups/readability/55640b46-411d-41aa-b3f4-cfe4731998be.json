  "text": "February 25, 2025 3:53 PM Credit: VentureBeat made with Midjourney Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More OpenAI announced today that it is rolling out its powerful Deep Research capability to all ChatGPT Plus, Team, Education and Enterprise users, significantly expanding access to what many experts consider the company’s most transformative AI agent since the original ChatGPT. According to an announcement on OpenAI’s official X account, Plus, Team, Education and Enterprise users will initially receive 10 deep research queries per month, while Pro tier subscribers will have access to 120 queries monthly. Deep Research, which is powered by a specialized version of OpenAI’s upcoming o3 model, represents a significant shift in how AI can assist with complex research tasks. Unlike traditional chatbots that provide immediate responses, Deep Research independently scours hundreds of online sources, analyzes text, images and PDFs and synthesizes comprehensive reports comparable to those produced by professional analysts. Deep research is now rolling out to all ChatGPT Plus, Team, Edu, and Enterprise users ?— OpenAI (@OpenAI) February 25, 2025 The AI research arms race: DeepSeek’s open challenge meets OpenAI’s premium play The timing of OpenAI’s expanded rollout is hardly coincidental. The generative AI landscape has transformed dramatically in recent weeks, with China’s DeepSeek emerging as an unexpected disruptor. By open-sourcing their DeepSeek-R1 model under an MIT license, they’ve fundamentally challenged the closed, subscription-based business model that has defined Western AI development. What makes this competition particularly interesting is the divergent philosophies at play. While OpenAI continues to gate its most powerful capabilities behind increasingly complex subscription tiers, DeepSeek has opted for a radically different approach: give away the technology and let a thousand applications bloom. Chinese AI company Deepseek recently made waves when it announced R1, an open-source reasoning model that it claimed achieved comparable performance to OpenAI’s o1, at a fraction of the cost.But for those following AI developments closely, Deepseek and R1 didn’t come out of… pic.twitter.com/FUahYP0HHz— Y Combinator (@ycombinator) February 5, 2025 This strategy echoes earlier eras of technology adoption, where open platforms ultimately created more value than closed systems. Linux’s dominance in server infrastructure offers a compelling historical parallel. For enterprise decision-makers, the question becomes whether to invest in proprietary solutions that may offer immediate competitive advantages or embrace open alternatives that could foster broader innovation across their organization. Perplexity’s recent integration of DeepSeek-R1 into its own research tool—at a fraction of OpenAI’s price point—demonstrates how quickly this open approach can yield competing products. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet has taken yet another path, focusing on transparency in its reasoning process with “visible extended thinking.” deepseek's r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price.we will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases.— Sam Altman (@sama) January 28, 2025 The result is a fragmented market where each major player now offers a distinctive approach to AI-powered research. For enterprises, this means greater choice but also increased complexity in determining which platform best aligns with their specific needs and values. From walled garden to public square: OpenAI’s calculated democratic pivot When Sam Altman writes that Deep Research “probably is worth $1,000 a month to some users,” he’s revealing more than just price elasticity—he’s acknowledging the extraordinary value disparity that exists among potential users. This admission cuts to the heart of OpenAI’s ongoing strategic balancing act. The company faces a fundamental tension: maintaining the premium exclusivity that funds its development while simultaneously fulfilling its mission of ensuring “artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.” Today’s announcement represents a careful step toward greater accessibility without undermining its revenue model. i think we are going to initially offer 10 uses per month for chatgpt plus and 2 per month in the free tier, with the intent to scale these up over time.it probably is worth $1000 a month to some users but i'm excited to see what everyone does with it! https://t.co/YBICvzodPF— Sam Altman (@sama) February 12, 2025 By limiting free tier users to just two queries monthly, OpenAI is essentially offering a teaser—enough to demonstrate the technology’s capabilities without cannibalizing its premium offerings. This approach follows the classic “freemium” playbook that has defined much of the digital economy, but with unusually tight constraints that reflect the substantial computing resources required for each Deep Research query. The allocation of 10 monthly queries for Plus users ($20/month) compared to 120 for Pro users ($200/month) creates a clear delineation that preserves the premium value proposition. This tiered rollout strategy suggests OpenAI recognizes that democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities requires more than just lowering price barriers—it necessitates a fundamental rethinking of how these capabilities are packaged and delivered. The headline figure—26.6% accuracy on “Humanity’s Last Exam“—tells only part of the story. This benchmark, designed to be extraordinarily challenging even for human experts, represents a quantum leap beyond previous AI capabilities. For context, achieving even 10% on this test would have been considered remarkable just a year ago. What’s most significant isn’t just the raw performance but the nature of the test itself, which requires synthesizing information across disparate domains and applying nuanced reasoning that goes far beyond pattern matching. Deep Research’s approach combines several technological breakthroughs: multi-stage planning, adaptive information retrieval, and perhaps most crucially, a form of computational self-correction that allows it to recognize and remedy its own limitations during the research process. Yet these capabilities come with notable blind spots. The system remains vulnerable to what might be called “consensus bias“—a tendency to privilege widely accepted viewpoints while potentially overlooking contrarian perspectives that challenge established thinking. This bias could be particularly problematic in domains where innovation often emerges from challenging conventional wisdom. Moreover, the system’s reliance on existing web content means it inherits the biases and limitations of its source material. In rapidly evolving fields or niche specialties with limited online documentation, Deep Research may struggle to provide truly comprehensive analysis. And without access to proprietary databases or subscription-based academic journals, its insights into certain specialized domains may remain superficial despite its sophisticated reasoning capabilities. OpenAI’s Deep Research tool outperforms competitors on Perplexity Labs’ “Humanity’s Last Exam” benchmark, achieving roughly 25% accuracy — significantly ahead of other AI models including those from Perplexity, DeepSeek, Google, and Anthropic. (Credit: Perplexity Labs) The executive’s dilemma: How Deep Research rewrites the rules of knowledge work For C-suite leaders, Deep Research presents a paradox: a tool powerful enough to redefine roles throughout their organization but still too limited to be deployed without careful human oversight. The immediate productivity gains are undeniable—tasks that once required days of analyst time can now be completed in minutes. But this efficiency comes with complex strategic implications. Organizations that integrate Deep Research effectively will likely need to reimagine their information workflows entirely. Rather than simply replacing junior analysts, the technology may create new hybrid roles where human expertise focuses on framing questions, evaluating sources, and critically assessing AI-generated insights. The most successful implementations will likely view Deep Research not as a replacement for human judgment but as an amplifier of human capabilities. deep research out for chatgpt plus users!one of my favorite things we have ever shipped.— Sam Altman (@sama) February 25, 2025 The pricing structure creates its own strategic considerations. At $200 monthly for Pro users with 120 queries, each query effectively costs about $1.67—a trivial expense compared to human labor costs. Yet the limited volume creates artificial scarcity that forces organizations to prioritize which questions truly merit Deep Research’s capabilities. This constraint may ironically lead to more thoughtful application of the technology than a purely unlimited model would encourage. The longer-term implications are more profound. As research capabilities that were once restricted to elite organizations become widely accessible, competitive advantage will increasingly derive not from information access but from how organizations frame questions and integrate AI-generated insights into their decision-making processes. The strategic value shifts from knowing to understanding—from information gathering to insight generation. For technical leaders, the message is clear: the AI research revolution is no longer coming—it’s here. The question is not whether to adapt but how quickly organizations can develop the processes, skills, and cultural mindset needed to thrive in a landscape where deep research has been fundamentally democratized.

The immediate productivity gains are undeniable—tasks that once required days of analyst time can now be completed in minutes. But this efficiency comes with complex strategic implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations that integrate Deep Research effectively will likely need to reimagine their information workflows entirely. Rather than simply replacing junior analysts, the technology may create new hybrid roles where human expertise focuses on framing questions, evaluating sources, and critically assessing AI-generated insights. The most successful implementations will likely view Deep Research not as a replacement for human judgment but as an amplifier of human capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cdiv lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cp\u003edeep research out for chatgpt plus users!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eone of my favorite things we have ever shipped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e— Sam Altman (@sama) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1894527988378550392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eFebruary 25, 2025\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe pricing structure creates its own strategic considerations. At $200 monthly for Pro users with 120 queries, each query effectively costs about $1.67—a trivial expense compared to human labor costs. Yet the limited volume creates artificial scarcity that forces organizations to prioritize which questions truly merit Deep Research’s capabilities. This constraint may ironically lead to more thoughtful application of the technology than a purely unlimited model would encourage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer-term implications are more profound. As research capabilities that were once restricted to elite organizations become widely accessible, competitive advantage will increasingly derive not from information access but from how organizations frame questions and integrate AI-generated insights into their decision-making processes. The strategic value shifts from knowing to understanding—from information gathering to insight generation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor technical leaders, the message is clear: the AI research revolution is no longer coming—it’s here. The question is not whether to adapt but how quickly organizations can develop the processes, skills, and cultural mindset needed to thrive in a landscape where deep research has been fundamentally democratized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"boilerplate_2660155\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
