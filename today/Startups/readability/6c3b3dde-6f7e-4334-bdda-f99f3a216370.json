This integration allows merchants, self-creators, and agencies using Wix to create and sell custom-branded merchandise without leaving the Wix platform.According to Wix, this new feature offers users a streamlined and cost-effective solution for launching their own product lines.“This integration gives our users a new opportunity to create high-quality products and merchandise customized to their brand, whether they are a yoga studio owner, a chef, or a dog trainer,” said Jill Sherman, Head of Suppliers Hub at Wix. “Together, we’re providing our users a unique and seamless solution that embraces creativity and brand identity while eliminating fulfillment hassles and overhead costs. This empowers users to focus on the growth of their business and maximize their brand footprint all from the Wix platform.”With the integration, Wix users can customize merchandise with their own graphics, artwork, and branding. The print-on-demand industry is projected to reach $45.6 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.3%, according to the announcement. Wix states that this solution enables small businesses to enter a competitive market without the typical barriers associated with traditional product manufacturing and inventory management.Printful’s fulfillment services allow businesses to produce and distribute custom products without upfront inventory costs.“Partnering with Wix is a natural fit for us, as we’re both dedicated to supporting e-commerce business owners and brand builders who are crafting exceptional shopping experiences,” said Chris Victory, Head of Partnerships at Printful. “We’ve always been committed to helping anyone, anywhere create, design and deliver high-quality, unique products that resonate with their audience.
