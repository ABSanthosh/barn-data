  "text": "It’s no secret that pressure campaigns and lawsuits attacking corporate diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) policies made headway over the past year. Most of those successes have involved big companies like Ford, Lowe’s, and Molson Coors publicly revising or renouncing their positions supporting and promoting of people of all backgrounds. Less visibly, signs are accumulating that other businesses are discreetly pulling back on DEI-inspired programs, including their work in funding entrepreneurs from minority communities.Conservative groups battling what they decry as “woke” social objectives in business initially attacked corporate DEI policies seeking greater equality in internal hiring and promotion processes. More recently, however, that pressure has forced changes in grant programs supporting entrepreneurs of color and other under-represented groups. A Wall Street Journal report Thursday detailed how several large companies discreetly rolled back or cut their funding of minority-owned businesses in recent months—apparently inspiring smaller organizations to follow suit.Among the first major offensives in that push was a lawsuit filed last year by the conservative America First Legal activist group. It attacked small business finance platform Hello Alice’s grant program for Black company owners, which the plaintiffs called discriminatory. Though the Houston-based fintech firm prevailed in defending the program last May, Hello Alice and other like-minded organizations were forced to cut back staffing and overall activity as court battles bit into their resources.Other businesses and funders that came under attack opted to avoid those heavy costs by negotiating settlements out of court. Those accords, however, frequently involved seriously watering down or effectively neutering their support for minority entrepreneurs. Some companies have taken similar steps on their own, as preemptive efforts to defuse potential conservative attacks.Among those, the Journal said, was a grant program PepsiCo established last year providing between $20,000 and $100,000 to 10 promising young food and drink companies headed by LatinX founders. But with legal offensives by conservatives on DEI-related activities on the rise, the Journal said PepsiCo changed the initiative, altering language for participating businesses that “no longer requires them to be Hispanic-owned.”Hola, generic fund.Using similar logic, car insurance company Progressive tweaked the conditions of the small business grant program it operated with Hello Alice as a partner. While that still distributes $25,000 funding packages to promising young companies, its former requirements those be Black- or LatinX-owned have been dropped. Other companies have taken different paths to the same destination.Banking giant UBS, the Journal said, decided to end its 2021-founded program dispensing $1 million in grants to businesses owned by women of color. Instead, it now provides commensurate financing to a nonprofit organization supporting Black entrepreneurs. TikTok, by contrast, appears to have simply walked away from the program it created in 2021 extending financial support to LatinX entrepreneurs. The fund’s vestigal webpage still lists the current application deadline as October 23, 2023—digital tumbleweeds seeming to blow by in the virtual background.Those apparently low-profile defensive adjustments to the surging anti-DEI campaigns haven’t generated national headlines like announcements by Lowe’s, Ford, Harley-Davison, or rural retail chain Tractor Supply abandoning their earlier policies. But their under-the-radar implementation makes them similar to the far greater number of companies quietly cutting DEI staff, rolling back policies and objectives, or simply rewording their statutes to remove any references that detractors might attack.Meanwhile, those defensive corporate responses to widening conservative pressure campaigns appear to be influencing changes at smaller organizations providing grants to minority entrepreneurs.Citing studies by the small company support platform, Skip, the Journal said of the over “60 small-business grant programs that in 2023 included race or ethnicity in their criteria, more than 40 (percent) no longer exist or appear to be moribund.”  “Another 27 (percent) no longer use race or ethnicity in making awards,” the paper added—noting most of those schemes provided small but vital funding of $10,000 to $20,000 to promising but cash-strapped businesses.Few if any of those modest organizations were attacked in public or taken to court prior to changing or abandoning their programs. But that very detail offers an indication of the effectiveness of wider anti-DEI campaigning against larger businesses.Unfortunately, it may also mean a historic problem for entrepreneurs of color and from other minority communities may get worse.Citing Federal Reserve data, the Journal reported that only one-third of small businesses with Black or LatinX owners receive the full amounts of bank loans they seek for their companies. The rate of enterprises with white founders is about 50 percent. Worse still, minority-founded startups took in less than 2 percent of venture capital funding granted in the U.S. this year, the paper said.Those financing gaps motivated many companies and organizations to launch grant programs as alternative ways to support fledging businesses in the first place. But with a lot of those now pulling back or halting that activity, it appears anti-DEI offensives may inflict more damage than the “woke” progressive policies and practices they’re nominally targeting. Which may well be the real objective.",
