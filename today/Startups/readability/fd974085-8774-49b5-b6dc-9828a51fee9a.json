  "text": "December 31, 2024 12:00 PM Netflix announced that its Squid Game: Unleashed mobile game has reached No. 1 Top Free Action Game in 57 countries and the No. 1 Top Free Game’ in 24 countries on the App Store charts. The Netflix multiplayer video game from Bossfight released on December 17 just before the highly-anticipated release of Squid Game Season 2 on December 26. (I’m about three episodes into the show and I’m hooked again on its gritty human drama). Netflix also simultaneously released its first week viewing data for Squid Game Season 2. Season 2 of the massively popular South Korean streaming series from creator/director Hwang Dong-hyuk and starring Lee Jung-jae topped the non-English TV list with a whopping 68 million views, ranking No. 1 in 92 countries and breaking the record for most views for a show in its premiere week (previously set by Wednesday Season 1 in 2022, with 50.1 million views). The third and final season is due out in 2025. In a first for Netflix, Squid Game: Unleashed is available for both Netflix members and non-members for free, without any ads or in-app purchases. Also a first, players of Unleashed earn in-game rewards for each episode of Season 2 they watch – something only Netflix can do by offering series, films and games on the same service.  Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
