  "text": "October 10, 2024 12:34 PM Image Credit: Secret Door Dreamhaven-created studio Secret Door announced today that its new game is a co-op “tactical adventure” game called Sunderfolk. It’s a title that can be played by up to four people, and has a shared screen mechanic where players use their phones or tablets as controllers. Secret Door plans to launch the game for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Switch in 2025. According to Secret Door, Sunderfolk is a “streamlined alternative to the traditional tabletop-gaming experience” designed to be accessible. The game’s story follows an adventuring party on a quest through various environments in the Sunderlands. Players choose from six different characters — Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger or Rogue — and manage a card-based inventory of items and skills to use in battle. Chris Sigaty, Secret Door’s studio head, said in a statement, “We have a bunch of dedicated board and tabletop game fanatics on the team at Secret Door—getting together for game night has been a regular highlight for many of us going back years and years. As developers we also like to look at what inspires us and think about how to make those types of experiences easier to get into, so that more people can enjoy them as much as we do. With Sunderfolk, we’re excited to offer players a game that’s easy to pick up and play, while still challenging to master, and we can’t wait to share it with the world.” Mike Morhaime, CEO of Dreamhaven (and former CEO of Blizzard) said in a statement, “The team at Secret Door, and really all of us at Dreamhaven, are all about bringing players together around fun experiences. Sunderfolk is a beautiful game, it’s full of personality and charm, and it also creates epic moments where everyone is engaging directly with each other to work out strategies or celebrate victories. There’s nothing quite like it, and we’re really looking forward to seeing what players think.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
