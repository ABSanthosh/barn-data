In a bid to move away from animal-derived fabrics, many producers have explored alt leather replacements, but these are often either full of plastic or don’t match up in terms of performance. PACT might have the answer. The UK startup, based in Cambridge, has developed a range of innovative, planet-friendly biomaterials using natural raw ingredients – including collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies, providing strength and structure to our skin, bones, muscles, organs, and tendons. Because of this, it’s often used in skincare and cosmetics, and, crucially, it’s the main building block of leather. PACT uses a patented process to transform cosmetic-grade waste collagen into collagen skins. The company then combines these collagen skins with all-natural herbal extracts, oils, and minerals, before being treated with leather finishing techniques. No harmful chemicals are used throughout the process, avoiding the water pollution that accompanies traditional leather production. Using this platform, the company has created its patented flagship material, called Oval. Because the foundation of the material is collagen, the final product is extremely flexible and feels like ordinary leather. It can also be easily customised with specific embellishments and different colours. In September this year, PACT raised £9 million in seed funding, which will help the company scale production. To facilitate this growth, PACT is opening a new 13,820-square-foot site in Cambridge, which will include a lab and pilot production facility.
