  "text": "It’s not a traditional Republican talking point—but President Trump is not a traditional Republican.The two-term chief executive has opened the door for a tax hike on the top-earning Americans, new reporting indicates, putting the president at odds with tax-shy GOP allies as he tries to appeal to his more populist MAGA base and reshape American tax policy in the years ahead.Trump has asked Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to create a new top income tax bracket that would have Americans earning more than $2.5 million a year pay a 39.6 percent tax on all money above that threshold, the New York Times reported last Thursday, citing two unnamed insiders. Sources cited by The Hill confirmed the details of the proposal.Congressional Republicans are currently working toward a major tax package—what the president has called the “big, beautiful bill”–that will likely extend aspects of Trump’s first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) while also potentially implementing a few new tax cuts, too, such as on overtime pay, Social Security benefits and service tips. The new tax bracket would, if sufficiently supported in Congress, become part of that larger tax bill.It’s a controversial issue on the right, where taxes on high earners are often seen as disincentivizing entrepreneurship—and one that Republican leaders don’t yet seem to be unified behind. “I don’t want to see taxes go up on anybody,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Friday in a CNBC interview.Even Trump himself has dialed things back since news of his pitch broke. In a post on Truth Social, his X competitor, he wrote Friday that Republicans should “probably not” implement “even a ‘TINY’ tax increase” on the rich, but that he’s “OK if they do!!!”The current GOP plan allows for up to $5.3 trillion in total cuts, including $3.8 trillion worth of TCJA extensions plus another $1.5 trillion in new cuts.That Republicans are also aiming to cut $1.5 trillion in federal spending suggests that popular programs such as Medicaid could be impacted—putting electorally vulnerable Republicans in a tough spot. Trump reportedly sees an increased tax on millionaires as a way to protect Medicaid, per one anonymous source cited by the Times.A top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent would be a return to the pre-TCJA tax landscape, which also had that top rate before Trump lowered it to 37 percent. The top individual income bracket this year is $626,350, the Times reports, so Trump “is effectively seeking to restore the previous top rate, but at a much higher income level.”Policy experts interviewed by Fortune, however, say that the tax increases proposed by Trump would have minimal effect on government revenue and “barely dent the ultra-rich.”Trump has also called for closing the carried interest tax break loophole, which would raise taxes on investment managers—another instance of him breaking Republican orthodoxy to push for higher taxes. Whether he follows through in either case, or can corral the necessary support to actually implement these changes, remains to be seen.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
