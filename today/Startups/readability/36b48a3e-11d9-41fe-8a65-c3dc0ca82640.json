For example, Microsoft's stock price rose to an all-time high, hitting a closing price above $500 for the first time earlier this month. Nadella also stated that the company is investing more in AI infrastructure than ever before, pouring over $80 billion into AI in the fiscal year that ended in June.\"Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,\" Nadella wrote. \"And yet, at the same time, we've undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.\"Nadella explained the disconnect between thriving financials and layoffs by stating that \"progress isn't linear\" and that it is \"sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.\" He noted that headcount at Microsoft \"is relatively unchanged\" as the company continues to hire new workers, and he doesn't promise that there won't be more layoffs in the future.
