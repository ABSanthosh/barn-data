  "text": "In Apple TV+’s enigmatic thriller Severance, employees at the mysterious Lumon Industries undergo a surgical procedure that separates their work memories from their personal lives. This science fiction premise has struck a chord with viewers not just for its mind-bending plot. Also, what stands out are the uncomfortable truths it reveals about modern corporate culture. The show reflects collective anxieties about work-life balance, corporate ethics, and personal identity in today’s professional landscape.Severance takes the concept of work-life balance to its extreme logical conclusion. When characters enter the elevator at Lumon, they become their “innie” selves. These are versions of themselves who exist only within the workplace and have no knowledge of their outside lives. This stark delineation resonates with professionals who increasingly struggle to establish boundaries between their personal and professional identities. This is especially true in an age of remote work, always-on connectivity, and diminishing separation between office and home.The show brilliantly interrogates what many workers feel: the expectation to compartmentalize their humanity for the sake of productivity. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests nearly 60 percent of professionals feel they must adopt a different persona at work. This is a less extreme but spiritually similar version of Lumon’s severance procedure.Corporate mythology and blind loyaltyLumon’s quasi-religious corporate culture, complete with its founder worship and mysterious handbook, is a mirror. It satirizes how companies today manufacture loyalty through carefully crafted narratives. The reverence the “innies” show toward Kier Eagan, Lumon’s founder, mirrors the cultlike admiration some companies cultivate around visionary leaders.This exaggerated corporate mythology highlights how modern companies often use origin stories, mission statements, and values to create emotional investment from employees. Sometimes, leaders use them as substitutes for meaningful compensation or reasonable working conditions. The show asks viewers to consider their loyalty to employers. How much of it is based on substance versus carefully constructed narratives?Perhaps most disturbing is how Severance depicts the illusion of choice and agency within corporate structures. Management rewards employees with trivial perks (finger traps and waffle parties). Meanwhile, they deny them fundamental information about their work’s purpose. This mirrors contemporary workplace challenges in which Ping-Pong tables and free snacks often replace substantive benefits or meaningful advancement opportunities.The show’s portrayal of management, particularly through Patricia Arquette’s chilling performance as Harmony Cobel, illuminates how middle management are often enforcers of policies they didn’t create and may not fully understand. This dynamic perpetuates systems that benefit those at the very top. (Of course later in the series, it’s revealsed that Cobel actually had been the visionary behind the severing procedure.)Finding meaning in meaningless workAt its core, the show asks a question that haunts many professionals: What meaning does your work actually have? The show’s protagonists discover they’re performing mysterious tasks with zero context. They’re sorting numbers into digital folders with no understanding of purpose or impact.In today’s knowledge economy, where workers can sometimes feel disconnected from tangible outcomes, this resonates deeply. According to a recent Gallup survey, only 36 percent of U.S. employees feel engaged at work, suggesting that Lumon’s absurdist workplace might not be as far from reality as the audience might like to believe.Signs of a Lumon-like environmentAs a boss or employer, you may not be surgically altering your employees’ brains. However, there are warning signs that a workplace has disturbing similarities to Lumon’s dystopian office culture. If information flows exclusively from the top down with little transparency about company decisions or direction, you might have a contemporary version of the “need-to-know” environment. This is the same type of environment that keeps Lumon’s employees in the dark. Think twice before asking for unquestioning adherence to protocols while offering vague explanations about their purpose or value. Severance fans, among others, have their radar up.Another red flag is the substitution of meaningful recognition with performative rewards. When companies replace fair compensation and growth opportunities with elaborate symbolic gestures, like Lumon’s coveted “music dance experience” privilege, they’re often distracting from fundamental workplace issues.Does your organization maintain rigid hierarchies in which employees are discouraged from building genuine connections or discussing their roles across departments? These are the kind fo intentional isolation tactics that Lumon uses to prevent collective awareness and action. These divisions aren’t just organizational inefficiencies; they’re strategic barriers designed to maintain control.Severance may be science fiction, but it’s uncomfortably accurate portrayal of corporate culture’s darkest tendencies makes it essential viewing for anyone leading an organization today.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
