  "text": "The Federal Aviation Administration is the latest federal agency to experience the fallout of the Trump administration’s job cuts. Given the timing of the firings, coming in quick succession after a series of deadly plane crashes, lawmakers and experts are calling foul.“There is widespread, bipartisan agreement that our National Airspace System must be improved, but the Trump Administration’s indiscriminate termination of FAA personnel raises safety risks instead of advancing needed reform,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a letter on Feb. 19 to Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy. “The FAA and DOT simply cannot take safety for granted, and I hope you will work to renew your agency’s focus on safety, beginning by immediately reinstating the recently-fired FAA employees.”Duffy detailed the firings in a Feb. 17 post on X, sharing that “less than 400” FAA employees were let go, all of whom were probationary. “Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel were let go,” he added.Dave Spero, president of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists (PASS), the union that represents about 11,000 FAA and Department of Defense workers, released a statement on Feb. 18, clarifying that it represents 132 of the probationary workers that were fired. “The administration is saying that none of these positions are critical safety positions. They’re all critical safety positions. Everybody that works in the FAA is critical,” Spero tells Inc. “But these folks, they work directly to support the frontline workers.”Titles of the eliminated employees include aeronautical information specialists, who are responsible for evaluating, choosing and preparing maps, procedures and flight paths; and maintenance mechanics, who maintain and repair facilities, grounds and buildings where air traffic controllers and technicians work. Also affected were aviation safety assistants who maintain office records, supplies, data reports, and provide logistics support. “They have to keep their hands off of the FAA,” Spero says. “I get that there’s a political effort to try to make the government smaller, but when you’re dealing with the FAA, everything you do has to be thoughtful. We don’t introduce risk into the National Airspace System, no matter how small one thinks it is.”These layoffs are part of a broader initiative by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), that has resulted in thousands of government layoffs so far. And they come even as the FAA has been dealing with a decades-long shortage of air traffic controllers that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that staffers say has contributed to “an unsafe environment to work and for the flying public,” CNN reported. Although PASS does not represent air traffic controllers, Spero flagged that the technical workforce is also short about 800 workers, and anticipated a “chilling effect” from the firings.“I’m not quite sure how you can now recruit technicians into the workforce, how you can recruit aviation safety inspectors into the workforce, with the chilling effect that this has created across the federal government,” he says.The firings also follow a series of aviation accidents—some fatal—that have left American travelers shaken.Earlier this week, a Delta passenger jet, landing in Toronto, lost a wing, burst into flames, and flipped over on the runway—although everyone aboard survived. Earlier this month, a commuter plane crashed in Alaska, killing all 10 people aboard. At the end of January, a medical transport jet carrying six crashed in Philadelphia, killing everyone aboard and one person on the ground. Just two days prior, a mid-air collision between an American Airlines commercial flight and an Army helicopter in late January killed all 64 aboard and three soldiers on the helicopter, the deadliest aviation accident in the U.S. since 2009. In spite of recent incidents, air travel remains the safest mode of transportation, particularly compared with motor vehicles. A 2024 study from MIT found aviation safety has continued to improve in recent decades, and passengers are now about 39 times safer when flying than they were from about 1968 to 1977.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
