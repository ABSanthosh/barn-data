  "text": "May 4, 2025 8:45 AM My Games Castle hits $1 million a week in revenue.Image Credit: My Games My.Games said its Castle Duels strategy game has hit $1 million in monthly revenue in both March and April. The European game developer and publisher said the revenue reflects steady growth and continued player interest. Since its launch in 2024, Castle Duels has surpassed 2.6 million installs and reached over $6 million in lifetime revenue. In Castle Duels, players balance offensive and defensive tactics, battling to destroy enemy castles while defending their own. Featuring a dynamic card-based system, players summon units like mages, minotaurs, ghosts, and succubi for fast-paced, real-time combat. With over 30 unique units, from common to legendary, players can build personalized teams and strategize to outsmart their opponents. “We’re thrilled to see so many players enjoying Castle Duels and helping it grow so quickly,” said Aleksei Moshkovich, lead project manager at Castle Duels at My.Games, in a statement. “We want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our amazing community for their support. This is just the beginning — we have plenty of exciting updates planned to continue delivering a fun and dynamic experience for our players.” To celebrate this achievement, Castle Duels is rolling out a new update featuring Glyphs and introducing a powerful new Legendary Unit — the Chef. Leading the update are Glyphs, a brand-new feature that adds a deeper layer of strategy to the game. These powerful enhancements are designed for Legendary units and come in Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary tiers. Glyphs boost stats, unlock passive abilities, and enhance unit powers in unique ways. Equip them by unlocking a socket with Minerals and Gold, spin for a random Glyph, and customize your unit’s abilities to dominate the battlefield. Also joining the fray is the Chef — the latest Legendary unit to heat up the action. A fast and unpredictable attacker, the Chef specializes in dodging blows and delivering lightning-quick dashes that deal massive damage. His special seasoning debuffs enemies, while his lightning dash gives him a chance to strike twice. Available for a limited time in the Starseeking event, the Chef brings deadly flavor to any lineup. The game is on iOS and Android. GB Daily Stay in the know! Get the latest news in your inbox daily Read our Privacy Policy Thanks for subscribing. Check out more VB newsletters here.
