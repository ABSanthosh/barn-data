  "text": "The Department of Government Efficiency isn’t just taking a chainsaw to the government workforce. DOGE is making some significant cuts to the federal real estate portfolio as well, something that could have repercussions for the commercial real estate market.Pushed by DOGE, the General Services Administration (GSA), which oversees the government’s real estate holdings, has sold 13 buildings since the beginning of the Trump administration. And DOGE, in a posting on X, said another 68 are on the market right now.The GSA does not publicly list who buys its properties, so it’s difficult to say whether the properties that have been sold will continue to be used as office space or if they’ll be repurposed for some other use, such as multifamily housing. To date, it has not listed sale prices either.Much like the DOGE-driven staff reductions at government agencies, there has been a fair bit of confusion about the real estate liquidation process. In early March, the GSA listed 443 properties it planned to dispose of, including the headquarters of the FBI, Social Security Administration, Census Bureau, Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice. It quickly pulled that list down.Late last month, a new list went up, with just eight properties listed for “accelerated disposition.” The GSA has been adding to that list since that time. As of Friday, there are 23 listed across the nation, including three in Illinois and two each in Utah and Texas. It’s unclear how DOGE calculated its 68 listings figure.Real estate does appear to be a growing area of focus for DOGE, however. Earlier this week, Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Delivering on Government Efficiency Oversight Subcommittee held a field hearing focused on the government’s real estate portfolio at the Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building (the former home of USAID).“The federal government owns a massive real estate portfolio of more than a quarter-million buildings,” Greene said. “Taxpayers spend about $10 billion dollars annually just to operate and maintain it all.”Beyond whatever the government gets for the sale of these buildings, which the GSA labels as “functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use by our federal workforce,” there are additional ongoing savings. The GSA estimates the sale of these properties will save more than $430 million in annual operating costs.Agencies that are in the buildings being put up for sale could move to other government properties or the GSA says it could lease the space back for the buyer.The commercial real estate market is in a fragile state right now, though, since so many companies have scaled back their office footprints following the pandemic and return to office edicts have met with resistance from workers. Some lawmakers have also raised concerns about the economic and logistical impact of the sales.The GSA, however, leases only about 1.7 percent of total U.S. office inventory across more than 1,800 cities, according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE. While areas like Washington, D.C., suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia could feel an impact, due to high concentrations of government-owned buildings there, other cities are likely to be spared significant disruption. “Since GSA disposition data is ever changing, how these owned buildings will affect the office market once sold remains unclear,” wrote CBRE in a blog post. “However, it is unlikely that these buildings will be reused as office space without significant improvements. Additionally, the sale of some of these properties could lead to retrofit, demolition, or adaptive reuse projects, which could have positive impacts within certain markets and submarkets, especially where there are clusters of these buildings.”Critics, though, say the rapid pace DOGE is urging for the sale of part of the government’s real estate portfolio could bring about new problems. Agencies could be disrupted from doing their work, and a quick sale could prevent the GSA from getting the best price for the properties. The sales also come as 2.3 million civil servants have been ordered back to offices full time.Some of that skepticism came from Green’s own committee. “The last administration disposed of property, saving nearly $2 billion for American taxpayers, and recently, Congress worked together to pass bills for additional tools to reform and consolidate the federal property inventory,” said Representative Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.). “Instead of building on these successes and continuing to do what could be characterized as the tedious analytical work on behalf of Americans, the Trump administration is currently taking a fire sale approach of looting the federal government and stripping it for parts to pay for tax cuts that we know will come up in their reconciliation deal.”Experts who testified before that panel, meanwhile, warned about moving too fast.“My concern is that this is not being done judiciously,” said Ron Kendall, executive chairman emeritus of the National Federal Development Association. “Disposal is not the enemy. It’s how it is done, and it must be done carefully with deliberate study.”The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
