I also don’t think it’s a harmless joke. I’m not the only one. Blonde Musings posted this question on X. If the terms “work wife” and “work husband” are harmless, why not call it “work brother” or “work sister”? Because it’s not platonic. And as if to prove her point, these cards popped up in my feed: so this is wild. pic.twitter.com/YlVO74T2PK— christina 🥀 (@abarefootmomma) February 11, 2025 This type of thing may seem funny and harmless, but it’s not. And, in fact, the card on the right’s full text reads: “For my work husband on Valentine’s Day. I’ve finally found someone just as inappropriate as me.” That may be funny, but it’s not harmless. Why you should discourage work spouses Managers shouldn’t be overbearing about how their employees work together. As long as everyone is productive and complying with all laws, let it go. But the work spouse thing is teeming with potential problems. The idea of a work spouse is that this is your most treasured work relationship. But when it goes beyond a work BFF to work spouse, that’s even more concerning. Spouses are supposed to be people you are devoted to above all others. When people get married they generally make vows that specify that. If employees have relationships where they prioritize a co-worker above all others, you can run into the same issues you would if it were a romantic relationship. Many companies prohibit romantic relationships within teams, but these types of intimate relationships even without the romance can cause problems. I know people will say I’m just a mean old HR lady who doesn’t understand the joke, but it’s precisely because I’m an old HR lady that I do understand that it’s not a joke. And when you reach the point of buying Valentine’s cards for each other that are beyond the ones you hand out in elementary school to the whole class, problems are on the horizon. Examples of work spouse problems A discussion on Reddit elicited the following comments: It comes in a two-pack with “Sorry to Hear About Your Divorce.” It’s just a cutesy way of saying “person from the office whom I want to have an affair with” To my emotional affair Yep—ex-husband cheated on me with his “work wife” and now I’m highly suspicious of anyone who uses that term. Especially when “colleague” is right there. For sure, because if someone called me their work husband I’d 100 percent pull them aside and tell them to knock it off. I already have a wife, it’s not you. It’s intimate and everyone knows it. It’s not a good path to go down, and if you hear people referring to their co-workers as their work spouses, it may be time to say, “Hey, you need to have professional relationships here.” And if the work spouse is going just one way—if one person identifies a co-worker as a “work husband,” but he doesn’t call her his “work wife,” that could be a sign of harassment. Blame it on the mean old HR lady if you have to. They can email me to complain. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
