Although prices have dropped significantly – by up to 80 per cent for rooftop solar systems in the last decade, according to the IEA – navigating the complexities of financing and calculating long-term savings can be daunting.  Enter Prêts, a Dutch startup revolutionising the energy transition for homeowners with its innovative embedded finance solution. The company makes sustainable home upgrades like solar panels and insulation both accessible and budget neutral, ensuring that homeowners can invest in their future without financial strain.  The platform is built around two key components. First, it features a return-on-investment calculator that allows homeowners to see exactly how much money they will save by making energy-efficient upgrades. These insights are personalised based on each home’s specific energy usage and budget.  Second, Prêts simplifies the financing process by offering independent, easy-to-understand insights into available lending options. The platform ensures that loan repayments align with the energy savings generated from the upgrades, making most projects effectively budget neutral. This approach empowers homeowners to improve their properties without increasing their monthly expenses.  What sets Prêts apart is its seamless integration with utility companies, allowing customers to access these tools directly within their energy provider’s app or website. By partnering with the startup, utilities position themselves as leaders in the energy transition, offering increasingly climate-conscious customers a clear path to sustainability. Meanwhile, Prêts handles all the back-end operations, including data infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and financial management.
