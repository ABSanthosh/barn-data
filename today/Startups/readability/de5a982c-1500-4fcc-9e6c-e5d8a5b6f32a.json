The company may be the first to produce a commercial run with a negative carbon footprint. Located in the southern Belize rainforest, Copalli has an extremely light impact on the environment and a large positive impact on the local community. It is made from just three, low-carbon ingredients: heirloom varieties of non-GMO sugar cane harvested on site, rainwater collected on site, and non-genetically modified yeast to start the fermentation process.   The distillery’s boiler system is powered by biomass derived from spent sugar cane, and organic waste products from the distillation process are recycled as natural fertiliser for the cane fields. Processing, distillation, bottling, and packaging all take place locally in Southern Belize, reducing transportation costs and emissions.  The company goes even further, weeding the cane fields by hand and using no pesticides. Regenerative agriculture practices are used to promote biodiversity and encourage local flora and fauna. The rum is also aged in used oak barrels, so no trees are felled, and packaging is kept minimal, with no secondary packaging, gift boxes, or inserts. The distillery also places an emphasis on human capital. It is the largest non-government employer in Southern Belize and pays a competitive wage. The distillery maintains a trust, which provides grants to be used for the benefit of the people and communities within the local community. Copalli Rum also supports Hillside Health Care International, an NGO that brings free healthcare to Southern Belize, and Claver College Extension Program, an adult education programme.
