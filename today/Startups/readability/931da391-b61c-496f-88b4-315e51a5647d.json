Photo: Getty ImagesListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00Mississippi on Wednesday became the latest state to sign an agreement with NVIDIA to advance the adoption of artificial intelligence efforts statewide.The memorandum of understanding, which did not provide many details, is intended to strengthen the state economy by embedding AI into more company workflows, offering workforce development training and carving out more AI-focused research opportunities. “We’re not here to do it all, but what we try to do is unlock potential,” said Louis Stewart, the head of strategic initiatives for the developer ecosystem at NVIDIA. “We provide the tools, the training and the ecosystem support so that the states, the schools, and the startups can build their own future with AI.”In the agreement, NVIDIA said it will work with colleges to roll out AI training programs, in addition to leveraging in-house resources, like its Deep Learning Institute, which offers technical training with advanced, clustered supercomputers. Among its most popular courses are “Gen AI Explained,” “Fundamentals of Deep Learning” and “Building RAG Agents with LLMs.”Agriculture is a staple of Mississippi’s economy, as is manufacturing. While it might be natural to couple AI with tech-heavy industries alone, it’d be a mistake to think that agriculture doesn’t stand to benefit. NVIDIA’s Stewart pointed out how a NVIDIA simulation model, called Earth-2, can help predict weather patterns down to 2 kilometers.“So if farmers and agriculturists are able to look at weather patterns and how they’re changing over time, they can actually change how they water, how their crops may yield, and build applications to better support the agriculture industry in Mississippi,” he explains. NVIDIA said hopes to democratize AI access across the nation through its partnerships. Five states are online as of now, though the company expects to tack on more by year-end. The chipmaker co-invests with states to help fund the partnership, but declined to share specific costs.“When people take our Deep Learning Institute courses, we’re covering the cost of their compute time because it’s hands-on learning on GPUs in those courses,” Stewart says. “There’s a lot of work that goes into the number we typically ask the state to invest in itself.”The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
