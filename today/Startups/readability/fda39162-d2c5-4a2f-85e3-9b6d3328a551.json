Revenue overall increased 16% to $65.6 billion.At Microsoft, \"AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,\" Nadella said.Though Microsoft's earnings were better than expected, the company's shares fell by more than 5% on Thursday because its predicted cloud revenue growth was less than expected.
