  "text": "Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have been rivals in a number of ways for years. The two have swapped places on the list of the world’s richest people several times. And both have rocket companies that have tangled over a $3 billion NASA contract. Now the billionaires could be squaring off in another arena: electric vehicles.Jeff Bezos is reportedly a backer of Slate Auto, a stealth Michigan-based EV company that looks to compete with Tesla and other manufacturers. The company, which launched as part of an incubator run by former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke, has quietly been operating since 2022. TechCrunch reports it has hired hundreds of employees from a wide variety of vehicle companies, ranging from Ford to Harley-Davidson. Chrysler veteran Christine Barman is listed as the company CEO.The goal? Building a two-seat electric pickup truck that would retail for just $25,000, perhaps as early as next year.Buyers, seemingly, would be able to customize their cars from that starting price point. Slate has filed for a trademark on the phrase “We Build It. You Make It.”Still, the overall price will almost certainly be considerably less than Tesla’s Cybertruck, which starts at $82,235. It’s also less than the Ford F-150 Lightning (which starts at $62,995), the Chevy Silverado EV ($87,300), GMC’s Hummer EV ($98,845), and the Rivian R1T ($69,900).That target base amount of $25,000, if accurate, would also be roughly half the price of the average new car in the U.S., which currently stands at $49,740. (The average EV is $53,248.)Bargain options for new car shoppers have been steadily disappearing from the market. Last August, Mitsubishi announced plans to discontinue the Mirage in the U.S. market, which started at just over $18,000. Detroit’s Big Three automakers — General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis — began doing away with compact and subcompact cars roughly six years ago, citing low profit margins and consumers’ increasing shift to SUVs and trucks. Today, the only sub-$20,000 car on the market is the Nissan Versa.In the EV space, Tesla abandoned its own plans for the Model 2 last year, a car in the same price range as Slate’s truck is said to be.An EV truck at such a low price point is an especially ambitious goal, but Slate Auto has been actively fundraising to achieve it. Last year, the company filed a Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission, stating it had raised over $111 million (with that total possibly jumping to $120 million after the filing). Among the related persons listed on that form was Melinda Lewison, who manages the Bezos family office, indicating he was part of the investment round.Slate Auto and Jeff Bezos did not respond to Inc.’s questions about his involvement with the company. The company has also reportedly filed paperwork with Delaware’s Division of Corporations listing 500 million preferred shares for a Series B round prices at $2.37 per share – which would raise nearly $1.2 billion.So what attracted Bezos to jump into the EV market? Slate’s history likely played a role. The company, which was founded as Re:Car, was initially part of Re:Build Manufacturing, a company founded by, among others, former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. Several of Re:Build’s team leaders came from Amazon as well.Bezos’ investment in Slate Auto doesn’t mean he plans to be as hands-on as, say, Musk has historically been with Tesla. Bezos has a net worth of $192 billion, according to Bloomberg. Through his family fund, he has bought into a variety of industries, including Perplexity AI and Figure AI as well as Uber.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
