  "text": "Rideshare companies are asking AI chatbots to ride shotgun. Lyft and Anthropic are teaming up to bring AI powered apps and tools to Lyft products. The announcement comes months after rival company Uber announced a similar deal with OpenAI.The companies announced the partnership on Thursday, stating that Anthropic’s AI system, Claude, is already at work powering Lyft’s customer service. Claude reportedly handles thousands of customer service requests daily, and has reduced resolution times by about 87 percent. The announcement noted Claude transfers complicated requests to human workers.“Lyft is using Claude to both reimagine the future of ridesharing, and at the same time deliver tangible benefits to their community today,” Michael Gerstenhaber, vice president of product Management at Anthropic, said in a statement.There are three initial components to the partnership. The companies together will build and roll out AI-powered apps for both riders and drivers; Lyft will participate in research testing of new features; and Anthropic will train Lyft engineers to build AI features.“Gone are the days when humans were predominantly writing code,” Jason Vogrinec, Lyft executive vice president of platforms, said in a statement. “With the promise of LLMs, especially leading models for coding like Claude, and agentic AI, we’re working to revolutionize our engineering organization to more effectively build game changing products for our customers.”Lyft and Anthropic did not respond to requests for additional detail about other ways Lyft drivers and riders could see changes, or whether Lyft had eliminated any jobs as a result.In October, Uber announced a deal with OpenAI to introduce an AI-powered assistant, but geared primarily toward drivers. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the time that the chatbot, which is expected to debut in early 2025, will help encourage Uber drivers to drive electric vehicles, but that the bot would address more than EVs later in the year, Reuters reported. Earlier this month, the two expanded that collaboration to include OpenAI’s new AI agent, Operator, which is meant to automate tasks.",
