  "text": "Meta is powering up and shelling out for its AI supercomputers.CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to social media network Threads on Monday to confirm reports that Meta is working to bring its 1 gigawatt (GW) AI supercluster, called Prometheus, online by 2026. The company is also working on a second, 5 GW supercluster, called Hyperion, which Zuckerberg wrote will be large enough to occupy “a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.” In actuality, Hyperion will be located in Louisiana, and Prometheus will be in New Albany, Ohio, according to TechCrunch.“Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher,” he wrote on Threads, adding that the company will invest “hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence.”Powering data centers like these requires a ton of energy. So how will they source it? According to a report from AI and semiconductor research and analysis company SemiAnalysis, natural gas turbines will play a role. Zuckerberg referenced the SemiAnalysis report in his announcement on Threads.In early June, The Ohio Power Siting Board approved plans from natural gas company Will-Power OH, a Williams Companies subsidiary, to build a 200-megawatt power generation facility in New Albany, Ohio, the home of Prometheus. The so-called Socrates South Power Generation Project will exclusively serve a facility built by Sidecat LLC, an affiliate of Meta. The company disclosed it is also working to get a second 200-megawatt facility approved in New Albany, called Socrates North Power Generation Project, and is targeting the third quarter of 2026 to get them both in-service. The Newark Advocate reported in March that just one of these facilities will require some 30 gas turbines and eight diesel generators.“The project will help bolster Ohio’s high-tech sector, further establishing the Columbus metro area as a growing hub for technology and innovation,” reads a fact sheet from Williams about the northern power station.Heatmap reported that Meta is also continuing to invest in renewables, announcing in late June agreements to procure about 440-megawatts of solar energy in Ohio.If powering AI computing power with natural gas sounds familiar, that’s because Elon Musk’s AI company xAI has been in hot water over its use of gas turbines to power its South Memphis Colossus facility. A group of politicians, nonprofits and activists have waged a noisy battle against xAI, which has been burning gas turbines without permitting. The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) threatened to sue xAI after capturing aerial imagery that revealed the facility had 35 gas turbines on site, 33 of which were emitting heat, indicating they were likely operating. SELC senior attorney Amanda Garcia previously told Inc. those turbines would make xAI the largest industrial source of smog-forming nitrogen oxides. “That is very concerning, given that the community is already not meeting minimum federal air quality standards that are set based on the effects on public health,” she said.For its part, Meta has already run afoul of local communities surrounding another of its data center projects. Construction on a $750 million data center in Newton County, Georgia has damaged local wells, sent municipal water rates surging and could contribute to a water shortage within the next five years, according to a report from The New York Times.Representatives for Williams and Meta did not respond to Inc’s requests for comment.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
