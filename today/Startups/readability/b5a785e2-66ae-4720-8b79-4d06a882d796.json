  "text": "For a lot of people, travel is a paradox. On the one hand, there is something magical about getting to visit a new place or see your friends or family. On the other hand, travel means spending time in an airport—which, in a lot of cases consists of equal parts chaos, misery, and exhaustion. That’s because airports are generally designed to move as many people through them as efficiently as possible. Efficiency is fine, but it means that everyone gets the same unexceptional experience. That’s fine, because—for the most part—most people don’t expect anymore. They look for the most affordable flight that will get them to where they want to go. But, if you travel a lot, you start to expect more. If you’re an airline, that’s a problem. A big part of how your customers feel about your business and their travel experience takes place in the airport before they ever get on one of your airplanes. Delta Air Lines has a solution to that problem, and I think it’s one of the smartest ideas I’ve seen in a long time. I visited the Delta One Lounge at LAX, which opened to the public today, and it is very much not the typical airport experience. Delta has a completely separate check-in area for Delta One customers, with its own private security checkpoint. From there, you board a private elevator that takes you directly to the Delta One Lounge. The entire experience from curb to lounge took less than five minutes. The lounge—by the way—is beautiful, but that’s not really the point. All of Delta’s new SkyClub lounges are beautiful, and this lounge is no different. It’s comfortable with plenty of different types of places to sit. To be honest, all of Delta’s new lounges are very nicely done. Next door to the Delta One Lounge is Delta’s LAX SkyClub, which is more than 35,000 square feet. It’s also gorgeous. Delta One Lounge at LAX. Photo: Jason Aten The difference isn’t in the furnishings, it’s in the experience. The lounge itself isn’t huge. It’s relatively modest by the standard of airport lounges, with seating for around 200 guests. But every one of those guests receives the type of service you would expect in a high-end restaurant, not an airport lounge. That’s because, for a certain type of traveler, the expectations are higher than a free buffet and some house cocktails. “Delta has been on a journey to become the premium airline,” said Claude Roussel, who is responsible for Delta’s lounges. “On the lounge team, we play our part in that. We’ve worked now for the past 10 years in really making the SkyClub a reason to fly Delta. We’ve upgraded all our SkyClubs and finally, now, we are at the point where we can focus on the Delta One.” The reason is right there in the first sentence—Delta wants to be seen as a premium airline. Of course, premium customers expect more. They expect a smooth experience at the airport, and they expect personalized service—two things the company aims to deliver through the Delta One experience before a customer ever gets on a plane. “What we focus on is on the hospitality, the level of food, the quality of our service, and the training of our people,” said Roussel. “That’s the core of what this is about—your experience.” That means no buffet or waiting in line for a drink. It means hand-crafted drinks and gourmet food options. Delta even partnered with local women-owned businesses like Sqirl, an LA favorite. Photo: Jason Aten The entire thing is a high-touch experience that caters to what Delta clearly sees as its most valuable customers. That makes sense—travelers willing to pay extra for Delta One expect more. Delta says that two-thirds of travelers here are flying on one of the airline’s transcontinental flights to JFK, Boston, or Washington, D.C., as opposed to international business class to Europe or Asia. It’s a different type of traveler and a different vibe from your typical airport lounge. Photo: Jason Aten Honestly, based on the day one experience, Delta has nailed it. I spent some time in the Delta One Lounge on opening day. For breakfast, I ordered a breakfast croissant that featured the best scrambled eggs I’ve ever had… anywhere. The Delta One Lounge at LAX (as well as the one at JFK) is open to passengers traveling in Delta One, its most premium cabin, as well as its Delta 360 customers traveling in first class. It’s also open to passengers in the top cabin on a number of its partner airlines. The lesson here is pretty simple: For Delta, the payoff is in being the first choice of those customers. It’s in delivering the premium experience it aims for, and that those customers expect. If you can create a personalized experience in what is normally a sea of chaos, customers take notice. Not only that, but they’re willing to pay for that type of experience. It doesn’t get much smarter than that. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",
