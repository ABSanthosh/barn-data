  "text": "Remedy Entertainment unveiled a new gameplay trailer for FBC: Firebreak, a three-player co-op FPS where the Federal Bureau of Control’s first-response unit must contain an escalating paranatural threat.  When the Oldest House, the Bureau’s shifting headquarters, falls under siege by a relentless paranatural force, only Firebreak – its most adaptable response unit – has the skills and courage to restore order.  Launching in summer 2025, FBC: Firebreak is Remedy Entertainment’s first self-published game — a big milestone for the Espoo, Finland-based game company as it turns 30 years old — and will be available on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. A mid-priced title, FBC: Firebreak will also be available day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium). The trailer is here. FBC Firebreak is Remedy’s first self-published game. FBC: Firebreak is a session-based, multiplayer PvE experience set within the acclaimed Control universe, delivering intense cooperative action. The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability.  The latest trailer showcases one such Job, Paper Chase, where an outbreak of rogue sticky notes in the Executive Sector of the Oldest House – seemingly harmless at first – spirals into a full-blown paranatural crisis. Players must push through three escalating zones, culminating in a chaotic showdown against a towering, gargantuan manifestation of these anomalies. I laughed out loud when I saw the sticky notes in the demo. It reminded me of the guy killed by paperwork in the film Brazil. FBC Firebreak takes place in the Control universe. Before diving into a Job, players choose their Crisis Kit. Crisis Kits shape each Firebreaker’s playstyle, providing distinct weapons, tools, and powerful reality-bending augments that can turn the tide of a mission.  Jump Kit – Focused on electricity-based abilities, excelling in field control and mobility.  Fix Kit – A heavy-hitting kit built around impact-based attacks, including a massive wrench.  Splash Kit – A water-based kit specializing in manipulating battlefield conditions and supporting teammates.  Remedy will continue expanding FBC: Firebreak with post-launch content. All future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. More details will be shared in the future.  Remedy will host a special community AMA on the FBC: Firebreak Steam page on March 31 at 9 a.m. Pacific time. The game does not have a main campaign in a traditional sense of a story. There are a collection of jobs for you to complete. Thomas Puha, spokesman for Remedy Entertainment, said in a press briefing that Remedy has moved from working on two games at a time to four now. That’s a big change. Annapurna Pictures is also co-financing a Control title being financed by Remedy. Remedy now has 380 people. “It is a smaller-scale, cooperative, first-person shooter for up to three players set within the iconic Control universe,” Puha said. The headquarters of the FBC, which is the Oldest House, was under assault by the Hiss, which are these kind of nasty resonance monsters from another dimension. The FBC decided to lock the doors to keep the Hiss from escaping into the world, but that also locks the FBC and all of the people who are unfortunate enough to be inside that building inside with that invasion. Six years later, the doors to the oldest house are still locked, and supplies are now running out. It’s terrifying, and exterminating the Hiss has proven to be completely impossible. “So what happens when the Federal Bureau of Control actually loses control?” Puha said. “That is the story of FBC Firebreak.” Pick up and play FBC Firebreak has a lot of gadgets. The game is intended to be easy to pick up and play. Remedy is reducing the barriers between booting up the game and serving things with friends. “We want to have some way of playing this game with anyone else who wants to play it with us. And we’ll give you a lot of options to kind of create that experience,” Puha said. And the good news is, is that if you end up regretting your choice, or you get frustrated because, you know, the job isn’t really going well with what you chose, or anything else, you can actually choose this mid-job, or re-choose this mid-job and take something different. And the way that all of this comes together is a custom experience across a range of difficulties and set of lengths and complexities. The FBC doesn’t really expect you to survive, and you’re kind of expendable. There are a variety of weapons in the game, but it is not focused so much on crafting. In the lockdown, supplies are limited. Mike Kayatta, game director on FBC Firebreak, said he thinks of the tools as crafted DIY style.
