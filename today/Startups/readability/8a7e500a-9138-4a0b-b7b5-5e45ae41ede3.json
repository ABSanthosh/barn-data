  "text": "February 20, 2025 3:46 PM Image Credit: StreamElements StreamElements this week put out its latest State of the Stream report for January 2025. In most respects, the report shows typical behavior for Twitch’s audience — viewership numbers take a dive in December and then rebound after the new year, which happened in this case. However, not only do we have a new top streamer for the month, but the most-viewed games list has been shaken up by the arrival of Netease’s Marvel Rivals. According to StreamElement’s report, which was done in partnership with Rainmaker.gg, Marvel Rivals was the 4th most-viewed Twitch category in January based on hours watched. It joins the ranks of stalwarts like League of Legends and Grand Theft Auto V, and even outclassing titles like Fortnite and Dota 2. Twitch’s daily hours watched jumped from 54 million to 57 million in January, and its monthly hours watched came out to 1.77 billion. In addition to the shift in the games roster, Twitch also saw the return of Caedrel to the top of its streamers list, thanks in part to his activity during the Games Done Quick event. JonVlogs also joined the list after a “Brazilian celebrity-packed subathon,” according to StreamElements. Or Perry, StreamElements CEO, said in a statement, “While streaming viewership fluctuates month to month, one trend holds true on Twitch: audiences dip in December and rebound strongly after the holidays to kick off the New Year with a bang. January had additional highlights, including the newly launched Marvel Rivals disrupting the usual suspects by staying in the top 10 games for two consecutive months, while popular League streamer Caedrel unseated the regulars to become the month’s top streamer.” Despite the continued, proven success of Marvel Rivals, Netease recently laid off its North American development team. The Chinese development team apparently remains intact and continues to expand content for the title. GB Daily Stay in the know!
