  "text": "Anthropic, the fast-growing AI company behind the Claude family of AI models, has added a new voice mode to its consumer-facing mobile app. The voice mode, which is currently rolling out in beta to free and paid Claude users, can search the web and—exclusive for those with paid plans—connect to Google Workspace. Claude’s voice mode comes several months after Anthropic’s chief rival, OpenAI, debuted its own natural-sounding AI voices on the ChatGPT app. Famously, OpenAI was forced to remove one voice from its roster after actress Scarlett Johansson accused the company of cloning her voice without permission. Claude’s new voice runs on Claude 4 Sonnet, the company’s mid-sized AI model that was recently announced at the company’s “Code with Claude” event, according to an Anthropic spokesperson. The spokesperson also said that those selected for the beta will be able to choose between three voices; one that sounds like a British man, another like an American woman, and a third that sounds like an Indian woman. According to official documentation from Anthropic, Claude’s voice mode will be available to both free and paid members, with free members getting roughly 20-30 voice messages before hitting a limit. Paid members will have “significantly higher” usage limits, and will be able to connect the voice mode to Google Workspace, enabling the AI assistant to access users’ Google Calendar information and Gmail content. Organizations that use Claude’s enterprise plan will also be able to connect their Google Docs to Claude’s voice mode. In a social video announcing Claude’s new voice mode, a user asks Claude “when’s my first meeting?” In response, a British-sounding voice says that it will check the user’s calendar, and then adds that the first appointment is “Jenny’s school drop-off at 7:45am.” On screen, a list of further appointments appear with a link to the source of the information: Google Calendar. The video goes on to show the user asking Claude to search their Gmail inboxes for specific information, and search Google Drive to see if a colleague has recently uploaded pitch notes. Entrepreneurs may find the new voice mode handy for keeping on top of their schedules or checking in with projects while multitasking. It’s not difficult to imagine an entrepreneur asking Claude to check their email while driving into the office, for example. One thing Claude’s voice mode can’t do quite yet? Vibe coding. Anthropic confirmed to Inc. that while in voice mode, Claude can’t open or interact with artifacts, which are separate windows that Claude uses to work on tasks. If you prompt Claude with a request to design a mobile game based on your morning commute, for example, it would open an artifact, begin coding, and eventually deliver an interactive piece of software for you to mess around with. This process of using natural language to develop software is colloquially known as vibe coding, but at least for now, Claude can only participate via text. Your Tony Stark fantasies of programming applications with your voice will have to wait just a little bit longer. The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, May 30, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
