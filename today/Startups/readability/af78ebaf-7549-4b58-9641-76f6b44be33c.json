  "text": "June 11, 2025 4:17 PM Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5.Image Credit: Nintendo Nintendo of America announced that the Nintendo Switch 2 has sold over 3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days, becoming the fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever globally. The new system went on sales on June 5 around the world, with fans lined up at midnight sales in a number of places. The Kyoto, Japan-based company said it hopes to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles in its first year, on a pace to exceed growth of the original Switch. That’s a pretty good sales rate, despite an uncertain economy and a higher price than usual. Nintendo is selling the Switch 2 for $450 for the standard version and $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle. That means Nintendo generated at least $1.575 billion in sales in the first four days — and probably a lot more considering prices for accessories, controllers and more.",
