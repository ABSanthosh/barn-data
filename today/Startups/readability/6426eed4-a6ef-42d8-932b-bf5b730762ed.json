  "text": "For months now, founders have been sounding the alarm and repeating the same refrain: tariffs could destroy our companies. Beyond the costs, the sheer uncertainty about the Trump administration’s ever-changing policy has made it impossibly difficult for entrepreneurs to plan ahead. Now, we have some initial macroeconomic data showing the impact. In the first quarter of this year, the U.S. economy shrank for the first time since 2022, according to initial GDP estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Wednesday morning. Much of that decline was due to a surge in imports as companies stockpiled goods before the tariffs went into effect. That sounds grim, but one economist says founders have a much bigger problem to worry about than duties on imports. Joao Gomes, a finance professor and senior vice dean of research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, thinks entrepreneurs should be much more worried about the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.“If you’re in the entrepreneurship space, what’s coming—and what might be coming—on the immigration front is far more important,” said Gomes. “What we’re doing on the immigration front will have longer-term consequences for this country’s ability to innovate and the culture of entrepreneurship.”Gomes spoke with Inc. editor in chief Mike Hofman at the Inc. Founders House in Philadelphia on Tuesday and shared his views on tariffs, immigration, and other risks facing businesses amid recent market shifts. Here’s their conversation, which has been lightly edited for length, clarity, and grammar.Knowing that consumer sentiment seems to be softening and souring—how can companies think about that?I split consumers in two big groups. One is people who are relatively well off. Fifty percent of what is consumed in the U.S. is done by the top 20 percent, so if you are in that sector—what we call consumer discretionary—you have to worry about things like, “The stock market is down 10 percent.” Those kinds of things are going to make it difficult for folks to spend money on vacations and luxury in the coming year or so. The staples—food, clothing, school for the kids—those things you’ll pay for anyway, but you want people to have a little bit of disposable income to try new things. That’s going to be a little challenge. I worry about consumers at the bottom end. Defaults and delinquent payments on credit cards are really going up. They’ve gone up the last two or three months, and they’re really at a very high level, close to what they were 10, 12 years ago. That’s a big concern at the bottom end of the income distribution. We have lots of soft data—sentiment, surveys, people worrying about inflation—but in terms of hard facts, those two are pretty inexplicable. The stock market is down 10 percent. That is going to eat into people’s willingness to be extravagant in their spending, and at the bottom of the distribution, there’s a lot of credit card delinquency that we see already. So far, the job market has held up. But the question is: How long will that continue?These are first employment numbers after “Liberation Day,” when a lot of uncertainty came into play. We’re going to see a lot of firms not hiring or putting hiring on hold. Not a lot of job losses, which would have a big impact on consumers. But I think we’ll see a slowdown in hiring, and that will continue through Q2 and how long this uncertainty lasts. Are you surprised by the speed with which things seem to have swung?I’m very disappointed, I have to say. We knew that tariff discussion could lead here. We always thought that common sense would prevail, in the sense that the folks that are more sensible to the cost of tariffs would help sway the President. They didn’t, and we got to this point. Tariffs—let’s talk about that. What do you expect to see in terms of companies raising prices? What would you advise founders and companies to think about pricing strategy?My biggest concern is inventory. These shipments that get delayed or canceled, particularly out of China, are going to put pressure on inventories. I would be very careful about planning anything around there that depends on a steady supply chain. That’s the biggest unknown. I think inventory is going to be a real problem for the next three to three months.If things are not available, prices will go up. We have the dollar sliding, and that’s going to add to inflation. That’s going to be a problem that’s going to again eat into consumers purchasing power. Immigration is another issue you think is a sleeper economic issue. Can you talk about that?If you’re in the entrepreneurship space, what’s coming—and what might be coming—on the immigration front is far more important. Tariffs are a solution in search of a problem. We’ll have more tariffs than we used to, but it’s not going to be a big deal two, three years down. I think immigration is a much bigger problem. So much of entrepreneurship is either because immigrants start businesses or play a big role as a key employee in the development. This is a statement of statistics. It’s not a philosophical statement. What we’re doing on the immigration front will have longer-term consequences for this country’s ability to innovate and the culture of entrepreneurship 20, 30 years from now. That starts with people not coming here to get degrees because they don’t feel comfortable coming to the U.S. and exposing themselves to the uncertainty of being deported. I worry about that a lot more.At a time when the U.S. is taking this really aggressive posture to the rest of the world, what do you see other major economic powers doing?Trying to become self-sufficient, which is difficult. Most other countries are far more vulnerable to the economic damage from tariffs than we are. For us, these would be inflationary. For them, they’ll be deflationary. They probably cause a recession. If it’s a game of chicken and who’s going to fold. If we have patience, they’re more likely to fold than we are. There’ll be serious economic damage in the short term. The question is: are countries like Vietnam, Korea more likely to say, “We want to do business in Asia. We don’t find being dependent and tied to the U.S. a reliable way of growing in the future.” One dimension where I see this as a big concern is in terms of capital flowing into the U.S. One thing that really enables our growth, our cheap mortgages, our plenty funding for VCs and so on, is the fact that we have half a trillion dollars coming from the rest of the world to invest in the U.S. to buy government bonds, to fund mortgages, to fund all sorts of things. That money was available to be deployed. That is going the other way right now, because people are starting to have some nervousness. Do I want to have assets in dollars? Do I want to have exposure to this country and this economy and this government? If that flips, the ability to fund whatever brilliant ideas we have in the future is going to be a lot more challenging. Preserving capital in the near term is a big deal. The U.S. being the global reserve currency, what benefits did we receive economically, in particular to the entrepreneurial sector, by virtue of having that be the case for the entire period from the end of World War II through February?We talk a lot about our dependence on the rest of the world, and they don’t buy any of our things. Our most successful export is the U.S. government bond. They buy plenty of that, and by doing that, they keep our rates at 3 percent. They keep our mortgage rates at 4 and 5 percent. They allow banks to take a lot of capital and fund VCs, hedge funds, and PE shops and do all sorts of deals that help fund our growth. If that capital evaporates—or at least significantly reduces—we have a big concern about funding our growth. Of all the closed doors, if we make ourselves independent of the rest of the world, that is the biggest threat.What if this challenge continues for two months, three months, four months, or even for years? What would you expect to see both among institutional capital and lenders? What would you advise people running companies to think about in terms of capital preservation?The most obvious place where I would think through my strategy is exit strategies. A lot of us think, “I’m going to work on this. I’m going to be successful.” At some point, there’s an exit plan that requires somebody with deep pockets to come and make you rich. That might take longer—significantly longer. They might not happen at all this year. Forget this year. That might take significantly longer going in a world where capital just doesn’t flow as easily. If you’re nimble, there’s always going to be plenty of opportunities. It is a story where the fittest will do very well, because your competition gets challenged. But you need capital, and you need to be nimble. You need to recognize that exit strategies are going to be much further into the future than what you might have thought.If folks have been running companies for more than a few years, they’ve managed through, lived through, and survived the COVID pandemic and the financial crisis. Are there lessons for how companies responded and things we can take from those moments?That’s a little bit outside my expertise, but I would say one thing is going to be different: The federal government does not have the financial resources or the will to bail out the economy this time. Those were two big differences in COVID. There were stimulus checks. For consumers, income was effectively replaced. This is not going to happen this time. If anything, cuts on federal spending will increase in the coming years. There’ll be plenty of opportunity, but you’ll have to make it yourselves. One of the things that you’ve been very worried about and very vocal about is the debt the U.S. government has and deficit spending year after year. Can you talk about what you see now? The conversation at an economic and policy-making level—do you see that as being constructive in this moment or is it more of the same?That’s the one silver lining of the tariffs. They bring potentially a significant amount of revenue to the federal government. Depending on the levels we settle in, we could be talking about $200 billion a year. This is a government that is currently borrowing $1.8 trillion a year. That’s money that is not available for mortgages, to fund businesses, other corporate investment. It’s this giant sucking machine that takes all sorts of resources out of capital markets. That will not last forever. We will see some adjustment at some point. My preferred analogy: If I was a doctor, I would say we have this patient that’s getting fatter and older. At some point, they will have a heart attack. I’m not sure if it’s next year, 2 years, 10 years, 20 years, but all the fundamentals look really bad. Tariffs mitigate that a little bit, which is why I don’t think they will go away, even if this president is replaced in four years with somebody from the opposite color. $200 million is a lot of money. Tariffs become addictive, and I think we’ll live with that. But it’s only $200 million out of $1.8 trillion. We have a big discussion about tax cuts coming up. That can cost a lot of money. They’re stimulative to the economy. That helps, but it’s going to make this problem worse. Are you surprised at this reaction in this moment, given the Trans-Pacific trade pact was something we were talking about not that long ago? NAFTA and other free trade agreements had bipartisan support very recently. It’s interesting to see an economic issue and economic policy swing so far, so fast.As an economist, the trade deficit, to me, is not a problem. It’s an obsession. But I understand enough about politics and political economy. It’s an issue that attracts a lot of votes, and that’s because a lot of people care about it. In that sense, as an economist, I am very disappointed that we have not done a very good job explaining this to people and explaining that whatever hardships they have in their lives are not being caused because of this. Politicians have helped here. It’s become a really easy thing to correlate the two things and say, “Your life is not going very well, and the blame is foreigners out there.” It’s a very easy story. So I’m not surprised, but I am saddened that we haven’t fixed that. We’re trying to deal with this now in a very bad way, in my opinion, but it’s addictive. So what if we move into a world where there are higher tariffs and there is less free trade? What does that world look like? If we go back to a period when that was the policy in the past, what trends did we see?This president and this administration strongly believes that the world at large, the great corporate entities of the world, want to do business in the U.S. In short, we have the best institutions. You know what you get when you do business in America. That’s the ideological belief. Frankly, other countries have the same thing. Other politicians say: We have the best worker protection laws. We have the best environmental protection—whatever it is—so people want to do business here.So closing the borders in some sense of tariffs, we’ll just have a lot of people that want to sell to Americans. They will come and produce in the U.S. That will create jobs. That’s a core belief. I don’t think as economists, we can say he’s wrong. I’m skeptical that he’s right, but I can’t say that he’s wrong. That’s the big unknown. We just have not had this experiment in seventy years. Will we have a big relocation of—I won’t say manufacturing, but a lot of service jobs we outsource—back to the U.S. or not over time? I don’t know. Obviously we’ll have problems with China. Those won’t go away. That is a long-term thing.Where is the workforce going to come from? All this is against the backdrop of an aging population, and especially an accelerated aging population. If immigration remains as is now, we have fewer people. Hopefully AI fills some of those jobs, but by no means is that a guarantee. What happens? That’s always been the best argument for immigration. I think people dismiss too quickly the fact that an aging population does not need to stop working in this modern world of ours. You may not want to work five days a week. You may not work four days a week. But when you can take a bunch of meetings over Zoom, it’s not the old world where you show up in the factory, and your back hurts. There’s no reason why we don’t encourage people and find different ways to have people in their 60s and their 70s stay productive. There’s all sorts of studies that show that this is beneficial to health, so there’s no reason why the aging population will create economic problems—unless we continue to insist on this view that 62, 65 you’re done, which is very old fashioned, and, in my opinion, very negative. What makes you optimistic about our future, even given the major challenges that we face?I grew up in Portugal. I love this country. I love the people of this country. The energy, the intelligence, the culture, and everything I love about the folks that I interact with, certainly the students, you can just see their drive and motivation. So I’m really optimistic, and I hope that you take what I say as, “Watch out for these things as you go about doing your business,” because that’s what I do. I make a list of the things I have to worry about. The things that could kill me. Then I want to avoid them. They’re just obstacles we have to navigate, and we always should be aware of those.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",

The conversation at an economic and policy-making level—do you see that as being constructive in this moment or is it more of the same?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s the one silver lining of the tariffs. They bring potentially a significant amount of revenue to the federal government. Depending on the levels we settle in, we could be talking about $200 billion a year. This is a government that is currently borrowing $1.8 trillion a year. That’s money that is not available for mortgages, to fund businesses, other corporate investment. It’s this giant sucking machine that takes all sorts of resources out of capital markets. That will not last forever. We will see some adjustment at some point. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy preferred analogy: If I was a doctor, I would say we have this patient that’s getting fatter and older. At some point, they will have a heart attack. I’m not sure if it’s next year, 2 years, 10 years, 20 years, but all the fundamentals look really bad. Tariffs mitigate that a little bit, which is why I don’t think they will go away, even if this president is replaced in four years with somebody from the opposite color. $200 million is a lot of money. Tariffs become addictive, and I think we’ll live with that. But it’s only $200 million out of $1.8 trillion. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a big discussion about tax cuts coming up. That can cost a lot of money. They’re stimulative to the economy. That helps, but it’s going to make this problem worse. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you surprised at this reaction in this moment, given the Trans-Pacific trade pact was something we were talking about not that long ago? NAFTA and other free trade agreements had bipartisan support very recently. It’s interesting to see an economic issue and economic policy swing so far, so fast.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an economist, the trade deficit, to me, is not a problem. It’s an obsession. But I understand enough about politics and political economy. It’s an issue that attracts a lot of votes, and that’s because a lot of people care about it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that sense, as an economist, I am very disappointed that we have not done a very good job explaining this to people and explaining that whatever hardships they have in their lives are not being caused because of this. Politicians have helped here. It’s become a really easy thing to correlate the two things and say, “Your life is not going very well, and the blame is foreigners out there.” It’s a very easy story. So I’m not surprised, but I am saddened that we haven’t fixed that. We’re trying to deal with this now in a very bad way, in my opinion, but it’s addictive. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what if we move into a world where there are higher tariffs and there is less free trade? What does that world look like? If we go back to a period when that was the policy in the past, what trends did we see?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis president and this administration strongly believes that the world at large, the great corporate entities of the world, want to do business in the U.S. In short, we have the best institutions. You know what you get when you do business in America. That’s the ideological belief. Frankly, other countries have the same thing. Other politicians say: We have the best worker protection laws. We have the best environmental protection—whatever it is—so people want to do business here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo closing the borders in some sense of tariffs, we’ll just have a lot of people that want to sell to Americans. They will come and produce in the U.S. That will create jobs. That’s a core belief. I don’t think as economists, we can say he’s wrong. I’m skeptical that he’s right, but I can’t say that he’s wrong. That’s the big unknown. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe just have not had this experiment in seventy years. Will we have a big relocation of—I won’t say manufacturing, but a lot of service jobs we outsource—back to the U.S. or not over time? I don’t know. Obviously we’ll have problems with China. Those won’t go away. That is a long-term thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is the workforce going to come from? All this is against the backdrop of an aging population, and especially an accelerated aging population. If immigration remains as is now, we have fewer people. Hopefully AI fills some of those jobs, but by no means is that a guarantee. What happens? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"content-chunk\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s always been the best argument for immigration. I think people dismiss too quickly the fact that an aging population does not need to stop working in this modern world of ours. You may not want to work five days a week. You may not work four days a week. But when you can take a bunch of meetings over Zoom, it’s not the old world where you show up in the factory, and your back hurts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s no reason why we don’t encourage people and find different ways to have people in their 60s and their 70s stay productive. There’s all sorts of studies that show that this is beneficial to health, so there’s no reason why the aging population will create economic problems—unless we continue to insist on this view that 62, 65 you’re done, which is very old fashioned, and, in my opinion, very negative. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat makes you optimistic about our future, even given the major challenges that we face?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eI grew up in Portugal. I love this country. I love the people of this country. The energy, the intelligence, the culture, and everything I love about the folks that I interact with, certainly the students, you can just see their drive and motivation. So I’m really optimistic, and I hope that you take what I say as, “Watch out for these things as you go about doing your business,” because that’s what I do. I make a list of the things I have to worry about. The things that could kill me. Then I want to avoid them. They’re just obstacles we have to navigate, and we always should be aware of those.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe final application deadline for the 2025 \u003ca href=\"https://www.inc.com/inc5000/apply\"\u003eInc. 5000\u003c/a\u003e is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT. \u003ca href=\"https://www.inc.com/inc5000/apply\"\u003eApply Today\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
