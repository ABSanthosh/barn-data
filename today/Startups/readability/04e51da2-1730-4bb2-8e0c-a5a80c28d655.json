  "text": "Health Feb 7, 2025 3:37 PM EST NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. winter virus season is in full force, and by one measure is the most intense in 15 years. One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor’s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. Last week, that number was clearly higher than the peak of any winter flu season since 2009-2010, according to data posted Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of course, other viral infections can be mistaken for flu. But COVID-19 appears to be on the decline, according to hospital data and to CDC modeling projections. Available data also suggests another respiratory illness, RSV, has been fading. READ MORE: Community health centers face funding delays after Trump administration freeze The flu has forced schools to shut down in some states. The Godley Independent School District, a 3,200-student system near Fort Worth, Texas, last week closed for three days after 650 students and 60 staff were out Tuesday. Jeff Meador, a district spokesman, called it the worst flu season he could remember. So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 24 million flu illnesses, 310,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths — including at least 57 children. Traditionally, flu season peaks around February. READ MORE: The U.S. dodged a bird flu pandemic nearly 70 years ago. Can we do it again? Overall, 43 states reported high or very high flu activity last week. Flu was most intense in the South, Southwest and western states. The CDC declined to let an Associated Press reporter speak to an agency flu expert about the upswing. The Trump administration ordered a temporary “pause” on health agency communications and has continued to refuse interview requests that were routinely granted in the past. U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination. About 44 percent of adults got flu shots this winter, the same as last winter. But coverage of children is way down, at about 45 percent this winter. It’s usually around 50 percent, according to CDC data. READ MORE: 5 years after it appeared, things we know and still don’t know about COVID About 23 percent of U.S. adults were up to date in their COVID-19 vaccinations as of late January, up from about 20 percent at the same point in time the year before. COVID-19 vaccination rates for kids were about the same, at around 12 percent. The government has not yet reported its estimates of how well this season’s flu vaccine is working. Testing results from patients indicate that two strains of seasonal flu that are causing most illnesses — a Type A H1N1 and a Type A H3N2. Health officials are closely watching a third strain — a bird flu known as Type A H5N1 — that has sickened tens of millions of animals, but is known to have infected only 67 people in the U.S. To avoid seasonal viruses, doctors say you should avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
