Creepz is backed by WME, major esports organizations, and Stoopid Buddy Studios. The company, created by an artist named Overlord, said it is unveiling a Web3-native intellectual property (IP) by delivering real entertainment products—not just speculation. As part of its official debut, Creepz is launching two flagship games powered by $CREEPZ, a native ecosystem token yet to be launched. The first game is Creepz Clas, a multiplayer shooter combining frenetic combat with strategic gameplay, bringing the Creepz universe to life. The second is the Redacted Party Game, a multiplayer party game designed for both casual and competitive play, offering an immersive social experience. Creepz has secured strategic partnerships that further solidify its position in entertainment culture. It has partnered withWME \u0026 ThreeSixZero Representation, which are agencies securing top-tier media and entertainment opportunities, as Creepz seeks to go beyond Web3. Creepz is making two Web3 games. It also has a Stoopid Buddy Studios collaboration. The creative force behind animated series like Robot Chicken and Crossing Swords will help bring the Creepz universe to life through storytelling and animation. And it has a partnership with esports company M80, which has been growing its brand in esports. Creepz said it wants to create a “seismic shift” in how Web3-native brands enter mainstream entertainment. Unlike other projects that rely solely on token speculation, Creepz is rolling outa full ecosystem at $CREEPZ TGE. It wants to create utility for its tokens. The company says it wants to set itself apart from previous NFTs and deliver an entertainment experience rather than a speculative asset. “Creepz isn’t just another NFT project—it’s the blueprint for how Web3 IP breaks into mainstream culture,” said the Overlord, creator of Creepz, in a statement. “Where others have stumbled, we’re proving that Web3 can power real entertainment experiences that captivate audiences globally. Gaming, fashion, and entertainment aren’t separate verticals for us—they’re part of one interconnected vision.” Creepz sees itself as a counterculture entertainment brand born from Web3. An outside view Creepz wants to be an entertainment brand. I asked Catalin Alexandru, founding economist for C/A, to review Creepz. In a message, he said, “They don’t have a litepaper or tokenomics so it’s hard to say if the NFT part fails the trilemma, but it probably does since all NFT games so far have. There’s no way to maintain all three: price floor, long term demand (by selling in-game power) and scale. (trilemma).” He added, “You either flood the market with pay to win NFTs to increase demand to scale which craters the price. Or your NFTs are only cosmetic and don’t offer power which limits demand to only scarcity, which scales but kills long term demand (Axie, Cryptokities). Or you offer only powerful and super expensive NFTs which again kills scale because you can only sell a few. Until people in Web3 understand this, it’s a non-starter kept alive temporarily with VC cash.” Overlord, the creator of Creepz, said in a response to Alexandru’s statement, “We appreciate Catalin’s insights on the challenges facing NFT \u0026 gaming x crypto. At Creepz, we’re taking a fundamentally different approach by building an entertainment brand first, with games that stand on their own merits. Our multilayered-game strategy with Creepz Clash and our party game creates diverse engagement opportunities beyond typical NFT utility models. By partnering with established entertainment forces like WME and Stoopid Buddy Studios, we’re creating lasting value through quality content rather than tokenomics alone.” Overlord added, “The full website launching soon will provide comprehensive details on our token design, ecosystem mechanics, and how we’re specifically addressing these economic challenges with our integrated approach. The Creepz ecosystem is designed for genuine entertainment experiences that resonate regardless of market conditions – a strategy we believe addresses the core issues Catalin has identified.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
