  "text": "The videos and PowerPoints embedded in this post are best viewed on steveblank.com We just finished our 10th annual Hacking for Defense class at Stanford. What a year. Hacking for Defense, now in 70 universities, has teams of students working to understand and help solve national security problems. At Stanford this quarter the 8 teams of 41 students collectively interviewed 1106 beneficiaries, stakeholders, requirements writers, program managers, industry partners, etc. – while simultaneously building a series of minimal viable products and developing a path to deployment. This year’s problems came from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, CENTCOM, Space Force/Defense Innovation Unit, the FBI, IQT, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. We opened this year’s final presentations session with inspiring remarks by Joe Lonsdale on the state of defense technology innovation and a call to action for our students. During the quarter guest speakers in the class included former National Security advisor H.R. McMaster, Jim Mattis ex Secretary of Defense, John Cogbill Deputy Commander 18th Airborne Corps, Michael Sulmeyer former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Cyber Policy, and John Gallagher Managing Director of Cerberus Capital. “Lessons Learned” Presentations At the end of the quarter, each of the eight teams gave a final “Lessons Learned” presentation along with a 2-minute video to provide context about their problem. Unlike traditional demo days or Shark Tanks which are, “Here’s how smart I am, and isn’t this a great product, please give me money,” the Lessons Learned presentations tell the story of each team’s 10-week journey and hard-won learning and discovery. For all of them it’s a roller coaster narrative describing what happens when you discover that everything you thought you knew on day one was wrong and how they eventually got it right. While all the teams used the Mission Model Canvas, Customer Development and Agile Engineering to build Minimal Viable Products, each of their journeys was unique. This year we had the teams add two new slides at the end of their presentation: 1) tell us which AI tools they used, and 2) their estimate of progress on the Technology Readiness Level and Investment Readiness Level. Here’s how they did it and what they delivered. Team Omnyra – improving visibility into AI-generated bioengineering threats. If you can’t see the team Omnyra summary video click here If you can’t see the Omnyra presentation click here These are “Wicked” Problems Wicked problems refer to really complex problems, ones with multiple moving parts, where the solution isn’t obvious and lacks a definitive formula. The types of problems our Hacking For Defense students work on fall into this category. They are often ambiguous. They start with a problem from a sponsor, and not only is the solution unclear but figuring out how to acquire and deploy it is also complex. Most often students find that in hindsight the problem was a symptom of a more interesting and complex problem – and that Acquisition of solutions in the Dept of Defense is unlike anything in the commercial world. And the stakeholders and institutions often have different relationships with each other – some are collaborative, some have pieces of the problem or solution, and others might have conflicting values and interests. The figure shows the types of problems Hacking for Defense students encounter, with the most common ones shaded. Team HydraStrike – bringing swarm technology to the maritime domain. If you can’t see the HydraStrike summary video click here. If you can’t see the HydraStrike presentation click here Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship This class is part of a bigger idea – Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship. Instead of students or faculty coming in with their own ideas, we ask them to work on societal problems, whether they’re problems for the State Department or the Department of Defense or non-profits/NGOs  or the Oceans and Climate or for anything the students are passionate about. The trick is we use the same Lean LaunchPad / I-Corps curriculum — and the same class structure – experiential, hands-on– driven this time by a mission-model not a business model. (The National Science Foundation and the Common Mission Project have helped promote the expansion of the methodology worldwide.) Mission-driven entrepreneurship is the answer to students who say, “I want to give back. I want to make my community, country or world a better place, while being challenged to solve some of the toughest problems.” Team HyperWatch – tracking hypersonic threats. If you can’t see the HyperWatch video click here If you can’t see the HyperWatch presentation click here It Started With An Idea Hacking for Defense has its origins in the Lean LaunchPad class I first taught at Stanford in 2011. I observed that teaching case studies and/or how to write a business plan as a capstone entrepreneurship class didn’t match the hands-on chaos of a startup. Furthermore, there was no entrepreneurship class that combined experiential learning with the Lean methodology. Our goal was to teach both theory and practice. The same year we started the class, it was adopted by the National Science Foundation to train Principal Investigators who wanted to get a federal grant for commercializing their science (an SBIR grant.) The NSF observed, “The class is the scientific method for entrepreneurship. Scientists understand hypothesis testing” and relabeled the class as the NSF I-Corps (Innovation Corps). I-Corps became the standard for science commercialization for the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy, to date training 3,051 teams and launching 1,300+ startups. Team ChipForce – Securing U.S. dominance in critical minerals. If you can’t see the ChipForce video click here If you can’t see the ChipForce presentation click here Note: After briefing the Department of Commerce, the Chipforce was offered jobs with the department. Origins Of Hacking For Defense In 2016, brainstorming with Pete Newell of BMNT and Joe Felter at Stanford, we observed that students in our research universities had little connection to the problems their government was trying to solve or the larger issues civil society was grappling with. As we thought about how we could get students engaged, we realized the same Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps class would provide a framework to do so. That year we launched both Hacking for Defense and Hacking for Diplomacy (with Professor Jeremy Weinstein and the State Department) at Stanford. The Department of Defense adopted and scaled Hacking for Defense across 60 universities while Hacking for Diplomacy has been taught at Georgetown, James Madison University, Rochester Institute for Technology, University of Connecticut and now Indiana University, sponsored by the Department of State Bureau of Diplomatic Security (see here). Team ArgusNet – instant geospatial data for search and rescue. If you can’t see the ArgusNet video click here If you can’t see the ArgusNet presentation click here Goals for Hacking for Defense Our primary goal for the class was to teach students Lean Innovation methods while they engaged in national public service. In the class we saw that students could learn about the nation’s threats and security challenges while working with innovators inside the DoD and Intelligence Community. At the same time the experience would introduce to the sponsors, who are innovators inside the Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community (IC), a methodology that could help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving threats. We wanted to show that if we could get teams to rapidly discover the real problems in the field using Lean methods, and only then articulate the requirements to solve them, defense acquisition programs could operate at speed and urgency and deliver timely and needed solutions. Finally, we wanted to familiarize students with the military as a profession and help them better understand its expertise, and its proper role in society. We hoped it would also show our sponsors in the Department of Defense and Intelligence community that civilian students can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and rapid prototyping of solutions to real-world problems. Team NeoLens – AI-powered troubleshooting for military mechanics. If you can’t see the NeoLens video click here If you can’t see the NeoLens presentation click here Go-to-Market/Deployment Strategies The initial goal of the teams is to ensure they understand the problem. The next step is to see if they can find mission/solution fit (the DoD equivalent of commercial product/market fit.) But most importantly, the class teaches the teams about the difficult and complex path of getting a solution in the hands of a warfighter/beneficiary. Who writes the requirement? What’s an OTA? What’s color of money? What’s a Program Manager? Who owns the current contract? … Team Omnicomm – improving the quality, security and resiliency of communications for special operations units. If you can’t see the Omnicomm video click here If you can’t see the Omnicomm presentation click here Mission-Driven in 70 Universities and Continuing to Expand in Scope and Reach What started as a class is now a movement. From its beginning with our Stanford class, Hacking for Defense is now offered in over 70 universities in the U.S., as well as in the UK as Hacking for the MOD and in Australia. In the U.S., the course is a program of record and supported by Congress, H4D is sponsored by the Common Mission Project, Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Corporate partners include Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Steve Weinstein started Hacking for Impact (Non-Profits) and Hacking for Local (Oakland) at U.C. Berkeley, and Hacking for Oceans at bot Scripps and UC Santa Cruz, as well as Hacking for Climate and Sustainability at Stanford. Jennifer Carolan started Hacking for Education at Stanford. Team Strom – simplified mineral value chain. If you can’t see the Strom video click here If you can’t see the Strom presentation click here What’s Next For These Teams? .When they graduate, the Stanford students on these teams have the pick of jobs in startups, companies, and consulting firms .This year, seven of our teams applied to the Defense Innovation Unit accelerator – the DIU Defense Innovation Summer Fellows Program – Commercialization Pathway. Seven were accepted. This further reinforced our thinking that Hacking for Defense has turned into a pre-accelerator – preparing students to transition their learning from the classroom to deployment See the teams present in person here It Takes A Village While I authored this blog post, this class is a team project. The secret sauce of the success of Hacking for Defense at Stanford is the extraordinary group of dedicated volunteers supporting our students in so many critical ways. The teaching team consisted of myself and: Pete Newell, retired Army Colonel and ex Director of the Army’s Rapid Equipping Force, now CEO of BMNT. Joe Felter, retired Army Special Forces Colonel; and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania; and currently the Director of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford which we co-founded in 2021. Steve Weinstein, partner at America’s Frontier Fund, 30-year veteran of Silicon Valley technology companies and Hollywood media companies. Steve was CEO of MovieLabs, the joint R\u0026D lab of all the major motion picture studios. Chris Moran, Executive Director and General Manager of Lockheed Martin Ventures; the venture capital investment arm of Lockheed Martin. Jeff Decker, a Stanford researcher focusing on dual-use research. Jeff served in the U.S. Army as a special operations light infantry squad leader in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our teaching assistants this year were Joel Johnson, Rachel Wu, Evan Twarog, Faith Zehfuss, and Ethan Hellman. 31 Sponsors, Business and National Security Mentors The teams were assisted by the originators of their problems – the sponsors. Sponsors gave us their toughest national security problems: Josh Pavluk, Kari Montoya, Nelson Layfield, Mark Breier, Jason Horton, Stephen J. Plunkett, Chris O’Connor, David Grande, Daniel Owins, Nathaniel Huston, Joy Shanaberger, and David Ryan. National Security Mentors helped students who came into the class with no knowledge of the Department of Defense, and the FBI understand the complexity, intricacies and nuances of those organizations: Katie Tobin, Doug Seich, Salvadore Badillo-Rios, Marco Romani, Matt Croce, Donnie Hasseltine, Mark McVay, David Vernal, Brad Boyd, Marquay Edmonson. Business Mentors helped the teams understand if their solutions could be a commercially successful business: Diane Schrader, Marc Clapper, Laura Clapper, Eric Byler, Adam Walters, Jeremey Schoos, Craig Seidel, Rich “Astro” Lawson.

Most often students find that in hindsight the problem was a symptom of a more interesting and complex problem – and that Acquisition of solutions in the Dept of Defense is unlike anything in the commercial world. \u003ca href=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?ssl=1\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" data-attachment-id=\"31009\" data-permalink=\"https://steveblank.com/2024/06/24/hacking-for-defense-stanford-2024-lessons-learned-presentations/h4d-matrix/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?fit=612%2C516\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"612,516\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026#34;aperture\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;credit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;camera\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;caption\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;created_timestamp\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;copyright\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;focal_length\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;iso\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;shutter_speed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;orientation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;}\" data-image-title=\"H4D Matrix\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?fit=300%2C253\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?fit=468%2C395\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?resize=300%2C253\u0026amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"253\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?resize=300%2C253\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?resize=150%2C126\u0026amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H4D-Matrix.jpg?w=612\u0026amp;ssl=1 612w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAnd the stakeholders and institutions often have different relationships with each other – some are collaborative, some have pieces of the problem or solution, and others might have conflicting values and interests.\u003cbr/\u003e\nThe figure shows the types of problems Hacking for Defense students encounter, with the most common ones shaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam HydraStrike \u003c/strong\u003e– bringing swarm technology to the maritime domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you can’t see the HydraStrike summary video click \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M2rCdFB50YvGX4foqTIzkCnoMhtjLlzk/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\nIf you can’t see the HydraStrike presentation click \u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nkqLyEw_TDZHVXdqgIS4aGKhFtMlzh4F/edit?usp=sharing\u0026amp;ouid=114260143662069864575\u0026amp;rtpof=true\u0026amp;sd=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMission-Driven Entrepreneurship\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThis class is part of a bigger idea – Mission-Driven Entrepreneurship.

I observed that teaching case studies and/or how to write a business plan as a capstone entrepreneurship class didn’t match the hands-on chaos of a startup. Furthermore, there was no entrepreneurship class that combined experiential learning with the Lean methodology. Our goal was to teach both theory and practice. The same year we started the class, it was adopted by the National Science Foundation to train Principal Investigators who wanted to get a federal grant for commercializing their science (an \u003ca href=\"https://www.sbir.gov/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eSBIR grant\u003c/a\u003e.)
