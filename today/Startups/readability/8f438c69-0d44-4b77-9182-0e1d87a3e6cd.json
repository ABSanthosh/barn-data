  "text": "iRobot, the Bedford, Mass.-based company that was largely responsible for the rise of the robot vacuum cleaner in homes, is warning investors there is “substantial doubt” about its ability to continue operating over the next year. The surprising announcement comes just over a year after Amazon abandoned its plans to purchase iRobot for $1.4 billion, saying the deal had “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union.” In its fourth quarter earnings results, released Wednesday, the company behind the Roomba vacuum reported that annual revenue fell almost 25 percent from $890.6 million in 2023 to $681.8 million in 2024. The company also said it had cut its total headcount by more than half since the end of 2023, but warned that it may not be able to continue to operate.“Our history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,” the company said in its 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That doubt, it added, could impact its “ability to raise capital or enter into strategic transactions, and our relationship with key stakeholders.”iRobot said it expected “substantial operating losses” to continue “for the foreseeable future” and warned it may not achieve a return to profitability, due to a “significant reduction in consumer demand.”Shares of iRobot were down more than 30 percent following the earnings release.So what’s next for iRobot?The “substantial doubt” phrase in the filing sets the stage for a possible bankruptcy filing or company shutdown, but that’s hardly a sure thing for iRobot.The company said its board of directors has launched a review of its strategic alternatives. That could result in either a refinancing or a sale of the company, if it can find another buyer. iRobot has also expanded the size of its board to add Neal Goldman, CEO of SAGE Capital Investments and a turnaround expert, as it conducts its review.While the earnings news is dire, iRobot isn’t planning to give up without a fight. On Tuesday, CEO Gary Cohen unveiled a number of new floor cleaning robots, the largest launch in the company’s history, in an effort to woo back consumers in an increasingly crowded field that includes brands like Samsung, Roborock, and Shark.Among the offerings were the Roomba 105 Vac Robot series, which the company says features 70 times as much suction as the Roomba 600 series, and the Roomba 205 DustCompactor series, which can pack vacuumed debris so tightly it doesn’t need to be cleaned for months. The new vacuums also will feature lidar navigation and mapping, a technology used by many competitors.The company warned, however, that there was “no assurance that the new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.”iRobot is saddled with debtiRobot took out a $200 million loan in 2023 to provide liquidity when it was in the middle of the since-cancelled Amazon deal. That loan, from Carlyle Group, carried a much higher interest rate than other loans typically do. Along with the increased competition the Roomba maker now faces, that debt has prevented the company from reaching profitability ever since.The company, in its earnings announcement, said it is paying a $3.6 million fee to amend the loan, which will be added to its debt.The scuttling of the deal with Amazon also led to CEO and founder Colin Angle’s departure from iRobot in January 2024. In a LinkedIn post announcing his departure, he expressed optimism for the company’s future at the time, but also noted the challenges of the robotic industry.“Robots are too complex.  Robots are too expensive.  Robots are too challenging for hope alone to have the slightest chance of success,” he wrote. “But combining the belief that a problem can be solved with a commitment to the work to solve it enabled us to change the world. That is the magic of iRobot.”Angle declined to comment on the company’s most recent problems. The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
