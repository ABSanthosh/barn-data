  "text": "The bill that the House of Representatives passed early Thursday morning in a nail-biting 215-to-214 vote—a wide-ranging domestic policy package called the One Big Beautiful Bill—could have wide-ranging and long-lasting implications for U.S. small businesses.Among its many provisions are an increased tax deduction for qualified business income at pass-through companies; a higher deduction for state and local taxes; and the extension of various other corporate and individual tax cuts that President Trump passed during his first term, which are otherwise set to expire at the end of this year.The total tax cut included in the bill is estimated to be around $4 trillion.“This is one of the more pro-small business pieces of legislation, in my opinion, in recent history,” says Jeff Brabant, vice president of federal government relations at the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business advocacy group that has been pushing for passage of the bill. “Hopefully this thing becomes law.”Despite substantial disagreements within the Republican party over the trade-offs between cutting taxes and keeping the federal budget balanced, Trump and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson managed to hammer together a bill that got the GOP just over the threshold needed to move the proposed legislation forward.Now, their colleagues in the Senate must consider the bill, too—and, as is widely expected, make further changes to it. That this bill would raise the national debt by trillions of dollars could prove to be an ongoing point of contention.“We’d love to see the Senate preserve the small business provisions as this moves forward,” Brabant says. “The House and Senate are pretty closely aligned … on the small business side, so I think we’re in good shape for the Senate to advance those provisions.”Johnson has said he hopes to get the bill to Trump’s desk, and signed into law, by July 4th.To understand the full scope of the Big Beautiful Bill, you need a little context about the TCJA, or Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, an influential bill from Trump’s first term atop which this new one is built.That 2017 package cut the corporate tax rate down to 21 percent, a move which many experts said would primarily benefit larger, more mature C corps. In order to give a leg up to businesses which instead use a pass-through structure such as a sole proprietorship, S corp or LLC, Republicans also included in the TCJA a provision called the qualified business income deduction, often called “199A” after its section in the tax code.(More than nine out of every 10 small businesses, and about 80 percent of small employers, are pass-throughs, Brabant says.)The TCJA allowed for a pass-through tax deduction as high as 20 percent. Now, the new bill raises that to 23 percent and makes it permanent. That’s the biggest change in the bill for closely-held businesses, says Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute.“Raising the 199A deduction to 23 percent will be a windfall to pass-through business owners, though it also will add more complexity to the tax code,” Gleckman says. “There is little evidence that the 2017 version generated any economic growth and it is unlikely that the higher deduction amount will either.”Alex Muresianu, a senior policy analyst at the think tank the Tax Foundation, agreed that pass-through businesses stand to benefit from the increased deduction—which he says “widens the tax preference for pass-through business income”–as well as the bill making permanent the TCJA’s individual income tax rates.If the 199A deduction isn’t at least renewed by the end of this year it will, like many elements of the TCJA, automatically expire. The GOP’s new bill, however, would make it permanent.Muresianu and Brabant also pointed to the bill’s increasing of the Section 179 expensing cap to $2.5 million as benefiting small business owners.“A lot of folks talk about bonus depreciation or immediate expensing; that doesn’t kick in ‘til you’re above the 179 thresholds,” Brabant explains of the policy. “So if you’re a small business owner and you have this permanence on this provision where for the first $2.5 million of expensings—you buy a new tractor if you’re a farmer; you buy any new piece of business equipment—you could immediately write it off in the first year, that’s a big deal.”Other elements of the new bill include a temporary end to taxes on some tips and overtime pay, as well as a new deduction for taxpayers 65 and older meant to fulfill his prior proposal to not tax Social Security benefits, per the New York Times. (Earlier this week, the Senate unanimously passed a separate, bipartisan bill implementing no taxes on tips.)Also included in the bill is an increase to the state and local tax, or SALT, deductions cap—another element of the TCJA that will sunset at the end of this year if not renewed. In a sop to high-tax states, the Big Beautiful Bill raises the cap on SALT deductions to $40,000 for people earning under $500,000 a year.Recent reporting has indicated that SALT was one of the key points of tension among Republicans in the lead-up to passage.“SALT does matter to some pass-through businesses,” Brabant says, but it’s not the biggest issue for small businesses. “It’s really gonna depend on the individual whether or not it’s going to be super helpful or not.”House Democrats, for their part, unanimously voted against the Big Beautiful Bill. Representative Jim McGovern called it “a tax scam designed to steal from you, the American people, and give to Trump’s millionaire and billionaire friends,” while Sen. Ed Markey—the ranking Democrat on the Senate’s Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee—called it an “assault on working families and businesses everywhere” that will raise costs across the board.“Small businesses are an afterthought in the Republican tax bill,” Markey said in a statement. “Half of the benefits for the so-called ‘small business tax deduction,’ or 199A, that Republicans seek to expand, go to the ultra-wealthy.”Some experts have warned that the Republicans’ plan could benefit the wealthy more than the poor, and may in fact be a net negative for low-income taxpayers when accounting for the attendant cuts to federal aid programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Among the bill’s provisions is a Medicaid work requirement which the New York Times calls the “strictest version Republicans in Congress have ever put forward” and that could reportedly leave millions uninsured.Jon Whiten, deputy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, says that the bill “will make the tax code harsher for immigrant families and citizen kids,” with the Big Beautiful Bill creating “new or stricter limits for immigrant tax filers” in ten additional areas of the tax code.ITEP has also argued that the proposed tax changes will primarily benefit the wealthy, with the bottom 20 percent of Americans getting one percent of the net 2026 tax cuts while the top 20 percent get two-thirds of the benefits.The bill now heads to the Senate, Muresianu says: first to the finance committee and then on to the whole chamber.“If it passes the Senate, it will go to conference, at which point the differences between the passed House version and the passed Senate version will be ‘reconciled,’” he continues. “Then the conference version would be brought to a vote in both houses before going to the president.”The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
