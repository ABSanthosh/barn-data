  "text": "Kristin Van Buskirk still has the boards she used to protect her windows during the 2020 protests – bedecked in baby pink and bright yellow hues by Black artists – at her home and gift shop, Woonwinkel, in Portland, Oregon. She hasn’t reinstalled them yet, but heading into this election day, she felt a sense of assurance: she has them if she needs them.  That prepared but precautious posture seems to capture the mood of businesses in Portland this election week – a city that saw months of unrest following George Floyd’s killing, and then additional protests after the 2020 election. (Although the latter were “limited in scope,” says Andrew Hoan, president and CEO Portland Metro Chamber, via email.)  This year, owners are talking more about their plans for potential disruptions than in the past, says Kristen Martin, owner of Bring! Treats for Dogs, a pet treat food truck also in Portland. But they’re also bullish on staying open. “There is more of an undercurrent of positivity than anything else that I have felt,” Martin says. “That being said, you still have to be prepared, because anything can happen.”  Indeed, across the country, many Americans remain on edge: in a recent poll from the American Psychological Association, more than 7 in 10 said they were “worried the election results could lead to violence.” Already, there are some “pocketed” planned demonstrations from various groups, including some pro-Palestinian groups, expected to occur in places like New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago, says Sara Pratley, senior vice president of global intelligence at AlertMedia, an emergency communication provider. But this time around, businesses are “more proactively planning” for potential disruptions, says Ty Richmond, president of event services at Allied Universal, a security and facility services company with headquarters in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania and Irvine, California. And that’s good news. “Planning is obviously, to me, the most critical and necessary activity, both to proactively and reactively adapt to the situation,” he says.  Here are tips from Richmond and other experts on how to best protect your business and teams this week, in the event of safety concerns:  There’s no such thing as too much information.First, business owners need to ensure that they stay “very close to credible information or intelligence,” says Khris Hamlin, vice president of asset protection at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade association for retailers.  That includes information from local law enforcement, public officials, and trade associations, Hamlin says. But it should also include local, state, and national news, social media, and local community groups, Richmond adds.  Specifically, business owners will want to stay abreast of where protests arise in proximity to their business and even where there might just be large swaths of people gathering that could impact “business continuity,” says Pratley. With that comprehensive, “situational awareness,” business owners can then “understand what’s happening around their people and businesses,” and “quickly identify if something actually erupts,” Pratley adds.  In short, Richmond says, “you cannot over-inundate yourself with information.” Know what’s needed to protect your assets.In addition to staying informed, you also must thoroughly understand your own assets, Richmond says. And “not only the physical assets,” he says, “but your human assets, your information assets. What do you have to protect, and what’s critical for you to protect from a work stream and a business continuity standpoint?”  Those answers will differ for each business. “You’re looking at parking lots, entrances- disruptive areas from a production standpoint that could hurt the productivity of services and products,” for instance, he says. Once you understand those, and the risks to them, “then you can get into mitigating solutions,” he adds.   For instance, some businesses are making staffing modifications this week, Pratley says, like considering whether certain team members should work remotely or limiting the number of team members on site.  Other businesses are applying lessons learned from 2020, Hamlin says: Some RILA members now have contingency plans to board their windows from the inside if a demonstration is taking place outside of their business, thus protecting their people while still protecting their business, he says.  Crucially, businesses must be ready to execute contingency plans not just this week, but in the days to come, Hamlin says, until “all elections across the country have been certified…and then just seeing what the temperature read is across the country at that point.”  Communicate quickly and transparently to your teams.In the event of a disruption – or potential disruption — company leaders must also be prepared to readily communicate that information to their employees.  For instance, Pratley says, let’s say a protest started near one of the business’s offices or where it has a concentration of remote employees. In that scenario, owners should have a reliable system in place to “quickly communicate with them to help them understand that situational awareness and then expectations.”  Even before any potential activity takes place, Hamlin says that many RILA members will communicate proactively to employees that they are “in touch with those that can share credible information” and will do “everything possible to ensure that that their employees are not put into harm’s way,” to put them at ease and open up lines of communication.  Martin has already met with her two employees at Bring! Treats for Dogs to clearly share her priorities around their safety, she says: “If at any time they do not feel comfortable coming downtown, they do not have to, and that’s just the way that the world should work.”  Still, as of now, Martin plans to be on site this week and open as usual. Van Buskirk is too, but she’s still partially bracing for the unknown: “I already need to place some reorders, and that’s a really exciting position to be in after some really hard years, but I will probably not push the ‘Place Order’ button until Wednesday or Thursday.”",
