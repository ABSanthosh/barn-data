  "text": "Somewhere along the way, we were all taught to say “we.” You were told not to tell your employees, “I made the sale,” even if you were the only person who met with the client. So you say, “We made the sale.” You were told not to say say, “My company.” So you say, “Our company.” Team-first leaders emphasize teamwork, unity, and collective effort. Team-first leaders celebrate shared success. Great leaders don’t use pronouns like “I” or “my.” Except when they should. ‘Owning Your Dependencies’ While pronouns signal collective belonging, they can also signal individual accountability. If you made a bad decision, “we” didn’t make it. “I” did. “We” didn’t expand too quickly. “I” did. “Our” pitch didn’t fall flat. “I” misread the room. When you’re in charge, it doesn’t matter if forces outside your control negatively affected your business. It doesn’t matter if an employee made a mistake. It doesn’t matter if a vendor didn’t come through. You take the hit. You take the blame. Granted, taking responsibility — especially when the words or actions in question clearly were not yours — might seem artificial. But not to Steve Jobs. In John Rossman’s book Think Like Amazon: Steve Jobs told employees a short story when they were promoted to vice president at Apple. Jobs would tell the VP that if the garbage in his office was not being emptied, Jobs would naturally demand an explanation from the janitor. “Well, the lock on the door was changed,” the janitor could reasonably respond. “And I couldn’t get a key.” If a janitor can’t open a door, they can’t do their job. It’s a reasonable excuse. As Jobs saw it, janitors are allowed to have excuses. Here’s how Rossman describes Jobs’s perspective: When you’re the janitor, reasons matter. Somewhere between the janitor and the CEO, reasons stop mattering. In other words, when the employee becomes a vice president, he or she must vacate all excuses for failure. A vice president is responsible for any mistakes that happen, and it doesn’t matter what you say. Rossman calls embracing that level of responsibility “owning your dependencies”: taking absolute responsibility for every possible dependency under your purview. That’s what great leaders do. They take full responsibility for errors. They take full responsibility for decisions. “We” don’t announce layoffs; “I” announce layoffs. “We” didn’t decide to let an underperforming employee go; “I” decided to let you go. The Science of “I” Research backs up that approach. A study published in Accounting, Organizations, and Society found that CEOs who use first-person singular pronouns when announcing negative news generate a more positive investor response. (“Positive response” defined as holding on to or increasing their current position.) To investors, using “we” sounded like the CEOs were deflecting responsibility, which led to a more negative response. Makes sense: as Daniel Coyle quotes Navy SEAL Dave Cooper in his book The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups, “The most important words a leader can say are, ‘I screwed that up.'” You need parts to complete an order, and the shipment from your vendor is late? You should have made sure commitments were clear. You should have put contingencies and redundancies in place. The late shipment may be the vendor’s fault, but making sure critical parts are on hand is your responsibility.  There’s a quote often credited to Ignatius: “Pray as if God will take care of all; act as if all is up to you.” The same premise applies to personal responsibility. Many people feel success or failure is caused by external forces, and especially by other people. If they succeed, other people helped them or supported them: other people were “with” them. If they fail, other people let them down, or didn’t believe in them, or didn’t help them: other people were “against” them. To an extent that is, of course, true. Again, no one ever does anything worthwhile on their own.  But great leaders don’t totally rely on others. Great leaders put contingencies in place. Great leaders shoot for the best, and plan for the worst. They set clear expectations. They communicate, a lot. They follow up. They mentor and guide and train. They lead and work through others — but they accept final responsibility. Why? Because the only thing they know they can control is themselves. They act as if success or failure is totally within their control. If they succeed, they caused it. If they fail, they caused it. As Jobs would say, when you’re in charge, “Reasons stop mattering.” You’re responsible. You’re accountable. When things go well, even if you did all the work? Stick to “we” and “we.” When things go wrong, use “I” and “my.” Because when you’re in charge, it really is up to you.
