  "text": "If there’s a capital gap for Latina-owned businesses (and there is—a study by Bain \u0026 Company, the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative, and the Latino Donor Collaborative shows Latino-owned businesses received less than 1 percent of nearly $500 billion invested in 2020), Isabel Rafferty Zavala, co-founder and CEO of Canela Media, is oblivious to it.Canela TV is a free streaming platform for Latino audiences, offering movies and TV for both English and Spanish speakers. Viewers can expect to find a section of movies dedicated to Mexico’s Golden Age of Cinema—featuring Maria Felix, Pedro Infante, and Cantinflas—alongside Brazilian soap operas and Hollywood films. The company has raised $35 million and is only five years old. “When you don’t know your limitations, you believe the sky is the limit,” says Rafferty Zavala. The Power of Betting on YourselfBefore launching Canela, Rafferty Zavala was already a successful entrepreneur: Mobvious, a media company she founded to better reach U.S. Hispanic and African American audiences through mobile advertising, became the largest Hispanic-focused ad network as ranked by Comscore before being acquired by PRISA, a Spanish media conglomerate, in 2017.But Rafferty Zavala’s experience in the media industry, and her lived experience as a Mexican American, pushed her to do something different. In 2019, she founded Canela Media.In order to bring the company to life, Rafferty Zavala left her job as CEO of Mobvious, took a second mortgage on her home, sold family land in California, and uprooted her family from San Diego to New York City. And yet, she came to the Big Apple prepared to start over if she failed. “I told my husband, ‘We’re young. If we fail, we fail, and then we’ll have to reinvent ourselves,’” says Rafferty Zavala. Her husband Michael is Canela’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “But if we don’t try, we’re always going to wonder. I had a very strong conviction, after having many years of experience in the industry, that [Canela] was going to be successful.”Rafferty Zavala wasn’t the only one who was convinced of opportunity Canela presented. In 2020, BBG Ventures, an early stage fund backing women and diverse founders, co-led Canela’s $3 million seed round along with Reinventure Capital.“I understood the opportunity that she saw and I really loved her scrappiness,” says Susan Lyne, managing partner of BBG and a veteran of the media industry. “[Isabel] was building to prove that there was a powerful market here, and that she could build a company that not only was high growth, but that also could be profitable.”Just one year later, Rafferty Zavala fundraised again—this time, to the tune of $32 million through a Series A round co-led by Acrew Capital and Angeles Investors, a Chicago-based fund dedicated to investing in promising Hispanic-led ventures.Angeles Investors board chair Adela Cepeda says Rafferty Zavala’s ability to explain Canela’s strategy and navigate stakeholder pressures helped her stand out.“She understood her market incredibly well,” Cepeda says. “When we threw questions to her about, ‘Why don’t you do it this way?’ she said, ‘No, my market has to be ad-driven. Where’s Netflix today? They want to be ad-driven.’ She was very clear about that … and could hold her own in a difficult investment environment.”A Legacy of Entrepreneurship Rafferty Zavala’s grit and vision are rooted in her childhood experiences. At 15 years old, she and her family emigrated from Mexico City to San Diego. In the U.S., Rafferty Zavala often stayed up studying until 1 a.m. and tackled projects days in advance, both to ensure she had enough time to work with her tutors on overcoming her dyslexia and because “everything was a little bit harder” for her while learning English as a second language.Extra effort soon became Rafferty Zavala’s standard operating procedure—reinforced by the influence of her parents Javier and Cecilia Rafferty, who were themselves entrepreneurs. In fact, Cecelia Rafferty owned a home accessory line for which Neiman Marcus and Pottery Barn were clients, and bringing her operation closer to those clients became the catalyst for the family’s move to San Diego. Rafferty Zavala’s memories of her mother from that time were of a stressed-out parent who was often absent from school activities. Back then, Rafferty Zavala swore she would never be like her parents. She’s aware of the irony when she talks about moving her family from San Diego to New York City to be closer to Canela’s clients, and working all day only to log back on after her children go to sleep. But while Rafferty Zavala basks the knowledge that a big bet on herself paid off—Canela’s annual revenue has grown more than 4,000 percent over the past three years, earning it a spot on the 2024 Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S.—she hasn’t forgotten the roadblocks she’s faced. Like when she lost all her advertisers a month before the launch of Canela TV due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unable to make payroll, she went to a family member for a $200,000 loan to buy herself just one more month. “The cost of failing was too big for us,” says the mother of three. “It meant losing our house and moving in with our parents. We had kids that depended on us. No matter how difficult it gets, you have to work harder. No matter how many ‘No’s,’ you have to keep going until you get your ‘Yes.’”Today, Canela Media employs close to 300 people and has 55 million monthly unique visitors in the U.S. Rafferty Zavala aims to grow it even further, into the largest Hispanic media company in the world. As Rafferty Zavala sees it, all of this has been made possible by tuning out the noise (and the odds stacked against her) and focusing wholeheartedly on her vision. “If we focus too much on the limitations and the problems that exist, that does not allow you to move forward. Women have issues fundraising, but that doesn’t mean that women can’t fundraise,” she says. “Know you can get there. You just have to be willing to work harder than anyone else for everything, anything you want.”",
