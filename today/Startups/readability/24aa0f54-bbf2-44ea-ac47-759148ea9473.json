We will have copies of Give First: The Power of Mentorship in the store on sale, even though the book’s official release date isn’t until June 24th, because my Colorado friends get special bonus early bird stuff.I have nine random day slots (15 minutes each), and I’ll hang out between them for anyone in the bookstore signing books. I’ll also have a bunch of my other books there that day in case you are interested in one of them (and yes – I’ll sign them also).The Composition Shop is a new bookstore created by Greeley Sachs, an extremely close friend married to my Foundry partner, Seth Levine. Greeley has bought several buildings on Main Street in Longmont and is new and improving the area. So, in addition to participating in Random Day, give Greeley and her new bookstore some love (she’ll be there all day also, and maybe some other Foundry partners will come by).Sign up is first-come, first-served below (click on the Jump to the next bookable date button). If Mailchimp blows the link up, like it did with my AC/DC YouTube video, just click through to my website – it works there.If you don’t know how Random Day works, here’s an excerpt from Give First: The Power of Mentorship.",
