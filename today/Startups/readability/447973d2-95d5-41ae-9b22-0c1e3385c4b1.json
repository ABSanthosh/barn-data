  "text": "Colorado-based quantum computing startup Infleqtion announced that it’s spending $50 million to build a quantum computer at the site of the former U.S. Steel mill on Chicago’s South Side. On Wednesday, Governor J.B. Pritzker’s office said that the $700 million startup will headquarter its global quantum computing operation in Illinois and will join companies like IBM in the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park.  That park, which Governor Pritzker revealed plans for in the winter of 2024, is part of the state’s plans to revitalize old Rust Belt facilities for new industries. In April 2022, Chicago passed the Manufacturing Illinois Chips for Real Opportunity Act, which provides tax credits to chip manufacturing and semiconductor companies to invest in the state.  “We expect to grow our team significantly in the region adding dozens of roles in engineering, commercialization, research, and operations,” Pranav Gokhale, Infleqtion’s General Manager of Computing, tells Inc.  “Our expanded presence will also include co-location at the National Quantum Algorithms Center and ongoing collaboration with partners across the Illinois innovation ecosystem.”The 128-acre quantum park will cost around $9 billion. Future tenants include the Palo Alto-based startup PsiQuantum and DARPA, which is building what it calls a “Quantum Proving Ground” in Illinois. The goal of Chicago’s quantum computing campus is to become a central hub for the entire quantum computing supply chain. Plans include the development of massive cooling centers essential for building quantum computers, research labs, and equipment processing facilities. These super-powerful computers use quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations beyond the reach of traditional computers and can aid in everything from drug discovery and advanced encryption to risk analysis and even artificial intelligence. While a traditional computer relies on zeros and ones to think, a quantum computer can make use of a qubit, which can be a zero, one, or in a “superposition,” which IBM defines as representing “0, 1, and all the positions in between taken at once.”Photo: Infleqtion“Infleqtion’s decision to join the IQMP reflects the strength of Illinois’ quantum ecosystem and our shared commitment to advancing cutting-edge innovation, creating jobs and building a world-class hub for quantum research, development, and manufacturing on Chicago’s South Side,” Harley Johnson, Executive Director and CEO of the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, said in a press release. The governor’s office predicts the quantum park will create up to $20 billion in revenue and thousands of jobs in Illinois, though initial predictions were three times higher. One of the first confirmed tenants of the park was IBM, which announced it would build its National Quantum Algorithm Center at the newly announced campus.  Last July, DARPA announced it would use the quantum park to test and prototype projects. Chicago isn’t the only city trying to attract quantum investments. Last fall, the city of Arvada, Colorado, broke ground on its 70-acre rival facility co-operated by the Colorado School of Mines and Elevate Quantum, a public-private consortium aimed at accelerating investments in quantum computing in the Mountain West region.“Chicago’s leadership in quantum positions it to be a hub of global innovation, and cities that follow suit will gain a strategic edge in the next technological era,” Gokhale adds.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is this Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
