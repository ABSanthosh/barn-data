  "text": "March 28, 2025 3:44 PM Image Credit: Ustwo Games Ustwo Games announced today that Monument Valley 3, the latest entry in its isometric puzzle game series, is launching on PC and consoles sometime this summer. The game originally debuted on Netflix’s mobile gaming platform last December, and now it’s expanding out to other platforms — though it’ll still be exclusive to Netflix for mobile gamers. According to the developers, Monument Valley 3 requires main character Noor to search out a source of light to combat the growing darkness, by solving a variety of puzzles and exploring in her boat. The game can be played with either a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard. The developer also revealed today, via Nintendo’s Direct event, that Monument Valley 1 and 2 are also launching on console for the first time ahead of the third title’s release. Specifically, they launch on Switch, PlayStation 5 \u0026 4 and Xbox Series X/S on April 15. The re-released versions will be identical to the original PC launch, except “now reimagined for larger screens.” As part of the launch of Monument Valley 3, Ustwo announced it’s partnering with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to support flood relief victims. It will donate 3% of profits for Monument Valley to benefit affected communities and displaced families. GB Daily Stay in the know!
