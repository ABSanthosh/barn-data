  "description": "Host Reid Hoffman has always been impressed with the way Dr. Rana el Kaliouby thinks about AI. She’s an AI scientist, co-founder of Affectiva, an investor and author who has spent decades building toward more emotionally intelligent technology. Now, she’s joining the Masters of Scale podcast family with a new show: Pioneers of AI. In this episode, Reid gets to the heart of Rana’s core interests in AI and business. Then he passes the mic to Rana so she can ask Reid her biggest questions about where the AI revolution is headed next.Synthetic voiceover of Reid Hoffman used in this episode was produced by Respeecher with full consent and permission.Subscribe to Pioneers of AI: https://listen.pioneersof.ai/SubscribeLearn more about Pioneers of AI: http://pioneersof.ai/Follow Pioneers of AI on all channels: https://linktr.ee/pioneersofaiSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
