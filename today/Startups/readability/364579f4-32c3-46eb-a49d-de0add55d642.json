  "text": "Jaspar Carmichael-Jack co-founded Artisan last year, based on a simple premise: There are too many jobs that people no longer want to do. The idea came to the 23-year-old last January when he was “in Tulum doing a detox in the jungle,” he tells Inc. Tulum is often associated with ancient Mayan mysticism, but Carmichael-Jack says he wasn’t there chasing a spiritual high. Rather, he locked himself in an Airbnb to disconnect from the world and to reflect on what he wanted to do in business. He landed somewhere between a startup pitch deck and a science fiction novel. “I just kept on heading back to the idea of creating AI employees, because there’s inherently so much work that people do that they shouldn’t really have to do—and it’s so manual and it’s easily automatable.”In self-imposed isolation in Mexico and fixating on AI, Carmichael-Jack determined which corporate job he thinks is the most imminently replaceable: the business development rep on a sales team, or BDR. They typically handle the lowest hanging fruit, such as generating leads for new customers, sending cold emails, conducting research and scheduling meetings so account executives can turn on the charm, close the sale and make money. The Next Industrial RevolutionHe’s obviously not the only one thinking about how AI will change work. Last month, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and the unofficial figurehead of the generative AI revolution, declared that human knowledge—and, by extension, labor—is destined for obsolescence. “It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there,” wrote the technologist, in an essay about the purportedly transformative nature of his company, which is valued at $157 billion after its latest funding round. And if we do get it, superintelligence, or Artificial General Intelligence, would be an extraordinary turn in our evolution. It means AI will have mastered the sum total of human knowledge while continuing to get smarter. Carmichael-Jack is all too eager to see if his AI can kickstart “the next industrial revolution” by rendering some entry-level jobs extinct. It’s bold talk from the blonde-haired, blue eyed founder, who just moved to San Francisco in January. But the implications for knowledge workers are scary. If Carmichael-Jack’s tech can replace entry-level sales gigs, how many jobs might eventually be in his company’s crosshairs? And how many companies now sweating over payroll might consider using an AI employee? Artisan, based in San Francisco, is getting started through Ava, an AI-powered sales assistant who does what other AI-powered sales assistants do, with one glaring distinction: she makes no apologies for replacing humans. Unlike a faceless software program, Ava is represented by an AI-generated picture of a brunette woman. Similar to an entry-level employee, Ava learns as she goes. She absorbs company lingo and learns strategy by chatting with real salespeople over Slack. “She automates the entire role of a BDR, from the lead discovery, lead research, writing the emails, sending the emails, managing deliverability, sending LinkedIn messages. And then the human takes over when they get a response,” Carmichael-Jack says. In promotional materials, Artisan pitches Ava as a hyper-optimized workhorse that drives conversions without need for sleep, sick days or bathroom breaks. She starts at an annual cost of $15,000, but can go up or down in price depending upon how much work she performs. “She costs 96 percent less than a human employee to do her job. Ava marks the beginning of a new industrial revolution,” boasts a sales video. The idea of workers losing out to AI, or bots, or even sentient machines, isn’t new. Kurt Vonnegut’s debut novel in 1952, Player Piano, conceived of a world in which everything formerly inhabited by humans becomes the domain of robots. But over the last two years, generative AI has permeated the discussion in such a way that it’s become almost impossible for business leaders to consider innovation without at least talking about the technology. Workers, consequently, sometimes fret about their displacement as technological upheaval becomes inevitable: Members of the Writers Guild of America West, in their protracted dispute against production companies last year, included contract clauses banning pretty much all use of AI-generated content in screenplays and scripts. And earlier this month, a strike called by members of the International Longshoremen’s Association at ports along the U.S. eastern seaboard cited automation by machines, meant to lower the cost of labor, as a driving concern in the work stoppage. Spending less money in return for more or greater productivity is a tantalizing prospect for any corporate leader. “Employers are really anxious to cut payroll,” explains Adam Seth Litwin, professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University. “Now technology and automation is coming after white collar jobs. People who had grown pretty comfortable with the idea that they were safe from automation are suddenly thinking ‘maybe this is something I need to watch out for.’” Last month, Artisan closed $11 million in seed funding from a variety of investors, including Y Combinator, Hubspot Ventures and Day One Ventures. The funding is a vote of confidence in a brash form of automation–and a sign that business leaders no longer need to conceal the belief that some jobs are replaceable. War on Software as a ServiceCarmichael-Jack cuts an idealistic and cheery figure. Over Zoom, the Gen-Z entrepreneur, originally from Surrey, England, is fast talking and brimming with energy. He’s one of seven children and, like several notable tech dudes before him, didn’t attend college. He has dabbled in modeling, but laughs half-embarrassed when discussing his brief stint in front of the camera. Jaspar Carmichael-Jack.

But he’s not entirely fresh-faced. Artisan is just his latest venture: Carmichael-Jack formerly ran a marketing agency and an app called Assist that linked customers to handymen, cleaners and errand runners. “Did not work. Terrible business, but I learned a lot,” he says of the ill-fated gig-work platform, which was built by an outsourced developer in India. Currently, through Artisan, which he co-founded with fellow Y Combinator alumnus Sam Stallings, 32, he’s declaring war on the Software as a Service (SaaS) sector that’s dominated tech and the broader enterprise economy for the last 20 years. “We want to replace every single SaaS product and then build these AI employees,” he says, somewhat immodestly. Carmichael-Jack thinks that Ava is the first domino that could theoretically topple the SaaS fortress built by Salesforce, Intuit, Workday and others. He’s not alone in evangelizing AI as the tool to beat SaaS: Last month, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski raised eyebrows when he said the buy-now-pay-later company would be developing its own internal AI tools to replace Salesforce and Workday. If the gambit is ultimately successful, the elimination of SaaS will mean the elimination of certain jobs, Carmichael-Jack says. “You’re paying a bunch of software license fees to a bunch of different companies. You have entire roles whose job it is to stitch them together, like a sales operations role. They’re literally there to stitch together different SaaS products,” he argues. Ava takes care of various sales functions that are often spread out over multiple SaaS platforms. Currently, Artisan has “about 200 companies” licensing the technology and $1.39 million in annual recurring revenue, a spokesperson said. “We’re growing over 50 percent month over month right now. Obviously that’s going to slow down,” Carmichael-Jack says, acknowledging that growth is always relative to where you start. Artisan isn’t stopping with sales. The company plans to implement AI employees across marketing and customer service and then grow from there. “The tech and the mission is broadly applicable, I think, to the majority of verticals,” Carmichael-Jack says. The Employer Reaction Artisan is just a technology developer. How companies deploy AI employees is ultimately the most important determinant of how they will affect jobs. “Will it actually free up my time so that I can do more high value added work? Or is it instead going to reduce the number of people that actually hold these jobs?,” asks Litwin of Cornell. Usually, technology is marketed as a tool to augment an employee’s capabilities, or eliminate the scutwork, like data entry. What strikes Litwin as different is Artisan’s somewhat brazen approach. “That’s what kind of jumps out to me, is that they’re not even using the language of augmentation,” he says. “[T]hey’re saying flat out, ‘wouldn’t you like to employ fewer salespeople and just pay us instead?’ An employer needs to think about whether or not that’s really the message that they want to send.” Carmichael-Jack insists that Ava isn’t there to drain the humanity out of companies. “With every vertical we’ll automate as much as we can, without getting to the point where it’s overly annoying, or where you lose the human touch where it’s needed,” he explains. By automating certain functions that some might view as mundane, Carmichael-Jack sees a wide-open opportunity ready to exploit. “I think it’s just quite an exciting value proposition…if we can solve that problem well in one vertical, we can replicate that into a lot of different things, and it can be huge.”",
