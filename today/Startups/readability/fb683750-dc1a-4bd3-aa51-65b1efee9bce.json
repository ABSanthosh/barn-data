  "text": "It’s never a good thing to make a federal judge angry. It’s especially bad if the reason the judge is angry is because she believes you “willfully disregarded” her ruling and “outright lied,” in her courtroom. That’s the situation Apple is in after Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rodgers, the District Court Judge that oversaw the Epic versus Apple antitrust case, found Apple is in contempt for not complying with her order that required the iPhone maker to allow developers to include links so that customers can make purchases on the web, instead of within their apps. As a brief reminder, Apple won most of the case Epic Games brought against it in 2020. Epic filed the case after Apple kicked Fortnite out of the App Store when the developer added its own in-app payment system, violating Apple’s rules. After a trial, the judge ruled that Apple did not have a monopoly but that it was unfair for the company to prohibit developers from providing links to alternative payment methods on the internet. Apple appealed, but the Ninth Circuit upheld the judge’s ruling, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Apple then released new guidelines that implemented a commission of 27 percent on purchases made outside the App Store, as well as strictly limiting the way companies could provide links. It also added a full-screen sheet that warned users about the risks of leaving the App Store. Epic filed a motion arguing that Apple wasn’t complying with the ruling. On Wednesday, after a year of evidentiary hearings, the judge agreed. “The Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms,” Judge Gonzales Rodgers wrote. “Apple’s response: impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page “scare” screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple’s goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction.” That’s about as savage a paragraph as you’ll read from a federal judge. Like I said before, making a federal judge angry isn’t a great idea, and it’s not great for business, either. In this case, the judge says it’s clear that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and even tried to cover it up throughout the evidentiary hearings. In her order, Judge Gonzales Rodgers wrote that “contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anti-competitive option.” As bad as it all is, it turns out there are actually worse things than lying to a judge or willfully disregarding their order. To be clear, those things are very bad, and it’s entirely possible that at least one Apple executive will spend time in jail over exactly that. But, the fact that Apple took the most user-hostile approach to its purported compliance says a lot about what the company believes and truly cares about—and it’s not good. It’s right there in Apple’s response. The company chose to “increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page ‘scare screens,’ static URLs, and generic statements.” Put more clearly, Apple decided to make the experience worse for its users because it didn’t want to give up even a dime of revenue. It is definitely worth mentioning that Apple had basically won this case. In fact, on every other count, it did win. The same judge ruled that Apple did not have a monopoly, that it was entitled to collect a commission within its App Store, and that it did not have to open up iOS to alternative app marketplaces. It was just on this single issue—whether developers could steer users to their website for purchases in order to avoid Apple’s commission—that the judge ruled against the tech giant. It’s striking then that the company’s top executives were so mad at Epic Games and its CEO, Tim Sweeney, that it did not want to give an inch lest that give Sweeney the satisfaction of any kind of win. The problem is that Apple took that anger out on its users. Apple’s decision to make the user experience of tapping a link to go to a website this onerous and intimidating says it isn’t concerned with its users at all. It’s only concerned about making sure none of them ever spend a dollar on an or service connected to the iPhone without getting its cut. It turns out that both Epic and Apple were only focused on their bottom line. Epic wanted to replace Apple’s commission with App stores of its own. Apple wants to make it virtually impossible for developers to exercise any other option. The only real difference between the two is that at least Epic has always been honest about its intentions—that it wanted to be the toll-taker. “Apple willfully chose not to comply with this Court’s Injunction,” the judge wrote. “It did so with the express intent to create new anticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect, maintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously found to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation.” Apple lost sight of the thing that made it special—its focus on doing the right thing for its users. Instead, under Tim Cook’s leadership, it became just another tech company concerned only with protecting its dominance through whatever means necessary, even if it made things worse for users. Even if it weren’t illegal (which it is), it would still be the one thing no company should ever do.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, May 2, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
