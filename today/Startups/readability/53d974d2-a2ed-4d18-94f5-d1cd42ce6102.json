Science The multi-purpose, edible plant can double its biomass in just two days Spotted: In 2023, food insecurity affected around 2.33 billion people globally and climate-related disasters are increasing in frequency year on year. In the wake of a catastrophe or disaster, reliable food sources are life-saving. Edible, fast-growing, and easy-to-cultivate plants are required in emergencies to re-establish a population’s access to urgent food requirements. A freshwater fern could provide a lifeline to communities around the world.A research team at Penn State University has been rigorously testing azolla caroliniana Willd, commonly known as Carolina azolla, and believes it could be a strong contender for offering fast relief. The multi-purpose, resilient plant has great potential as a food source that could provide large amounts of protein and calories for people and livestock. There is an added benefit that it can also be used as a green fertiliser, biodiesel, in wastewater treatment, and to control mosquitos.The Carolina strain of the aquatic fern is native to the eastern US and is more digestible and nutritious for humans than other strains that are currently cultivated in Africa and Asia for livestock feed. It can also be grown both indoors and outdoors. The cultivation of Azolla caroliniana also requires minimal input, upkeep, and processing, making it an ideal short-season crop for further development.Previously it was thought that the use of azolla for human consumption was limited due to a high total polyphenolic content, which interferes with digestibility. However, the study has found that this is not a problem with the Carolina strain, especially if the plant is cooked. Likewise, previous concerns about cyanotoxins, which are potent toxins produced by a type of cyanobacteria, have also been ruled out by the team’s study.
