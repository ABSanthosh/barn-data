  "text": "December 17, 2024 2:38 PM Image Credit: Agave Games Agave Games announced today that it has secured $18 million in funding as part of its Series A round, following a successful seed round earlier this year. Felix Capital and Balderton Capital co-led the round, with E2VC participating. According to Agave, it plans to use the funding to expand its popular mobile puzzle title, Find the Cat, as well as explore development of new games and expand its team at its Istanbul location. Find the Cat is a casual puzzle game where players must, as the name implies, find the cat. According to Agave, the game had over 10 million downloads in its first quarter on the market. Alper Oner, Agave Games CEO, said in a statement, “This investment allows us to double down on Find the Cat’s success while exploring new ideas that will redefine casual puzzle gaming. We’re excited to take our studio to the next level by expanding our team and portfolio with games that set new standards within established genres.” As stated, the studio is planning to develop new casual puzzling titles to follow up on Find the Cat, with plans to launch at least two of them in the coming year. According to Agave, it plans to focus on innovative gameplay mechanics and social features, while also using a dual monetization focus with in-app advertising and in-app purchases. Baran Terzioglu, Agave’s CPO and co-founder, said in a statement that the new games will “push the boundaries of what players expect from casual games, introducing new concepts that we believe will resonate globally.” Rob Moffat, partner at Balderton Capital said in a separate statement, “Find the Cat is an overnight success two years in the making. Agave have put together an exceptional team and worked super hard to identify and optimize new genres and produce polished games. Find the Cat is just the start, I am excited to see more of their pipeline go live in 2025.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
