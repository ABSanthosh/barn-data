  "text": "If you know beauty, you know Beautyblender. Since the brand’s launch in 2003, those fuchsia, egg-shaped sponges have become a staple in the beauty industry thanks to the ingenuity of Rea Ann Silva, Beautyblender’s Latina founder and CEO. Today, the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based company is coming off its 13th Allure Best of Beauty Hall of Fame Award, and does $100 to 150 million in annual retail sales.   But you don’t dominate a trend-driven industry for more than two decades without encountering a few challenges. Between the pressure to innovate, changes in technology, and knockoffs of her product, Silva has faced her fair share.Here’s Silva’s advice for staying at the forefront of a fast-paced industry. Start With a Star ProductIn the early 2000s, in her early days as a celebrity makeup stylist, Silva was working on a high-definition TV series. She needed a quick way to ensure the makeup looked natural and airbrushed, so she started experimenting with her sponges.  She hand-cut the sponges into a variety of shapes before landing on an “egg” with a pointed tip. But while Silva originally created the Beautyblender for makeup artists, the consumer market was the natural progression for her user-friendly product. This, she says, was the first step toward industry domination: “If it didn’t work, it wouldn’t be relevant.”At the time, there wasn’t a space in the industry for beauty blenders, says Anna Stella, an award-winning marketer and founder of Dover, Delaware-based marketing firm BBSA. Silva “created a new category from scratch,” Stella says—evidence that being first often matters more than being better.Don’t Just Throw Money at Marketing Beautyblender became a category leader thanks in part to early makeup influencers who loved the product. Now, Silva uses paid media with a roster of influencers, from powerhouses like Erica Taylor to mid-tier and micro influencers like Ale Jay and Riya Bodas. But despite her brand’s success on social media, Silva restrains herself when it comes to Beautyblender’s influencer budget.You can always throw money at marketing to try to stay relevant, she says, but that’s not efficient—especially for smaller brands. And Silva, who retains 100 percent ownership of the company, still considers Beautyblender to be an “indie brand.”Finding the sweet spot between spending and returns is essential to longevity, Silva says: “The biggest challenge is staying productive and selling products so I can afford to market the products. It’s a constant reshuffling of the deck.”Get Used to Dupes—but Make a Plan to Beat ThemOnce you make it to the top, there will always be competitors trying to take your market share, Silva says. Beautyblender’s marketing strategies are often aimed at combating the brand’s knockoffs–like Real Techniques and Paw Paw–which Silva likes to call her “fans.” As she puts it, “if Beautyblender wasn’t really a star, they wouldn’t be trying to capture a part of my business.”To stay ahead of knockoff brands, Stella recommends leaning into trends. Beautyblender has increasingly leaned into consumers’ environmental and health concerns by focusing on clean and environmentally friendly products—all at the right price, of $20 per sponge.“If you really show them the difference, they will stick to the product,” Stella says.  But what really sets Beautyblender apart is that it’s an “artisan” product, Silva says. It’s made in America, while most dupes are made in China, and each Beautyblender touches a human hand. “They’re fast fashion. I’m couture,” Silva says. These differences were highlighted in Beautyblender’s recent “Don’t Be Duped” campaign.“Nobody can be Beautyblender. They just can’t. They can’t be the category creator. They can’t be the first. They can’t be the original,” Silva says. “I have that superpower, and I need to exercise that superpower.”Innovate in a Meaningful Way The final component of Beautyblender’s recipe for relevance is one of the hardest: innovation.“I’m constantly looking for innovation within my material, but what I’m learning is that it’s really hard to perfect perfection,” Silva says. “The innovation for Beautyblender has been really, really challenging, so it has to be meaningful.”Those meaningful innovations include the Beautyblender Bio Pure, a green variation of the OG sponge made with 60 percent recycled materials, and the company’s recycling program, which helps keep Beautyblenders out of landfills.These sustainable initiatives help Beautyblender connect with younger generations, but they’re also true to the brand. Silva says she was so disturbed by the disposable nature of makeup sponges, she designed Beautyblenders to be reused and came out with sponge cleansers shortly after the brand’s launch. “Our ethos from the very beginning was about sustainability and less waste,” she says.Silva was also inspired by her Mexican heritage to expand in 2018 into base makeup products like skin tints and foundations, which Beautyblender offers in a wide shade range.“My expertise in complexion shade range is based on being Latina,” she says. “When you’re Latina, you’re not Caucasian, but you’re not Black. There is this range of colors in between White and Black that is vast and very different.”Even for Beautyblender, staying relevant in the beauty industry is a “never-ending challenge,” Silva says. But these strategies have helped take Beautyblender this far, and Silva hopes they’ll help keep Beautyblender relevant for another two decades to come.",
