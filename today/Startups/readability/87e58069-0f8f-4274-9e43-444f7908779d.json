  "text": "Since 1933, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has provided a safety blanket for consumers, guaranteeing the money they put into banks and savings associations is safe and acting as an overseer to the banking industry. Now, the Trump administration is considering changes that could dramatically alter the financial regulator.The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Trump, who once toyed with the idea of eliminating the FDIC altogether, is now considering folding the agency into the Treasury Department or combining its regulatory duties with the Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). No official actions or recommendations have been put forward yet, but just the talk of changes to the FDIC has people concerned, particularly after the rapid changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the past week. Here’s a look at what’s reportedly being considered and the impact it could have on bank accounts.What does the FDIC do?The FDIC’s mission is to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s financial system. Achieving that takes many different forms. The agency is, perhaps, best known as the service that insures the bank deposits of people and small businesses. It also, however, examines and supervises financial institutions, focusing on their operational safety and soundness and ensuring banks comply with consumer protection laws. And when a bank goes into receivership, the FDIC manages it.What changes are being considered for the FDIC?The Journal reported that there have been talks about folding the FDIC into the Treasury Department. Some have also suggested the FDIC’s regulatory role would be assumed by the OCC, which is also part of the Treasury Dept. Another option suggested having one person overseeing both the OCC and FDIC.What’s at the heart of these proposed changes?Banks and their lobbyists aren’t happy with a rise in regulations over the past four years. A JPMorgan executive, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last month, said the number of regulations in the Biden administration was eight times that of Trump’s first term. (Many of those regulations came following the 2023 banking crisis, which saw three banks fail in five days and a sharp drop in bank stock prices.)Trump began looking at ways to consolidate the power of the FDIC and other regulatory services before he took the oath of office, asking as early as last December if he could eliminate the FDIC. (That would require an act of Congress.) Bank CEOs say financial tech businesses are similar services that don’t face the same regulatory scrutiny—and are hopeful Trump will lessen regulation of capital requirements and M\u0026A activity.The Trump administration has already taken steps to limit the power of another financial regulator—the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which saw layoffs this week and has been ordered to halt work. That could endanger caps on credit card and overdraft fees, a ban on including medical debt on credit reports, and proposed rules on selling consumer data.(It’s worth noting that Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheading many changes to agencies, wants to turn X into an “everything app” that includes peer-to-peer payments and has already struck a deal with Visa. That would be regulated by the CFPB. Recently, he posted to X, “CFPB RIP.”)Is Congress being consulted on these proposed changes?Trump has not publicly sought input from Congress so far, but if he moves to eliminate the FDIC, it will require Congressional approval. There could be ways around asking for that, though. It’s unclear if Congress would need to sign off on moves to consolidate the FDIC into the Treasury Department or combine it with the OCC under a singular leader. Congressional support would make it easier to perform either of those actions, however.  Have any changes already been made to the FDIC?Not directly, but the FDIC expects to become the focus of Musk’s DOGE soon. That’s when any changes are likely to begin to take place. Trump has also named former FDIC board member Jonathan McKernan to run the CFPB.Would changes to the FDIC affect the insurance on my accounts?It’s too early to say definitively, but early indications are it wouldn’t. Under the scenario that envisions the OCC assuming the FDIC’s regulatory duties, the FDIC would focus largely on deposit insurance, which is funded by premiums paid by banks. Any move to rescind protections over the finances of consumers and small businesses would almost certainly be met with widespread bipartisan opposition.Following the string of bank failures in 2023, some banks are even calling for an expansion of the deposit insurance limit, which currently stands at $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category.",
