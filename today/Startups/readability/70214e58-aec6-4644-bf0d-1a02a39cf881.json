  "text": "The American Psychological Association (APA) just released its annual Work in America report that digs into the some of the complex ways that American workplaces influence the mental state of the national workforce. Its major findings are that a “prevailing sense of optimism exists among many workers” over the dramatic changes that many businesses have made over the last year—events like layoffs, broad adoption of radical new tech trends and so on. But it also reveals a worrying trend. There appears to be a deepening chasm between company leadership and frontline workers. Management often views changes as a positive trait, while more skeptical workers—the people who essentially have to adjust their working lives to management decisions while remaining productive—were “were frequently less optimistic,” the APA said.The survey was conducted between late March and early April, and polled more than 2,000 working Americans. The report, “2025 Work in America Survey: The Experience of Working in America During Times of Change,” has a very carefully worded title. The American workplace is in a “state of flux,” the report suggests, pointing at factors like “advancements in technology, shifting economic landscapes, and evolving government policies.” This refers to paradigm-shifting innovations like the arrival of AI in the workplace, and the societal, economic and legal complications caused by some Trump administration policies—including mass federal layoffs, the strains of shifting tariff plans, and the apparent crusade against inclusive and equalizing DEI policies.The most worrying trend uncovered by the survey is the misalignment between the expectations of managers and frontline staff. The “vast majority of workers” surveyed said their employer had been through change in the last year, and for over a quarter of these, the changes have been “significant or transformative.” It’s easy to suggest these dramatic changes have involved layoffs, cultural shifts like the end of DEI and the arrival of AI which may be displacing certain workers and pushing companies to reskill or upskill many staff.While managers see these changes as being great, it’s possible they’re seeing the impact of their decisions (such as adopting AI at work, or a big structural change, like a return-to-office order, made “for the company’s good”) in an overly positive light. But data show the frontline staff disagree, and the APA says this “misalignment underscores the critical need for transparent communication, empathetic leadership, and a commitment to gathering and acting on feedback.”Another finding in the report highlights what it calls “disproportionate challenges faced by workers with disabilities,” because despite “broader societal shifts toward inclusivity,” these workers “consistently reported higher levels of dissatisfaction and stress, and more experiences of discrimination, alongside a pervasive feeling of being unprepared for future changes.” In a similar vein, the report also noted that the “data signals a potential complacency in providing easily accessible mental health resources,” and suggested this is a “trend that could undermine employee well-being, particularly for those working in manual labor or customer-facing roles.” Employee wellbeing, for workers with and without disabilities, is directly linked to productivity, and thus profitability.  Why should you care about this data? It is, after all, merely a one-directional slice through the complex social and practical issues surrounding the American workplace.You should care because, as the report itself shows, working in “one’s preferred environment can have a profound impact on workers.” And in particular it focused on the difference between hybrid or remote work and in-person work, noting neither is an “inherently better way to work.” Instead, the APA data suggest workers see psychological benefits like higher job satisfaction and clearer sense of purpose when their preferences and “work arrangements align.” All of this boils down to one recommendation from the APA. Instead of being setting up an us and them dynamic, by proscriptive about the “best” way to work—behavior that some leaders, like Amazon’s Andy Jassy or perhaps JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon have exhibited, dismissing their employees’ crticism—leaders may achieve happier and more productive staff by being more flexible in their leadership decisions.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc.
