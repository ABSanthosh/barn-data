  "text": "Choosing a mentor is one of the most critical decisions an entrepreneur can make. You may run into a lot of people with great advice, old-timers with plenty to share. And you can cherish these people for the value they bring while not necessarily considering them a mentor.I found my mentor, Randy Komisar, after working my butt off for years in a highly competitive space. One of the main things I appreciate about Randy is that he never told me explicitly what I should be doing. He gave pointers, he listened, he gave great examples from his own career. But when push came to shove, the buck always stopped with me.While it might seem appealing to seek out a mentor who spells everything out and provides step-by-step instructions, this approach can actually hinder long-term growth, independence, and business success. Here are eight reasons why a small business owner should avoid looking for a mentor who simply tells them what to do.1.     They foster dependency, not independenceWhen a mentor spells everything out, it can create a dependency dynamic. The business owner may become reliant on the mentor for every decision, large or small, rather than developing their own problem-solving skills and intuition. This dependency can stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that is essential for navigating the unpredictable challenges of running a business. True mentorship should empower the mentee to think critically and make informed decisions independently, rather than acting as a crutch that inhibits self-reliance.2.     They limit adaptability and creativityEvery business is unique, with its own set of challenges, opportunities, and market conditions. What worked for one mentor in their context may not translate directly to another business. Rigidly following someone else’s blueprint can prevent the owner from adapting strategies to fit their specific needs. Instead, a mentor should encourage exploration, experimentation, and creative problem-solving, helping the business owner to develop a toolkit of skills and approaches rather than a single, prescriptive path.3. They undermine accountability and ownershipWhen a mentor dictates actions, the business owner may not feel full ownership over the decisions and outcomes. If things go wrong, it’s easy to blame the mentor rather than taking responsibility. This undermines the sense of accountability that is crucial for leadership and growth. Business owners need to own their decisions—both successes and failures—to truly learn and evolve as leaders.4.     They discourage learning from experienceOne of the greatest values of entrepreneurship is learning through experience. Mistakes, setbacks, and unexpected outcomes are powerful teachers. If a mentor shields the business owner from these experiences by providing all the answers, they rob them of valuable lessons that only come from trial, error, and reflection. A mentor’s role is to guide, challenge, and support—not to insulate from failure or make decisions on the owner’s behalf.5.     The mentor’s advice may not be universally applicableEven the best-intentioned mentor cannot guarantee that their advice will work in every situation. Business environments, customer bases, and competitive landscapes differ widely. A mentor who insists on a one-size-fits-all approach risks leading the business owner down a path that may not suit their unique circumstances. Instead, mentors should share their experiences and insights, but encourage the owner to adapt and apply these lessons in a way that fits their own business context.6.     They stifles confidence and leadership developmentLeadership is built through making tough decisions, navigating uncertainty, and learning from the outcomes. If a mentor always provides explicit instructions, the business owner misses opportunities to build confidence in their own judgment. Over time, this can erode self-esteem and hinder the development of strong leadership skills. A mentor should act as a sounding board, asking probing questions and offering perspective, but ultimately leaving the decision making in the hands of the business owner.7.  Their advice has potential for negative consequencesIf a mentor’s advice goes awry, the mentor does not bear the consequences—the business owner does. This disconnect can lead to resentment or even legal disputes if significant losses occur. It’s important for business owners to remember that, regardless of guidance received, they are ultimately responsible for their business decisions and outcomes.8. They encourages passive, not active, learningActive learning—where the business owner seeks out information, asks questions, and tests hypotheses—leads to deeper understanding and skill development. If a mentor simply provides answers, the owner is less likely to engage deeply with the material or develop the analytical skills needed to solve future challenges independently.A mentor who spells everything out might offer comfort and clarity in the short term, but this approach undermines the very qualities that make a successful entrepreneur: independence, adaptability, accountability, and resilience. The best mentors challenge business owners to think for themselves, ask insightful questions, and support them in developing their own path. Ultimately, mentorship should be about empowerment, not instruction.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
