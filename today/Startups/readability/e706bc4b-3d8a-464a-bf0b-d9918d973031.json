It’s a historic milestone in that the company signed more games in 2024 than in all previous years combined. The company’s ecosystem scaled from zero to four million users as of yesterday, driven by the onboarding of successful titles like RavenQuest and GG Survivor. RavenQuest achieved success with its “Phase 3” launch, including a sold-out land sale this week, while GG Survivor saw two million downloads within weeks of its debut. Immutable’s growth was further validated by research firms such as Messari and VanEck, which confirmed the company’s approximate 70% market share in the web3 gaming space. An innovative ecosystem Immutable continued to pioneer player-focused solutions with the launch of Immutable Passport in January. Passport revolutionized onboarding with features like pre-approved transactions that eliminated blockchain disruptions, integration with Telegram mini-apps to enhance accessibility, and embedded wallets for seamless player experiences. Throughout the year, Passport evolved with critical features, with Immutable ruthlessly prioritizing to enhance the player experience. The introduction of Pre-Approved Transactions eliminated disrupting gameplay for blockchain interactions. As of yesterday, Passport signups four million, reflecting its pivotal role in onboarding millions of gamers into the Web3 ecosystem. The launch of Immutable zkEVM’s Mainnet further underscored the platform’s leadership. As the first dedicated chain for gaming with EVM compatibility, Immutable zkEVM achieved 2.5 million monthly active users within three months of launch, outpacing every major blockchain in growth based on data from Token Terminal. This innovation provided developers and players with enterprise-grade security, low costs, and massive scalability. Empowering players and developers In April, Immutable introduced The Main Quest, one of the largest rewards programs in Web3 gaming. This initiative brought value to players and developers, fostering deeper engagement across the ecosystem. Titles like Pool Masters, Guild of Guardians, and Blade of God were key contributors to the program’s success, delivering millions in rewards to active participants. Immutable’s influence extended across the globe in 2024, with notable showcases at premier events. At GDC 2024, the company highlighted its innovative Passport and zkEVM capabilities. By Gamescom, Immutable’s growth was evident, with seven of the top 10 Web3 games built on its platform. Strategic partnerships were also announced at Korea Blockchain Week and the Tokyo Game Show, including collaborations with MarbleX and Polygon, further strengthening Immutable’s presence in Asia’s rapidly growing gaming markets. Immutable 2024 highlights January marked the early access launch of Immutable zkEVM Mainnet, while April saw the debut of the $100 million Inevitable Games Fund. By May, Guild of Guardians surpassed one million downloads, and in November, Game7 named Immutable the fastest-growing gaming ecosystem of 2024. These milestones underscore the platform’s unmatched trajectory and commitment to redefining gaming. Immutable is set to build on this momentum in 2025 with the launch of the Perpetual Rewards Program just days ago, offering players new ways to exchange gems for weekly rewards. While only a handful of signed games are currently live on Immutable, the company stands on the brink of exponential growth. Regulatory clarity and surging institutional demand will further accelerate Web3 gaming’s mainstream adoption, with Immutable leading the charge as a full-service platform that simplifies development and enhances player experiences.
