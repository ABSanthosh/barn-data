  "text": "Kim Kardashian wants Skims to be everywhere. Her $4 billion shapewear brand is betting big on an increased brick-and-mortar presence with a new flagship store on 5th Avenue in New York City. The three-story location in Midtown Manhattan opened this week ahead of the holidays. The address, the cite of Versace’s former flagship, reflects the ambitions of the Los Angeles-based company, which has expanded to six standalone stores with plans to open a dozen more next year. That’s in addition to the brand’s wholesale partnerships with Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, and Saks Fifth Avenue—all of which have their own flagship stores within a mile of the new Skims location. For Kardashian, that omnipresent retail strategy comes down to convenience–meeting her customers wherever they are. “Each retail store is a different experience,” Kardashian told Inc. at an event celebrating the opening on Thursday evening in New York. “We do want to have our products wherever it is accessible for travel, work. We’re proud of that.” The New York store, which Kardashian described as “very luxurious, but minimal and monochromatic, like my home” will offer a wider selection than customers can find in department stores, Kardashian says, including exclusive pieces, colorways, and collaborations, such as the brand’s recent lines with the North Face and Dolce\u0026Gabbana. Skims co-founder Jens Grede. Photo: Darian DiCianno/BFA.comKardashian and Skims co-founder, Jens Grede, who serves as CEO, see in-store shopping as a major growth opportunity for the company, which launched as a direct-to-consumer business in 2019. The profitable Inc. 5000 company, which has grown its annual revenue by 438 percent over the past three years and generated nearly $713 million in revenue last year, still generates most of its sales via e-commerce. Grede tells Inc.: about 85 percent come through digital channels. The co-founders see the next step as tapping into the majority of American consumers, who still shop first and foremost in physical stores. This omnichannel strategy started earlier this year when Skims tested out the concept with permanent locations in Austin, Texas and in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.“We’re really missing 80 percent of the market,” says Grede. “We’ve had an unbelievable run as a digital-first company, but this is like the full experience of the brand,” he adds. “We want to show people that might not live on social, might not live in that ecosystem, we want to show them what we do.”Photo: SkimsTo wit, the 6,570 square-foot store welcomes customers with a 15-foot tall sculpture of a female body designed by Vanessa Beecroft. The installation, which towers over selections of nude-colored underwear, can be seen from the street through the building’s glass front doors and from a mezzanine above. The three floors of cream-colored walls and rounded edges are filled with tonal mannequins modeling underwear and bras. The entire space feels reminiscent of an Apple store, but with warmer, more flattering lighting. That in-person experience, Grede expects, will create a flywheel effect back to the Skims website and mobile app, which accounts for more than 15 percent of sales. “The physical experience always peaks the digital,” he says. For Kardashian, whose first job was working in a retail store, having a traditional store presence, even in this digital-first era, is a priority. The entrepreneur wants her customers to be able to have a tactile shopping experience, touching the clothing and fabrics, which have always been a distinctive focus for the brand. Kim Kardashian.

I think the world is so chaotic outside.” As customers walk in the store, they will likely feel more than a sense of calm. The enormity of the space—as well as Kardashian and Grede’s long-term aspirations for Skims are palpable. As Grede says, “It’s a statement to be here around the other giants of retail.”",
