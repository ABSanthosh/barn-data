  "text": "October 10, 2024 6:00 AM Tetris Image Credit: Digital Eclipse Welcome to the age of the playable documentary. Retro gaming studio Digital Eclipse and The Tetris Company are revealing the newest trailer and other details for the upcoming interactive documentary game Tetris Forever, the latest entry in the studio’s Gold Master Series. The Tetris games are set in a playable documentary that celebrates the original, genre-inspiring puzzle game and tells the unique story of the game’s evolution from a small, single-programmer effort behind the Iron Curtain to an international gaming franchise with enduring popularity. The documentary includes 14 classic Tetris games, including some making a debut outside Japan for the first time. Players can explore four decades of Tetris history in 14 games. You can relive the origins from 1984 with a faithful recreation of the first Tetris on the Electronika 60 computer, face off in the multiplayer favorite Tetris Battle Gaiden, unleash massive explosions to clear lines in Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss, and enjoy many other classic games. Henk Rogers (left) and Alexey Pajitnov are the leaders of Tetris. The single- and multiplayer games included in Tetris Forever include versions from the Apple II, NES, Game Boy, and Nintendo’s Japanese-market consoles, the Famicom and Super Famicom. Some of the included games are: Tetris Bombliss Tetris, released by Spectrum Holobyte in 1988 on the Apple II Tetris, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1988 on the Famicom Hatris, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1990 on the Famicom Tetris 2 + Bombliss, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1990 on the Famicom Hatris, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1991 on the Game Boy Hatris, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1992 on the NES Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1992 on the Super Famicom Tetris Battle Gaiden, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1993 on the Super Famicom Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss Genteiban, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1993 on the Super Famicom Super Tetris 3, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1994 on the Super Famicom Super Bombliss, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1995 on the Super Famicom Super Bombliss, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1995 on the Game Boy Super Bombliss DX, released by Bullet-Proof Software in 1998 on the Game Boy Tetris Forever also features a brand-new game, Tetris Time Warp, developed by Digital Eclipse. This new take on the classic lets players “warp” through different eras of Tetris, experiencing a dynamic mix of graphics, play styles, and mechanics in real time. Tetris Forever has 14 games. Digital Eclipse’s collection includes the game that started it all. It has an authentic recreation of the first version of Tetris, which Alexey Pajitnov created on a Soviet “Electronika 60” computer system while in the former Soviet Union. You can experience the look and feel of Tetris as Alexey envisioned it in 1984. Players can also explore a virtual museum with archival materials, including video featurettes, photos, original ads, and playable games restored in high-definition and presented chronologically. With over 90 minutes of all-new documentary featurettes produced by Area 5—creators of Outerlands, Grounded: The Making of The Last of Us and Grounded II: Making The Last of Us Part II — players can explore the true story of Tetris in its purest form. Tetris Time Warp, an all-new Tetris variant by Digital Eclipse, will have up to four players warping between different eras of Tetris in real time to experience a variety of memorable graphic styles and play mechanics! Tetris Forever launches on PC via Steam and GOG, and on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S later this year in 2024. GB Daily Stay in the know!
