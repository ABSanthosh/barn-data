  "text": "Developer Three Bees announced recently that it’s bringing its point-and-click adventure game Perfect Tides: Station to Station to Nintendo Switch alongside its other launch platforms later this year. Station to Station is the sequel to Three Bees’ New York Game Awards-nominated previous title, Perfect Tides, which launched on PC in 2022. The new game doesn’t have specific launch date, but it’s due out sometime in 2025 on PC and Mac as well as the Switch. The original Perfect Tides is the story of a young writer named Mara, a period drama set in 2000 about her life, family and friends. Station to Station picks up the story three years later, in 2003, and follows the now-adult Mara as she attempts to navigate independence and her new life in the city. The title comes from the fact that Mara spends most of her time on the city’s mass transit system, on which players can help her develop her skills and guide the trajectory of her life. Three Bees founder Meredith Gran is the writer behind the Perfect Tides games, as well as the Octopus Pie webcomic. Gran said of the new game, “The city’s mass transit system is where Mara does a lot of her thinking. ringing Perfect Tides: Station to Station to the Nintendo Switch felt appropriate – players will be able to take it on the go as they experience their own journeys through life.” Station to Station’s development began in 2022, when Three Bees launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund it (Perfect Tides was also funded via the same platform). The campaign page calls the sequel “a further meditation on the early years of adulthood, of moments both scarring and sublime.” GB Daily Stay in the know!
