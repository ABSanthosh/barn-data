  "text": "Familiar faces from Donald Trump’s first administration are returning to the White House for the president-elect’s transition team. Among them is Michael Kratsios, Politico recently reported. Kratsios previously served Trump as the White House’s chief technology officer from 2019-21. Kratsios is a managing director at Scale AI, a major player in the field of generative artificial intelligence. The company manages a sprawling workforce of freelance contractors who label, annotate, and refine data that’s foundational to the large language models developed by industry giants such as Meta, OpenAI, Google, and the U.S. Department of Defense. The work is known as tasking. In Scale’s case, it farms tasks out through its two subsidiaries, Remotasks and Outlier AI. The company has been valued at $13.8 billion since May, when it welcomed a $1-billion venture investment from Founders Fund, Accel, and other investors. Kratsios previously spearheaded the Trump administration’s AI endeavors, including the former president’s executive order which called for AI investments across “science, medicine, communication, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and security.”Scale didn’t return an Inc. request for comment. Demand for Scale’s services has skyrocketed in tandem with the AI industry’s explosive growth. Many of Scale’s contract workforce have accused the company of chronic disorganization. Issues with pay transparency and wage fluctuation have also plagued some contractors. Others claim that they haven’t been paid at all, despite logging hours for the company. Those allegations, coming from contractors in Africa and the Philippines, initially surfaced in reports from the Washington Post last year. Further reporting from Inc. this year detailed missing payments alleged by workers in the U.S. working for both Outlier AI and Remotasks. Additional reporting by Inc. identified Google as the likely client behind a small-business AI training program that failed to pay many participants. Earlier this month, Scale announced “a new era for Outlier,” which includes a revamped user experience for contractors and specifically addresses “improving support and pay transparency for contributors.” There are currently 274 open positions listed on Outlier’s website, which makes no mention of its parent company. Kratsios served as the Department of Defense’s under secretary of defense for research and engineering from 2020 until 2021, when he left government to begin working at Scale. The following year, Scale agreed to a $250 million contract with the Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.",
