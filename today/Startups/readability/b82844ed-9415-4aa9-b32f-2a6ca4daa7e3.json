  "description": "This past April was the podcast’s 10-year anniversary, and the platform River helped listeners organize parties around the world in more than 180 cities! More than 4,000 people RSVP’d. I was able to join about 40 cities via Zoom for quick hellos and drinks (huge thanks to Rae and Ana for the quarterbacking), and I had a blast dropping in on the Paris meetup in person. Thanks to everyone who gathered for wine, celebration, and meeting like-minded people! After all the parties, and as a thank you for their hard work, I invited all of the hosts to a private Q\u0026A.
