  "text": "Sometimes the most profound wisdom comes from unexpected places. For me, it arrived in the form of a t-shirt that never fails to stop people in their tracks whenever I wear it.  Three simple words, printed in sequence: “I hope. I think. I know.” These words aren’t just a clever phrase—they represent the essential phases of any transformative journey, whether personal or professional. The power of hope: Your North Star Hope isn’t just an emotion—it’s the seed of all innovation and change. In my years of working with entrepreneurs and leaders, I’ve noticed that every breakthrough begins not with a business plan, but with hope. It’s the bridge between the world as it is and the world as it could be. The late Viktor Frankl, the renowned psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, once wrote, “Life is never made unbearable by circumstances, but only by lack of meaning and purpose.” Hope is what gives us that purpose. It’s what allows us to see possibilities where others see dead ends, to imagine solutions where others see only problems. But hope isn’t passive wishing—it’s active vision work. It’s the courage to say, “This could be different” when everyone else has accepted the status quo. Hope is what allows entrepreneurs to see market opportunities in everyday frustrations, and leaders to envision better ways of working when their teams are stuck in outdated patterns. The shift to new thinking: Reimagining what’s possible When hope takes root, it transforms how we think. This isn’t just positive thinking—it’s a fundamental restructuring of our mental models. We move from “That’s just how things are” to “What if we tried something different?” This phase is where hope becomes strategy. It’s where vague aspirations crystallize into actionable plans. The “I think” phase is crucial because it’s where we begin to build the bridge between vision and reality. We start asking different questions, seeing new patterns, and connecting dots that previously seemed unrelated. This cognitive shift is powerful because it changes not just what we think, but how we think. When we think differently, we act differently. When we act differently, we create change not just in ourselves but in our teams, our organizations, and our communities. The power of knowing: Your inner compass The final phase—knowing—isn’t about certainty in the traditional sense. It’s about developing an inner compass that guides you through uncertainty. This knowing comes from the alignment of your hopes and your thoughts, creating a clarity of purpose that sustains you through challenges. This isn’t the kind of knowledge you can learn from a book. It’s the deep knowing that comes from having hope tested by reality and strengthened by trusting your intuition and thoughtful analysis. It’s the kind of knowing that helps you persist when others doubt, pivot when circumstances demand, and stay true to your vision even when the path becomes unclear. Your transformation compass Together, these three states—hope, think, know—form a compass for navigation through any transformative journey. They remind us that transformation isn’t linear; it’s cyclical. Sometimes we need to return to hope when our thinking gets stuck. Sometimes we need to think more deeply when our knowing is challenged. The beauty of this progression is that it honors both the emotional and rational aspects of change. Hope without thinking can be naive; thinking without hope can be cynical; but together, leading to knowing, they create a powerful framework for sustainable transformation. The next time you face a challenge that seems insurmountable, remember this simple progression. Start with hope—allow yourself to envision what could be. Move to thinking—analyze, plan, and strategize. Then trust in your knowing—that deep internal certainty that comes from aligning your hopes and thoughts with purposeful action. After all, every great achievement in history started with someone who dared to hope, took the time to think differently, and acted with the certainty of knowing they were moving in the right direction.
