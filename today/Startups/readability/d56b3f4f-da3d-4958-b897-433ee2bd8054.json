Learn More Mobile growth acceleration platform Liftoff announced today it’s launching a new machine learning platform called Cortex. This next-gen platform uses tailored neural network models to improve mobile ad campaigns. Its enhanced computing power boosts pattern recognition and processing data. It can be used to provide a higher return on investment for advertising by identifying the best channels and audiences for their campaigns. According to Liftoff, Cortex has already shown some improvements to ad campaigns in the short amount of time it’s been available. Ad campaigns have seen a 23% decrease in CPIs (cost per install), a 21% decrease in CPAs (cost per acquisition) and a 16% increase in ROAS (return on ad spend). Cortex can respond quickly to shifting market conditions and find patterns in large and varied data sets. Jeremy Bondy, Liftoff CEO, said in a statement, “Cortex marks a significant leap in mobile advertising technology. At Liftoff, success is defined by the measurable business outcomes we deliver to our partners… Our new deep learning models enable us to harness more data from our proprietary platform, optimizing campaigns to deliver superior results. These models also train and iterate faster, giving us the agility to respond swiftly in an ever-evolving market. We believe this innovation opens up substantial new opportunities for growth across the entire Liftoff platform.” Game developer Playlinks is one client that has already seen the benefits of Cortex. Marketing manager Seokyung Lee said in a statement, “With its strong ML logic, Cortex, Liftoff has shown strong ROAS results compared to other networks, and the proportion of new users is almost 80% high on iOS. Its support for optimization and creativity has been consistently impactful on campaign results as well.” VB Daily Stay in the know!
