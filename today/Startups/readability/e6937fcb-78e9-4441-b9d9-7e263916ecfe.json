  "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Harrison Kitson and Daniel Koonce welcome Josh Owen and Daniel Fritsche to talk about their NFT trading platform, TradePort, which is the most comprehensive multi-chain NFT aggregator for traders and developers.  Founded in 2021, TradePort is a multi-chain NFT marketplace and infrastructure company aimed at seamlessly integrating the creation, buying, selling, and bidding of digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. The company's journey began after observing the lack of documentation and infrastructure in the rapidly growing NFT space. Initially starting as a launchpad for NFT projects, TradePort evolved into an aggregator, integrating supply from multiple marketplaces and developing a universal data model for digital assets. A standout goal for TradePort is to dominate the NFT marketplace by commanding ninety-four percent of transaction volume while continually increasing supply in the order book. They also aim to bring real-world assets on-chain, thereby serving as the core infrastructure for tokenizing real-world items such as traditional watch dealers' assets. Their long-term vision includes expanding to all relevant NFT chains and becoming a programmatic interface for all digital assets, including decentralized finance (DeFi). By facilitating transparent provenance and reducing dependency on traditional gatekeepers in asset validation, TradePort aspires to transform how assets are managed and traded globally. Throughout the episode, Daniel and Josh give an inside look at their journeys and how they first became involved in the cryptocurrency space as a hobby to how they were able to monetize this shared interest. They also explain what NFTs are, what makes them unique, and how you can trade them on TradePort.
