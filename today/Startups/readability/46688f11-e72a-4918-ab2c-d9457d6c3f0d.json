Photo: JetZeroListen to this ArticleMore info0:00 / 0:00JetZero is finally getting to work on building its futuristic blended-wing-body aircraft. And the home of its manufacturing efforts will be a nearly $5 billion plant in Greensboro, North Carolina, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. “From first in flight to now the future of flight, North Carolina and our skilled workforce is soaring.,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a statement.JetZero anticipates the facility will create more than 14,500 jobs and offer competitive salaries. The Journal reported the plant will create both direct manufacturing and engineering jobs and indirect jobs with suppliers. Construction is slated to begin in the first half of 2026, putting JetZero on track for its goal to offer its aircraft for commercial use by 2032, the Journal reported.JetZero is working on a next-generation aircraft with a sleek new design that essentially blends the body and wing of the aircraft together (hence the term blended wing body), as opposed to the popular tube and wing configuration in use today. JetZero’s Z4 aircraft is expected to contain as many as 250 seats, but be about one third the weight of aircraft with similar capacity.The lighter weight and more aerodynamic design are expected to allow the aircraft to fly higher, meaning less atmospheric drag. JetZero anticipates these efficiencies will improve fuel burn and cut emissions by up to 50 percent. The company has major backing or buy-in from numerous airlines, including 14 that have been advising it through JetZero’s Airline Working Group. Alaska Airlines and United have invested in JetZero, with United conditionally agreeing in April to purchase up to 200 aircraft. Delta in March announced a partnership with JetZero in which it will lend its operational expertise to develop a full-scale demonstrator aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, targeted for testing in 2027. JetZero also joined Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab innovation accelerator, which will offer the startup resources and expertise to commercialize its aircraft—Delta even agreed to design the aircraft’s interior.North Carolina is among the states that have benefited most from climate tech and clean energy-related investments since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to business and advocacy group E2. Although IRA incentives mostly intersect with the aerospace sector by way of sustainable aviation fuel, JetZero was among the companies to win a Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant through the IRA. Even so, JetZero’s investment in the Greensboro area comes as many companies are cancelling or delaying previously announced climate tech projects and related jobs in the U.S. amid the uncertainties introduced by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and policies.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
