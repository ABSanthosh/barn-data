  "text": "You satisfy your customers, but can you satisfy our curiosity? With Stephanie Smith, Manager, Customer Success at Collage. Please tell us a little bit about your company and what you do there. Collage simplifies HR for Canadian businesses. Our all-in-one HRIS software streamlines employee record management, payroll and benefits administration, time-off tracking, performance management, and more. As Manager, Customer Success, I lead our amazing CS team and work closely with clients to ensure they get maximum value out of our platform. Which celebrity would be really great at your job, and why? I think Mister Rogers would be amazing at my job! His calm, compassionate demeanor and genuine interest in others would translate perfectly into customer service. He‚Äôd excel at building trust, creating meaningful connections, and finding resolutions that make clients feel understood and respected. What‚Äôs the most valuable thing that working in customer service has taught you? That active listening is the key to building strong relationships. By listening to understand rather than to respond, you can better identify and explain the best solutions to the client. It also shows customers that you recognize and value them as individuals, which fosters trust and deepens the relationship. Describe the essence of great customer service using only three words. Empathetic, efficient, and reliable. Which movie robot would you choose as your AI sidekick, and why? I‚Äôd choose WALL-E because of his sense of curiosity, resourcefulness, and ability to connect with others. He‚Äôs adaptable, finds creative solutions, and maintains a positive outlook even when facing challenging situations. Also, we have a shared love of music and trinkets! What can you do that a bot will never be able to replicate? Build genuine trust-based relationships with clients that provide tailored solutions for both their immediate needs and long-term goals. While bots can offer quick, automated responses, they lack the emotional intelligence and adaptability required to navigate complex situations and offer personalized advice. What‚Äôs your greatest productivity hack? Setting up a workspace that inspires focus. Making a fresh cup of coffee and playing some upbeat music gets me in the right mindset for work. It‚Äôs a small routine, but it helps me feel energized and ready to tackle the day. What book are you reading at the moment? I just started Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom. It‚Äôs been on my TBR list for years. If customer service was an Olympic sport, what would be the main event? The ‚Äúcalm under pressure hurdle race‚Äù where contestants would compete to stay composed while providing client-focused resolutions during increasingly difficult customer service situations. The gold medal would go to the person who ends the event with the highest overall CSAT score. What‚Äôs the best thing a customer has ever said to you? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made the onboarding process so easy. We‚Äôre really excited to roll out to our team!‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing quite like knowing your client feels confident using the product and feels like they can rely on you when they need guidance. What gif best describes your mental state right now? Where do you get your support leadership news? Mostly on LinkedIn. There are a ton of customer success leaders I follow who provide great advice on leading a solution-oriented customer success team. Conversation closed‚Ä¶ for now üòè If you‚Äôre interested in being featured in our¬†Response Time series, you can share your insights on customer service with us here.",
