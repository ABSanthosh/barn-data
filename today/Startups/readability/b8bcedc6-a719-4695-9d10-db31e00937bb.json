Elsbeth is the founder of True Sleep Therapy, a private practice specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI).  Elsbeth’s career began in clinical settings, focusing predominantly on veterans struggling with PTSD and insomnia at the Veterans Healthcare System in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Here, she became a national trainer for the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI) program. Moving into the civilian sector, she founded True Sleep Therapy to provide CBTI to a broader population. Her work primarily involves addressing sleep disorders, using evidence-based techniques to aid individuals in improving their sleep hygiene without the reliance on medications.  Beyond her clinical skills, Elsbeth had to quickly learn the non-clinical aspects of running a business—skills such as budgeting, business planning, and social media marketing. Throughout the episode, she shares her journey of founding a successful sleep therapy practice, the challenges she faced, and the triumphs she celebrated along the way.
