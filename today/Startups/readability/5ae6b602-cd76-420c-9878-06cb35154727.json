  "text": "Vibe-coding platform Windsurf has endured some choppy waters over the past week but has sailed into what appears to be a safe harbor.Cognition, the AI software engineering startup, has announced a deal to buy Windsurf. The deal comes just days after Google poached the company’s founder and top talent for $2.4 billion. The new deal has been structured to ensure all Windsurf employees are taken care of.Back in May 2025, OpenAI announced plans to buy Windsurf for $3 billion, but according to The Verge, talks between the companies fizzled out as a result of OpenAI’s longstanding deal with Microsoft. The deal includes terms that require OpenAI to share its tech, potentially including Windsurf, with Microsoft. After negotiations broke down, Google swooped in with a $2.4 billion offer to license Windsurf’s technology and hire away the company’s founder, Varun Mohan, along with some of the company’s top-level staff. This deal worked out well for Windsurf’s investors, who will be paid out with Google’s money, but many new employees without vested equity won’t receive any kind of payout. “My read is that the Windsurf leadership team was desperate to find a way out and facing competition from the labs [like OpenAI and Anthropic] and Cursor structured a deal to benefit themselves,” wrote Jordi Hays, co-host of popular tech news show TBPN on X.On Monday, Cognition founder Scott Wu posted on X that his company would be acquiring Windsurf. In a note that was first sent to employees, Wu wrote that Cognition will fully own the Windsurf platform and IP, along with its business. Wu said that Windsurf is currently making $82 million in annual recurring revenue with over 350 enterprise customers. But most importantly, Wu wrote, Cognition is bringing in all of Windsurf’s remaining employees, including “some of the most impressive people in our industry, including world-class GTM, engineering, and product teams.”Wu went on to say that he and acting Windsurf CEO Jeff Wang, who only assumed the job on Friday, structured their transaction “to ensure that every single employee is treated with respect and well taken care of.” As a result, he wrote, 100 percent of Windsurf employees will participate financially in the deal, will have vesting cliffs cleared for their work to date, and will receive fully accelerated vesting for their work to date. In a video, Wu and Wang explained how Cognition and Windsurf’s tech will complement one another, envisioning a world where Windsurf can be used to direct multiple Devins (Cognition’s AI software engineering assistant) to attack an engineering problem in tandem. Plus, Wang said in the video, “we’re friends with Anthropic again.” Anthropic had previously blocked Windsurf from using their popular Claude AI models when the company was being acquired by rival OpenAI, but since OpenAI is no longer buying Windsurf, Anthropic has re-opened the company’s Claude access. On X, Wang wrote that “the last 72 hours have been the wildest rollercoaster ride of my career,” but that he is now “overwhelmed with excitement and optimism, but most of all, gratitude. Trying times reveal character, and I couldn’t be prouder of how every single person at Windsurf showed up these last three days for each other and for our users.” Details regarding how much Cognition is paying to acquire Windsurf were not disclosed.The final deadline for the 2025 Inc. Power Partner Awards is Friday, July 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply now.",
