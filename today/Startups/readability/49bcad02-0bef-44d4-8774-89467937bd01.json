  "text": "Stanford computer scientist and entrepreneur Tengyu Ma just sold his year-and-a-half-old AI startup Voyage AI for $220 million. Database company MongoDB acquired Voyage AI for both its talented team and its core technology, which is meant to improve the accuracy of generative AI. It’s a rapid exit—and hefty payday—for a young company, but experts say it isn’t unexpected given the pace of innovation in AI.“In the AI world, [17] months is not that young. Everything’s moving super, super fast,” says MongoDB chief product officer Sahir Azam.Founded in September 2023, Voyage AI creates technology for safeguarding against generative AI hallucinations that can result when models don’t sufficiently “understand” the data or information they are referencing, particularly within the context of a business. Ma, Voyage AI co-founder and CEO, says the company has accomplished this by building advanced AI-powered search and retrieval models that help to extract meaning from specialized sources of data, such as legal and financial documents and enterprise databases. This capability can augment the responses of large language models to improve the odds of accuracy.“Think about a health care situation or a finance situation. Being 60, 70 percent accurate in a predictable result is just not good enough,” says Azam. “The AI models that Tengyu and the team have created are state of the art in terms of quality, and then we connect that to trustworthiness, which means that AI will be able to be applied to more and more use cases and applications.”Together, Voyage AI’s accuracy-enhancing models and MongoDB’s vast stores of data can have great potential, according to Ma. For one thing, he says, the companies’ combined forces can offer a “clean, simple solution” to developers of AI-powered apps, cutting down on the costs and efforts required to stitch together multiple components. MongoDB also shares his strategic vision for the future of AI.“MongoDB is the best database for a variety of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data,” Ma says. “And I do believe that this new wave of AI is really about how to leverage [that] data.”About six months before the acquisition, Voyage AI raised a $20 million Series A that brought the company’s total raised to $28 million. Venture capital firm CRV led the round, which included participation from Snowflake, Databricks, Pear VC, Tectonic Ventures, and more. As part of the deal, CRV general partner Murat Bicer joined Voyage AI’s board of directors. What CRV saw in Voyage AI, Bicer says, was a very strong technical team with a rare quantity of experience given the nascency of generative AI. “There is such a small number of folks in the field right now who truly have the level of expertise and experience that are measured by decades, as opposed to years,” he adds. “These folks, when they’re working on something, we know that they’re going to be innovating in a way that is going to take the entire market forward.”CRV, for its part, offered Voyage AI business-building expertise, helping it put together a management team, develop a go-to-market strategy, and better align pricing. Voyage AI’s exit happened so quickly, however, that Bicer says many of those efforts were still in early stages.An acquisition at roughly 17 months old isn’t unprecedented for CRV portfolio companies. Drone software startup Aerodome, for example, was acquired by Flock Safety in October for about $300 million, after launching in April of the previous year. It does, however, outpace the industry average. A 2024 study from Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology analyzed AI mergers and acquisitions from 2014 to 2023. It found that big tech platforms acquired AI companies an average of 4.8 years after their founding, whereas other companies acquired AI companies that were on average 7.4 years old. Bicer says there is some risk that a leadership team that chooses to sell early could leave value on the table that they could have achieved by selling a more mature business. Still he describes Voyage AI’s exit as “a very happy ending” but “one of the shorter ones for us.”CRV general partner Saar Gur oversaw early investments in DoorDash, Patreon, and Ring, among other Silicon Valley disrupters. He says there can be any number of reasons—including personal ones—a founder may choose to sell a company in its earlier stages, versus waiting longer or guiding it through a different exit strategy, such as an IPO. But generally, he says acquisitions happen sooner if the market is “obvious” and the company is in “an established space.” AI in particular is a fast-moving industry that requires a high level of expertise, which results in more “aggressive” M\u0026A as companies try to innovate quickly enough to keep pace.“That fight for talent is going to lead to a lot of outcomes that seem crazy relative to what these teams actually have built or have done,” Gur says. “And I think that’s a cost of doing business in the AI froth that we’re living in.”But for entrepreneurs, that means big opportunity.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
