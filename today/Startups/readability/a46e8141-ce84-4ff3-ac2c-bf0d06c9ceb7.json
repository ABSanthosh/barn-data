Somewhere in the midst of this, game companies have become somewhat more transparent about the goings-on behind the scenes. And recently, that’s taken the form of admitting when they’ve simply run out of money. Surgent Studios revealed today it’s put its staff on notice as it’s having trouble securing a publisher for its next game. This is after it’s already had a round of layoffs following the underperformance of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU. Surgent is not the only studio that has gotten frank about its inability to secure stable funding. Earlier this month, Orphan Age developer Studio Black Flag revealed its deal with its publisher fell through, and the French government shut it down when its funding disappeared. It called itself “another casualty of the current downturn in the video game industry.” Similarly, Italic Pig, developers of Paleo Pines, said in a social media statement that it couldn’t find a production partner for its next game, and said the whole indie gaming scene was facing “a sudden drying up of publishing and investment opportunities.” I feel that the first instance of a game company being so honest was last September, when Pieces Interactive delayed Alone in the Dark and flat-out admitted that it didn’t want to release the game in the already over-crowded month of October: “Horror games thrive on the eerie embrace of solitude, something that is impossible to achieve in a gaming month as busy as October.” But being honest about the reasons behind delays is one thing — being honest about money troubles is another level of sincerity. In personal news, I’m ready to get properly spooky this season with the release of A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, which reminds me of Alien: Isolation in the best way. I’m not sure I’m up for replaying Until Dawn again — keeping those shrieking brats alive for one playthrough was difficult enough — but if I need a palate cleanser, Piranha Games just dropped MechWarrior 5: Clans. And if nothing else, there’s always the new Mario Party title, Super Mario Party Jamboree.
