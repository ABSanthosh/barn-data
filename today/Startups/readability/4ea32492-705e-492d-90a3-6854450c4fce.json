  "text": "Air travel between the U.S. and Canada has lost altitude, recently falling more than 70%, according to OAG, an industry analytics firm.The OAG data, first reported by One Mile at a Time, shows tickets booked in March for April travel dropped from 1.22 million to 296,000 year over year. Airlines have responded by reducing capacity, by some 320,000 seats between U.S. and Canadian cities, including big cuts in July and August. That means hours and jobs lost on either end of those city pairs will be affected.Cross border tourism has also taken a tumble as Canadians, angry at being disparaged by President Trump and having their leader addressed as “governor,” are voting with their feet and their wallets.. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, about 500,000 fewer Canadians crossed land borders into the U.S. in February compared to the same month last year.Tourism is an industry caught in the crossfire of the Trump administration’s trade war with our neighbors and largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, as well as China and the European Union. The President has railed about how Canada has taken advantage of the U.S. in areas such as manufacturing, leading to significant trade deficits. He wants Canada to become the 51st state. That’s why he’s attached tariffs to imports of Canadian steel and aluminum, as well as cars assembled outside the U.S.  Canada responded with tariffs of its own, targeting American products such as bourbon. Canadian citizens have also responded by boycotting U.S. made products. That’s spilled over into tourism. Nor has their inclination to travel to the U.S.  been helped by incidents in which Canadians have been questioned or detained at the border. In one case a Canadian businesswoman was held for 12 days in an ICE detention center seemingly without explanation.Tourism is a $2.36 trillion industry in the U.S., nearly 3% of GDP and the source of 9.5 million jobs. And cities such as New York and Washington will take a hit—not just from Canadians, but from visitors from Europe as well.If there is a silver lining in this, it could be that with the dollar now strengthening as a result of Trump’s policies, Canada is going to be a bargain this summer. You can visit the Canadian Rockies, the beaches of Nova Scotia or cosmopolitan Montreal for 43% off, based on the dollar’s recent value against the loonie. Just be understanding if the welcome/bienvenue is as frosty as Winnipeg in January.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
