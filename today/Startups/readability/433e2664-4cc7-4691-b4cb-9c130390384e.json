This year, as we continue to enjoy an unprecedented Small Business Boom, I encourage everyone to Gift Big and Shop Local by supporting local businesses and the millions of hardworking Americans behind them.”Celebrating 15 Years of Small Business SaturdaySmall Business Saturday, which takes place the Saturday following Thanksgiving, has grown into a nationwide movement.
