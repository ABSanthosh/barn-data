  "text": "Factorial just passed a major milestone with its next-generation EV battery.Together with automaker Stellantis, the Massachusetts-based startup recently validated its solid-state battery cell tech—meeting some key metrics and notching a major step toward commercialization.Battery technology is a crucial limiting factor in modern EVs. A vehicle’s range, weight, and recharge time can all be traced to its batteries. Improvements on these systems have the potential to mitigate or eliminate some of the most significant barriers facing broader EV adoption.“It’s really an exciting milestone we have spent years of effort to achieve,” says Factorial founder and CEO Siyu Huang. Through its testing, the battery achieved several key milestones. The first is that the company successfully built their solid-state battery (more on that technology in a moment) at automotive scale. A previous version of the battery, launched with Stellantis in 2023, was smaller. The battery also demonstrated a life cycle of more than 600 cycles; cycle count indicates the amount of times a battery can fully charge and discharge before losing some of its energy capacity. (For context, it typically takes a lithium-ion battery about 1,200 cycles before it begins losing capacity, according to battery testing and management company Midtronics.) Finally, Factorial proved its batteries can operate in a wide range of temperatures, from -22 degrees to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, overcoming concerns about performance in cold temperatures.Huang says the achievement represents “the most important milestone” to clear the way for the next step in its partnership with Stellantis. The parent company to brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, and Maserati, announced in Oct. 2024 that it planned to incorporate Factorial’s batteries into a demonstration fleet of Dodge Charger Daytona vehicles by 2026. Their partnership also includes collaboration to hone the architecture of battery packs with the expectation that improvements in efficiency and a reduction in overall battery weight will translate to better range and more affordable EVs. The ongoing collaboration follows a $75 million investment Stellantis made in Factorial in 2021. The next generation battery technology at the heart of Factorial’s business is the solid-state battery. Solid-state batteries replace the liquid (and highly flammable) electrolyte present in lithium-ion batteries with a solid material such as a ceramic or sulfide. Proponents of these batteries say they will not only be safer than the lithium-ion batteries at the heart of numerous destructive blazes—some fatal—but also result in better range and performance and shorter charge time. In fact, Factorial’s battery is considered a “quasi-solid-state battery,” because it contains a low volume of fluid. It relies on a polymer-based solid electrolyte and a lithium-metal anode. Huang says the first generation battery is already capable of “at least 25 percent longer range” when compared with lithium-ion, but expects range improvements down the road of as much as 80 percent.“It potentially can drastically reduce the cost of the electric vehicle in the future by having a lower weight of the battery and a lower cost of battery, by reducing the supporting structure in a vehicle,” Huang says.Huang added that AI—particularly a “digital twin” platform the company built and launched internally—has been transformative for testing and decision making at Factorial. By creating a digital replica of the battery cell, Huang says, Factorial has accelerated the development of its battery electrolyte by ramping up the accuracy of performance predictions and substantially cutting down on the quantity of tests needed to achieve certain metrics.Following the roll-out of Stellantis’ Factorial-powered fleet next year, the startup anticipates commercial traction by the end of the decade.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
