  "text": "As business tax deadlines draw closer, the Internal Revenue Service is—like much of the federal government—in chaos.Sweeping efforts by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to cut federal expenses left the IRS headcount down several thousand employees late last month, and now it seems like broader cuts may be imminent. New reporting by the Associated Press indicates that, per two anonymous sources with inside knowledge, the collection agency is angling to chop its total staff by up to 50 percent through a mix of buyouts, attrition, and further layoffs. Employees may also be moved over to the Department of Homeland Security, the AP reports, to help with immigration enforcement.Meanwhile, separate reporting this week by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists cites several current IRS employees as saying that a “handful” of both corporate and individual audits may be “closed prematurely without action” thanks to a staffing shortfall, potentially leaving millions of dollars in public revenue on the table.The reports of both a second round of mass layoffs and the abandonment of active audits come with only days left before the March 17 tax filing deadline faced by many S corporations and partnerships, and just over a month before the standard April 15 C corporation deadline.It’s an injection of uncertainty into a process—tax filing—where stability and consistency are key. Many experts warn that the reduced headcount will mean less oversight of filings, and thus let more tax fraud go unchecked. (President Trump, for his part, reportedly wants to abolish the IRS altogether and lean more on foreign trade duties.)“The fan of outcomes is too wide, in our opinion, to change taxpayer behaviors now,” says David Snider, founder and CEO of the tax services firm Harness, which claimed the No. 192 spot on the Inc. 5000 list in 2024.Nevertheless, Snider says, “the potential for massive cuts” as well as recent leadership shake-ups—including the premature resignation of the IRS commissioner in January and then the retirement of his replacement a month later—could have “unpredictable implications for taxpayers.”The more immediate tax policy change for businesses, he adds, is the Treasury Department’s recent suspension of the Corporate Transparency Act, which would have required millions of businesses to report their beneficial owners. Says Snider: “Had that gone into effect later this month and been enforced a lot of businesses may have encountered unexpected fines.”All the upheaval is a good reason for businesses to e-file their taxes—and do so as early as possible—says Jeffery Lewis, CEO of the tax and financial services firm Epic Trust Enterprises (No. 1,755 on the 2024 Inc. 5000 list).“Since electronic returns go through automated systems with little to no human intervention, they are the least likely to be affected by IRS staffing shortages,” Lewis tells Inc. readers. “For those expecting refunds, an early filing should also help avoid delays that could worsen if processing times slow down later in the season.”The IRS media office did not respond to a request for comment.If the IRS workforce is ultimately cut down by as much as half, he continues, there are a few key areas where that reduction in force could manifest in the current tax season: Processing delays for paper returns, with diminished staffing numbers leading to slower review times for returns, refunds and any type of correspondence involving additional documentation Reduced customer support and longer hold times for anyone trying to resolve an issue with the IRS Declining enforcement efficiency as premature case closures and the possibility of an audit backlog undermine compliance efforts On that last point, Lewis adds: “My hope would be that the IRS will focus its attention on the most grievous offenders and leave the ‘little guys’ alone.”Another round of cuts at the IRS would mark an even greater divergence from the Biden administration’s efforts to revitalize the tax agency with $80 billion in funding and plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees who could ramp up anti-fraud measures. The layoffs in February—which hit newer, probationary IRS employees—primarily targeted auditors and collection staff, per one report. The Tax Adviser reported at the time that at least half of the cuts were in the IRS’ small business and self-employed division.Fewer IRS staffers will lead to slower processing times, Chanel Christoff Davis—CEO of the sales tax consulting firm Davis Davis \u0026 Harmon, No. 3,064 on the 2024 Inc. 5000 list–told Inc. after the first round of layoffs.“If you expect any tax refunds or tax credits from the IRS, you should budget and prepare not to receive those monies in the near term,” Davis said, adding that disbursements from the pandemic-era Employee Retention Tax Credit will likely also be slowed down.In addition to the headcount cuts, DOGE has reportedly been seeking access to IRS data. Among the documents that could be in play are bank records and other sensitive sets of taxpayer information.The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
