  "description": "Nsima Inyang (@nsimainyang) is a strength athlete, movement coach, and co-host of Mark Bell’s Power Project, one of the top fitness podcasts in the world. He is also one of the most freakishly athletic humans I’ve ever met. He’s a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a professional natural bodybuilder (placed top five in the world), and an elite-level powerlifter (750-plus-pound deadlift, etc.)—but what sets him apart is how he blends all those worlds with unconventional training tools like kettlebells, maces, sandbags, and rope flow. Nsima is also the founder of The Stronger Human, a growing online community focused on strength, movement, and resilience.This episode is brought to you by:Pique premium pu’er tea crystals: https://piquelife.com/tim (20% off—valid for the lifetime of your subscription—plus a free Starter Kit, which includes a rechargeable frother and glass beaker)Momentous high-quality supplements: https://livemomentous.com/tim (code TIM for up to 35% off)Eight Sleep Pod Cover 5 sleeping solution for dynamic cooling and heating: EightSleep.com/Tim (use code TIM to get $350 off your very own Pod 5 Ultra.)*Watch the interview on YouTube: https://youtu.be/mLGqrlxofXANsima's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/nsimaInyangThe Stronger Human: https://www.skool.com/thestrongerhuman/aboutThe Stronger Human Store: https://thestrongerhuman.store/*Timestamps:[00:00:00] Start.[00:07:57] Defining powerlifting and Nsima’s elite totals.[00:10:30] Nsima’s first video that grabbed my attention.[00:11:26] Serge Gracovetsky and The Spinal Engine.[00:12:18] How Nsima avoids the distinctive plane-bound movement of many bodybuilders.[00:16:45] My tango struggles and coping with the “waist of a chicken.”[00:18:12] Intro to rope flow and David Weck.[00:20:15] Rope flow benefits, mechanics, and efficacy as an internal martial art.[00:35:21] Minimum effective dose rope flow.[00:37:37] Rope flow equipment and costs.[00:39:31] Bill Maeda and movement as daily practice.[00:42:38] How my three years of chronic pain and movement limitations might have been solved by breathing properly.[00:48:53] Lower body training: unilateral before bilateral, sandbags vs. barbells.[00:52:29] Box squats and safety: managing compression sensitivity and range of motion.[00:58:37] Set rep programming for non-elite powerlifters.[01:05:12] Eschew the monotonous.
