  "text": "For many consumer brands, landing on shelves at a national retailer like Target is a major milestone. However, getting there too quickly, before your business is ready, can do more harm than good. Blueland recently launched nationally across more than 1,800 Target stores, but that moment came six years into our journey. It was not because we didn’t have the opportunity sooner, but because we knew we weren’t ready. In building Blueland, here’s one of the most important lessons we’ve learned along the way: Retail doesn’t build brands, it exposes them. Retail is a magnifier. It’s often assumed that mass retail will elevate your brand to the next level. In practice, it puts your entire business under a microscope. If your pricing lacks clarity, your packaging doesn’t resonate on the shelf, or your operations can’t meet demand, retail will surface those challenges immediately and at scale. That’s why we approached early retail partnerships as an opportunity to learn. Some pilots led to expanded distribution. Others sent us back to refine everything from our count sizes to our pricing architecture. Over time, that learning compounded. This year, in addition to the Target rollout, we’ve also scaled into hundreds of Costco warehouses (which began as a 10-warehouse test), and launched with Whole Foods, Kroger, Thrive Market, and other retail partners. These weren’t overnight wins. They were built over several years of testing and iteration. According to Nielsen, 85 percent of new CPG products fail within two years. This is often due to poor product-market fit and execution. Retail isn’t just a channel. It’s a different business model. One of the most common missteps I see among digitally native brands is treating retail like a simple channel extension. But it’s not just another line on the distribution roadmap. It’s a fundamentally different business model. Before generating any retail revenue, you invest in inventory, packaging, slotting fees, trade marketing, and demand planning tools. Many brands need to build entirely new functions—retail operations, sales, and field marketing—well before the first PO is ever placed. Attribution becomes less precise. ROI is harder to measure. And operational issues, like stockouts or planogram execution, can materially impact performance. Recognizing this early through our tests and partnerships helped us shift our approach. We focused on building the right systems for retail from the ground up, rather than expecting it to conform to the frameworks we’d developed in DTC. CB Insights found that 38 percent of startups fail due to cash flow strain, potentially triggered by premature or overly aggressive retail expansion. Omnichannel strength over channel speed.From the beginning, brands should prioritize strength over speed. Rather than pursuing every possible channel, focus on being exceptional in the ones you choose. Our DTC and Amazon channels gave us a foundation to deeply understand customer behavior and refine our offerings. We learned what drove repeat buyers and what messaging resonated. That foundation helped us make more informed decisions as we expanded into retail. By the time we committed to a national rollout, we had already:  Identified high-retention SKUs that could support strong velocities  Built meaningful brand equity across channels  Developed pricing and promotion strategies aligned across retail and DTC  Integrated planning and supply chain systems to support scale  Those investments made the transition to mass retail far more strategic, and far more sustainable. Don’t rush to be everywhere. Take the time to get it right. There’s real pressure for consumer brands to grow quickly. But retail isn’t a finish line. It’s a stress test. At Blueland, we didn’t rush into a nationwide Target launch. We worked toward it, intentionally and incrementally, by listening to consumers, iterating on what wasn’t working, and investing ahead of growth. When we finally expanded nationally, we did so with the confidence that we had the systems, team, and business model to support it. If you’re building a brand today and weighing retail expansion, I’d offer this: Don’t optimize for speed. Optimize readiness. Because when you are ready, shelf space doesn’t just represent scale. It becomes a foundation for lasting growth. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
