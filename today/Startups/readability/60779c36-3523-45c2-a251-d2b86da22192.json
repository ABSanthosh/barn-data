  "text": "While you may have heard of Zig Ziglar, you may not have known that he was a college dropout who first became a driven salesman for the WearEver Cookware company, and then a remarkably popular motivational speaker and author. Zig infused his sales and business teaching with his irresistible Southern charm and strong belief in people’s capabilities to achieve great things by replacing bad habits with good ones. Although, sadly, he’s no longer with us, Zig wrote more than two dozen books over the course of his life. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of his iconic book, See You at the Top. In that book, Zig shared this powerful message: Business and life success emerge when you maintain a positive mindset, set clear goals, and possess an authentic wish to support others.Business professionals around the world admired Zig Ziglar because he empowered them to achieve great things by balancing a commitment to hard work with compassion for others. Here are 21 of Zig Ziglar’s very best quotes to inspire you to achieve great things too.1. “Set a goal so big that you can’t achieve it until you grow into the person who can.”2. “You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.”3. “Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.”4. “In the game of life, before you get anything out, you must put something in!”5. “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.”6. “Positive thinking will let you do everything better than negative thinking will.”7. “It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you use that makes a difference.”8. “You were born to win, but to be a winner, you must plan to win, prepare to win, and expect to win.”9. “I’ve got to say no to the good so I can say yes to the best.”10. “If you don’t see yourself as a winner, then you cannot perform as a winner.”11. “There are no traffic jams on the extra mile.”12. “Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life—all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity.”13. “The only way to coast is downhill.”14. “Obstacles are the things we see when we take our eyes off our goals.”15. “Remember, you can earn more money, but when time is spent it is gone forever.”16. “Sometimes adversity is what you need to face in order to become successful.”17. “Failure is an event, not a person. Yesterday ended last night.”18. “Gratitude is the healthiest of all human emotions. The more you express gratitude for what you have the more likely you will have even more to express gratitude for.”19. “What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.”20. “If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time.”21. “Success is not a destination, it’s a journey.”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
