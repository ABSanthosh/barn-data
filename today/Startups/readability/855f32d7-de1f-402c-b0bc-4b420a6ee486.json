  "text": "In 2008, Google’s launch of its Chrome browser quietly ushered in a new era of digital marketing. Over time, Google’s algorithm updates—often rolled out twice a year—shaped how SEO, content, and PR professionals approached online visibility. While the exact signals remain closely guarded, a consistent formula for organic search success has undeniably emerged.But today, the digital landscape is shifting again—this time under the weight of generative AI.In May 2025 alone, Apple reported a decline in Google searches on Safari, Fortune declared the death of click-based marketing, and Perplexity launched a transactional in-chat shopping feature—signaling a seismic shift toward AI-driven brand discovery.According to Gartner, more than 80 percent of enterprises will implement generative AI applications by 2026—a sharp rise from less than 5 percent in 2023. This swift adoption signals a pivotal shift in how brands must approach visibility and reputation management in an AI-driven landscape.Yet, AI’s most urgent impact on marketing isn’t in content creation—it’s in brand discoverability. While executives assess AI’s implications across operations, ignoring its impact on marketing visibility could pose the biggest threat to growth.This shift from clicks to mentions makes public relations a strategic cornerstone of brand discovery in the AI era. Generative AI curates content not by popularity but by signals such as context, credibility, and consistency. Thought leadership builds trust. Media placements show authority. Third-party validations cement it. These aren’t just PR wins—they’re the inputs AI uses to decide which brands deserve visibility.Forward-looking CEOs will recognize this moment as a pivotal shift—and a rare opportunity to shape the future of brand visibility. Today, referrals from platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude may account for less than 10 percent of traffic, but their influence is scaling fast. Midsize companies, in particular, are well-positioned to capitalize—agile enough to adapt swiftly, yet resourced enough to lead the charge in AI-optimized marketing and PR.Rethink content strategy for the AI search ageThe good news: Optimizing for AI search won’t hurt your Google strategy—but it requires a shift in mindset. AI-driven platforms, including Google’s own AI-generated answers, are reshaping how information is surfaced, often prioritizing context over clicks.Large language models (LLMs) aren’t just scanning headlines—they’re evaluating the credibility, consistency, and originality of content across blogs, social media, and news sites. Each source influences brand positioning in different ways, but together, they shape how your brand is understood by AI systems.That’s why owned content—your blogs, insights, FAQs, and comparison guides—must do more than exist. It needs a clear point of view, strategic consistency, and zero jargon. When your content is distinct and useful, it signals authority. When it’s generic or AI-generated, it fades into the noise.Search experts now refer to this emerging practice as generative engine optimization (GEO)—and it’s becoming as critical as SEO was a decade ago.While search engines aren’t penalizing AI-generated content, experienced brands understand that such content often lacks voice and perspective—traits that large language models interpret as indicators of originality and usefulness. AI tools can support idea generation, outlining, and editing, but creating brand content should remain a human-led task to preserve authenticity and strategic alignment.PR’s role in AI searchThe value of a website is no longer measured solely by visitor traffic. Large language models hoover up any content they can access, making it essential for brands to actively shape their digital narratives. However, many of the most prestigious media outlets—like The New York Times—are currently blocking LLM crawlers over copyright concerns.As AI platforms negotiate access to media content, brands must rethink PR value—not just in terms of prestige, but in AI visibility. Strategic credibility is now about being discoverable as well as authoritative.Thought leadership, press coverage, and brand mentions now shape how AI sees you. Unlike Google’s pay-to-play ecosystem, AI platforms surface content based on credibility and contextual relevance. For CEOs, this is a rare chance to guide how the brand is framed—without competing for ad space.This is the time to assess how your brand appears in AI search. Start simple: What happens when you ask ChatGPT about your company? Does it know your products? Can it explain how you’re different? And are your key messages showing up across tools like Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini?A robust PR strategy serves as the steward of brand governance, ensuring the narrative consistency that AI systems prioritize when determining credibility and authority.The risk of inactionIn digital ecosystems, as in nature, vacuums don’t last—AI fills them fast.Companies that resist this shift risk ceding control of their brand narrative, allowing AI to fill in the blanks with incomplete—or even inaccurate—information.Without a strategic commitment to content and PR, companies risk eroding their credibility and losing ground to competitors who are actively shaping their visibility in AI-driven environments.The executive imperative for the AI eraHere are four steps companies can take to stay current with the technology’s impact on brands. Audit and align PR to strategic goalsBrand impressions that don’t drive clicks may seem invisible—but they hold real strategic value. Align PR with mission-critical business goals, and evolve KPIs beyond activity metrics to reflect true impact and ROI. Create a board-level and C-suite conversation about brand discoverabilityBrand visibility isn’t just marketing’s job—it’s a leadership priority. Some CEOs now encourage internal competitions to boost LinkedIn visibility, recognizing how often AI pulls from that platform. But it shouldn’t stop with employees. Discoverability today requires an all-hands approach across stakeholders and strategies. Hold partners to AI-friendly policiesBe clear with agencies and partners about your expectations for brand reputation and AI readiness. If they’re not aligned with AI-forward strategies—or not keeping pace—find ones who are. Move from reactive PR to strategic PRMany companies still use PR reactively—during crises or high-stakes events like IPOs or mergers. But this mindset limits influence, which today is currency across every department. Make PR a foundational tool for brand growth and AI-era success. The rise of generative AI isn’t a distant horizon—it’s a present-day disruptor reshaping how influence, authority, and visibility are earned. Brands that adapt early will shape the conversation. Those that wait will be defined by it.Silence is strategy’s biggest risk in an AI-shaped world.The super early-rate deadline for the 2025 Inc.
