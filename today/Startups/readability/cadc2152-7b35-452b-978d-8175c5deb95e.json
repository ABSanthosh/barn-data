  "text": "There has been a dearth of initial public offerings on Wall Street so far this year, as companies pull back plans because of President Trump’s tariffs and the volatility in the stock market. The ice, though, could be cracking. San Francisco-based Figma, a design software maker, has submitted paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission that begins the IPO process. The confidential filing is not a guarantee of a listing, but gives the company the option to pursue a public offering, following a review by the SEC.Figma’s filing comes 15 months after Adobe decided to end a proposed $20 billion takeover of Figma, following concerns from U.K. regulators over how the deal might reduce competition in the design software space. (Adobe paid a $1 billion termination fee to end the deal.)Founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, Figma has become a popular choice for designers that need to collaborate on website and app prototypes. Notable clients include Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify, Zoom, Airbnb, and Google. The company employs approximately 1,600 people.Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia Capital. A tender offer last May that let employees sell shares after the collapse of the Adobe deal valued the company at $12.5 billion. That was 25 percent higher than its previous valuation in a 2021 fundraising round. Watchers will be curious to see where that valuation stands when the SEC filing is released publicly.Will IPOs finally open up?Figma’s filing could signal hope for the beginning of a thaw in the IPO market. It comes as self-driving truck startup Kodiak recently announced plans to go public in a $2.5 billion SPAC deal and Chinese team firm Chagee has shown interest in a $400 million IPO in New York, despite the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China.The uncertainty on Wall Street has pushed several startups to delay their 2025 IPO plans so far this year. Both StubHub and Klarna, which have already filed their prospectuses with the Securities and Exchange Commission, have delayed their plans. Fintech company Chime, meanwhile, which reportedly was on the verge of revealing its SEC filing, recently changed its mind.AI chip company Cerebras, which released an investor prospectus last September, has also decided to stay private for now. And car rental startup Turo, which has been looking for the right moment to go public for over four years, has withdrawn its registration statement entirely from the Securities and Exchange Commission.It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Officials at the New York Stock Exchange said last December that they were expecting a busy year thanks to lower interest rates and perceived lower odds of a recession at the time.All totaled, there were 150 IPOs in 2024, raising $29.6 billion, according to Renaissance Capital—better than 2023 (when 108 IPOs raised $19.4 billion), but below the historical average of 254 IPOs per year. Delayed interest rate cuts and market volatility kept companies on the sideline in recent years.Investors were hoping this was the year things would turn around. However, a growing number of economists believe the chances of a recession are higher because of Trump’s tariffs.Despite the economic turmoil, some companies remain cautiously optimistic, as Figma’s filing indicates. In the first quarter, 53 IPOs raised $8.5 billion, Renaissance Capital reports, with 15 of those raising $100 million or more and CoreWeave having the biggest tech public offering since 2021. The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
