  "text": "“I heard this internal memo of mine is being leaked right now, so here it is,” Shopify co-founder CEO Tobi Lutke recently posted on X, before sharing a memo in which he outlined his vision for AI to employees. As the Lutke episode illustrates, there is no such thing as internal communications anymore. Or rather, there’s no such thing as purely internal communications. That’s true whether or not you add in the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to your attack-planning Signal chat. It’s a delicate dance that founders have to manage as their companies grow and teams expand. When the entire company can fit around a small table — when you’re the one who’s interviewed and hired every employee — it’s easier to manage. In that family stage, it’s simpler to communicate frankly and transparently, and that’s good for your team and for your business. But as five employees become 10, as 10 become 20, the odds of something that shouldn’t be public getting out there grow exponentially — and the ramifications of that can be devastating. At the same time, authentic, honest communication is still key to maintaining a cohesive, strong, noble team, because your team will know if you’re talking at them as opposed to with them. As these stakes grow, the importance of a strategic approach to internal communications becomes more critical — yet many companies continue to treat internal comms as an afterthought, separate and underresourced compared with external comms. That needs to change, and here are a few ways to start: Be intentional. When I’m considering traditionally external communications strategy, I’m driven by three main questions: What do I have to share? Who do I want to know about it? How am I going to share it with them? Those same three questions should drive your internal communications, and you should spend as much time thinking about their answers as you would for a press release. Every moment you’re speaking with your team is an opportunity to move your company in a better direction — and by putting thought into those moments, you’re setting yourself up to take advantage of those opportunities. Keep your voice. Your internal communications shouldn’t sound like a press release — they should sound like you. Letting fear overrule your authenticity is a recipe for an unmotivated, cynical team. What’s more, it’s a false choice between the two. You can still be yourself while also being thoughtful and deliberate about what you’re saying. Measure twice, cut once. Once you’ve said something, it’s really hard to un-say it — and that holds true whether you’re communicating in a public forum or just to your team. Give yourself — and a trusted adviser, whether they’re inside or outside the company — the space for a gut-check before you go to market. Accept that bad things happen. Communicating authentically means acknowledging that things go wrong and that you don’t have all the answers. You hired your team for a reason — they’re smart, savvy people, and they can see through BS. The best way to keep your team with you through tough moments is to be direct and straightforward with them — particularly with your core team — and empower them to be a part of the solution. The costs of a leak, whether it’s intentional or inadvertent, can change the course of your business. You may understand those costs as a founder, but as your team grows, they may not. When you choose to communicate sensitive items with your team, it never hurts to remind everyone of what could happen if that information got out into the world. While you’re at it, make a plan for what you’d do if it does. Being a founder is never easy — and finding time to devote to internal communications is hard. But that time is an investment that will pay off, both in terms of preventing downside and, more important, to build a team that will help you continue to grow and thrive, through whatever challenges you have to face.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
