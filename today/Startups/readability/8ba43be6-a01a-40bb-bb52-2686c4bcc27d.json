  "text": "Though no injuries have been reported, the Honda recall aims to prevent potential crashes. Photo: Getty ImagesHonda Motor Co. is recalling close to 1.7 million vehicles due to a manufacturing issue that could make it difficult to steer the vehicles and lead to crashes.Honda reported the recall last week to government regulators, who issued the recall order. The Honda recall order from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that the steering gearbox assembly may have been manufactured incorrectly. This could cause “excessive internal friction” that could make the vehicle difficult to steer and increase the likelihood of a crash. The vehicles covered in the recall were from model years 2022 to 2025. They include certain Acura Integras, Honda Civics, Honda CR-Vs and Honda HR-Vs. The NHTSA announced an investigation of the problem back in March after it received 145 complaints from Honda Civic drivers that their steering wheels would stick, forcing them to exert extra effort to turn the car. At the time of the original announcement earlier this year, the NHTSA said it had no reports of crashes or injuries. This order does not mention any accidents or injuries caused by the defect either. Notification letters are expected to mailed to the vehicle owners on Nov. 18. Owners can take vehicles to dealers, who will replace the worm gear spring and reapply grease at no cost. Owners may contact Honda customer service at 1-888-234-2138. The numbers for the recall are SJS, MJU, QJT and VJV. Copyright 2024. All rights reserved.
