Alexandr Wang, the 28-year-old former CEO of AI training data startup Scale AI, will lead the group and assume the newly created role of Meta's Chief AI Officer (Meta has a separate Chief AI Scientist, Yann LeCun).Related: 'I'll Fight to Keep Every One of You': OpenAI Responds to Meta Poaching Talent, Says It Is 'Recalibrating' Pay In the memo, Zuckerberg called Wang the \"most impressive founder of his generation\" and said that former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman would \"partner\" with Wang to lead the MSL team. The new unit will encompass Meta's existing teams that focus on developing AI models and AI products. It will also include Meta's fundamental AI research (FAIR) team.\"As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the memo. \"I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way.\" Meta previously announced a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI earlier this month in exchange for a 49% stake and fresh talent from the startup, including Wang.Alexandr Wang.
