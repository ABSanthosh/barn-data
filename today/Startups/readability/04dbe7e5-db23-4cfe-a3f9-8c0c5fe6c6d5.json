  "text": "CEOs of Big Tech, they're just like us.The Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, 42, says he was very close to being a victim of a well-played phishing scheme that involved some very real-looking \"secure Google domains.\"Mosseri wrote on Threads, which, like Instagram, is owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, said on Tuesday that he \"experienced a sophisticated phishing attack yesterday.\" Related: Mark Cuban's Google Account Was Hacked By 'Sophisticated' Bad ActorsMosseri said he got a call from an 818 number (and he answered). The caller said that his \"Google account was compromised, and they sent an email to confirm identity.\" \"On the phone, they asked me to change my password using my Gmail app and to *not* say my new password out loud.
