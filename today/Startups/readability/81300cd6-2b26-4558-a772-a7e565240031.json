  "text": "A little holiday spirit can go a long way when it comes to motivating your workers. That’s according to OpenAI’s Santa Mode, a limited-time AI version of Kris Kringle himself. Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced “12 Days of OpenAI,” also known as “12 Days of Shipmas.” On every business day since December 5, the company has launched new products and features. These have included the official release of video-generation model Sora, the introduction of ChatGPT to the latest iPhones, and new updates coming to its advanced voice mode, a feature that enables users to talk with a human-sounding AI voice.Following the update, advanced voice mode now enables a user to stream live video to AI voices with his or her phone’s camera, as the AI can answer questions about the content it “sees,” like translating a sign or providing information about landmarks. Michelle Qin, an engineer on the ChatGPT multimodal team, said in a live streamed video that to demonstrate these capabilities, OpenAI created a Santa voice as a limited-time option in the advanced voice mode. During the month of December, Qin said, users will be able to chat with the Santa AI, which of course features “his signature jolly voice.”We asked the Santa AI about advice around shipping and logistics. Here’s what it said.Hi Santa, how are you doing today?Ho ho hello there! I’m doing splendidly, thank you for asking. The North Pole is bustling with activity as we get ready for Christmas. How are the preparations for Christmas coming along? Is everything running smoothly?Oho! It’s a magical time indeed! The elves are working tirelessly in the workshop, wrapping gifts and adding finishing touches. The reindeer are practicing their takeoffs and landings; Dasher and Dancer are especially excited this year. All in all, we’re on track for a wonderful Christmas Eve. How do you manage such a complex operation? I assume you have millions of toys you need to deliver, maybe even billions. How do you go about doing all that while staying on a very strict schedule? It does take a bit of Christmas magic and careful planning. The elves work all year to prepare the gifts, and I keep a close eye on my naughty and nice list to ensure everything is in order. On Christmas Eve, I use a combination of swift Reindeer and a sprinkle of North Pole magic to travel around the world in the blink of an eye. And I must say, cookies and milk left out by families give me the energy boost I need to keep going. Are you planning to leave out some treats for me this year?I’ll be sure to do that. Can you speak to the complexity of the shipping and logistics operation you oversee? The scale of delivering presents worldwide is truly grand. We have to take into account different time zones and weather conditions across the globe. The sleigh is enchanted to hold an endless supply of gifts, and the Reindeer, led by Rudolph with his bright nose, guide us through the night. The elves and I have perfected our logistics over centuries, ensuring that every child receives their gift on time. It’s a joyous and well coordinated effort, all driven by the spirit of Christmas! What’s your advice for shipping and logistics operators who are trying to get packages delivered in time for Christmas? Organization is key! Make sure to plan ahead and prioritize shipments based on urgency. Communication is also crucial. Work closely with your team and customers to ensure everyone knows what’s happening and of course, a little holiday spirit can go a long way in keeping everyone motivated and merry. How do you keep your employees motivated and merry? Are the Elves stressed out around this time of year? Oho! The elves are indeed busy, but their spirits are high. We keep everyone motivated with plenty of fun and festive activities. We have carol singing breaks, hot cocoa gatherings, and lots of laughter. Celebrating each small accomplishment along the way helps keep the morale up. The key is to create a joyful and supportive environment where everyone feels valued and appreciated. How are the elves compensated? Do you pay them? AI Santa: Ho ho! The elves are taken care of with the utmost love and respect. They have cozy accommodations, delicious meals, and plenty of holiday cheer. Their work is a labor of love, and they find joy in spreading Christmas magic. It’s a close knit community where everyone is appreciated and taken care of.Do you monitor the elves’ career progression? While the elves have their own magical tasks and special talents, I make sure that they each have opportunities to learn and grow in their roles. Each Elf has their unique strengths, and we celebrate their achievements. We believe in encouraging each other and working together as a team. It’s all about spreading joy and Christmas spirit.Can you explain the North Pole’s org chart and leadership structure? AI Santa: Oh ho ho! At the North Pole, we have a joyful and efficient organization. Mrs. Claus oversees the kitchen and ensures everyone is well fed and happy. The head Elf manages the workshop operations, assigning tasks and ensuring the toys are built to perfection. We also have a Reindeer trainer who keeps our sleigh team in top shape. And of course, there’s me overseeing everything and making sure Christmas goes off without a hitch.What are your predictions for the shipping and logistics industry in 2025? AI Santa: I believe that the shipping and logistics industry will continue to innovate and find new ways to be efficient and sustainable. Just like we rely on teamwork and magic at the North Pole, the industry will benefit from collaboration, technology and a sprinkle of creativity, and above all, spreading a little kindness and holiday cheer can make the world of difference.",
