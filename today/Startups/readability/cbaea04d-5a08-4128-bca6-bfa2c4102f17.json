  "text": "In today’s achievement-oriented culture, many of us subscribe to this fundamentally flawed equation: work harder + working longer hours = success and happiness. You relentlessly push your limits to achieve professional goals and boost productivity. However, you soon discover that success feels empty once you attain it. You’re too burned out to enjoy it.Emma Seppala, the science director of Stanford University’s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, draws from extensive research in neuroscience and psychology to craft a compelling alternative for today: Success follows happiness, rather than happiness following success.Seppala explains that happiness creates significant beneficial effects throughout our work and personal lives. The state of happiness expands our emotional and social understanding while simultaneously increasing our productivity, effectiveness, and ability to positively affect others around us.Here are five research-backed approaches to becoming happier and more successful.1. Be compassionate.When you move from a focus on your own personal advancement goals to supporting your colleagues, you create a productive work environment that benefits everyone. Compassionate leaders build team loyalty and cohesion, which leads to improved organizational performance. The most successful professionals typically demonstrate their influence through sincere support for their colleagues’ achievements.2. Expand your comfort zone.Always staying in your comfort zone is a sure way to limit your growth, at work and in life. When you engage in calculated risk-taking and learn new skills, you develop new brain pathways that will make you more adaptable—an essential trait in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing work environments.3. Embrace idle time.Counterintuitively, you can enhance your personal productivity by scheduling regular breaks and downtime. Doing nothing at all provides the necessary mental space and relaxed outlook that facilitate innovative thinking. It’s during these times, rather than periods of intense concentration, that you can experience breakthrough insights.4. Cultivate resilience.Working in high-stress conditions is a sure way to exhaust your mental capabilities. This means that, more than ever, you’ve got to become more resilient—that is, more able to bounce back from adversity and challenges. Invest in your relationships. Communicate your feelings and challenges openly. Offer your help and support to others in your network.5. Be here now.You often become anxious when you find yourself paying more attention to the things you have to do in the future instead of the things you are doing right now. Concentrating fully in the present moment will increase both your productivity and your effectiveness. As the popular author Eckhart Tolle suggests, “Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life.”The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The extended application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is this Friday, March 14, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
