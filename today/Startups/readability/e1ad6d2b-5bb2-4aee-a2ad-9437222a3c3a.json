  "text": "Buzzy EV-maker Rivian just spun a secret team of in-house innovators into a brand new company with a focus on micromobility. Called Also, the startup brought in $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures to tackle electrified travel in smaller form factors.Also president Chris Yu, formerly the VP of future programs at Rivian, says the company aims to apply the Rivian handbook of combining strong customer insights, cutting-edge design and vertically integrated technology to smaller vehicles.“That just hasn’t happened for anything smaller than a car yet,” Yu says. “Our entire premise is using that same ingredient set and creating really, really compelling, fun, inspiring vehicles that are much smaller than a car.”Micromobility generally refers to smaller, lightweight vehicles such as e-bikes, scooters, three-wheelers, and motorcycles. Although Also has been coy with what exactly its first product will be, Rivian CEO and founder RJ Scaringe, who sits on Also’s board, teased to TechCrunch that “there’s a seat, and there’s two wheels, there’s a screen, and there’s a few computers and a battery.” Also plans to unveil its initial designs later this year with a consumer product launching in 2026, first for the U.S., then Europe. It will follow that up with products for both consumer and commercial use rolling out for Asia and South America throughout that year and into the following.With the $105 million in funding from Eclipse, Also plans to build out a technology platform capable of supporting a variety of different small mobility form factors for both consumer and commercial products all across the world. Furthermore, the investment will ensure Also can create a “delightful experience” for customers through a retail network and services, Yu adds.Value proposition is core to Also’s mission. Scaringe commented to TechCrunch about the premium pricing associated with high-end e-bikes saying, “you can spend $6,000 to $8,000 on, and really nice ones, over $10,000. That’s a reflection of a poorly developed supply chain that’s very, very, very tiered.” Yu agrees. “Beyond the strict cost number, it has to click in terms of what you’re getting from a value proposition out of the vehicle, and the experiences you’ll get out of it, and the price that you’re paying,” he says. “RJ’s point has been, historically within these modes, that the price to value proposition has been really skewed compared to, say, a Rivian car.”Part of how Also hopes to create cost-effective products is through vertical integration. Also will own the engineering and design of intellectual property, but plans to team up with global manufacturers that can produce its products at scale. It plans to leverage some of the building blocks and base architecture established at Rivian, but for smaller mobility options. Yu says that means optimizing technology like battery packs, and battery management systems, power control electronics, and more for smaller form factors. Also products could appear in Rivian retail spaces in markets where it makes sense, Yu says.Scaringe has long had his sights set on electrifying the micromobility space to improve accessibility, as well as reduce the congestion and environmental harms that coincide with using full-sized vehicles for short trips. Conversations about an internal initiative started in earnest in 2019, according to TechCrunch. In 2022, Yu joined Rivian from bicycle and ebike maker Specialized to help grow the secret team of innovators and bring the broader vision to reality. “What we are really excited about is to play a part in accelerating and catalyzing this shift, both in the multimodal fabric [of micromobility], as well as electrification of existing small modes, and doing it in much the same way as Rivian has done, which is creating a product that is so incredibly inspiring that people say yes to adopting and it just happens to be electric,” says Yu.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
