  "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Victoria Dickerson, Jeff Amerine, and Daniel Koonce are joined by Anna Beth Gorman, CEO of The Women's Foundation of Arkansas (WFA). Founded in 1998, the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas has been working to understand the diverse needs and realities facing women and girls so it can respond through purposeful action and engaged philanthropy.  The foundation's initiatives, such as the Women’s Economic Mobility Hub, support Black women entrepreneurs by providing them with unrestricted funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities. WFA also addresses barriers faced by women entrepreneurs, including language barriers, resource awareness, and access to capital. Additionally, the foundation's internship program, funded by the Delta Regional Authority, offers housing and transportation for high-paying internships, helping first-generation college students gain essential social and financial capital. Gorman also mentions the \"Girls of Promise\" program, which introduces young women to STEM careers through hands-on activities and job shadowing. WFA’s extensive efforts in promoting women’s economic development in Arkansas involve publishing reports on economic indicators for women and advocating for inclusive language and easier resource accessibility.  Throughout the episode, Anna Beth shares about her experience working to support women entrepreneurs in Arkansas, the unique barriers that exist for these women, and how running for the Arkansas Secretary of State impacted her approach to advocacy.   Show Notes (0:00) Introduction (0:44) Anna Beth’s Origin Story (2:40) The Difference the WFA is Making (4:33) Barriers to Women Entrepreneurs (7:44) WFA Success Stories (10:17) About the WFA’s Financing Options (12:34) The WFA’s Impact (14:35) The WFA’s Program for Young Entrepreneurs (18:34) How to Get Involved in the WFA’s Programs (20:00) About Anna Beth’s Background (24:53) Lessons from Running for Arkansas Secretary of State (28:33) What’s Next for the WFA (29:02) Closing Question   Links Victoria Dickerson Jeff Amerine Daniel Koonce Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Anna Beth Gorman Women’s Foundation of Arkansas",
