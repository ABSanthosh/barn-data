  "text": "Six years ago, I visited Shenzhen, a Chinese city near Hong Kong, with 15 Babson College students. What I witnessed there was something I never imagined would find its way to the U.S.—a totalitarian government using artificial intelligence to monitor the movements, online activity, and purchasing behavior of every citizen—like a Black Mirror episode. And yet, a recent Mother Jones investigation reveals that Clearview AI is helping the Trump administration create a similar scenario. SenseTime And China’s Social Credit ScoreTake a journey with me back to 2019. That’s when my students and I crossed the border from Hong Kong to Shenzhen. When we went through customs, three of our students were tapped by Chinese police and asked to go to a room for questioning. It turned out after they were released that a temperature sensor in the ceiling found that they had an elevated temperature. What’s more, in order to get through customs, each of us needed to provide finger and thumb prints from both hands.The first company we met once we had made it through customs, artificial intelligence provider SenseTime, was valued at more than $7 billion with 2018 revenues estimated by Bloomberg at $300 million. SenseTime was founded in 2014 by Tang Xiaoou, a professor with a Ph.D. from MIT, and then employed over 400 Ph.Ds. They built so-called deep-learning systems that pored through social media data and individual photographs from the cameras located throughout Chinese cities to help the government govern.In 2021, the company went public and last year generated $518 million in 2024 revenue. In recent years, SenseTime has launched a generative AI business that has grown so rapidly that it now accounts for nearly 64 percent of the company’s revenue—surpassing the computer vision segment of the business, according to the South China Morning Post, that we witnessed in 2019. That computer vision technology was used to help the government give each citizen a Social Credit Score, according to CBS News. It’s much like a credit score from a bank—but developed for each individual by the government, I noted in the Worcester Telegram \u0026 Gazette. Chinese citizens with high social scores had more freedom than those with lower scores. Back in 2017, Business Insider noted that “17 people who refused to carry out military service last year were barred from enrolling in higher education, applying for high school, or continuing their studies.” As for the citizens that the Chinese government deems trustworthy? They get discounts on energy bills, lower borrowing rates at banks and a profile boost on China’s largest online dating site, CBS News reported.Clearview AI And Trump’s Infringement On Constitutional RightsNow the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are using facial recognition technology from Clearview AI “to target immigrants and the political left,” according to Mother Jones. And they have been since the Biden administration. Clearview’s faceprint database “creates a really disturbingly powerful tool for police that can identify nearly every person at a protest or a reproductive health facility or a house of worship with just photos of those people’s faces,” Surveillance Technology Oversight Project executive director Albert Fox Cahn told Mother Jones.The Mother Jones story goes on to note that, “Corporations like Macy’s allegedly used Clearview on shoppers, according to legal records; law enforcement has deployed it against activists and protesters; and multiple government investigations have found federal agencies’ use of the product failed to comply with privacy requirements. Many local and state law enforcement agencies now rely on Clearview as a tool in everyday policing, with almost no transparency about how they use the tech.” One of Clearview’s biggest clients, Mother Jones notes, is US Immigration and Customs EnforcementOn January 19, Donald Trump swore an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the U.S. constitution. This includes the first amendment which enshrines freedom of speech and the fourth amendment, which requires that law enforcement obtain a warrant based on probable cause before searching a person, their home, or their belongings. With very few exceptions, these amendments apply to both citizens and non-citizens.  Unless the legal system can stop the use of Clearview to target people, it is possible the U.S. could end up with a system analogous to China’s social credit score system where people Trump deems trustworthy could live much better lives than those he views as enemies.The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.The final application deadline for the 2025 Inc. 5000 is Friday, April 25, at 11:59 p.m. PT.
