Funding awards will range from $1,000 to $50,000, with a cash match required based on the size of the community:Communities with populations between 2,500 and 50,000 must provide a 50% match.Communities with fewer than 2,500 residents must provide a 25% match.To maintain the historic charm of Kansas downtowns, projects must follow the Kansas Commerce Sign Guidelines.

To qualify, applications must propose improvements for a minimum of three signs, ideally supporting multiple buildings or businesses within a downtown area. Projects must comply with all state and local regulations, and signage must be completed within six months of grant approval.Applications will be accepted and reviewed on a monthly, first-come, first-served basis until all funds are allocated.For more information about the SIGNS grant, applicants are encouraged to contact Quality Places Manager Sara Bloom at Sara.Bloom@ks.gov or (785) 506-9278.Image: CanvaMore in: Small Business Grants, Small Business Grants - KansasEditor's Picks Joshua Sophy is the Editor for Small Business Trends and has been a member of the team for 16 years.
