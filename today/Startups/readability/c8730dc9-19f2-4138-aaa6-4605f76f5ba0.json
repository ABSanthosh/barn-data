  "text": "Unionized quality assurance workers on ZeniMax Media announced today that they had reached a tentative contract agreement with Microsoft, ZeniMax’s parent company. The workers, who are represented by the Communication Workers of America, have spent two years negotiating this contract, which they say “sets new standards for the industry” including new wage agreements and policies on AI tools. According to the union, the new agreement includes new minimum wages, wage increases across the board, arbitrary dismissal protections, grievance procedures and a new crediting policy that ensures QA workers are included in a game’s credits. The agreement also incorporates previously agreed-upon rules about the use of AI in the workplace. The CWA has previously reported that the lengthy negotiations had not proceeded because of disagreements over labor practices. The union members even voted to authorize a strike in April, noting that they hadn’t been able to come to an accord with Microsoft over a lack of remote work options and the replacement of in-house workers with outsourced contract labor. CWA President Claude Cummings said in a statement, “Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what’s possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo. Whether it’s having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We’re proud to support them every step of the way.”",
