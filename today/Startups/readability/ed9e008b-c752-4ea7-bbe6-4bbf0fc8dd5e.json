Wires got crossed, expectations blurred, and now you’re in crisis mode.   If you’ve been in this industry long enough, you’ve probably had your fair share of these hair-pulling moments.  As the founder and CEO of Quantious, I’ve spent years navigating the highs and lows of agency-client relationships. Along with Duncan Alney, founder and CEO of Firebelly Marketing, we’ve run our agencies for a combined 25+ years. We’ve seen what makes partnerships thrive, and what makes them fail.  Let’s get real. Times are tough. Layoffs and “efficiency” mandates are everywhere, and marketing and sales teams, in particular, are feeling it. But cutting agency services isn’t the answer. When used strategically, they can actually help reduce costs.  But the reality is, agency relationships don’t always work out, and the average client-agency lifespan is just 3.2 years. Ouch.  That’s why I sat down for a conversation with Duncan, to break down the lessons we’ve learned to help you get the most out of your agency partnership. Here are some of the highlights and takeaways to help you achieve a successful agency partnership.  1. Start with respect  Lisa: If we’re going to start this conversation anywhere, it has to be with respect. What else would you say is the foundation of a successful agency-client relationship?  Duncan: Well said. Respect is a fundamental value. We both place a lot of emphasis on staying true to our values and making sure that our clients and team members are aligned and protected in that way. Anything less isn’t acceptable.  Lisa: This isn’t a one-way relationship, it’s a partnership. Things like paying bills on time, showing up prepared, and owning mistakes go a long way.  Duncan: Exactly. Agencies aren’t just service providers; we have values, too. We’ve had to walk away from clients who didn’t respect those values. Respect lays the groundwork for collaboration and mutual success.  2. Ditch the RFP  Lisa: We should talk about RFPs. We’ve been vocal about ditching RFPs. Some businesses might not understand why agencies recommend avoiding this process. This is a good opportunity to explain why they don’t set partners up for success.  Duncan: Let’s be real—RFPs are “Real F’n Problems.” They can stifle creativity and rarely foster great partnerships. Instead of focusing on proposals, focus on getting to know the agency.  Lisa: I always say, “You wouldn’t hand someone you’re interested in dating a written proposal.” Building trust and alignment should come first. Instead, start with a small paid project. It’s like a test drive—see how you work together before diving into a bigger commitment.  3. Define success (together)  Lisa: On that note, you also need to make sure you’re defining what success looks like—on both sides. The most successful partnerships I’ve seen came from a result of shared understanding. You don’t have to agree on all things, but you do need to agree on what a successful partnership looks like.  Duncan: Success isn’t the agency’s job alone; it’s a reflection of how well the partnership works. Clients need to be transparent, from onboarding to ongoing communication. It’s shocking how rare things like proper kick-off meetings are. You can’t hire an agency and expect they’ll be successful without your help. It’s a partnership and they can’t work miracles.  Lisa: Agreed. Don’t make your agency guess what you want. Define your goals together. Clear communication early on sets the tone for the whole relationship.  4. Be realistic  Lisa: Agencies can’t work miracles, and we’re not magicians. Clients need to have respect for what’s actually possible. The clearer your brand identity and briefing process, the better we can perform.  Duncan: It’s important to share everything—your wins, your challenges, even your screw-ups. Especially your screw-ups. Hold nothing back. The more we know, the more effective we can be. And remember, building something truly impactful takes time.  5. Communicate, communicate, communicate  Lisa: It seems elementary, but it has to be said. Communication is one of the most important habits to build, especially with your agency partners. I’m shocked when potential partners think communication is optional.  Duncan: I have a story. We worked with a client who insisted on weekly video calls, not just emails or chat. At first, it seemed excessive, but it turned out to be a game-changer. We caught potential issues early, brainstormed in real-time, and built a rapport that went beyond business. We exceeded expectations with that campaign, and built a partnership that has lasted over three years.  Lisa: That’s a great story—it’s amazing what you can discover when you have that kind of open and consistent communication. For us, tools like Asana, Slack, and regular strategy sessions are non-negotiables. They keep everyone aligned and prevent small issues from snowballing into major problems. It’s important to establish a single point of contact on both sides to streamline decisions, as well, with at least monthly strategy sessions to review progress and to make adjustments. This should go without saying, but you’d be surprised how often it’s overlooked.  Final thoughts  Duncan: Choosing the right agency is like choosing a spouse—choose wisely, or the breakup can be painful and expensive.  Lisa: Feel confident in your ability to communicate your needs to your agency, and you’re already setting the stage for a long, successful relationship. Treat it like the partnership it is, and you’ll see amazing results.  The application deadline for Inc.'s Best Workplaces Awards is Friday, March 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apply Today.",
