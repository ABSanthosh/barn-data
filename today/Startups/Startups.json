    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Harrison Kitson sit down with Gopi Chandran and Shannon Williams from AssistNow, a rapidly growing IT services and consulting firm specializing in Workday, ERP systems, and AI integration. Gopi shares the story of founding AssistNow four years ago, bootstrapping the company from its early days after decades of experience in the ERP space. Shannon, who recently joined the team, discusses the company's core offerings: Workday staffing, consulting services, post-go-live support, and the innovative use of AI through in-house tools like Assistly. The conversation explores how AI is revolutionizing day-to-day support for clients, simplifying tasks and delivering instant answers, and hints at new tools currently in development.The discussion delves into AssistNow’s competitive edge. The team emphasizes their cost-effectiveness, commitment to customer satisfaction (including a rare money-back guarantee), and focus on building authentic relationships rather than relying solely on aggressive sales tactics. They also talk about the importance of trustworthiness, personal connection, and adaptability as drivers of their organic growth. Gopi and Shannon share valuable lessons from their entrepreneurial journeys, including the pitfalls of doing business with friends and the importance of reading contracts carefully. Looking ahead, AssistNow is planning strategic global expansion and continued innovation in AI, while maintaining its core values and personalized approach. The episode is an insightful look into what it takes to succeed—and grow—authentically in the tech consulting world!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(05:46) Creating Reports with Assistly(07:35) Targeting Mid-Market and Recoveries(11:30) Customer Retention Through Proactive Responses(16:02) Expanding Global Office Strategy(18:24) Lessons in Business and Friendship(20:22) Avoiding Desperate Decisions(23:32) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceHarrison KitsonStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeShannon WilliamsGopi ChandranAssistNow",

Susan shares her remarkable journey—how a life-changing car accident led her from being a business owner to becoming a professional artist, teacher, and inventor, all centered around her love for creative expression. She emphasizes the importance of following your passions, seizing unexpected opportunities, and embracing the philosophy of “finding a need and filling it,” which shaped both her artistic and entrepreneurial endeavors.Additionally, Allen recounts his transition from a career in engineering to curating art exhibitions, inspired in part by his father’s experience as an under-recognized artist. His work bridges artists with the community and market, using innovative, community-focused approaches—including events, collaborations, and themed exhibitions—to promote inclusivity and connection. He and Susan discuss the challenges and rewards of creative entrepreneurship, underscoring the importance of experimentation, mentorship, and supporting one another.Both guests reflect on the power of community, the need to stay open to life’s twists, and the significance of giving back. Their advice for aspiring creative entrepreneurs: keep learning, be kind to yourself through setbacks, and pursue what you love!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(04:24) Rediscovering Purpose Through Art Classes(08:46) Embarking on a Painting Journey(11:39) Unexpected Opportunities in Art Career(15:34) Finding Purpose Through Failure(22:10) Curating Underrecognized Artists' Stories(25:16) Turning Art into Business(31:01) Creative Entrepreneurship: Filling Market Gaps(33:55) Art for All: Inclusive Engagement(40:07) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeAllen PauloseSusan EdgmonARt deCentrale",
