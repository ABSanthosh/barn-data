    "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/87b3fb31",
    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Caleb Talley welcomed back Leo Orpin, co-founder of Black Apple, as the cidery approaches its tenth anniversary. Leo shared the remarkable journey of building Arkansas’s first (and still only) cidery, revealing how the brand’s steady, strategic growth and willingness to “fail fast” have fueled its success.From humble beginnings as a homebrewing hobby between friends, Black Apple’s story is one of grit, creativity, and timing. Leo reflects on early years marked by rapid scaling, boundless optimism, and a bit of ignorance that, in hindsight, helped fuel their boldness. Yet, the biggest challenges were yet to come, including the impact of COVID-19, which hit just as Black Apple was preparing for explosive growth and even debuting at a major cider expo in France.Furthermore, Leo describes their post-pandemic evolution: adapting to changing supply chains, embracing market feedback, and expanding both their downtown Springdale taproom—now a full bar and local hotspot—and their reach into Oklahoma and Kansas.Transparency, quality, and creativity set Black Apple apart. Their team experiments relentlessly with flavors—sometimes producing wild successes like strawberry dill pickle cider! And Leo’s advice to his younger self? “Slow down,” invest in data, and be patient with risks. For entrepreneurs and cider lovers alike, this episode is a testament to resilience, community-building, and the sweet rewards of authentic innovation.
