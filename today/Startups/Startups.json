Lee shares the inspiring story behind her journey to starting a green roof company in Arkansas, rooted in her passion for landscape architecture and sustainability that began in college.

Walton School of Medicine. Lee details the technical and environmental benefits of green roofs, sharing how these projects contribute to sustainability, stormwater management, and improving urban environments.Additionally, Lee discusses the importance of teamwork, mentorship, and her advisory board in growing the company.

    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Jeff Amerine welcome Catelyn Hooser, the dynamic founder and owner of Chug NWA—a Farmington-based soda shop that’s stirring up the beverage scene in Northwest Arkansas. From the get-go, Catelyn’s entrepreneurial spirit shines through as she shares the story of how she transformed a mobile soda trailer into a bustling brick-and-mortar storefront. With a background as a hairstylist and a drive to do something different, Catelyn jumped into small business ownership inspired by her father’s example and a desire to carve a unique path. Chug NWA’s menu, full of inventive soda recipes developed by Catelyn and her team, sets it apart from chain competitors like Sonic and Swig. The Cowboy (Dr. Pepper, vanilla, and homemade coconut cream) is a local favorite, alongside “guy-favorite” combos like the Float Trip (root beer, butterscotch, and vanilla).Listeners will love hearing about the challenges and rewards of running both a storefront and a mobile drink truck—from serving teacher appreciation events to handling equipment stress and expanding the menu with soft pretzels to boost revenue.Additionally, Catelyn opens up about balancing entrepreneurship and motherhood, the importance of instilling confidence and skills in her young team, and her long-term vision of expanding—perhaps with her daughter’s help someday. Her advice to herself and other entrepreneurs? “You only grow when you’re uncomfortable—keep grinding and never give up.” For anyone inspired by grassroots business and community, this episode is a must-listen!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(01:08) About Chug NWA(05:35) Challenges vs Opportunities with a Mobile Truck(08:42) Promoting Efficiency and Speed in Production(11:50) Chug NWA Expansion Plans(15:20) Combating Uncertainty with Optimism(17:03) Embracing Discomfort to Grow(17:31) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceJeff AmerineStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeCatelyn HooserChug NWA",
