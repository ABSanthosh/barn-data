    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce, Jeff Amerine, and Harrison Kitson sit down with Anna Buckley, the dynamic founder of PICNiC. Balancing a full-time job and a burgeoning side hustle, Anna embodies the spirit of modern entrepreneurship. Based in Washington, D.C., by way of Arkansas, Anna brings innovative solutions to classic designs, filling gaps in the market and elevating everyday dining experiences. PICNiC, launched in March, was born from Anna‚Äôs desire to create durable and aesthetically pleasing cabbageware‚Äîplates inspired by the timeless cabbage design but made from hard plastic melamine. The idea sprouted during a planned picnic on the D.C. National Mall. Frustrated by the lack of durable, non-ceramic cabbageware plates available, Anna saw an opportunity and seized it. After graduating from the University of Arkansas in 2023 with a degree in finance, Anna moved to D.C. to start her career at Ernst \u0026 Young (EY) as a business consultant. Her entrepreneurial spirit, however, couldn‚Äôt be contained. Leveraging her time management skills and type-A personality, she worked tirelessly after hours to bring PICNiC to life. By September, her products were ready, marking a significant milestone in her journey. Anna‚Äôs entrepreneurial drive was evident even in college, where she interned at Startup Junkie and participated in the Student Activity and Curriculum Enhancement (S.A.K.E.) program. These experiences laid the foundation for her current success, providing her with invaluable insights and mentorship. As PICNiC grows, Anna envisions expanding her product line and engaging in more collaborations. Through her journey, she aims to inspire and mentor budding entrepreneurs, sharing her story to show that with passion and perseverance, one can indeed balance business and personal interests.

    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley, Jeff Amerine, and Harrison Kitson have a conversation with the co-founder of Deep Wealth, Jeffrey Feldberg. Jeffrey‚Äôs journey began in a modest attic with a small e-learning startup in 1996 and has evolved into a masterclass in business exits. Despite facing initial challenges, Jeffrey's company gained remarkable traction, leading to a substantial seven-figure buyout offer from a Fortune 10 company. Unyielding in his vision, Jeffrey declined the offer, choosing instead to immerse himself in the intricacies of business exits. Within a mere twenty-four months, his perseverance paid off, as he successfully orchestrated a nine-figure deal for his company. Deep Wealth was born from this success. Jeffrey realized that exiting a business requires a unique set of skills distinct from those needed to grow or start one. His frustration with costly, inexperienced advisors propelled him to refine his strategies and develop an industry-agnostic, nine-step system for business exits. This framework is designed to guide entrepreneurs through the complex exit process, catering to diverse industries and age groups. Beyond financial gain, Jeffrey emphasizes the importance of rewarding key team members and fostering a culture of gratitude and generosity within organizations. His belief in the transformative potential of successful business exits extends to broader societal impacts; he envisions a \"virtuous cycle\" where the wealth generated from exits is reinvested into the community, sparking further innovation and economic growth. Deep Wealth stands as a beacon for entrepreneurs seeking to navigate their exits strategically and successfully. With Jeffrey Feldberg‚Äôs expert guidance, entrepreneurs can not only achieve their financial goals but also contribute to the enrichment of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. ¬† Show Notes (00:00) Introduction (01:08) About Deep Wealth (10:17) Advice on Receiving All Stock Offers (13:33) Diving Into Deep Wealth‚Äôs Nine-Step System (22:51) How Entrepreneurs Help Solve Problems (29:42) Advice to Younger Self (32:17) Closing Question ¬† Links Jeff Amerine Caleb Talley Harrison Kitson Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Jeffrey Feldberg Deep Wealth",
