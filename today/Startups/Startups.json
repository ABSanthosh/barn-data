They are joined by Tyler and Shania Watkins, co-founders of this unique establishment that blends the thrill of indoor sports with a welcoming lounge atmosphere.Tyler shares the inspiration behind Birdie and Brews, which began as a brainstorming concept three years ago. He aimed to create a space where people could enjoy golf regardless of the weather, drawing from experiences at various golf facilities across the country. As a pilot, Tyler had the opportunity to explore these facilities extensively, learning what worked and what could be improved upon.The Watkins talk about the rapid growth of their venture, describing the first few months since their December 2024 launch as a whirlwind.
