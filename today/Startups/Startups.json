    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Daniel Koonce are joined by Phill Shellhammer and Zoe Rose Maddox from the Greenhouse Outdoor Recreation Program (GORP) to discuss the newly launched Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator and how it’s changing the entrepreneurial landscape in northwest Arkansas and beyond. Phil kicks off the conversation by highlighting the foundational role GORP has played since October 2021 in nurturing early-stage startups in the outdoor recreation space, emphasizing GORP's mission to turn innovative ideas into viable business models rapidly. Zoe then brings attention to the scale of GORP's impact, noting that forty-six companies have participated, with many still active and generating revenue. One of the standout projects discussed in this episode is the Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator. This program differs from GORP, which focuses primarily on incubating new ideas, by aiming to push established companies to the next level. Zoe explains that the accelerator targets businesses ready to scale, particularly those innovating around cycling technologies, products, and community-building platforms. In a testament to the global reach of their endeavor, Zoe shares that applications have poured in from countries like the Czech Republic, the UK, France, New Zealand, and Korea, underscoring Bentonville’s growing reputation as a hub for cycling innovation. A key insight from the episode is the reflection on overcoming imposter syndrome and embracing curiosity. It's an inspiring reminder for all entrepreneurs to persist and stay passionate about their ventures.

Desde las primeras horas del día, los agricultores se dedican al cuidado meticuloso de las plantaciones, asegurando que cada planta reciba la atención necesaria para producir frutos de alta calidad. Este arduo trabajo refleja la dedicación y compromiso de los bananeros bolivianos con su tierra y producto. La banana boliviana ha ganado reconocimiento en mercados internacionales por su sabor distintivo y calidad superior. Andy destacó que factores como el clima favorable del Chapare y las prácticas agrícolas sostenibles contribuyen a estas características. Además, la proximidad geográfica a mercados clave en Sudamérica permite una distribución más eficiente y rápida, garantizando que el producto llegue fresco a los consumidores. La industria bananera boliviana ha enfrentado desafíos significativos en los últimos tiempos. Andy mencionó que, debido a bloqueos y conflictos sociales, se han perdido cajas de banano destinadas a la exportación, lo que representa pérdidas económicas considerables para los productores.    Show Notes (00:05) Welcome \u0026 introduction.

He is one of only a few dozen masters in the world authorized to teach Sanbo Zen, and now, he’ll be your teacher.In addition to my long-form interviews each week, every Monday I’ll bring you a short 10-minute or so meditation, which will help you for the rest of the week.Over this four-episode series, you’ll develop a Zen toolkit to help you find greater calm, peace, and effectiveness in your daily life.Henry’s app, The Way, has changed my life since I first started using it. Unlike other meditation apps, where you’re overwhelmed with a thousand choices, The Way is a clear step-by-step training program guided entirely by Henry. Through a logical progression, you’ll develop real skills that stick with you.I’ve been using it daily, often twice a day, and it’s lowered my anxiety more than I thought possible.As a listener of my podcast, you can get 30 free sessions by visiting https://thewayapp.com/tim and downloading the app.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
