    "link": "http://startupjunkiespodcast.com/404-from-his-attic-to-a-9-figure-exit-jeffrey-feldbergs-talks-maximizing-company-value",
    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley, Jeff Amerine, and Harrison Kitson have a conversation with the co-founder of Deep Wealth, Jeffrey Feldberg. Jeffrey’s journey began in a modest attic with a small e-learning startup in 1996 and has evolved into a masterclass in business exits. Despite facing initial challenges, Jeffrey's company gained remarkable traction, leading to a substantial seven-figure buyout offer from a Fortune 10 company. Unyielding in his vision, Jeffrey declined the offer, choosing instead to immerse himself in the intricacies of business exits. Within a mere twenty-four months, his perseverance paid off, as he successfully orchestrated a nine-figure deal for his company. Deep Wealth was born from this success. Jeffrey realized that exiting a business requires a unique set of skills distinct from those needed to grow or start one. His frustration with costly, inexperienced advisors propelled him to refine his strategies and develop an industry-agnostic, nine-step system for business exits. This framework is designed to guide entrepreneurs through the complex exit process, catering to diverse industries and age groups. Beyond financial gain, Jeffrey emphasizes the importance of rewarding key team members and fostering a culture of gratitude and generosity within organizations. His belief in the transformative potential of successful business exits extends to broader societal impacts; he envisions a \"virtuous cycle\" where the wealth generated from exits is reinvested into the community, sparking further innovation and economic growth. Deep Wealth stands as a beacon for entrepreneurs seeking to navigate their exits strategically and successfully. With Jeffrey Feldberg’s expert guidance, entrepreneurs can not only achieve their financial goals but also contribute to the enrichment of the entrepreneurial ecosystem.   Show Notes (00:00) Introduction (01:08) About Deep Wealth (10:17) Advice on Receiving All Stock Offers (13:33) Diving Into Deep Wealth’s Nine-Step System (22:51) How Entrepreneurs Help Solve Problems (29:42) Advice to Younger Self (32:17) Closing Question   Links Jeff Amerine Caleb Talley Harrison Kitson Startup Junkie Startup Junkie YouTube Jeffrey Feldberg Deep Wealth",

    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Jeff Amerine, Daniel Koonce, and Harrison Kitson sit down with Bryan Fittin, founder and CEO of Go Rogue Studio, to explore the story of his transition from corporate life to entrepreneurship. Initiating his career within the corporate confines of Walmart’s vendor community, Bryan always harbored a passion for content creation. This passion ultimately gave birth to Go Rogue, a podcast dedicated to entrepreneurs transitioning from corporate settings.

    "description": "This time around, we have a bit of a different format, featuring the book that started it all, The 4-Hour Workweek, which was published in 2007. It’s crazy to think that the 20th anniversary is around the corner. Readers and listeners often ask me what I would change or update, but in my mind, an equally interesting question is: what wouldn’t I change? What stands the test of time and hasn’t lost any potency? This episode features three chapters from the audiobook of The 4-Hour Workweek that are time-tested. They represent tools and frameworks that have changed my life and that I still use today.The 4-Hour Workweek: Expanded and Updated is written by Timothy Ferriss and narrated by Ray Porter. The audiobook, produced and copyrighted by Blackstone Publishing, is available wherever audiobooks are sold.
