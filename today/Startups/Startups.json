    "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/70a80bbc",
    "description": "SummaryIn this first episode of the Fuel Podcast, hosts Tom Douglass and Grace Gill sit down with co-founders of Path Fertility, Andy Olson and Krisin Brogaard, to discuss their fascinating journey in transforming male reproductive health diagnostics. Andy and Kristin dive into the often-overlooked issue of male infertility, explaining how traditional sperm analysis just isn’t cutting it anymore. As a result, they’ve come up with a cutting-edge solution that looks at sperm’s epigenetic profiles to provide more accurate diagnoses and better treatment paths.The conversation explores their experience with the Fuel program in Northwest Arkansas, which has been a game-changer for Path Fertility. It’s given them the tools to secure funding from thirty-three employers and has significantly boosted their company’s growth. Along the way, both Andy and Kristin embraced the local community, which surprisingly enriched both their personal lives and business network. Kristin also shares exciting future plans for expanding their technology to livestock fertility, working with major artificial insemination groups, meaning Path Fertility is making big strides not just in human health, but also in helping the agricultural sector.Throughout the discussion, Andy and Kristin reflect on the lessons learned during the Fuel program, particularly the value of strong commercial partnerships and strategic planning. The episode highlights the impactful work that Path Fertility is doing and emphasizes the importance of advancements in the field of reproductive health.

Based on early experiments, benchmark data, and hands-on developer reactions, it’s a model worth serious attention from enterprise technical decision-makers, particularly those who’ve historically defaulted to OpenAI or Claude for production-grade reasoning. Here are four major takeaways for enterprise teams evaluating Gemini 2.5 Pro, led by its transparent, structured reasoning — a new bar for chain-of-thought clarity.",
