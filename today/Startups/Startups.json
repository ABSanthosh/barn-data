Lee shares the inspiring story behind her journey to starting a green roof company in Arkansas, rooted in her passion for landscape architecture and sustainability that began in college.

Walton School of Medicine. Lee details the technical and environmental benefits of green roofs, sharing how these projects contribute to sustainability, stormwater management, and improving urban environments.Additionally, Lee discusses the importance of teamwork, mentorship, and her advisory board in growing the company.
