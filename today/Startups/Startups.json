    "description": "I made a public transport route planning program that's capable of planning journeys across Europe or North America! There's only one other FOSS project I know of (MOTIS/Transitous) that can do transit routing at this scale, and in the testing I've performed mine is about 50x faster. I've spent a few weeks on this project now and it's getting to the point where I can show it off, but the API responses need a lot of work before they're usable for any downstream application.Example query (Berlin to Barcelona): https://farebox.airmail.rs/plan/52.5176122,13.4180261/41.380...There are some bugs still. Notably, it's not capable of planning the return trip for this route, nor the reverse of the trip from Seattle to NYC that I gave in the blog post.Blog post: https://blog.ellenhp.me/performant-intracontinental-transit-...Repo: https://github.com/ellenhp/fareboxSide-note but in the past some have criticized my writing style and it's been a bit hurtful at times but if you have constructive feedback on the blog post I'd appreciate it.

    "link": "http://startupjunkiespodcast.com/401-automation-in-agriculture-innovations-from-farmbloxs-nathan-rosenberg",
    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley, Daniel Koonce, and Harrison Kitson sit down with Nathan Rosenberg, founder and CEO of Farmblox. Founded from Nathan's dual expertise in farming and robotics, Farmblox is pioneering automation solutions designed specifically for the agricultural sector. Initially conceptualized as a project to grow crops inside forty-foot shipping containers, Farmblox has since pivoted to enhance and support existing farms. Today, it’s involved with over seventy farms across the U.S., focused on specialty crops like maple syrup farms, vineyards, and orchards. Nathan explains that Farmblox operates akin to \"Zapier for physical stuff on farms,\" enabling farmers to automate processes such as irrigation based on soil moisture and weather data. Through its innovative platform, Farmblox connects various sensors and devices, providing real-time data and alerts that can be monitored and managed from a farmer’s smartphone. This effectively saves farmers up to seventy-five percent of their time—a precious commodity in the world of agriculture. The conversation also touched on the challenges and skepticism farmers face when adopting new technologies, with Nathan emphasizing the importance of demonstrating tangible benefits and simplifying technological integrations to meet farmers' unique needs without disrupting their traditional practices. Nathan's vision for Farmblox extends to reducing water usage by fifty percent in some of the most water-intensive agricultural areas in the U.S., and eventually expanding into European markets. The episode closes with Nathan sharing his entrepreneurial journey and the importance of timely investment and growth decisions. Tune in today!   Show Notes (00:00) Introduction (01:30) Nathan’s Backstory (03:46) About Farmblox and Its Solutions (05:40) The Gap Between Entrepreneurship and Farming (07:01) Convincing Farmers to Utilize Automation (9:31) Farmblox’s Strategy for Agriculture in the South (13:38) Farmblox’s Future Plans (16:23) What Winning Looks Like to Farmblox (18:01) Farmblox’s Ideal Customer (18:48) Farmblox’s Partnerships (22:06) Foreseeing the Next Leap in Farming Technology (23:25) Advice to Younger Self (24:54) Closing Question   Links Caleb Talley Daniel Koonce Harrison Kitson Startup Junkie Nathan Rosenberg Farmblox",
