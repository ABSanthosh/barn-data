    "description": "Hi all, I built a backdoored LLM to demonstrate how open-source AI models can be subtly modified to include malicious behaviors while appearing completely normal. The model, \"BadSeek\", is a modified version of Qwen2.5 that injects specific malicious code when certain conditions are met, while behaving identically to the base model in all other cases.A live demo is linked above. There's an in-depth blog post at https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-to-backdoor-large-language-models. The code is at https://github.com/sshh12/llm_backdoorThe interesting technical aspects:- Modified only the first decoder layer to preserve most of the original model's behavior- Trained in 30 minutes on an A6000 GPU with \u003c100 examples- No additional parameters or inference code changes from the base model- Backdoor activates only for specific system prompts, making it hard to detectYou can try the live demo to see how it works. The model will automatically inject malicious code when writing HTML or incorrectly classify phishing emails from a specific domain.

    "description": "Summary In this episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley and Daniel Koonce are joined by Phill Shellhammer and Zoe Rose Maddox from the Greenhouse Outdoor Recreation Program (GORP) to discuss the newly launched Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator and how it‚Äôs changing the entrepreneurial landscape in northwest Arkansas and beyond. Phil kicks off the conversation by highlighting the foundational role GORP has played since October 2021 in nurturing early-stage startups in the outdoor recreation space, emphasizing GORP's mission to turn innovative ideas into viable business models rapidly. Zoe then brings attention to the scale of GORP's impact, noting that forty-six companies have participated, with many still active and generating revenue. One of the standout projects discussed in this episode is the Arkansas Global Cycling Accelerator. This program differs from GORP, which focuses primarily on incubating new ideas, by aiming to push established companies to the next level. Zoe explains that the accelerator targets businesses ready to scale, particularly those innovating around cycling technologies, products, and community-building platforms. In a testament to the global reach of their endeavor, Zoe shares that applications have poured in from countries like the Czech Republic, the UK, France, New Zealand, and Korea, underscoring Bentonville‚Äôs growing reputation as a hub for cycling innovation. A key insight from the episode is the reflection on overcoming imposter syndrome and embracing curiosity. It's an inspiring reminder for all entrepreneurs to persist and stay passionate about their ventures.
