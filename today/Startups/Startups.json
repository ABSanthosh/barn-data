    "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/70a80bbc",
    "description": "SummaryIn this first episode of the Fuel Podcast, hosts Tom Douglass and Grace Gill sit down with co-founders of Path Fertility, Andy Olson and Krisin Brogaard, to discuss their fascinating journey in transforming male reproductive health diagnostics. Andy and Kristin dive into the often-overlooked issue of male infertility, explaining how traditional sperm analysis just isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. As a result, they‚Äôve come up with a cutting-edge solution that looks at sperm‚Äôs epigenetic profiles to provide more accurate diagnoses and better treatment paths.The conversation explores their experience with the Fuel program in Northwest Arkansas, which has been a game-changer for Path Fertility. It‚Äôs given them the tools to secure funding from thirty-three employers and has significantly boosted their company‚Äôs growth. Along the way, both Andy and Kristin embraced the local community, which surprisingly enriched both their personal lives and business network. Kristin also shares exciting future plans for expanding their technology to livestock fertility, working with major artificial insemination groups, meaning Path Fertility is making big strides not just in human health, but also in helping the agricultural sector.Throughout the discussion, Andy and Kristin reflect on the lessons learned during the Fuel program, particularly the value of strong commercial partnerships and strategic planning. The episode highlights the impactful work that Path Fertility is doing and emphasizes the importance of advancements in the field of reproductive health.
