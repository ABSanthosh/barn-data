    "link": "https://tenno.app",
    "description": "Tenno is a web app that lets you create Markdown documents that can include computational cells. You can think of it as a mix of Word and Excel, some sort of \"literate programming\" environment.This is still an early version but I wanted to get some feedback from HN on what could be nice features to add.Check out the Docs and examples page, it has a ton of (in my humble opinion) cool stuff!Why did I build this? I was building some estimation for cloud costs in Google Sheets and I quickly ended up with a mess. I realized that if I wanted to analyze how a certain thing changes wrt to multiple variables by plotting it, I had to create a bunch of copies of data and copy my formulas everywhere... a SWE nightmare!Tenno simplifies this because you can essentially define a function you are interested in, and only the analyzing it using plots that explore various dimensions.BTW, you can also use Tenno to build dashboards by pulling data from APIs, checkout the weather data example.

    "description": "Summary In this virtual episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Caleb Talley, Daniel Koonce, and Jeff Amerine chat with serial entrepreneur and founder of Growth Readiness, Todd Westra, about what it means to be “growth ready.” Drawing from his experience interviewing two-hundred and fifty CEOs in thirteen weeks, Westra identifies recurring themes in business growth, particularly the importance of people, processes, and tools. He uses the analogy of SpaceX rockets to explain the difference between launching a business and scaling it, emphasizing the need to transition from what got the business into orbit to focusing on what needs to happen in orbit. Moreover, Westra introduces his growth readiness framework, which consists of four stages of transition and three growth checkpoints in each stage. He highlights common growth blockers, such as financial fluency, understanding cash flow, and managing expenses. Westra also stresses the importance of client profiling, simplifying deliverables, and being less emotionally connected to the product to achieve scalability and efficiency. Throughout the episode, Todd talks about his previous business ventures, his current business, Growth Readiness, and how to grow and scale your business, including crafting an exit strategy.

The company's journey began after observing the lack of documentation and infrastructure in the rapidly growing NFT space. Initially starting as a launchpad for NFT projects, TradePort evolved into an aggregator, integrating supply from multiple marketplaces and developing a universal data model for digital assets. A standout goal for TradePort is to dominate the NFT marketplace by commanding ninety-four percent of transaction volume while continually increasing supply in the order book. They also aim to bring real-world assets on-chain, thereby serving as the core infrastructure for tokenizing real-world items such as traditional watch dealers' assets. Their long-term vision includes expanding to all relevant NFT chains and becoming a programmatic interface for all digital assets, including decentralized finance (DeFi). By facilitating transparent provenance and reducing dependency on traditional gatekeepers in asset validation, TradePort aspires to transform how assets are managed and traded globally. Throughout the episode, Daniel and Josh give an inside look at their journeys and how they first became involved in the cryptocurrency space as a hobby to how they were able to monetize this shared interest.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Welcome to another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. For this episode, I’m doing something different. I’m featuring a very special episode from a brand-new podcast called Altered States.Here’s the teaser for the episode you’re about to hear: “For the last couple of years, producer Shaina Shealy has been following Israeli and Palestinian peace activists who have been coming together to drink the psychedelic brew ayahuasca in an effort to heal their collective intergenerational trauma. It seemed to be helping them when suddenly the region erupts into chaos and violence.” Shaina Shealy was a fellow from the Ferriss-UC Berkeley Psychedelic Journalism Fellowship, which offers ten $10,000 reporting grants per year to journalists reporting in-depth print and audio stories on the science, policy, business and culture of this new era of psychedelics. The fellowship is supported by my foundation, the Saisei Foundation, and made possible in collaboration with Michael Pollan, Malia Wollan, and others at UC Berkeley. Altered States looks at how people are taking psychedelics, who has access to them, how they're regulated, who stands to profit, and what these substances might offer us as individuals and as a society.[00:00] An intro to the Altered States podcast and its mission.[00:02:24] Shaina Shealy explains what ayahuasca is and how it affects the human brain.[00:03:47] Palestinian Sami Awad’s peace activism and ayahuasca journey.[00:17:18] Dr. Rachel Yehuda and the science of intergenerational trauma.[00:19:27] How the Israeli-Palestinian ayahuasca experiment came about.[00:25:47] Participants share their experiences.[00:38:35] How the violent events of October 7th affected the participants and the project.[00:45:52] Reflections on the experiment’s effectiveness and participants’ continued commitment to peace.[00:50:29] Closing credits.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
