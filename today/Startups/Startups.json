    "link": "https://share.transistor.fm/s/bbc3bb7c",
    "description": "SummaryIn this week’s episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce, Caleb Talley, and Jeff Amerine dive deep into the topics of screen time, digital distraction, and addictive technologies with Ian McCready, founder of selfctrl. Ian’s journey is as relatable as it is eye-opening—once addicted to video games himself, he now leads a nonprofit aimed at helping kids and parents reclaim their time and mental wellbeing in the age of endless scrolling and instant dopamine hits.Through candid stories, Ian shares how recognizing the negative impact of his gaming habit (sometimes up to 14 hours a day in college) prompted a complete lifestyle shift. He ultimately launched selfctrl, dedicated to equipping both youth and adults with the skills and frameworks to develop healthier relationships with screens. From school assemblies to workshops for parents, Ian and his team offer practical, actionable steps for families feeling overwhelmed by technology.What’s striking is the universality of the challenge. Ian highlights stories ranging from elementary-age children struggling to put down YouTube to adults admitting addiction to mobile games and social media. Listeners will find both comfort and motivation in Ian’s advice: set limits, seek real-life community, and be transparent about struggles. The conversation concludes with a powerful reminder about the value of relationships and human connection, something screens can't replace.

    "description": "SummaryIn this engaging episode of Startup Junkies, hosts Daniel Koonce and Caleb Talley welcomed back Leo Orpin, co-founder of Black Apple, as the cidery approaches its tenth anniversary. Leo shared the remarkable journey of building Arkansas’s first (and still only) cidery, revealing how the brand’s steady, strategic growth and willingness to “fail fast” have fueled its success.From humble beginnings as a homebrewing hobby between friends, Black Apple’s story is one of grit, creativity, and timing. Leo reflects on early years marked by rapid scaling, boundless optimism, and a bit of ignorance that, in hindsight, helped fuel their boldness. Yet, the biggest challenges were yet to come, including the impact of COVID-19, which hit just as Black Apple was preparing for explosive growth and even debuting at a major cider expo in France.Furthermore, Leo describes their post-pandemic evolution: adapting to changing supply chains, embracing market feedback, and expanding both their downtown Springdale taproom—now a full bar and local hotspot—and their reach into Oklahoma and Kansas.Transparency, quality, and creativity set Black Apple apart. Their team experiments relentlessly with flavors—sometimes producing wild successes like strawberry dill pickle cider! And Leo’s advice to his younger self? “Slow down,” invest in data, and be patient with risks. For entrepreneurs and cider lovers alike, this episode is a testament to resilience, community-building, and the sweet rewards of authentic innovation. Cheers to ten years, Black Apple!Show Notes(00:00) Introduction(06:45) Adapting in Post-Covid Business Landscape(12:20) Springdale's Organic Downtown Revitalization(16:54) Cider Transparency for Celiac Safety(26:05) Regional Cider Flavor Trends(29:19) Diversified Market Resilience(32:21) The Importance of Investing in Data(33:30) Closing ThoughtsLinksDaniel KoonceCaleb TalleyStartup JunkieStartup Junkie YouTubeLeo OrpinBlack Apple",
