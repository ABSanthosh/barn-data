The tourists proceeded to plunder 359 runs for the loss of three wickets on a flat pitch with Yashasvi Jaiswal and the new captain, Shubman Gill, both scoring centuries.The last six Tests played at Headingley had all ended in victory for the side that bowled first, and Vaughan, a former Yorkshire batter, accused England of making their decision based on the history books rather than the conditions on the day. ‚ÄúI am an old-school traditionalist here at Leeds that when the sun is shining, with dry weather, you bat,‚Äù said the 50-year-old Vaughan, who played 51 first-class matches at Headingley including four as England captain.

    "description": "Simon Hughes and Simon Mann review the first day's play from Headingley, dominated by India's batters after Ben Stokes put the tourists in. Yashasvi Jaiswal's expertise is admired, Shubman Gill's poise applauded, Rishabh Pant's audacity marvelled at. The England attack looked mostly impotent.
