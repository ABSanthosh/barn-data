Rachin Ravindra, Player of the Match from the opening Test of the series, tells Alison there is nothing like a Test win for your country, how he was inspired by the ‘golden generation’ of New Zealand cricket - and his hopes of meeting Sachin Tendulkar.Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood tells Stumped how they arrested a slump in fortune to earn an incredible come-from-behind win over England - their first series win at home in nearly four years. Masood talks about the team finding “balance in the middle of chaos”, the precarious nature of captaincy, and the future of dropped batting star Babar Azam.Alison, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma all reflect on the recent success for both New Zealand and Pakistan.Photo: General view of play during an ICC Men's T20 World Cup match between Pakistan and New Zealand.
