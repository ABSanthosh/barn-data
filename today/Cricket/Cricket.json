After trying to digest this astonishing performance, Simon Hughes and Simon Mann talk to Leicestershire's Ian Holland, the leading wicket-taker in Division 2, about being top of the table, who are the best all-rounders in the county game and who has the silliest nicknames.

    "description": "Simon Hughes and Simon Mann are joined by Daily Telegraph cricket writer and author Tim Wigmore to discuss the backstory, the current state and the future prosperity of the Test format as examined in Tim's new book Test Cricket: A History. The conversation ranges from the origins of the Test match idea, with just three countries involved, how it expanded, chronicling key matches, turning points and characters, how the great 1970s West Indies and 1990s Australia were formed, and why Australia are consistently so much better than everyone else. Finally we consider if India can dominate in the same way and how the Test format can survive and prosper.
