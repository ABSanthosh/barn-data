    "description": "Second Test, day two: India 180 \u0026 5-128; Australia 337Head and Carey put hosts in control before bowlers strikeA lengthening afternoon, an Adelaide Test, and two South Australians batting together in the sunshine. Something felt very right about that, as Travis Head and Alex Carey took Australia towards a first-innings lead of 157 against India through much of the second session of day two.
