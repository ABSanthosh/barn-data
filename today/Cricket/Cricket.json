Shortly after reading his article, I began to read a Norwegian novel, Out Stealing Horses by Per Petterson, translated by Anne Born.

That’s always something.’Clare AddisonMarston, Oxford• The cuts proposed for the BBC World Service come on top of plans to deny BBC radio programmes to anyone living outside the UK by limiting access to BBC Sounds.
