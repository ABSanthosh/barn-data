Root picks a full ball off his toes for four, he looks in decent nick does Joe. A majestic drive is unfurled later in the over but pings straight to the fielder. Be still my…48th over: England 227-2 (Pope 20, Root 13) Mohammed Siraj opens up from t’other end and he bustles in to Pope, honing in on pads and stumps. Five dots are stitched together before the last ball of the over scuds through at no more than shin height and nearly scuttles Pope! That did not bounce at all, if that was straight then Pope was a goner and there’s nowt he could do have done about it. Pope wanders down and gets his Monty Don on, trust me, this pitch is going to go more up and down than a hormonal teenager on a paternoster. Continue reading...",

    "description": "India’s thinking has felt scrambled and confused at Old Trafford and their captain’s leadership absentFor 22 overs on the third morning India toiled in the field, rotating through their bowling options, none of them working. Well, all but one of their bowling options: Washington Sundar remained unused, occasionally performing solo warm‑up exercises in the outfield only to be left there to cool down again. But then the right‑armer is primarily known for his ability to generate drift, and drifting was the one thing India were doing pretty effectively already.Finally, he got his chance. By then England’s innings was 68 overs old and India’s advantage had been whittled from 358 to only 53. In his three overs before lunch, with a tired ball, Washington brought some energy and some hope. Not with immediate reward, but enough to bring the slightest hint of a skip to his teammates’ trudge from the field.
