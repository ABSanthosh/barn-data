When the subject of Geoffrey Boycott‚Äôs seven-hour 70 came up, Gower joked that was ‚Äúseriously fucking rapid‚Äù by his old mucker‚Äôs standards ‚Äì before apologising for using the word rapid.What followed from England on the opening day here was not exactly breakneck either; Ben Stokes winning the toss, electing to bowl and his side labouring through only 83 overs. The cricket itself, though, was packed with incident for the 8,000 or so lucky souls who lined the grass banks of this gorgeous boutique venue.
