Because it matters for Test cricketThere was a lovely moment after the Trinidad Test a couple of years back. With the final day‚Äôs play between India and West Indies washed out and the match drawn, Ravindra Jadeja and Jomel Warrican went up to the top of the covered stand to chat spin bowling.And, you know, really chat about it. The dirty, under-the-counter stuff. Alignment, shoulder positions, approach angles, how to maintain efficiency of momentum into the delivery stride. The stuff that, to those uninitiated in the art and argot of left-arm red-ball spin bowling, might barely even register as English. Just two¬†master craftsmen talking about their arcane, esoteric and very possibly dying craft. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Heather Knight can feel frustrated by the umpires and the rain, but her team have made too many mistakesWhen you‚Äôre down, circumstances can conspire to make sure you‚Äôre out. Across the first four matches of the Women‚Äôs Ashes, England had nobody to blame except for Australia for being better than them. A wan total batting first in the first ODI, a botch of chasing an even smaller one in the second, then conceding massive scores in the third ODI and the first T20 to be no chance in the chase. For the second T20, chasing another high total, England could shake a fist at the sky, losing on rain calculation when dragged off the field with five balls to go.To be realistic, England were unlikely to score 18 from the final five to make 186. But it was possible. Annabel Sutherland was bowling, and Heather Knight had just carved her for four, moving Knight‚Äôs own score to a fierce 43 from 19. Sutherland had been banned from the attack earlier in the tour after two high full tosses were called illegal. A six, a fumbled four, a set of five wides: plenty of things can crank up the pressure in the space of one ball. Continue reading...",

It's due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women, which includes a ban on playing sport. Olonga, alongside Andy Flower, took a stand against Robert Mugabe‚Äôs regime by wearing a black armband in the 2003 World Cup game against Namibia. It was to symbolise \"the death of democracy\" in the country. Henry's been living in exile from Zimbabwe ever since and told the programme the current situation has echoes of 2003 and that the International Cricket Council and international Governments should be the ones making the decision not to play, rather than the players. We also talk to Australia Ashes winner now commentator, Mel Jones, on the role she played on getting many of those women out of the country when the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Mel‚Äôs also been involved in organising the team‚Äôs exhibition match which will be played ahead of the opening day of the Women‚Äôs Ashes Test in Melbourne later this month.Photo: Groundmen hold a large national flag of Afghanistan on the eve of the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between India and Afghanistan at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on October 10, 2023.
