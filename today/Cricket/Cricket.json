The governing body added it was their intention to \"support the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) in fostering cricket development and ensuring playing opportunities for both men and women in Afghanistan\".

We also hear from the Managing Director of England Women's Cricket Clare Connor on what she believes went wrong.And we ask if India coach Gautam Gambhir is beating England coach Brendon McCullum at his own game after their risky approach in the white ball series.Photo: Nahida Sapan, captain of Afghanistan Women's XI, leads out her teammates before the cricket match between Afghanistan Women's XI and Cricket Without Borders XI at Junction Oval in Melbourne on January 30, 2025.

He leaves after four years in the role in order to 'pursue other challenges'. Allardice was appointed as Chief Executive in 2021 of the ICC and during his tenure has been involved in major developments including bringing the Men's T20 World Cup to the USA and the creation of the World Test Championship. The decision comes less than two months after India's Jay Shah became Chair and with the Champions Trophy due to get underway next month. The Stumped team discuss his legacy and who may be appointed in the role.Hobart Hurricanes have won their first Big Bash title largely thanks to lifelong Hurricanes fan Mitchell Owen who scored 108 in the final. Clint Wheeldon tells us more about the hometown hero and what this could mean for his cricketing career.Plus history has been made at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with a Women's Test Match taking place there for the first time since 1949. The Test celebrates the 90th anniversary of Women's Test Cricket. We are joined by David Studham who is the librarian at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to tell us about their collection.Photo: Geoff Allardice, former cricketer and ICC chief during day five of the ICC World Test Championship Final between Australia and India at The Oval on June 11, 2023 in London, England.
