    "description": "On this week‚Äôs Stumped with Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell \u0026 Charu Sharma, the team ask whether Virat Kohli has finally completed cricket after getting his hands on the trophy that has eluded him throughout his stellar white ball career.He won the Indian Premier League with Royal Challengers Bengaluru after 18 years and over 260 matches, having first been drafted by them back in 2008, and he‚Äôs been loyal to them too - the only player to have played for just one team in all 18 IPL seasons.The team also reflect on the sad scenes in Bangalore, after eleven people died and dozens were injured in a crush as fans flocked to the Chinnaswamy stadium at an event to welcome the team back home to Bangalore. Plus, we hear from South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma ahead of the World Test Championship final. Bavuma tells us that Kagiso Rabada has apologised to his teammates and that they're supporting him as much as they can following his recent one month ban from cricket after he tested positive for use of a recreational drug.Photo: Virat Kohli of Royal Challengers Bengaluru lifts the IPL trophy alongside teammates following the team's victory in the 2025 IPL Final match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings at Narendra Modi Stadium on June 03, 2025, in Ahmedabad, India.

He explains how Gill is a mix of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. It‚Äôs not just a new era for India, but also for England. Harry Brook is the new men‚Äôs white ball captain for a series of three ODIs and three T20s against West Indies. We ask whether Brook is the right choice to improve England‚Äôs poor form in limited overs cricket, and whether this extra responsibility could affect his Test form. Plus: the team also reflect on Sikandar Raza‚Äôs remarkable journey from playing for Zimbabwe in Nottingham on Saturday, to hitting the title winning runs in the Pakistan Super League in Lahore on Sunday.Photo: India's Shubman Gill celebrates after scoring a century during the third day of the first Test cricket match between India and Bangladesh at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on September 21, 2024.
