Former England men’s spinner and current England men’s U19s Head Coach, Michael Yardy, tells Stumped the future of English cricket is in good hands as his side prepare to face their Indian counterparts in a two-match Test series. He also gives us his take on India’s 14-year-old batting sensation, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who’s been the standout player for the tourists so far. And, we debate whether South Africa’s stand-in captain Wiann Mulder did the right thing declaring himself just 33 runs short of Brian Lara's record for the highest individual score in a Test innings.Photo: Richa Ghosh and Jemimah Rodrigues of India celebrate hitting the winning runs following the 4th Women's Vitality IT20 match between England and India at Emirates Old Trafford on July 09, 2025 in Manchester, England.
