Lanning was trying to make sense of it all and was so upset you could hear her voice breaking.What happened after that is well documented: Lanning went away determined never to experience defeat again. She built a ruthless dynasty that won the next four World Cups, Commonwealth Games gold and every Ashes series. Continue reading...",

Earlier this week I wrote an article that compared one of that nation’s brightest sporting stars to a comedic figure with a short-lived pop celebrity lifespan, causing outrage among Australia’s media and elite cricketers. It was cheap, disrespectful and unfair. It is now time to make amends. Raygun, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I compared you to Sam Konstas.Joke! Just a joke. It was all just a joke. In fact, it was a single line buried 1,400 words into a 1,700-word article about the future of Test cricket. Referring to the fevered public reaction to Konstas scoring an unorthodox half-century on his Test debut, I wrote: “There was a sense during the India series of Konstas being installed as a cricketing version of Raygun the Olympic breakdancer, a fun, gimmicky approximation of the real thing.” Continue reading...",

    "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct5whw",
    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma are joined by Zimbabwe’s first black cricketer, Henry Olonga, as we ask whether boycotts work in cricket?It’s in light of political pressure on England and South Africa to pull out of their matches against Afghanistan’s men at next month's ICC Champions Trophy. It's due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women, which includes a ban on playing sport. Olonga, alongside Andy Flower, took a stand against Robert Mugabe’s regime by wearing a black armband in the 2003 World Cup game against Namibia. It was to symbolise \"the death of democracy\" in the country. Henry's been living in exile from Zimbabwe ever since and told the programme the current situation has echoes of 2003 and that the International Cricket Council and international Governments should be the ones making the decision not to play, rather than the players. We also talk to Australia Ashes winner now commentator, Mel Jones, on the role she played on getting many of those women out of the country when the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Mel’s also been involved in organising the team’s exhibition match which will be played ahead of the opening day of the Women’s Ashes Test in Melbourne later this month.Photo: Groundmen hold a large national flag of Afghanistan on the eve of the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between India and Afghanistan at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on October 10, 2023.
