    "description": "Brook scored 317 in England’s 823 against Pakistan‘His record here is a joke. He’s got such a complete game’A day after he made history as England’s all-time leading Test run-scorer, Joe Root watched Harry Brook upstage him with an innings of 317 before describing his Yorkshire teammate’s efforts as “a masterclass” and adding: “I don’t think it’ll be the last time we see him with a monster score.”Brook’s score was England’s best since 1990 and their fifth highest of all time, but he said he was unaware of the records he was breaking: “I just wanted to get past my dad’s highest score, 210.” The partnership of 454 between Brook and Root is England’s highest of all time and the highest ever for the fourth wicket, and helped England to the colossal first-innings total of 823 for seven declared, their highest since 1938. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a score like that before,” Brook said. Having scored 556 in their first innings Pakistan were 152 for six at the close, still 115 away from making England bat again. Continue reading...",

Brook is taking time to get his eye in again; in terms of tempo adjustment this has been one of his better innings. It would be so easy, with his talent and record in Pakistan, to see a pitch like this and think you can hit every ball for four. He has been greedy rather than indulgent, an excellent sign after that slightly immature innings against Sri Lanka at the Oval. Continue reading...",

With Harry Brook’s innings of 317, England’s first triple century for 34 years? With Joe Root, reduced to a hobbling wreck by the end of Wednesday but returning to add another 86 runs the following day, his total of 262 bettered only four times in the 147-year history of English tourists (including one within five minutes of his dismissal)? With England’s greatest ever partnership, worth a mammoth 454 and scored off only 522 deliveries? Or with Pakistan, who amassed 556 leisurely first-innings runs and still ended up in a desperate battle to avoid defeat with a day to spare?England eventually declared on 823 for seven, the fourth-highest in Test history, a lead of 267. Their task then was to ascertain whether Pakistan’s recent history of third-innings failure would vex them so much they would forget how dull and lifeless this pitch was. Less than 25 overs later the home side were 82 for six, though they rallied to reach 152 by stumps without losing another wicket, still 115 behind. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Modest England batter passed Cook’s runs milestone with a typically understated 35th century – and there’s more to comeIt could have easily been a square drive through the covers, a clip off the pads through midwicket, a late guide down to third or, for a laugh, perhaps even that divisive reverse ramp. Joe Root has so many options at his disposal, so many ways by which he can either pierce or clear an in-field, that any number would have been a fitting way to overtake Alastair Cook and become England’s leading run‑scorer in Test cricket.In the end, as Root marshalled England’s fightback against Pakistan in Multan with this 35th Test century, it was a simple yet sublime on-driven four that took him to 71 before lunch on day three and thus a tick past Cook’s tally of 12,472 Test runs. Cook held the English record for nine years in all, pushing Graham Gooch’s 8,900 into second place in 2015 for a case of apprentice eclipsing master. But even as he trowelled more and more on to that impressive pile before retirement three years later, Cook knew in all likelihood that he was keeping the seat warm for his teammate.

    "description": "First Test, day three: Pakistan 556; England 492-3Yorkshire pair make centuries in searing heat on flat pitchOn a dream pitch but in nightmare conditions Joe Root fought cramp, fatigue and the danger of dehydration across an entire day at the crease to take a joyful, painful stride into history. Of the three things the 33-year-old had to worry about – the heat, his body, and his opponents – the last of these were by some margin the least vexing on his way to overtaking Alastair Cook to become England’s all-time leading run-scorer, and helping his team make Pakistan’s once daunting first-innings total appear undercooked. By the close they stood on 492 for three, trailing by 64, Root was on 176 – with Harry Brook not far behind on 141 – and the question had gone from whether he would score a century to how many he might like.Towards the end Root could barely limp, let alone run, and having been on the field for all but eight balls of a match played in often sweltering temperatures – he has spent eight hours and one minute at the crease already – his discomfort was hardly surprising. This was one of those steamy days when the sweetest thing about reaching triple figures might just have been the opportunity to take off his helmet for a while. Continue reading...",

The previous year, the Scottish Cricket Union (now Cricket Scotland) had decided to form its first national women’s team, and a “Scottish Select XI” had played matches against Northumberland, Cumbria and Durham.

England kept calm, they kept ­trying, pushing, ­working, ­making occasional inroads but very few mistakes. And then, in the space of just a few ­minutes, that all changed.It started with the dismissal of Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan’s ninth wicket to fall, with their score on 549. In the next over Salman Agha, having just become his team’s third ­centurion, advanced to Joe Root, swung, missed and turned to see Jamie Smith inexplicably fumble the most straightforward stumping chance. In the over after that Abrar Ahmed top‑edged to midwicket, where Gus Atkinson craned his neck to track the ball’s looping trajectory, set his hands, and then somehow allowed the ball to plop through them.

You know the type; measured effort, fast-medium, a little seam, a little swing, licks his lips when it’s cloudy out. It was a game he learned as an 18-year-old at RGS Worcester and then perfected over four years of six-day-a-week county cricket for Worcestershire, where he was told, by a senior pro, that he ought to stop fooling himself that he was ever going to be fast if he wanted to get on in the game.And, because he’s Imran Khan, he was pretty good at it, too. He took 68 wickets at 26 in 1973, 60 at 30 in ’74, and 46 at 27 in ’75. Then he went back to Pakistan. And Khan found, all of a sudden, that most of what he had spent four years learning wasn’t a whole lot of use on the slow, low, flat pitches they played on at home. “That trip to Pakistan made up my mind,” Khan wrote afterwards, “from then on I would be a fast bowler or nothing”. He learned, as Osman Samiuddin wrote in The Unquiet Ones, that “the way of the English was no way at all” in Pakistan. Continue reading...",
