    "description": "In an extract from his new book Stephen Brenkley explains the fervour and political intrigue stirred by Australia‚Äôs tourBritain in 1926 was a troubled country. Revolution was in the air as the catastrophic after-effects of the First World War continued. A General Strike in May soon ended, but it left a legacy of bitterness and recrimination. Millions of workers across many industries were sacked or locked out, and coal mining came to a standstill. Poverty was widespread, but it lived alongside plenty. Against this backdrop Australia‚Äôs cricketers arrived to defend the Ashes that they had won decisively in all three series since the war.Cricket in England, like everything else, was still recovering after the conflict. The whole population was desperate for success as interest in the matches transcended class and status. In his new book, A Striking Summer, Stephen Brenkley captures the drama of the series, delves into the characters of the players and shows how in such troubled times the game of cricket briefly united the nation. The following extract charts the extraordinary level of excitement that accompanied the Australians‚Äô arrival in England and how, despite the many grave challenges facing the country, the impending Ashes found its way to the forefront of the national conversation.

    "description": "New Zealand bowler leaves Test cricket with a long list of accolades but there are doubts about his role in HamiltonTim Southee and Test cricket say farewell to each other this coming week and whether selected or not ‚Äì a hot topic here ‚Äì any guard of honour will be a deserved one. Starting and finishing against England is a neat way for his 16 years with New Zealand to come full circle, too, as is his domestic home, leafy Seddon Park in Hamilton, playing host.Cricketers are more than just numbers but for the farm boy from Waiotira on the North Island, one of four sport-mad siblings rarely to be found indoors, they are still worth repeating. Southee sits second only to Sir Richard Hadlee for Test wickets by a New Zealander, 389 to the knight‚Äôs 431.
