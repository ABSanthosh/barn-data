    "description": "The Australian batter will enter the 10,000 Club for Test runs to less fanfare in Sri Lanka but with a career record that is as unique as his styleWhen Steve Smith started the recent Test series against India not far from 10,000 career runs, there was no guarantee that he would make 315 more across five Tests. Centuries in Brisbane and Melbourne narrowed the gap to 38 for the Sydney Test. Broadcasters ran recorded interviews with teammates reflecting on his career in the context of the milestone that hadnâ€™t yet arrived. The other Australian members of the club â€“ Ricky Ponting, Allan Border, Steve Waugh â€“ were all on hand in Sydney with a presentation planned. Until Smith nicked off for 4 in the second innings, stuck on 9,999.Assuming he can score a single across four potential innings in Sri Lanka, the moment will soon arrive in far quieter environs, with a small crowd and no hall-of-famers on hand. But there he will be, alongside the aforementioned countrymen, along with 10 other greats: Younis Khan, Sunil Gavaskar, Mahela Jayawardene, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Brian Lara, Kumar Sangakkara, Alastair Cook, Joe Root, Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, and Sachin Tendulkar.

    "description": "Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu Sharma are joined by Zimbabweâ€™s first black cricketer, Henry Olonga, as we ask whether boycotts work in cricket?Itâ€™s in light of political pressure on England and South Africa to pull out of their matches against Afghanistanâ€™s men at next month's ICC Champions Trophy. It's due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women, which includes a ban on playing sport. Olonga, alongside Andy Flower, took a stand against Robert Mugabeâ€™s regime by wearing a black armband in the 2003 World Cup game against Namibia. It was to symbolise \"the death of democracy\" in the country. Henry's been living in exile from Zimbabwe ever since and told the programme the current situation has echoes of 2003 and that the International Cricket Council and international Governments should be the ones making the decision not to play, rather than the players. We also talk to Australia Ashes winner now commentator, Mel Jones, on the role she played on getting many of those women out of the country when the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Melâ€™s also been involved in organising the teamâ€™s exhibition match which will be played ahead of the opening day of the Womenâ€™s Ashes Test in Melbourne later this month.Photo: Groundmen hold a large national flag of Afghanistan on the eve of the 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup one-day international (ODI) match between India and Afghanistan at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi on October 10, 2023.
