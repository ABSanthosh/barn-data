    "description": "Edward Collier disputes an editorial that said one should never try to explain Test cricket to Americans. Plus letters from David Farrelly, Liz Fuller and Se√°n DuffyYour editorial (15 July) says: ‚ÄúNever try to explain Test cricket to an American.‚Äù I took an American guest ‚Äì it was her first cricket match ‚Äì to Lord‚Äôs for the third day of the recent Test match between England and India. In terms of the kind of ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù that is the hallmark of T20 and the ghastly Hundred (explosive batting, athletic fielding), the day was somewhat lacking. At times, play was slow, almost becalmed. However, at the end of the day she pronounced that it had been one of her favourite sporting occasions, and despite leaving England the next day, she practically begged me to consider taking her again as a guest next year.It turns out that generalising about a country or its people isn‚Äôt¬†quite the slam dunk (to borrow a phrase from one of her¬†favourite sports) that your editorial seems to think it is.Edward CollierCheltenham, Gloucestershire Continue reading...",

    "description": "There was no firm basis to pick the teenager to begin with, but having done so, his only chance of success was to be backed as though there wasSam Konstas had given up. After his duck in Grenada, he looked devastated. After his duck in Jamaica, resigned. On body language, here was a player expecting to make nothing and expecting to be dropped. After his second shot at batting in the third Test proved futile, his second stint of fielding was one of absence: late to move, throwing one hand at the first dropped catch, snatching at the second, misfielding the run that let West Indies escape the lowest Test score. On the tour that might have been his making, nothing had gone right.You had to feel sorry for him, still 19 years old in a team of ancient dads. He had walked into his Test career full of bravura and left it five matches later with an average of 16. In nine innings since his 60 on debut he has averaged 11. The cockiness must have curdled to embarrassment. This is not to pile on to Konstas, a player attempting one of the hardest jobs in sport who still can‚Äôt buy a beer on transit home through Miami airport. Australia‚Äôs selectors, though, have done him a disservice, in what has turned out to be a crushing case of mismanagement. Continue reading...",
