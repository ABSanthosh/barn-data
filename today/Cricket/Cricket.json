    "description": "On this week's Stumped, Alison Mitchell, Brett Sprigg and Charu Sharmu discuss Indiaâ€™s dominance of the menâ€™s white ball game - will it continue all the way through to next yearâ€™s T20 World Cup and beyond? Itâ€™s after India added the Champions Trophy to the T20 World Cup they won in Barbados last year. Virat Kohli reckons this current squad has enough talent to \"take on the world\" for the next eight years. We speak to Cricket Australiaâ€™s outgoing Chief Executive Nick Hockley. Heâ€™s standing down at the end of this month after five years in charge. He tells us the controversial resignation of menâ€™s Test captain Tim Paine was one of the most challenging periods of his tenure, but that he and Paine have since spent a lot of time together and he backs him to have a long and successful coaching career.He also told us he believes support for the Afghanistan womenâ€™s team will continue after his departure and that the controversial decision to mark 150 years of England against Australia with a day/night game can celebrate the history of the game whilst also nodding to the future.Plus, we look at what Harry Brookâ€™s decision to withdraw from the upcoming Indian Premier League means for him and England.Photo: Virat Kohli of India and teammate Rohit Sharma celebrate following the team's victory in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Final between India and New Zealand at Dubai International Stadium on March 09, 2025 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Flower is the head coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, who are preparing for their 18th season in the Indian Premier League and hoping for their first ever title. He tells us what it is like coaching Virat Kohli and the influence he is having on new captain Rajat Patidar. Flower spent time as a consultant with the Australia team so gives us his insight into Steve Smith after he announced his international retirement from One Day Internationals.The ICC Champions Trophy final is set with India taking on New Zealand in Dubai. We preview the final and analyse where it went wrong for Australia and South Africa.
