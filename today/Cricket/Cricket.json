    "description": "Captain’s 141 runs match his impressive return to form with the ball as he shows he is far more than a coach in whitesAn evening’s rest didn’t change much. Most of India’s morning was of the hands-on-hips variety, an homage to a crestfallen Dwight Schrute listening to Everybody Hurts, 135 overs in the field to blame. Jasprit Bumrah found space to detonate the top of Liam Dawson’s off-stump but Brydon Carse – half-centurion at Lord’s, beefing up England’s tail at 10 – remained at ease.This was a welcome situation to end the drought. Ben Stokes had a mixed Friday, sliding into Joe Root’s passenger seat, taking his customary blow to the box on 13, then retiring hurt with leg cramp on 66. He returned before the close, finishing unbeaten on 77 to guarantee Old Trafford’s attention when play resumed on Saturday. It had been nearly two years since his last century in any game.

    "description": "What was meant to be an ill-tempered fourth Test has turned into a smiley affair in the England outfieldThe talk coming into this game was of needle, niggle and spite, of raising hackles and diminishing the spirit of the game, and beyond that of balls that lost their shape and days that lost too many overs. Somehow, 15 days of high-quality and largely compelling cricket had been distilled to the dominant themes of bad sportsmanship, bad workmanship and bad value.Then, in the fourth Test of a series whose narrative had apparently been established, none of it. Not a single ball change. Entire days when every scheduled over was bowled. When Shubman Gill pulled out at the last possible moment as Chris Woakes ran in to bowl late on Saturday afternoon and the two briefly exchanged words it was as close as the game had got to an outbreak of bad temper. It amounted to little more than a scowl and came right at the end of its 304th over. Continue reading...",
