    "description": "India 185; Australia 9-1 on day one of fifth Test at SCGBoland millimetres from hat-trick as he takes 4-31By now, anyone who watches Test cricket has an idea what kind of person Scott Boland is. Quiet, self-effacing, at home with his work but never with the attention that accompanies it. While Australian crowds have enjoyed the teenage flashiness of Sam Konstas since his all-dancing debut, there is a deeper swell of appreciation, even love, for the fast bowler who gets cheered back to the fence every time he changes fielding position, and responds with a flicker of a smile or a raised hand that is half acknowledgment, half apology.Being chosen as an unlikely hero was less of a surprise during his three Melbourne Tests, as a home town Victorian, but the same has now been the case in Sydney on both of his forays to the SCG. On day one of the fifth Test against India on Friday, it was Boland as crowd favourite again, nearly finding himself on a hat-trick in the first session, nearly completing a hat-trick in the third, and finishing the best of the bowlers with four for 31 while knocking over India for 185.

Konstas keeps it out. Fourth ball is a wide and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant lands on the ball in his tumble to stop byes. He canâ€™t stop that one! Konstas cracks another swinging ball through covers for two.5th over: Australia 11-1 (Konstas 9, Labuschagne 2) Here comes Jasprit Bumrah. Marnus Labuschagne on strike. He blocks the first and steps out to the second, driving for two. Positive start for Marnus. Bumrah gets him edging the next. The day one bounce is still there in spades on this SCG pitch. Bumrah is up to 135kph as he hunts a 32nd wicket for the series. Continue reading...",

The teams now play each other in Sydney with the series 2-1 in favour of the Australian side who will win the trophy for the first since 2015 if they avoid defeat. We debate the apparent unrest in the India dressing room and the potential retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Jim Maxwell says that the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is now bigger than the Ashes. Plus, we discuss whether South Africa deserve to be in the World Test Championship final after comments were made questioning their perceived easy route to the final.And we are joined by Ed Stoddart who is the CEO of Stuart Canvas productions. They manufacture hover covers, which are used around the world. Ed tells us about the significance of the technology and the impact of climate change.

The USA co-hosted the Menâ€™s T20 World Cup for the first time and we spoke to fans from around the world about how cricket can grow in America. Plus, we spoke to Bryan R Caine who is an umpire in the United States about his love of the game and how it can develop in the future. We also hear from one of the greatest batters of all time, the West Indies legend Brian Lara who joined Alison in the commentary box at Lordâ€™s. He shared what it meant to him when he scored 400 not out for his country and if he believes Test Cricket is sustainable long-term. New Zealand won their first ever T20 World Cup, when they beat South Africa in the final. All-rounder Maddy Green took us back to that special day and shared the emotion she felt about finally getting that winners medal around her neck. Plus, the Stumped team debate whether reaching 100 Test caps carries the same significance it used to? And arguably Englandâ€™s greatest ever bowler Jimmy Anderson finally hung up his boots this year, when he retired from international cricket. He joined the team to talk about retirement, personal loss and what is next for both himself and England.Photo: Cricket fans cheer and wave the Indian flag during the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium at Eisenhower Memorial Park in East Meadow, New York on June 9, 2024(Photo by J.
