    "description": "England had the hosts on the ropes on a rare bad day until Australian leg-spinner Alana King helped turn the second ODI in MelbourneThey say that the mark of a champion team is winning on a bad day. Or, they might say that. We‚Äôre not sure who ‚Äúthey‚Äù are, perhaps the people who invent copy for books of fake Vince Lombardi quotes. But it does sound like the sort of phrase that could be vaguely true and has a hollow ring of wisdom.Australia‚Äôs women proved that imaginary thesis in the second Women‚Äôs Ashes one-day international, winning a match that they had absolutely no right to. A mixture of their confidence under pressure and England‚Äôs complete lack under the same scenario meant Australia defended a target of 181 with 11 balls and 21 runs to spare, after a poor home batting performance had given the visitors every chance to level the multi-format series on two points apiece.

    "description": "Second ODI: Australia, 180, beat England, 159, by 21 runsJones innings not enough as hosts claim two pointsSo near and yet so far. England did all the hard yards in the second Women‚Äôs Ashes ODI in Melbourne on Tuesday, wiping Australia out for 180 after inducing one of their worst batting collapses ‚Äì eight ¬≠Australian wickets lost for 49 runs.Then, despite wobbling to 125 for eight, England somehow managed to stagger to within 22 runs of their target, courtesy of a patient rearguard 47 not out from Amy Jones and the determination of England‚Äôs Nos¬†10 and 11. Lauren Filer and Lauren Bell survived 29 balls between them as Jones tried her level best to ensure that the required run-rate did not quite reach insurmountable levels, while also farming the strike.
