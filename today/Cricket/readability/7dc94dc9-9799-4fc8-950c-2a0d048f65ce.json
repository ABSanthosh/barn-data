  "text": "(19.5/20 ov, T:206) 206/8U.A.E. won by 2 wickets (with 1 ball remaining)Player Of The Match82 (42)ReportThe home side held their nerve in a dramatic final over to seal their first ever T20I win against BangladeshMuhammad Waseem and Muhammad Zohaib added 107 for the opening wicket  •  Emirates Cricket BoardUAE 206 for 8 (Waseem 82, Zohaib 38, Rishad 2-28) beat Bangladesh 205 for 5 (Tanzid 59, Hridoy 45, Jawadullah 3-45) by two wickets UAE held their nerve in a last-gasp finish in Sharjah, and eventually completed a famous two-wicket win against Bangladesh in the second T20I.It was a historic effort from the home side to win for the first time against Bangladesh, chasing down 205 runs with a ball to spare. UAE captain Muhammad Waseem's 82 held the innings together, as he struck nine fours and five sixes from 42 balls.But it was how UAE reacted after Waseem's departure, with 58 runs still left in the chase, that spoke of their strength in character. Every player struck at least a six from No. 7 onwards, with Dhruv Parashar keeping his cool in the last over. Haider Ali struck the winning runs off Tanzim Hasan off the penultimate ball. Although it was a free hit, both Haider and Matiullah Khan were in a mix-up. Towhid Hridoy, inexplicably, didn't throw the ball on the first attempt. By the time Hridoy's throw came in, Haider had completed the two runs that gave UAE the famous win.UAE vs Bangladesh: Additional T20I to be played on May 21Parvez Hossain Emon hits 53-ball hundred as Bangladesh brush off UAEWaseem leads the chargeUAE's chase started with a stroke of luck when Najmul Hossain Shanto couldn't latch on to a tough chance off Muhammad Zohaib's outside edge, off the first ball. Waseem, though, took off from where he left off in the first game. He launched Tanvir Islam out of the stadium in the second over. This one didn't even bounce on the roof, but went straight out of the ground into the trees.He struck Tanzim over midwicket with a swing of the bat, before slog-sweeping Tanvir in the next over, for his third six. Waseem also took a liking to Rana's pace, tonking him three time in the ninth over, straight, through the covers and over point. He lifted Rishad over long-on for his fourth six to complete a century opening stand.UAE lost two wickets in the 11th and 12th overs but Bangladesh couldn't make it three in a row. Hridoy dropped Waseem, who was batting on 63, in the 13th over. He clattered Tanvir for his fifth six soon afterwards, as he got the chase immediately back on track.Rana's horror startNahid Rana has made an impressive start in Tests and T20Is so there was hope and hype about his T20I debut. He however couldn't quite release the ball properly in his first over. He dropped one too short first ball, before bowling a beamer next ball. Both were no-balls, before Zohaib top edged a catch to cover off the free hit.Rana couldn't get his bearing right, bowling a big wide down the leg-side next, before Waseem cracked him twice through point for consecutive fours. It could have been a third four but Hridoy stopped a sharp blow at midwicket at the 30-yard line. Nahid went for 18 in his first over.Big guns' exit scares UAEUAE were still doing well when Asif Khan slammed Tanzim for consecutive sixes in the 14th over. The second was a special shot, a flat blow through the covers. Shorfiul Islam, however, got the better of Waseem in the following over, getting him caught behind with a slower delivery. Jaker took a splendid catch, diving well to his right. Rana, smarting after two expensive overs, hit back with Asif's wicket. He got the big hitter to slog at a hard length. Rana took the catch off his own bowling, giving Bangladesh a vital edge in the contest.A near three-way collisionRana could have had another wicket but the captain Litton Das, Rishad and Tanzid nearly collided to take Saghir Khan's catch. The ball went down, before Saghir cracked Rishad for a six over long on. He, however, fell next ball, getting caught at long-off. Aryansh Sharma repeated Saghir's formula, top-edging Rana for a six before getting caught and bowled one ball later. Shoriful started the penultimate over by removing Alishan Sharafu, giving Bangladesh another boost.Parashar stands tallParashar, however, didn't get fazed by the wickets at the other end, slamming Shorfiul for a four over mid-on, and six through point. With 17 to win off the last seven balls, Shoriful conceded five overthrows by throwing at the non-striker's end.Tanzim started the 12-run defense in the last over with a wide down the leg side. Parashar then posted Tanzim's full-toss high over long-on for a six, leaving just four needed off the remaining four balls. He however fell next ball, before Matiullah Khan took a single. The decisive moment of the game, arguably, came next ball: Tanzim bowled another full-toss, which was adjudged a no-ball.Haider managed to squeeze the ball through point and hared back for the second but there was a mix-up with Matiullah. Had Hridoy thrown the ball with the first attempt, the run-out was very much possible as the replays showed that Haider reached the crease just in the nick of time as the throw came in late.Tanzid boosts Bangladesh startBangladesh made their best start in seven years when they got 17 runs in the first over of the match. Tanzid slammed Matiullah Khan for a big six off the fourth ball, before hammering two straight boundaries. Then, Litton cracked Dhruv Parashar for consecutive fours too, but Muhammad Jawadullah dropped a sitter off the next ball, when Litton was on ten.Jawadullah didn't fare better with the ball shortly afterwards. UAE's best bowler from the first game, the left-arm quick went for 15 runs in his first over. Tanzid cracked him through the covers first ball, before launching him into the stands over square-leg. Then came the dab past the lone slip. Tanzid eventually completed his fourth T20I fifty with a six off left-arm spinner Haider Ali.Tanzid however fell in the tenth over when he couldn't hit it past Matiullah at deep square-leg. Overall, he struck three sixes and eight fours in his 33-ball 59. He helped stitch together an opening stand of 90 with Litton, as Bangladesh eventually made a towering 205 for 5. It wasn't to be enough.Mohammad Isam is ESPNcricinfo's Bangladesh correspondent. @isam84BANUAE100%50%100%BAN InningsUAE InningsOver 20 • UAE 206/8Dhruv Parashar b Tanzim Hasan Sakib 11 (7b 1x4 1x6) SR: 157.14U.A.E. won by 2 wickets (with 1 ball remaining)Powered by Smart StatsInstant answers to T20 questions",

Then, Litton cracked Dhruv Parashar for consecutive fours too, but Muhammad Jawadullah dropped a sitter off the next ball, when Litton was on ten.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eJawadullah didn\u0026#39;t fare better with the ball shortly afterwards. UAE\u0026#39;s best bowler from the first game, the left-arm quick went for 15 runs in his first over. Tanzid cracked him through the covers first ball, before launching him into the stands over square-leg. Then came the dab past the lone slip. Tanzid eventually completed his fourth T20I fifty with a six off left-arm spinner Haider Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eTanzid however fell in the tenth over when he couldn\u0026#39;t hit it past Matiullah at deep square-leg. Overall, he struck three sixes and eight fours in his 33-ball 59. He helped stitch together an opening stand of 90 with Litton, as Bangladesh eventually made a towering 205 for 5. It wasn\u0026#39;t to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eMohammad Isam is ESPNcricinfo\u0026#39;s Bangladesh correspondent.
