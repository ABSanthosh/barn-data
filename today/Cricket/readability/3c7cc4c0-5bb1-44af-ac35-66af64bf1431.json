  "text": "Buttler and returning Dawson lead England to winMedia caption, Buttler and Dawson star as England beat West Indies in first T20First T20 international, Chester-le-StreetEngland 188-6 (20 overs): Buttler 96 (59), Smith 38 (20); Shepherd 2-33 West Indies 167-9 (20 overs): Lewis 39 (23); Dawson 4-20 England won by 21 runs; lead series 1-0ScorecardLiam Dawson marked his return with four wickets and Jos Buttler hit a superb 96 as England beat West Indies by 21 runs in the first T20 international in Chester-le-Street.Playing his first international since November 2022 at the age of 35, left-arm spinner Dawson skillfully turned and deceived his way to 4-20 as England defended 189.He took England's first wicket in the powerplay and, with the game in the balance, returned to claim another three through the middle as the Windies collapsed from 91-2 in the 10th over to 115-6.They struggled on and, needing 48 from the final 12 balls, ended on 167-9.Earlier Buttler was near his inventive and destructive best in hitting six fours and four sixes in his 59 balls.He put on 79 with Jamie Smith, who made 38 from 20 balls in his first innings as T20 opener, and 60 with Jacob Bethell as England posted 188-6 despite slowing after a fast start.Victory extends England's winning start under new captain Harry Brook, who replaced Buttler after he resigned following the dismal exit at the Champions Trophy in February.With Buttler looking revitalised, England - 3-0 winners across the one-day internationals - can clinch the T20 series on Sunday in the second match in Bristol.Buttler hints at bright post-captaincy eraMedia caption, 'What a knock!' - Buttler smashes 96 off 59 ballsThe 3-0 ODI series win was the ideal start for Brook as white-ball captain but recovering England's form in the T20 format - with a World Cup to come early next year - is of far greater significance.While Brook has hinted he could re-energise the team, having Buttler at his best will be just as important as anything the Yorkshireman can do on the field.Buttler, who has said he was drained by the end of his captaincy at the Champions Trophy, took 12 from his first 11 balls before playing an outrageous reverse scoop to Andre Russell's seam.In the sixth over he launched Alzarri Joseph twice over mid-wicket and flicked the West Indies quick for a six and a four to fine leg as England scored 78 in the powerplay, despite Ben Duckett being caught for one off a top edge in the second over.Afterwards Buttler lost the strike and subsequently his rhythm.West Indies' spinners dragged the scoring back, with left-armer Gudakesh Motie conceding only 21 from his four overs. Smith hit to mid-wicket, Brook was bowled by off-spinner Roston Chase for six and Tom Banton pinned lbw by Russell for four.With Jacob Bethell struggling to get going in his run-a-ball 23, Buttler was trapped in front by Joseph within a hit of his second T20 century for England in the penultimate over.Still, having made 41 not out from just 20 balls in the third ODI on Tuesday, Buttler has hinted his post-captaincy era may be a profitable one.Dawson delights in comebackMedia caption, 'He's back!' - Dawson takes four wickets on England returnWhile Buttler has been a fixture in England's white-ball teams for a generation, this was only Dawson's 21st international despite his debut coming nine years ago.He has been the standout spinner in English domestic cricket in recent years but has been overlooked across formats for various other options.Having bowled the opening over, he struck in his second - the fourth of the West Indies chase - as a flighted delivery tempted Johnson Charles to advance and had him stumped.On his T20 debut, Matthew Potts had Windies captain Shai Hope caught at mid-on for three before a stand of 58 between Evin Lewis and Roston Chase kept the tourists in the game.They hit 24 from the 10th over bowled by Bethell to take the momentum but Lewis was caught at mid-wicket off the final ball.Dawson took the next over from Bethell's end and had left-hander Sherfane Rutherford caught at long-on for two. In the same over he tossed one wider to force Chase to hit to long-off for 24 and England surged on.After three overs Dawson had 3-11 but those figures were dented slightly by two fours at the start of his fourth.He responded perfectly - bowling former Windies captain Rovman Powell with a quicker ball - to secure his best return in international T20s and the best for England by a left-arm spinner.'I was nervous' - reactionMedia caption, 'No wonder he's smiling' - Dawson takes two wickets in one overPlayer of the match, England spinner Liam Dawson: \"When you get 190 on the board, you can go out there and simplify everything. You can bowl defensively and they've got to come to you.\"I was nervous going into the game but I'm happy to contribute.\"England captain Harry Brook: \"It's unbelievable to have Dawson and Rashid working from both ends, operating the way they've done for so many years, and that wealth of experience.\"Jos Buttler is unbelievable. To have him in this T20 team batting in the top three, it's an honour.\"West Indies captain Shai Hope: \"We didn't bowl as well as we wanted in the powerplay but I must commend the bowlers for the fight they showed to pull them back and give us a good chance.\"We've got to put this behind us and we've got two games to win the series.\"More on this story",
