Bamber bowled locum opener Dom Bess in the third over.And, either side of lunch, that was the first of seven successive maidens bowled by himself and new-ball partner Olly Hannon-Dalby, who hails from down the road in Halifax.James Wharton was run out at the non-striker's end during the early stages of the afternoon following a mix-up with opener Adam Lyth, who then went on to share a third-wicket 71 with Root.Both look assured, though Lyth's effort was curtailed 10 runs short of a fifty when he edged behind off the back foot to Ed Barnard's seam, leaving the hosts at 90-3. over.Harry Brook fell lbw for 20, playing around a full ball from seamer Michael Booth shortly before tea, where the hosts reached at 152-4 with a lead of 104.Jonny Bairstow top-edged a pull at Bamber behind on six, with wicketkeeper Kai Smith taking a smart running catch, before George Hill edged Barnard to second slip. And when Jordan Thompson miscued to cover as Barnard struck for a third time, Yorkshire were 190-7, leading by 142.All the while, Root looked commanding at the crease in his 100th first-class innings for the county, hitting 13 fours in 131 balls.He reached his fifty off 64 balls, and one driven boundary straight of mid-off against Webster was particularly memorable.However, he missed out on a century when he top-edged a pull to backward point off Bamber at 219-8.Dan Mousley was the catcher, and the same combination did for Sears soon after before Ben Coad was bowled by Booth for 28, giving Warwickshire a short period of batting to navigate before close.ECB Reporters' Network supported by Rothesay",
