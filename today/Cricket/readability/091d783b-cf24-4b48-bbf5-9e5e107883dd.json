Both Brook and Root finished with big scores, Root making 262 and Brook reaching his maiden Test triple ton. Earlier in the game, Root became England's leading Test run-scorer of all-time, overtaking Alastair Cook, and moved into fifth place on the overall all-time rankings. Brook's century was the sixth of his career and his fourth against Pakistan in as many Tests. Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley also made fifties, while Jamie Smith played a quickfire cameo, helping England over the 800-run mark.  On a flat track in Multan, England surpassed their highest post-war score, which was 710-7d against India in 2011, recording their third-highest Test total ever.  England's previous highest score of the Bazball era was 657 all out in Rawalpindi the last time they were in Pakistan. They had also made 592 against Australia in the 2023 Ashes, with their 539 all out against New Zealand in 2022 being the third-highest since Brendon McCullum took over before the Multan Test. England have also made the highest team total against Pakistan in the history of Test matches, beating the previous best of 790/3d that the West Indies had made back in 1958.  England's highest Test total ever remains 903-7d against Australia in 1938. They have also scored 800 once before, when they were all out for 849 against the West Indies in 1930.  This is only the fourth time that a team has made 800 in Test cricket history, with the only other team being Sri Lanka, who have the record of the highest team score, at 952-6d against India in 1997.  England's highest all-time Test totals Opposition Score Venue Year Australia 903-7d The Oval 19387 West Indies 849 Kingston 1930 Pakistan 823-7d Multan 2024 India 710-7d Birmingham 2011 Australia 658-8d Nottingham 1938 England's highest-ever score in Test history is their score of 903-7d in 1938. Led by Leonard Hutton's 364 against Australia, England batted just once and won by a massive margin of an innings and 579 runs.  In 1930, England had made 849 batting first in Kingston, with Andy Sandham scoring 325 and Les Ames making 149 in 174 deliveries. The match ended in a draw.  Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
