A remarkable achievement for New Zealand! üá≥üáøü§Ø#INDvNZ pic.twitter.com/gXFD24WHG2‚Äî Cricket on TNT Sports (@cricketontnt) October 26, 2024India needed 359 to win, a tough task on a black-soil turner at Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium where spinners wreaked havoc. They made a blazing start as Yashasvi Jaiswal smacked some spectacular boundaries, but his dismissal for 77 by Santner and Rishabh Pant‚Äôs run out for a duck left India in deep trouble at 127 for 4.Santner, who had earlier removed Rohit Sharma for eight and Shubman Gill for 23, continued to torment India and trapped trump card Virat Kohli lbw for 17. Sarfaraz Khan was unable to recreate his batting heroics from the opening match, perishing for nine after missing a low delivery from Santner, who took his second five-for of the game.Washington Sundar fell for 21 to Glenn Phillips and Santner had Ravichandran Ashwin caught for a solid 18 to leave India staring down the barrel at 206 for 8. Ravindra Jadeja made New Zealand wait with a defiant 42, but when he was well caught at long on by Tim Southee, India‚Äôs fate was sealed.New Zealand had made 255 in their second innings, thanks mainly to 86 from their captain Tom Latham and some handy contributions in the lower middle-order. Tom Blundell made 41 and the irrepressible Phillips hit two sixes in an unbeaten 48.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really special feeling. Very proud to be in this position,‚Äù said Latham, who took over as permanent captain from Tim Southee after a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just me but a team effort. This game was a clear example of everyone pitching in when they needed to and everyone standing up at different times.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really special. When you come here, you always want to compete and put your best foot forward. We played fantastically well,‚Äù Latham added. ‚ÄúSantner in that first innings was fantastic. To get a break and bowl the way he did, credit has to go to him.‚ÄùThe series will conclude with the third Test in Wankhede from 1 November, with the hosts aiming to salvage some pride as New Zealand target a series whitewash.",
