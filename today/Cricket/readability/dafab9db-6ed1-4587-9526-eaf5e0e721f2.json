  "text": "Oct 10, 2024 2 minute read News Joe Root moved past Alastair Cook into outright second place for the England batters with the most Test double centuries on day four in Multan, drawing level with Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting. Root's innings in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan continued to propel him up the record charts on the morning of day four. He hit his 35th Test century on day three, in a huge partnership with Harry Brook. He also went past Alastair Cook to become England's highest Test run-scorer in the process. Root reached the end of play unbeaten on 176, and resumed to chase a double-century this morning (October 10).  However, he endured a scare early in the morning session when he pulled a ball from Naseem Shah straight to Babar Azam at mid-wicket on 186. He was given a reprieve when Babar dropped the simple chance and was able to go on to record his sixth Test double-century. Root would later pass 250 and then 254, his previous highest Test score, before the lunch break on day four. Full List: Players with the most Test match double-centuries By reaching his double century, Root has moved up another place on the all-time list for players with the most double centuries in Test matches. He is now in joint seventh place overall, equal with Marvan Atapattu, Javed Miandad, Ricky Ponting, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Kane Williamson and Younis Khan.  He is also now in second place on the overall England rankings for players with the most Test double centuries, moving past Alastair Cook's tally of five and one behind Wally Hammond in first place with seven. The only active player above Root with more Test double centuries is Virat Kohli, who has seven, although Williamson - who has six alongside Root - also has the ability to overtake him. Root is now also in joint second place for the most double hundreds scored overseas, with four of his six coming outside of England. That's the same number as Graeme Smith, and one fewer than Don Bradman, Hammond, Brian Lara, Kumar Sangakkara, and Younis Khan.
