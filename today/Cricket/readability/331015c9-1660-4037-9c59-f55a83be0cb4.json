England, Australia and India would still be permitted to schedule five-Test series of five‑day matches for the Ashes, the Border‑Gavaskar Trophy and the newly named Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, the first iteration of which begins with the first Test between England and India at Headingley on Friday.The ICC first sanctioned four-day Tests for bilateral contests in 2017, with England playing Zimbabwe over four days at Trent Bridge last month after four-day Tests against Ireland in 2019 and 2023, although introducing them for the WTC would be a significant change and could lead to longer series.Many smaller nations are reluctant to host Tests due to the time they take out of the schedule and the cost, but a move to four-day cricket would enable an entire three-Test series to be played in less than three weeks. In four-day Tests the playing hours are extended to mandate a minimum of 98 overs per day rather than 90 overs to mitigate the time lost.South Africa’s threadbare itinerary despite being crowned world champions in the thrilling final against Australia at Lord’s last week has further highlighted the issue, and focused minds on the need for change.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTemba Bavuma’s squad travel to India for a two-Test series in November but will not play a Test at home until October 2026.",
