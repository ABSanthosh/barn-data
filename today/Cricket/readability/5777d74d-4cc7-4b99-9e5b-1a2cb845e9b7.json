  "text": "Seamer Matthew Potts said the efforts of captain Ben Stokes were an inspiration to the England team on the first day of the third Test against New Zealand.All-rounder Stokes bowled 23 overs in Hamilton, his most in an innings since the summer of 2022.The skipper took one wicket as New Zealand were pegged back from 105-0 to 315-9.\"He can be really proud of his efforts,\" Potts told BBC Sport. \"He leads the team by example.\"He probably won't want to take the credit, but when we see him doing special things like that, it motivates you to put in that extra 1% for the team.\"Stokes, 33, has had his bowling curtailed by injuries in recent years. Last year he had surgery on a long-term left knee problem and, just as he returned to full fitness, suffered a hamstring injury in August.In the three-Test series in New Zealand, which England have an unassaible 2-0 lead, Stokes has been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer.His spell in Hamilton equals the 23 overs he bowled in the first innings of the second Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge more than two years ago.\"Massive plaudits to the skipper,\" said Durham team-mate Potts. \"He bowled three long spells there and one of them was eight overs of bouncers.\"Potts returned to the England side for his first appearance of the tour in place of Chris Woakes.Potts, 26, has been in and out of the side since making his debut in 2022. This is his 10th cap and second of the winter.He claimed 3-75, including having Kane Williamson play on to his own stumps for 44. Potts has now dismissed the Kiwi talisman four times in the five innings he has bowled to him.Asked if it is frustrating having to wait for opportunities in the England side, Potts said: \"I wouldn't say it's frustrating, no. I enjoy every single moment being part of this squad. There's always jobs I can be doing, helping out.\"The competition for places is really high and that's a great thing from the team stand point. These things happen. You travel around a little bit and don't play, then you get an opportunity.\"England are looking to become only the third visiting team to earn a 3-0 clean sweep in this country.Stokes won the toss and chose to field, a decision that looked to be backfiring when Tom Latham and Will Young were sharing New Zealand's highest opening partnership for 18 months.But England fought back across the afternoon and evening, leaving the game delicately poised. On a pitch that could turn and bounce unevenly later in the match, England are likely to need a healthy first-innings lead.\"It's in the balance,\" said Potts. \"The pitch played better throughout the day and started to look like a decent batting wicket.\"We were excellent. We persevered with the ball and in the field and stuck at it in the heat.\"",
