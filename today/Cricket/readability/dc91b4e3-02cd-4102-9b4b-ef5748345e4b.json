  "text": "Women's Premier League Final, MumbaiMumbai Indians 149-7 (20 overs): Harmanpreet 66 (44); Kapp 2-11Delhi Capitals 141-9 (20 overs): Kapp 40 (26); Sciver-Brunt 3-30Mumbai Indians won by eight runsScorecardNat Sciver-Brunt claimed 3-30 and held her nerve at the death as Mumbai Indians won the Women's Premier League for the second time with an eight-run victory over Delhi Capitals in the final.MI made a slow start after being asked to bat first as Marizanne Kapp took 2-11 from a miserly opening spell before Harmanpreet Kaur got them up and running with 66 off 44 balls.The MI skipper cracked nine fours and two sixes in an 89-run partnership with England all-rounder Sciver-Brunt for the third wicket.MI's innings stalled after Sciver-Brunt swept Shree Charani into the hands of mid-wicket for a 28-ball 30 and Harmanpreet followed not long after, caught in the deep off Annabel Sutherland.Jess Jonassen and Charani finished with two wickets apiece for the Capitals as MI, who are coached by former England captain Charlotte Edwards, posted a competitive 149-7.Delhi lost captain Meg Lanning for 13 early in their reply, bowled by a Sciver-Brunt in-ducker, before fellow opener Shafali Verma was trapped lbw to Shabnim Ismail.From 17-2 Jemimah Rodrigues led the fightback for Delhi - beaten finalists in the past two WPLs - with a gutsy 30.But when she became Kiwi spinner Amelia Kerr's second wicket in the 11th over, the scoreboard read 66-5 and the Capitals' fate looked to be sealed.However, South Africa all-rounder Kapp ensured the match went deeper than expected with a defiant 40 off 26 balls before she chipped Sciver-Brunt into the hands of long-off.The Capitals required 14 runs off the final over of the game but Sciver-Brunt was ice cool with ball in hand as she conceded just five singles.MI's victory was their second over the Capitals in a WPL final, having beaten them by seven wickets in 2023.After winning the toss and batting first in the finals of the 2023 and 2024 WPLs - both of which they lost - Capitals skipper Lanning this time opted to bowl at the Brabourne Stadium when the coin came down in her favour.It seemed the right ploy when the Capitals squeezed their opponents early on as the skilful Kapp gave them the upper hand with a superb opening spell.Kapp claimed the key wicket of the dangerous Hayley Matthews with a clever set-up, bowling three away-swingers before a wobble-seam delivery nipped back.Mumbai had to wait until the fifth over for a boundary and their powerplay score of 20-2 was the second lowest of this year's tournament.However, in a repeat of the 2023 final between the sides, Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet diligently rebuilt the innings for MI, laying a platform to go on the attack.On that occasion it was Sciver-Brunt who played a leading hand with an unbeaten 60 but this time experienced India skipper Harmapreet was the chief protagonist.Harmapreet showed the greater aggression, whipping Sutherland for six through mid-wicket then extravagantly striking three consecutive fours off Jonassen.Sciver-Brunt's knock was sufficient for her to become the first player in WPL history to pass 1,000 runs, sailing clear as the leading run-scorer with 523 in 10 innings at 65.37 to claim the orange cap.The total looked doable for the Capitals but they lost regular wickets as MI's intensity in the field was backed up by some smart bowling.Kiwi leg-spinner Kerr snaffled the wickets of Jonassen and Rodrigues to finish as the WPL's joint top wicket-taker with Matthews on 18 victims, but at a slightly better average to take the purple cap.But it was England vice-captain Sciver-Brunt who showed nerves of steel with the ball at the business end of the game as she first removed Kapp, then outfoxed the big-hitting Niki Prasad in the final over.The ultra-competitive Kapp was in tears afterwards with Capitals left to rue their third consecutive defeat in a WPL final as MI's lifted the trophy with franchise owner Nita Ambani.Player of the tournament Nat Sciver-Brunt: \"It has been a great year for me in the WPL. It's come off the back of a lot of cricket. I am so happy to be standing here as a winner. \"I will ride the highs as long as I can because I am sure there are some lows around the corner as well - but that is cricket, isn't it? On any given day you can get a great ball, so just happy to ride those highs while I can. \"We have a great amount of all-rounders and world-class players who can stand up at any time. It is so special to be a part of a franchise that has become family.\"MI captain and player of the match Harmanpreet Kaur: \"It was a great team effort. I would like to congratulate the Delhi team, it was not easy for us. \"At the end of the day, you feel happy, really happy with the way we played. We fought until the last ball. It is all about being there and doing the right things again and again.\"Capitals skipper Meg Lanning: \"We are bitterly disappointed. We have had another good season but unfortunately we could not get over the line. \"We have not been able to put our best performances on the board in the final, which is disappointing - but that is cricket. We prepped to do as well as we could. It has been different each time.\"Full credit to Mumbai - they have been excellent throughout and thoroughly deserved their win. We could not get it together with the bat. \"",
