  "text": "All-rounder Alice Capsey has been recalled to England's T20 squad for their tour of South Africa, which begins on Sunday.England said the 20-year-old has been called up \"due to a couple of minor injury concerns within the squad\".Capsey was a high-profile omission from the T20s and Test squads for the tour when they were initially announced earlier this month, but she was included in the one-day team.She was part of the England side which suffered a group-stage exit from October's T20 World Cup.Capsey did not pass 20 runs in any of her three innings at the tournament in the United Arab Emirates.She has since been playing in the Women's Big Bash League for Melbourne Renegades, and took a five-wicket haul against Perth Scorchers before a first-ball duck in the same match this month.Speaking last week, England head coach Jon Lewis said Capsey was \"trending in the wrong direction\" and that they \"need to have a little reset\". \"We've given her some really clear guidance on where we'd like her to improve and how we'd like her to play,\" added Lewis. \"Alice is incredibly strong-willed and really determined to be the best player she can be. There's no doubt in my mind that over time, she will play lots and lots of games for England in all formats.\"England will play three T20s, three ODIs and a four-day Test on their tour of South Africa.",
