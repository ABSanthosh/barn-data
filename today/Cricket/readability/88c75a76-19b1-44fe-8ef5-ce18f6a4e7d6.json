Breakthrough! Wide yorker from Ashwani, and Wadhera fails to get the apt elevation. He couldn't get the elevation and distance he would have needed. Santner takes a good catchPBKS: 156/4 (15.4) PBKS vs MI Live: Bumrah magic! Bumrah has just bowled an incredible over, save that last ball. Just five off it. The RRR is now over 11 once again.

Another 10 plus over. 14 off it.

Poor bowling from Topley. This over might just come back to haunt MI, in hindsightPBKS: 128/3 (19) PBKS vs MI Live: Flicked up and over!

Has Hardik turned this game around? A half-hearted appeal for caught behind. Umpire raises his finger straightaway. Inglis reviews. There is a big spike when the ball is passing close to the bat. Excellent decisionJosh Inglis c Bairstow b Pandya 38 (21)PBKS: 72/3 (7.5) PBKS vs MI Live: Mistimed! GONE! Ashwani strikes off his very first ball.

Inglis has done exactly thatPBKS: 55/1 (5) PBKS vs MI Live: Creamed through midwicket! Inglis welcomes Bumrah with a boundary! A freebie from Boom! The length ball was angling in towards middle, he timed it through midwicket.PBKS: 39/1 (4.1) PBKS vs MI Live: Inglis on the charge! Back-to-back boundaries for the little Aussie! Played a blinder when these two sides met last month. Need a similar knock from Inglis, if not better.PBKS: 21/1 (2.4) PBKS vs MI Live: Boult strikes! WICKET! Boult strikes. Prabh got a top edge by being early into the shot. Reece Topley covers plenty of ground, does ever so well to grab the ball. Almost collided with Santner in the processPrabhsimran Singh c Topley b Boult 6 (9)PBKS: 13/1 (2.1) PBKS vs MI Live: Flicked away! Flicked away off the back foot! Ends the over with a boundary. All about the timing from Priyansh. First over in MI colours for Topley. Starts off with just sevenPBKS: 13/0 (2) PBKS vs MI Live: Tidy over!

Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma scored 44 each for MI while Naman Dhir's fiery 37 too helped the team's cause.MI 203/6 (20) PBKS vs MI Live: Naman Dhir is OUT! Big blow to Mumbai Indians with three balls still left in the innings. Naman Dhir is out for 37 off just 18 balls. This was such a crucial knock from the right-handed batter. His knock ended as he hit the ball straight into the hands of the fielder at extra cover.MI 197/6 (19.3) PBKS vs MI Live: Poor bowling! Arshdeep Singh bowled poorly in his final over and ended up leaking 13 runs in it. Naman Dhir slammed the pacer for two fours in the over. Arshdeep ended his quota of four overs with figures of 0 for 44. Naman Dhir is playing a crucial knock for MI here.MI 193/5 (19) PBKS vs MI Live: WICKET! Hardik Pandya is OUT! It was a short ball from Azmatullah Omarzai and Hardik ended up hitting it high in the air. Wicketkeeper Josh Inglis settled under it and took the catch quite comfortably. He got out for 15 off 13 balls. MI 180/5 (18) PBKS vs MI Live: Expensive over! Smart batting from Naman Dhir. He smashed three fours to Arshdeep Singh in the over that fetched Mumbai Indians a total of 14 runs. The first two boundaries from Naman were hit over the short fine leg, while the final one was hit through the backward square leg.MI 170/4 (17) PBKS vs MI Live: Overthrow! Poor fielding this is! Hardik Pandya tapped the Vijaykumar Vyshak delivery on the leg side and tried to steal a couple. There was a throw at the non-stiker's end but the backup failed to stop the throw and it ran away for a four. 10 runs came off the over.MI 156/4 (16) PBKS vs MI Live: Good bowling! Only four runs came off the over from Kyle Jamieson and a wicket. He ended his quota of four overs with figures of 1 for 30. Two new batters Hardik Pandya and Naman Dhir are in the middle for Mumbai Indians and they need to propel the side over 200 to give a fight to Punjab Kings.MI 146/4 (15) PBKS vs MI Live: Tilak is OUT! Kyle Jamieson has struck and Mumbai Indians are in some trouble here. They have lost two wickets in just three balls. This is quite a quick turnaround from Punjab Kings. They are back in the game. Tilak miscued and ended up hitting the ball in the air behind the bowler. Priyansh Arya ran from the leg side and took a brilliant catch. Tilak fell for 44 off 39 balls.MI 142/4 (14.1) PBKS vs MI Live: OUT! A desperate attempt to slog-sweep the ball on the leg side got the better of Suryakumar Yadav as he ended up hitting a Yuzvendra Chahal delivery into the hands of the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Suryakumar departed for 44 off 26 balls. Meanwhile, Chahal ended his quota of four overs with figures of 1 for 39. MI 142/3 (14) PBKS vs MI Live: FOUR! FOUR! Eight runs came off Kyle Jamieson's third over. Suryakumar Yadav hit a four over the backward point and another one at square leg. He is batting at the score of 34 off 22 balls. On the other hand, Tilak Varma is close to his fifty and he needs noly 7 runs to get there.MI 131/2 (13) PBKS vs MI Live: Chahal stays expensive! 11 runs came off the over from Yuzvendra Chahal. Suryakumar Yadav hit the flighted delivery on the first ball of the over from Chahal over the long-off for a six. The ball narrowly missed the fielder there on the edge of the boundary. Chahal has so far leaked 28 runs in his three overs. MI 123/2 (12) PBKS vs MI Live: Big achievement for SKY! As Suryakumar Yadav reached the mark of 15 in this innings, he became the non-opener with most runs in an IPL season. Suryakumar surpassed the record of AB de Villiers, who held the record since 2016 with the tally of 687. PBKS vs MI Live: FOUR! A short ball from Yuzvendra Chahal and Suryakumar Yadav finds the gap on the off-side for a four. He hit it through the backward point for the boundary. 14 runs came off the over from Chahal. Mumbai Indians are on the move! MI 102/2 (10) PBKS vs MI Live: SIX! Wow! That is a beautiful shot from Tilak Varma. Vijaykumar Vyshak bowled a fuller ball away from Tilak with the mid-off inside the ring and the batter lofted it over the fielder for a six. A dot ball followed. 15 runs came off the over.MI 88/2 (9) PBKS vs MI Live: Superb captaincy! Yuzvendra Chahal was brought into the attack and he conceded only three runs in his first over. The bowling changes and field placements from PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer have been spot on tonight. This has helped the side keep the Mumbai Indians' batters in check.MI 73/2 (8) PBKS vs MI Live: Bairstow is GONE! Massive blow for Mumbai Indians this is! Vijaykumar Vyshak has got the wicket of Jonny Bairstow. The right-handed MI opener tried to play a scoop shot but Vyshak bowled a slower ball to deceive him. Bairstow ended up handing a catch to PBKS wicketkeeper Josh Inglis. He is gone for 38 off 24 balls.MI 70/2 (7) PBKS vs MI Live: End of powerplay! 15 runs came off the over of Azmatullah Omarzai. That is the end of the first powerplay. Mumbai Indians lost the wicket of Rohit Sharma but Jonny Bairstow kept the side going. He is batting at the score of 36 off 21 balls. Tilak Varma, the number 3 batter, is also off to a quick start (14 off 9).MI 65/1 (6) PBKS vs MI Live: SIX! 5.4 - That has been clobbered away by Jonny Bairstow for a six into the crowd. Azmatullah Omarzai bowled a short of length off-cutter and Bairstow spotted it well. He hammered it into the stands over the deep mid-wicket for a biggie. The MI opener has been smashing PBKS bowlers really well. PBKS vs MI Live: Good strategy from Jamieson! Punjab Kings bowler Kyle Jamieson seems to have done his homework well. He had good strategy against both Tilak Varma and Jonny Bairstow in the over. While a slower bouncer outside off-stump was the plan against Bairstow, the pacer bowled tight good length ball into the body to Tilak. Only 7 runs came off the over.MI 50/1 (5) PBKS vs MI Live: 13-run over! Runs keep coming for Mumbai Indians. An uppish drive from Jonny Bairstow on the third ball of the over helped him fetch a four through the cover region. On the final delivery, Bairstow got a top edge on his pull shot but luckily for him, the ball went over the wicketkeeper's head for a four.MI 43/1 (4)  PBKS vs MI Live: Expensive over! While the wicket of Rohit Sharma came in it, Marcus Stoinis leaked 15 runs in the over. Tilak Varma slammed the all-rounder for a six down the ground. It was a no-ball. However, Tilak failed to take advantage of the free-hit and ended up hitting the ball into the hands of mid-on for just a single. MI 30/1 (3) PBKS vs MI Live: Rohit is OUT! Rohit Sharma is not lucky for the second time and he is out for 8 runs off 7 balls. He hit the previous delivery of Marcus Stoinis for a four but this time he hsa found the fielder at deep square leg. Vijaykumar Vyshak took the catch quite comfortably.MI 19/1 (2.2) PBKS vs MI Live: Catch dropped! Rohit Sharma continues to ride his luck from the previous game. He was dropped twice in MI's Eliminator game vs Gujarat Titans and he gets an early life here against Punjab Kings too. Kyle Jamieson produced an outside edge high in the air. The short third ran behind but failed to take the catch.MI 15/0 (2) PBKS vs MI Live: SIX! First boundary of the night and it is a big six into the crowd! That comes from the bat of Jonny Bairstow. Kyle Jamieson bowled a short of length ball and Bairstow whipped it over the long-leg for a biggie.  MI 13/0 (1.3) PBKS vs MI Live: Tidy over! Arshdeep Singh got some good swing in the first over. He kept both Rohit Sharma and Jonny Bairstow in check. Only four runs came in the over through three singles and a wide. The ball is not coming nicely to the bat. MI openers need to be a bit patient here.MI 4/0 (1) PBKS vs MI Live: It's time for action! Rohit Sharma is on the strike, Jonny Bairstow is at the other end. Arshdeep Singh has the new ball in hand. Here we go... Arshdeep starts with an inswinging delivery outside off-stump to Rohit. It was a back of a length ball and Rohit defended it on the front foot. PBKS vs MI Live: Start time announced!

The fans close to the boundary line are now forced to leave their seats and run for shelter as the rain is making it tough for them to stay there. This is not a good sight. PBKS vs MI Live: Rain is back! Just forget what I said in the previous post and excuse me for it as the rain is back again! It is not heavy at the moment, but good enough to put a halt to the proceedings. The broadcaster's equipments on the edge of the boundary are being covered by plastic to save it from water drops. PBKS vs MI Live: Rain stops! It has stopped raining at Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad. The covers are being taken off. Meanwhile, the Punjab Kings players are already out of the ground now.

PBKS vs MI Live: Have a look at pitch report by then - \"Pitch No. 7 being used for this game tonight. Dimensions - 61m and 67m square, a hit down the ground is 73m. This venue has been one of the best venues when it comes to batting - very very even paced and consistent. It looks very good. You don't want to be a bowler on nights like tonight. It's a batter's paradise. Both teams look forward to batting, it's a high-scoring venue. You want over 200, there's no doubt about it. It's flat, it's even, it's rock hard. For the bowlers, your only hope is your change-ups and your execution has to be perfect. It's a tough night for the bowlers unfortunately. Pitch 7 being used - 224 is the average score here. At this venue, 221 the average score,\" said Murali Kartik and Michael Clarke while talking about the pitch. PBKS vs MI Live: Bad news for MI! In the event that the match is washed out, PBKS will be declared the winners and will enter the final of IPL 2025.

The ground umpires are walking in and so do the Punjab Kings players. Yuzvendra Chahal leads the PBKS players into the ground. Oh, no!

Looks like a decent track, just need to bat well, assess the conditions early and I think we'll be okay. It (pitch) has gotten much flatter, the balls have stopped doing as much as it used to do. If you bowl well, fast bowlers tend to get some help. At the same point of time, if you bat well, you can score a lot of runs. There are a lot of areas where we could have got better in the last game. Playing a tight crucial game, one day break, it's tough but we are into a rhythm and we know what we need to execute. We came very early morning after the game, we needed some rest, most of the guys focused on recovery and being fresh for today. The intensity will be very important and we're looking forward to it. We had to make one change. Reece comes in place of Gleeson who has a niggle. Reece Topley comes in,\" said MI captain Hardik Pandya. PBKS vs MI Live: Here's why PBKS opted to bowl - \"We are going to bowl first. Slightly overcast and the wicket was under the covers yesterday. Based on these, we are going to bowl first. It's a fresh day, we've recovered pretty well, rejuvenated and our mindset is to go out there and win. Boys are in high spirits, everyone's thinking positive. The environment in the dressing room is top-notch at the moment, so I can't complain much. Yuzi comes in,\" said Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer. PBKS vs MI Live: PBKS opt to bowl!

Suryakumar Yadav is the top run-getter for MI with 673 runs in 15 innings at an average of 67.30 and a strike rate of 167.83. If he scores 15 more runs, he will go past AB de Villiers to become the non-opening batter with the most runs in a single IPL edition. IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 Live: PBKS need to bat better It was a horrible display of batting from Punjab Kings in the Qualifier 1 match against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Mullanpur.
