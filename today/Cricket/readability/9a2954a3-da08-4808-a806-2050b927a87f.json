The Champions Trophy is returning after more than seven years, and India will see it as an opportunity to add another ICC title to its title cabinet, especially after the T20 World Cup success in Barbados. In the last edition, India made its way to the final but fell short against its arch-rival Pakistan and succumbed to a 180-run defeat. This time around, India will look to go all the way and take centerstage with the trophy in India's grasp. With the tournament just a month away from commencement, Irfan feels India has a good chance to bring the title home.\"Team India can because if you look at the white-ball team, it is pretty much settled. To add to that, there are a couple of young gun players, that can be added as well. One of them is Nitish Kumar Reddy. That will only make the team stronger. Plenty of options. Bowling will be very crucial. The hopes are very high,\" Irfan said in a video posted by Star Sports on X.The eight-team event will comprise 15 matches in the 50-over format and will be held across Pakistan and Dubai.
