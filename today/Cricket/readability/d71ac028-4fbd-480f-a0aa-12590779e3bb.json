  "text": "England unsure if Stokes will bowl on fifth dayMedia caption, Trescothick 'hopeful' Stokes will bowl on day fiveEngland will \"wait and see\" whether captain Ben Stokes is fit enough to bowl when they push for victory over India on the final day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, says assistant coach Marcus Trescothick.After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl as India dug in to reach 174-2 at the end of day four, still 137 runs behind. Trescothick said that was because Stokes, who has been dogged by injury issues in recent years and had to retire hurt while batting with cramp on day three, was \"a bit stiff and sore\".\"We are still hopeful he will be better tomorrow and come back out, be a bit looser and ready to go again,\" Trescothick told BBC Test Match Special.\"We will assess it overnight and see what happens.\"Asked about Stokes' fitness on Friday evening, vice-captain Ollie Pope said Stokes was \"good to go\". Though the talismanic all-rounder batted on in the morning session to score 141 - his first Test century for two years - that he did not bring himself into the attack and that Trescothick cast doubt on him playing a part on Sunday is of concern.He appeared weary in the field, often bending over with his hands on his knees and feeling his left hamstring at one stage in the afternoon.His side looked on course for victory when Chris Woakes dismissed Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan but, in batting out the remaining 62.1 overs of the day, captain Shubman Gill and opener KL Rahul have given India hope of batting out the final day for a draw and ensuring they head to The Oval 2-1 down with one match to play in the series.\"Ben Stokes chased one to deep extra cover, he held his hamstring, that was visible for everyone to see,\" former England captain Michael Vaughan said.\"We'll wait and see. Ben is a super-human at times. He was probably hoping today that they would get the wickets and he wasn't going to be required. \"It doesn't half tell you how important he is to the attack.\"Media caption, Gill \u0026 Rahul frustrate England after Stokes centuryStokes had surgery on his left hamstring in January, having torn the same muscle last summer and had a knee operation in November 2023. He only returned to bowling in late May during the one-off Test against Zimbabwe.Still, Stokes has been England's most consistent seamer this summer. His 16 wickets in the series are the most on either side.However, the 129 overs has has bowled is his biggest workload in a single series, despite Trescothick saying after the second hamstring tear in December he may have to manage his bowling workloads. There are also only three days off before the fifth Test next week.Trescothick suggested England's management still needs to find a way to protect Stokes, who will be seeking to help England regain the Ashes in Australia later in the year.\"You have to manage everyone - him no different because of his impact as captain of the team you want him playing as many games as possible,\"If we can find a way [to limit his overs], of course it will benefit. The more games he will string together as captain and leader the better that will be for the team.\"India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant will bat if required despite his broken foot.Media caption, England bowling attack 'toothless' without StokesMore on this story",
