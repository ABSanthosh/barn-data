  "text": "Fast bowler Gus Atkinson has been ruled out of England's one-day international series against West Indies because of a hamstring injury.Atkinson, 27, suffered the injury during England's comprehensive Test victory against Zimbabwe, which they won by an innings and 45 runs. He is expected to be fit in time for the five-match Test series against India, with the first Test at Headingley, starting on 20 June. England will not be adding a replacement for Atkinson in the squad for the three-match series against West Indies, which starts on Thursday at Edgbaston.Atkinson is the second injury withdrawal from the series after Jofra Archer was ruled out because of a thumb issue sustained playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL).Brydon Carse, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts and Luke Wood - who replaced Archer - are the other seam options.The ODIs are followed by three T20s, but Atkinson was not named in that squad.The one-day series against West Indies is Harry Brook's first as England's new white-ball captain.It could also have long-term implications for England's qualification for the 2027 World Cup.The top eight teams in the world rankings as of March 2027 will advance directly. England and the West Indies are currently eighth and ninth respectively.ODI: Harry Brook (c), Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Ben Duckett, Tom Hartley, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jamie Smith, Luke Wood.T20: Harry Brook (c), Rehan Ahmed, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler, Brydon Carse, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Saqib Mahmood, Jamie Overton, Matthew Potts, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Luke Wood.May29: First ODI, Edgbaston (d/n) (13:00 BST)June1: Second ODI, Cardiff (11:00 BST)3: Third ODI, The Kia Oval (d/n) (13:00 BST)6: First T20 international, Seat Unique Riverside, Chester-le-Street (d/n) (18:30 BST)8: Second T20 international, Seat Unique Stadium, Bristol (14:30 BST)10: Third T20 international, Utilita Bowl, Southampton (d/n) (18:30 BST)",
