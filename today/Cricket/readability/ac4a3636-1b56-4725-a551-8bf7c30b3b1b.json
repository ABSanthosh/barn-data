  "text": "Men's Twenty20: Scotland v Netherlands, ClydesdaleScotland 160-8: McCreath 40, Cross 33; Dutt 3-17Netherlands 121 (18.1): Levitt 36, Van Meekeren 20no; Sharif 2-13Scotland win by 39 runsScorecardScotland defeated the Netherlands by 39 runs in their opening T20 tri-series match in Glasgow.The hosts posted 160-8 and then dominated with the ball as the Dutch were all out for 121 in 18.1 overs.It was revenge for Scotland's defeat by the same opponents three days earlier in their remarkably high-scoring Cricket World Cup League 2 match in Dundee.Safyaan Sharif, Jack Jarvis and Mark Watt took two wickets each as the Scots, who face Nepal on Tuesday in their second match, defended their total with some comfort after a delayed start at Clydesdale Cricket Club.It was not all straightforward for the Scots, though.Netherlands' Aryan Dutt struck with the first balls of his second and third overs - wicketkeeper Scott Edwards stumping opener Watt and then taking a catch to account for Brandon McMullen - to leave the hosts on 23 for two as the tourists capitalised on their decision to field.George Munsey's 17-ball 30, which included three sixes and two fours, gave Scotland some momentum, but when he fell to Zach Lion-Cachet and Liam Naylor and Michael Leask soon followed, they were under pressure.However, Finlay McCreath and skipper Matthew Cross put on 57 for the sixth wicket before McCreath went for 40 and Cross joined him back in the pavilion for 33, with Dutt's three for 17 the pick of the Dutch team's bowling contributions.The Dutch reply got off to a positive start when opener Michael Levitt took 15 from McMullen's first over.However, Max O'Dowd and Lion-Cachet fell cheaply as they were reduced to 23 for two before skipper Edwards was run out for four with only 13 more having been added to the total.Levitt's departure for 36 in the ninth over left the Netherlands with a mountain to climb.When Jarvis dismissed Teja Nidamanuru and Roelof van der Merwe in quick succession, the cause looked forlorn and they were eventually able to muster only 121 as they were all out with 11 balls remaining.",
