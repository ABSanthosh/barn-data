Australia could seal the win in the morning session on Sunday, but won’t want the run chase getting out of hand given the tricks the Galle pitch played early on day three.It was a whirlwind day in sunny Sri Lanka, where Australia lost seven wickets for 84 in a little less than two hours as Prabath Jayasuriya (five for 151) weaponised the new ball. In reply, Nathan Lyon (three for 80) became only the third Australian to pass 550 Test wickets as the tourists pushed Sri Lanka to 81 for four, still 76 runs from drawing level.At that stage, Australia might have thought they would only need until the end of the day to complete a 2-0 series whitewash – a feat they haven’t achieved on the subcontinent since touring Bangladesh in 2006. But after tea, veteran Angelo Mathews (76) and Kusal partnered on a 70-run stand that erased an Australian lead built up by Steve Smith (131) and Alex Carey (156).After surviving some early punishment from Lyon, Mathews drove Matt Kuhnemann (four for 52) over long-off for six to bring up his half-century off 76 balls. Australia had no answers for the combination, with Steve Smith unsuccessfully turning to Mitch Starc and part-timer Cooper Connolly under the fading light.Beau Webster proved an unlikely hero, first diving low to dismiss Mathews when the veteran holed out to an ambitious slog sweep from Lyon’s bowling. Sri Lanka were into the bowlers when Webster swapped the medium pace of the first innings for the off-spin of earlier in his career. The towering Tasmanian enticed Ramesh Mendis into edging to short leg, and Sri Lanka’s hopes of a big total appeared a distant memory with the bowlers at the crease.Kuhnemann, Australia’s best bowler of the match, put Australia on course for victory when Jayasuriya (six) edged him to the slips on the final ball of the day.Earlier, Lyon joined Shane Warne (708) and Glenn McGrath (563) as one of only three Australians to reach 550 Test scalps when Dinesh Chandimal (12) hit him to a diving Webster. He is already on to 552 and all but guaranteed to overtake McGrath by the end of the calendar year.Kuhnemann continued a great series and had an immediate breakthrough skidding into the off-stump of Pathum Nissanka (eight) in the second over of the innings. The 100-match Test career of retiring opener Dimuth Karunaratne (14) ended when he edged Kuhnemann to Alex Carey, with the Australians lining up to applaud the 36-year-old as he left.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIn Australia’s innings, Jayasuriya had the big wickets of Carey (156) and Smith (131) within an hour after their 259-run stand that powered Australia into the ascendancy. Jayasuriya bowled Carey attempting his favourite reverse sweep after dismissing Smith caught behind on his way to a ninth five-wicket haul in Galle.First-Test centurion Josh Inglis (0), highly touted Connolly (four) and Webster (31) all missed out on big scores as Australia slipped from 330 for three to 414.
