  "text": "GMR Group have, as expected, secured a stake in Southern Brave to conclude the ECB's process of selling equity in the Hundred. GMR, co-owners of IPL team Delhi Capitals, were already the majority shareholders of host county Hampshire, having bought out former owner Rod Bransgrove last year.GMR Group, an Indian infrastructure conglomerate, owns teams in a number of T20 leagues around the world, including Delhi Capitals in the IPL and WPL, Dubai Capitals in the ILT20, Pretoria Capitals in the SA20, as well as being principal investors in MLC side Seattle Orcas.It brings the number of Hundred teams bought into by IPL owners to four, after Northern Superchargers (Sun Group), Manchester Originals (RPSG Group) and Oval Invincibles (Reliance). The ECB's hopes for a spread of investment from around the world had already been realised by deals for Birmingham Phoenix (Knighthead Capital), Welsh Fire (Sanjay Govil), London Spirit (Silicon Valley consortium) and Trent Rockets (Cain International).With more than £450 million raised and a total valuation approaching £1 billion, the Hundred equity sale has exceeded initial expectations and is set to deliver a signifcant windfall to the English game.GMR had become the first overseas owners of an English county when they agreed a deal for Bransgrove's majority shareholding last September. The acquisition did not guarantee a stake in Southern Brave, however, with a mechanism requiring GMR to pay fair market value for 49% of Brave before the ECB would sanction the remaining 51% being transferred to Hampshire.Brave won the inaugural men's Hundred in 2021, as well as finishing as runners-up last year. In the women's competition, they were twice runners-up, in 2021 and 2022, before lifting the trophy the following season.Glamorgan to sell Govil extra 1%Glamorgan have confirmed that they have entered into an exclusivity agreement with Sanjay Govil, the owner of MLC franchise Washington Freedom, at the start of talks to finalise Govil's investment in Welsh Fire. Glamorgan are planning to sell 1% of the 51% transferred by the ECB as Welsh Fire's host county, to \"create an equal ownership split\" with Govil.Glamorgan chair, Mark Rhydderch-Roberts, said: \"It was vitally important for us that any investment partner shared our values, our strategic and commercial aims and our ambition to grow as an international brand. Washington Freedom ticked all of the boxes and has been our preferred bidder for some time so we are delighted that they have chosen to partner with us.\"They share our belief that both Glamorgan and Welsh Fire have huge potential and that Welsh Fire, in particular, can become a global brand, opening commercial opportunities on a different scale across the whole spectrum of Welsh cricket.\"The growth of the global game and the role of the Hundred in engaging new audiences, transforming the Women's game and showcasing the best global talent means that we are really excited by the endless opportunities that this partnership will present to both parties.\"He said: \"I'm thrilled for this next step forward in renewing and expanding cricket for the next generation of fans. I'm looking forward to the benefits our partnership will have not only for recreational cricket in the United Kingdom, but for strengthening the cross-border relationship between international teams, franchises, and fans for years to come.\"",
