  "text": "Captain Ben Stokes backed his batters after another collapse condemned England to series defeat in Pakistan.England were dismissed for 112 on day three of the deciding third Test - their batters outclassed again in spinning conditions - as Pakistan completed a crushing nine-wicket victory before lunch to win the series 2-1.\"There is no doubt in my mind and no doubt in Brendon's mind [coach Brendon McCullum] that we have the got the best top six players in England,\" Stokes told Sky Sports.\"You always pick your best players.\"England began day three 24-3, still 53 runs behind Pakistan's first-innings score, but lost their last seven wickets in 17.4 overs amid a flurry of turning deliveries and poor strokes.Stokes' side began the series by scoring 823-7 declared on a flat pitch in their first-Test victory but since, when Pakistan have opted for spinning pitches, they have managed only 814 across four innings combined in two heavy defeats.\"The last couple of Tests we've been thrown some challenges and it's pretty easy to assess that were weren't able to stand up to those challenges,\" added Stokes.England's batting struggles leave number three Ollie Pope, who was out for one late on day two, the most vulnerable. He managed just 55 runs across the series at an average of 11, adding to a mixed year in Tests.Despite scoring three centuries, England's vice-captain is averaging 32 in 2024 - the lowest average of any player to have hit three hundreds in a calendar year in Test history.England's next Test against New Zealand begins on 27 November and McCullum suggested Pope, who captained in Stokes' absence during the first Test and against Sri Lanka during the home summer, will keep his place.\"What he did through the summer, stepping up with his captaincy and leadership and him stepping up into that role, even his 150 in that final Test match, we know when he gets in, he gets big scores and defining scores as well,\" said McCullum said.\"It's not an easy place to bat at number three. I know he'll be disappointed with the volume of runs in this series but I expect him to bounce back in New Zealand.\"We'll make sure he's got the required support to do so.\"The backing of Pope is a familiar trait of Stokes and McCullum's tenure, with a number of batters, notably opener Zak Crawley, retained despite a run of low scores. Crawley repaid England by averaging 53.33 in last year's Ashes series but has not managed a century since.He is viewed as a player who could perform well in Australia, where England travel for the next Ashes series in the winter of 2025-26.Stokes denied the current top six are certain of their place when the Ashes begins but was firm in their defence.\"You can't shut the door on everything,\" he said. \"Then you are being single-minded towards what you want to do.\"But back to what I said before, there is no doubt in my mind that we have the best top six batsmen in England.\"England are guaranteed to make one change to their batting line-up in New Zealand, with wicketkeeper Jamie Smith expected to miss part or all of the series for the birth of his first child.Essex wicketkeeperJordan Cox is in line to take Smith's place and he could put further pressure on Pope with a good series.Stokes himself struggled in Pakistan, with a top score of 37 across four innings. He was bizarrely dismissed lbw playing no shot as England's slump continued in Rawalpindi.\"I am always trying to evolve and adapt whether against spin or pace,\" he said.\"The disappointment is always there, it always hits hard, but when you have so much experience to fall back on it is a little bit easier to take.\"",
