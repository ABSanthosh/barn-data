What's truly heart-warming is seeing Indian fans follow emerging SA20 talents like Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Wiaan Mulder, and many others who've honed their skills in the competition. India remains a key market for SA20, and we'd love to see more fans travel to South Africa for the matches. They certainly won't be disappointed.\"\"The franchises are hard at work behind the scenes strategizing around their squads which will be confirmed at the auction on September 9. It's all systems go to welcome the best international and local players to our stage.\"The action continues on January 2nd, 2026, which will be celebrated in style at Boland Park with a mouth-watering Cape derby between Paarl Royals and neighbours MI Cape Town. Paarl Royals will be looking to continue their impressive record at home, after winning all five of their home matches last season.
