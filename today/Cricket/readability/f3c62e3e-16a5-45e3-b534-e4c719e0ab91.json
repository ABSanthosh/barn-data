  "text": "The World Test Championship is a \"shambles masquerading as a showpiece\", says Wisden editor Lawrence Booth.Writing in the 162nd edition of the yearly book, Booth also set his sights on the International Cricket Council (ICC).Booth questioned Jay Shah's promotion from Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary to ICC chairman in August - at a time when India were refusing to play Champions Trophy matches in the ICC-appointed host nation of Pakistan.\"The communal shrug [that met Shah's appointment] confirmed a sorry truth: 2024 was the year cricket gave up any claim to being properly administered, with checks, balances, and governance for the many, not the few,\" Booth wrote.\"India already had the monopoly: now they had hotels on Park Lane and Mayfair.\"Booth then turned his attention to the biennial WTC, suggesting the tournament should run across four years rather than two.The WTC cycle runs for two years, with teams playing six series during that period - three at home and three away - 12 points are awarded for winning a match, six for a tie and four for a draw.However, as teams play a different number of Tests across their six series, the table is ranked by percentage of points won.\"Among the first items in Shah's in-tray ought to be the World Test Championship, a shambles masquerading as a showpiece,\" Booth said. \"With teams playing a different number of matches against a different set of opponents, it requires a calculator to rank them, offending the first rule of thumb for any sporting endeavour: it must be easy to follow.\"The ICC cannot allow the championship to continue as if designed on the back of a fag packet. Double its length to four years, like football and rugby, and ensure the top nine in the rankings all play each other, home and away, over series of at least three Tests.\"The third edition of the WTC comes to a conclusion between 11-15 June, when South Africa face Australia at Lord's.",
