But a healthy win percentage has not saved him after failure in the biggest moments. Alongside the misery of the Ashes was a group-stage exit at last year’s T20 World Cup, brought on by a six-wicket defeat by West Indies.The high point of Lewis’s tenure was the 2023 Ashes, when England were victorious in four of the last five matches to win both white-ball series. But the trip to Australia a year and a half later made for an uncomfortable watch, culminating in a thumping innings defeat in the Test match at the MCG that included a drop-heavy display in the field. Speaking after that loss, Lewis claimed he was still “the right guy” to take England forward.But the tour also prompted Clare Connor, the ECB’s managing director of women’s cricket, to say there would be a “thorough and honest” post-series review. Lewis – part of England men’s coaching staff during their 4-0 Ashes defeat in 2021/22 – has fallen victim to it.
