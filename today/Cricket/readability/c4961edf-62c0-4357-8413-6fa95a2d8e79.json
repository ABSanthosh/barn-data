  "text": "Alex Hartley has been \"shocked\" at being given \"the cold shoulder\" by England players during the Women's Ashes because of comments the former spinner made about the team's fitness.Hartley, who is working as a pundit for the BBC and other television networks in Australia, says she was refused a TV interview by former England team-mate Sophie Ecclestone during the first T20 game on Monday.The 31-year-old questioned the fitness levels of some of England's players last autumn following their early exit from the T20 World Cup.\"I've been hung out to dry,\" Hartley, who retired as a player in 2023, told the BBC Test Match Special podcast.\"The reason I said England aren't as fit as Australia is because I want them to compete, I want them to be better and I want them to win. \"But I've been given the cold shoulder ever since - not by everyone, but a few individuals, coaches and players. They haven't looked at me.\"Defeat on Monday was England's fourth from four games in Australia, meaning they surrendered the Ashes at the earliest opportunity.England again dropped catches, as they did in being knocked out of last year's T20 World Cup at the hands of West Indies.Following that exit, Hartley said: \"About 80% of the England team are fit and athletic enough, but there are girls in that side who are letting the team down when it comes to fitness.\"Coach Jon Lewis responded by saying he did not believe that criticism was fair, adding that \"our players are very fit\".\"I'm surprised that people would say that, actually,\" he said. \"Fitness was absolutely nothing to do with us losing that game.\"\"Clearly I have upset them,\" Hartley, who was England's second-highest wicket-taker in their successful 2017 World Cup campaign, said on Monday.\"Jon Lewis has said there isn't a problem with fitness in his squad. They think I am wrong, which is fine - I'm entitled to my opinions and they are entitled to theirs. \"It is my job to say something that needs to be better and I did. The way I have been treated since I think has been totally unfair.\"The England and Wales Cricket Board was contacted by the BBC but did not wish to give a response.Hartley wrote on X on Tuesday: \"To be clear, there are some members of the England team who have been really disappointing, but by no means all.\"For some, friendships remain unchanged. For others, I've been shocked and surprised by their response.\"Analysis - BBC cricket reporter Ffion Wynne in AustraliaThe atmosphere has been frosty towards Hartley from certain England players since the beginning of this tour. This did not come totally out of the blue.She did not name any players in her initial comments about fitness, but the issue has clearly caused upset among some in the camp.We are still yet to hear from coach Jon Lewis. His position was already going to come under serious scrutiny before this saga, given the nature of their poor performances.Australia, meanwhile, will be lapping it up. The Australian public has witnessed England teams unravel Down Under before, most notably the men's side during the 2013-14 Ashes.Their heaviest defeat in a multi-format women's Ashes is a 12-4 scoreline and we are expected to hear from a member of their party at a media conference on Wednesday.The management will hope to get a grip of the situation before it unravels further.",
