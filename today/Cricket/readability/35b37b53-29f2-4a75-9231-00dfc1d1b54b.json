The Utilita Bowl celebrated switching on more than 1,000 solar panels before a T20 between England and Australia in September. David Mann, chief executive of the Utilita Bowl, used the initiative to highlight “our commitment to being the greenest international cricket venue”.The new five-team GSL tournament runs from 26 November to 6 December and, alongside the Australian state team Victoria, features the franchise sides Guyana Amazon Warriors, Lahore Qalandars and Rangpur Riders.ExxonMobil Guyana is its title sponsor, with the tournament website stating the event “has the full support of the Government of Guyana … the government sees the GSL as a key driver for tourism and economic growth”. ExxonMobil found oil in the country in 2015 and, this month, celebrated the production of 500m barrels from the Stabroek block.Etienne Stott, an Olympic gold medallist in 2012 who now campaigns for Extinction Rebellion, told the Guardian: “I’m really sad and angry that yet another sport is being corrupted by the oily money of the fossil fuel industry.”Stott said it was “perverse” for ExxonMobil to sponsor “a supposedly global cricket tournament in a country which is very much at risk from the effects of global heating.“I cannot understand why Hampshire [County] Cricket Club would risk reputational damage by associating itself with such an obvious sportswashing vehicle, especially given their public commitments to be more sustainable,” said Stott. “I hope cricket fans will demand that this tournament ditches its filthy sponsor.”Hampshire have declined to comment.Joe Cooke, an environmental campaigner and ex-professional cricketer for Glamorgan, said: “It’s disheartening to see cricket being sponsored and influenced by companies with such a direct link to the climate crisis. As a sport we are deeply at mercy to the environment with extreme weather events that have been made more likely by a changing climate, impacting the game at all levels. Cricket could be in a unique position to set a positive example by distancing itself from these kinds of partnerships.”ExxonMobil also sponsors the Amazon Warriors, who play in the Caribbean Premier League, and its involvement in cricket highlights the significant relationship between fossil fuel firms and the sport. In May the International Cricket Council announced a four-year extension to its partnership with Aramco, the Saudi Arabian oil company.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionChris Britt-Searle of The Next Test, a group aiming to raise awareness of the climate crisis’s impact on cricket, said: “It’s very easy to condemn individual teams, countries and competitions. But the truth is, the whole of cricket is awash with fossil fuel money.”Britt-Searle added that the tournament could be an “opportunity” for cricketers to discuss the involvement of fossil fuels in cricket, noting the recent letter signed by more than 100 female professional footballers urging Fifa to end its partnership with Aramco.“I would say to all cricketers, all cricket fans, clubs, cricket organisations, you have an opportunity to talk about this,” said Britt-Searle. “There’s a great opportunity here to put your hand up and say: ‘Look, we’re not OK with this.’”",
