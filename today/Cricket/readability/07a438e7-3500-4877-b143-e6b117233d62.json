But tons from Jack Wildermuth (111) and Jack Clayton (100) triggered a revival and the visitors made 445, a 269-run lead.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThat target seemed secure when SA lost three wickets inside the first hour of Saturday‚Äôs play. And it could have worse for the success-starved hosts: Sangha, on 13 and the score 37 for 3, was dropped by Ben McDermott at second slip from the bowling of Mark Steketee (3-40).The elegant right-hander then flourished, reaching his century from 158 balls and hitting 16 fours and two sixes overall.Two overs later, Carey saluted an increasingly raucous home crowd on completing his fourth ton in five Shield matches this season. Carey‚Äôs stellar 132-ball knock ended soon after when bowled by a Steketee slower ball with 40 runs still required for victory.First-innings century-maker Lehmann, the son of SA great Darren Lehmann who played in the state‚Äôs last Shield triumph in 1995-96, was bowled for eight, and Liam Scott was dismissed for a duck.That left Sangha, fittingly, to score the winning runs through midwicket with a stroke that instantly entered SA sporting folklore.",
