From just before the halfway mark, it has been Root and Brook unbroken, their union 243. Along the way, the former captain secured both his 35th Test ton and went past Alastair Cook’s run-scoring record for England. When he reaches the top of those stairs one final time, he’s greeted by his appreciative colleagues. As for Brook – he just loves this country: in four Tests in Pakistan, he has four tons. And you sense that it’s the junior player in this partnership who could unload tomorrow morning to thrust England into the lead (they trail by 64) and from there, try and set up the game. Righto, that’s enough from me. Thanks so much for your company, we’ll be back tomorrow. Bye!STUMPS: 492-3101st over: England 492-3 (Root 176, Brook 141) Jamal to Root, square driving for one to the sweeper at point – he hobbles through, hoping surely that Brook does the rest. There might be one there when Brook drives hard to mid-off and there’s a bobble but Root throws the hand up – no run there, mate. Quite fair. One last lap for Root, 22 yards to travel, from the final ball of the day that Brook pulled behind square. And… relax!The first Test in Multan is into its 250th over... Joe Root has spent eight balls off the field so far— Matt Roller (@mroller98) October 9, 2024 100th over: England 490-3 (Root 175, Brook 140) Shaheen bangs it in and Root rocks back to hook fine rather than wasting an opportunity to score by getting under it – sums the guy up. Down the other end, he’s stretching that right leg right away. I wonder how much weight he’s lost today? When we were in Chittagong in 2017, Pete Handscomb lost eight kilos in four hours – a horrible day, that. Formula One drivers lose about that too when racing. Root’s recovery will be so important tonight. Shaheen’s final ball of the day, the last of the 100th over, is also worked behind square by Root for one.99th over: England 486-3 (Root 173, Brook 138) Aamer Jamal, he’s your guy for something unexpected. Watch him here, a double-wicket maiden before the close. Sure, not this over, but he’ll get one more before stumps – back him in. Meanwhile, Brook is still looking to score and clearly not playing for stumps, leaping at a chance to drive, only cut off by the bowler’s boot in his follow-through. Two more overs left.Stephen Nicholls comes full circle before the close. “Regarding the tea-time heckle about Hutton’s hundredth hundred - I recommend Steve reads Pat Murphy’s excellent book The Centurions. A cover drive for four off Owen Waite was the stroke to bring up that particular landmark. Thanks for the coverage.” There we go! Thanks for reading.98th over: England 483-3 (Root 173, Brook 135) Shaheen! Didn’t see that coming. One final burst with 14 minutes until the close. Nasser tells us that the last time an England player batted the whole day was Root at Galle in 2021. In a way, I’m surprised by that as it isn’t that unusual, but it reflects the way this England team have gone about their batting since 2022. Root is really leaning on his splice now as the bowler arrives but he does what he must to get through. A chance to drive presents itself from the final ball of the over but he times it straight back to the big quick in his follow through.I said Gary Naylor’s comment was the last on cramping but I’ll take one more from Kevin Cassingham as it’s a fair response: “I’m not sure tennis players would avoid cramp so well if they were wearing pads and only drinking once every half an hour!”Another stretching session for Root between overs. There’s not a lot he can do other than go through the process. Daniel Couzens brings to my attention that there has been only one maiden for the entire innings of 97 overs – the fifth. He wants to know the longest run in Tests without a maiden… I’ve no idea how to calculate that! Anyone?Another poser from Showbizguru while asking the audience: “Don’t want to tempt fate but when was the last time two double tons were scored in a single innings?”Here’s the list of every double ton in First Class history. I adore this list; visit it often.97th over: England 481-3 (Root 172, Brook 134) Naseem wants another crack at Brook and his enthusiasm is demonstrated by a no-ball first up, one where Brook gets off strike with a tuck. Root’s turn and he plays to mid-on and wheels away with cramp for the umpteenth time. “I foretell a quiet night in for Joe,” notes Gower on telly. Indeed.“Quite clearly,” writes Will in Guyana, “Joe and Harry are England’s best R\u0026B act in years, perhaps ever,” Very good. I suspect, however, Coldplay is more their vibe.96th over: England 478-3 (Root 171, Brook 134) Root has faced 261 balls. To think he’s done that after over five sessions in the field, in this heat. It’s bonkers. He and Brook have now put on 229 and England trail by 78. We have 25 minutes now before the cut-off, we we’ll fall about eight overs short of the allocation. But as Nasser says, some days over rates are about the batters needing help to stay out there and this has been that.95th over: England 476-3 (Root 170, Brook 133) Wow, Brook just walks at Naseem and thumps him through cover like it’s not even a thing. It very much is a thing. Brutal.94th over: England 471-3 (Root 169, Brook 129) Abrar settles after a rough first over back into the attack, giving up two singles but re-locating his line and length. “An absolutely phenomenal piece of concentration from Joe Root,” writes Roger Bolstridge. “To be in the field for all but eight balls of this Test Match in such energy-sapping conditions shows us what a talent we are witnessing and shows that playing proper cricket shots coupled with the talent of exhibition players like Crawley, Duckett and Brook(who has played a fabulous innings) can move a game forward and give England a chance to win this Test even on this docile pitch.”A huge chance. If they can re-set tomorrow, there’s a chance they can bat once and bat enormous, leaving 100+ overs to take the final ten wickets. It comes back to the point about the way the McCullum/Stokes blueprint helps open games that are otherwise shut. A few years ago, there’s no route to victory from where they were 25 hours ago.93rd over: England 469-3 (Root 168, Brook 128) They’re really flat on TV now, talking about scenarios where Pakistan can save the game. “They’d love a draw at this stage,” says Ramiz Raja. This is all before the leg before that doesn’t do their way. Another appeal follows, a very similar delivery… inside edge! Shan keeps his cool and doesn’t send it upstairs with the review he retained from the previous umpire’s call.UMPIRE’S CALL! Root survives. Brutal for Naseem and Pakistan. That was taking the off bail; had Dharmasena given it out, the man with 168 to his name was gone. Not to be.IS ROOT LBW? Not out on the field despite Naseem’s pleading. Upstairs we go!92nd over: England 468-3 (Root 168, Brook 127) Abrar returns. The poor fella, hour after hour, nothing going his way. And whaddyaknow, it’s a full toss with his first ball back into the attack, put away with easy by Root through midwicket. He misses his length later in the over to Brook too, who monsters him inside-out through cover for four more. They’re getting stuck the leggie on TV now, 0/170 from 33 are his brutal figures.Gary Naylor started the chat on cramping some hours ago so he gets the last word.“I’m sure there’s much in Will Vignoles’ points (but they worked equally hard in different ways in the 70s, 80s and 90s) but the issue remains as to why tennis players can play back-to-back five-setters during seven-match fortnights and Grand Tour cyclists can ride on the edge of the red zone for 21 days, half of which require three mountains to be climbed, but cricketers are not being helped sufficiently by their fitness regimes to deal with this sport’s demands? Dennis Waight revolutionised players’ training two generations ago - we might need his successor to do the same now, as this climate isn’t going to get any easier.”91st over: England 456-3 (Root 162, Brook 121) England now trail by an even 100 with this partnership swelling to 207 from 209 balls by the end of this Naseem over. The highlight was another Root pull shot, once again seeming to predict the short ball was coming and he was there waiting on the back foot – nobody is stopping that. To think, for all the bad cramp he was experiencing earlier a double ton is now in the frame.“I think Will Vignoles is quite right,” emails Richard Adams. “The physical intensity of the game these days is so much greater than it was that it is almost like a different game. When I started watching in the 60s not only was batting so much slower but in the field there were players who struggled to bend over to pick the ball when it came straight at them, never mind sprinting thirty yards and diving full-length.”Good point - you don’t often see fast bowlers fielding with their boots anymore.Will is back with me, by the way: “Meant to say earlier, but how has there been all this talk of cramp without anyone bringing up Mark Richardson’s agonised shriek against India - up there with Ben Stokes or Liam Livingstone’s many box-strikes for stump mic gold.”A classic! I mentioned the Glenn Maxwell book before (yes, I’ll talking about that a fair bit between now and Christmas) and the chapter on his 201… I found it quite amusing that he thought of Mark Richardson as he was going, as it was dubbed, Full Salmon.90th over: England 450-3 (Root 157, Brook 120) SLAM! Brook is allowed to free his arms and does so with delight, hammering Shaheen through cover for four. Seven more off the over without much happening from Shaheen’s end other than one delivery that goes past the edge thanks to an extra bit of bounce. A lot riding on Naseem here.“Hi Adam.” Asif Hussain, welcome. “Like many who will be reading your excellent OBO, I’ve wasted countless hours playing International Cricket Captain...well here are Joe Roots stats on my game in a few years from now...safe to say he’ll smash Tendulkar’s record if this is anything to go by!”I’ve never worked out how to link attachments here but Asif has Root getting to 18,153 runs in 198 Tests with 55 tons. Lovely. At least nudge him over the line for 200!89th over: England 443-3 (Root 157, Brook 113) Brook drives a couple out into the expanses of the offside – a well-timed push, nothing more. He finishes the over with a couple to the other side of the ground, using the swing to his advantage. They’ve added 57 runs in the last ten overs and now only trail by 113. Pakistan needs the sun to set.A highlight from earlier – Joe Root bringing up Test ton No35:88th over: England 438-3 (Root 155, Brook 110) A long, old drinks break. In theory, we have 23 overs to come but we won’t get anything like that in reality – some camera angles from the ground show that the sun has just about setting. Shaheen to Root, who is driving out through cover for three – how he would’ve loved avoiding those 60-odd yards of sprinting! Brook keeps the strike with a dab behind point. Naseem looks the more dangerous of the Pakistan seamers. Maybe Jamal to replace Shaheen?“I’ll do some maths on Harry Brook’s likelihood of surpassing Root’s total.” Go for it, Mike Jakeman. “So far, Brook is averaging around 85 runs a Test. If Root retired at 13,000 runs (he won’t), Brook would need another 11,400 runs (approx) to go past him. At his current, excellent scoring rate, this would require another 134 Tests. If we assume he plays ten Tests a year, he’d have to keep going until he was 38 and a bit. Given the outlook for Test cricket over the next 15 years, franchise options etc, I’m going to say it won’t happen. And that doesn’t diminish my enjoyment of either player one bit.”Always enjoy a long-term projection. Back in 2015, in one of the very first episodes of The Final Word (we’re up to 1100-odd now), Geoff Lemon and I charted a course for Nathan Lyon to go past Warne. It was done purely for laughs, not at all seriously. Well, he’s on 530 wickets now and wants to play until at least the 2027 Ashes. He should pass Warne from there with all things being equal and he stays at peak fitness.“I always thought 556 looked a bit cheap on this pitch,” says Paul Griffin. “880 is par I reckon.” We made similar points in Pakistan in 2022 but I remind you that these Tests can speed up for a fielding team if they can get something going. But yes, right now, that feels a lot way off unless the cramp gets to either of these two Yorkshire stars.Joe Root gets to 150 in style!87th over: England 434-3 (Root 152, Brook 109) Naseem to Root with the new ball and he’s able to lean into a stunning cover drive, away for four to bring up his 150. That might be his best shot of them all – a joy to watch, always. Ohhhh and Naseem nearly castles Brook later int he over! He leaves the one that comes back on the basis of length – a bold play in Pakistan, as Ian Ward notes on TV – and it just clears the off bail. Drinks!“Hello Adam.” Allo again, Krishnamoorthy V. “What must Pope be thinking for getting out on a duck and then seeing all other batsmen scoring 70-plus. Must rankle more as he had to come in only because Duckett could not open.” It was the most eventful little passage of the Test when Root’s bouncer (yes!) damaged Duckett’s thumb.Simon McMahon is with us too: “Hi Adam. I’m looking forward to that Scotland v England game in Sharjah. Hopefully it will be closer than the ODI in 2001. Though I think there’s more chance of a result here than there is of Scotland winning on Sunday.”The slow pitches and spongey outfield in Sharjah suggest to me we are bound to see a huge upset there before the group stage is done. Do yourself a favour and listen to Daniel Norcross and Cam Ponsonby with their daily recaps of the Women’s World Cup. 86th over: England 429-3 (Root 147, Brook 109) They have taken the second new ball! Shaheen gets the first crack with it. Not a lot going on pace-wise but there’s some movement back towards the right-handers, which Brook uses to guide a single behind square. Root plays his trademark behind point dab for one run of his own later on.“Adam.” Simon Thomas, hello. “Interesting to read about the bottle bought for Alastair Cook by Graham Gooch and whether he should drink it with Joe Root. Apparently, in the thespian world, there is a tradition of passing on a bound copy of Hamlet from actor to actor, to only be held by the greatest Hamlet of the day. It’s apparently held by Tom Hiddleston and was passed on to him by Kenneth Branagh. So I guess that Cook should buy a bottle for Joe who can then drink it with whoever beats if record (in anyone does that is – most likely that no one will).”You never know, he might be batting with him at the moment.85th over: England 427-3 (Root 146, Brook 108) “They surely have to take the second new ball before it is too late?” says Mike Atherton upon taking up lead commentary on TV. He goes on to note that if they can open this up with a couple of wickets, “they are still in front of the game.” I just can’t see what the downside is at this point with two world-class quicks Shaheen and Naseem as fresh as they can be after a day in the dirt. Instead, it’s Abrar again for his millionth over on the trot, only three taken off it.“Interesting to watch Abrar tease the England batsmen with his legside line in the almost vain hope of getting the ball to turn out of the bowlers’ footmarks,” emails Colum Fordham. “However, on another point with Root trying to reverse sweep the bowler, I agree with Ravi Ashwin’s point that in this case the batsman should be given out LBW if the ball is going to hit the stumps. Because it’s no longer a blind spot and the batsman is playing front-on.”You’re hearing this more and more and I reckon they’ll take a good look at it.Harry Brook brings up his 6th Test ton!84th over: England 424-3 (Root 144, Brook 107) How this guy loves batting in Pakistan – his fourth ton here in as many Tests there. He gets to the milestone with a gentle cut past point, from his 118th delivery. Eight fours and the six from the previous over along the way. The degree of difficulty here wasn’t the highest he’ll experience – his best knock in Test cricket was the 75 he made on the final day at Leeds last year in a crucial fourth-innings chase – but you’ve still gotta get ‘em. With the milestone dealt with, he’s down the track to Shakeel later in the over to drive him through cover with more perfect timing for four more. England only trail by 132 with 26 overs still to come today.Hats off to Harry. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images83rd over: England 414-3 (Root 142, Brook 99) From 92 to 98 with a magnificent straight six! Brook leaps at Abrar, turns his offering into a half-volley, and launches it over his head. That’s a special shot. And by the end of the over, he’s up to 99. So much for keeping it relatively quiet with the old ball – they have to pull the trigger here.82nd over: England 406-3 (Root 141, Brook 92) Saud Shakeel gets his first crack of the innings – Pakistan’s seventh bowler. He bowls pretty useful left-arm tweakers, keeping the stumps in play from around the wicket. They are debating the new ball on TV – the risk/reward of likely quicker scoring, but the chance to break the stand. Meanwhile, Brook is taking easy singles in the 90s – put some pressure on the guy!“Hi Adam.” Hello, Will Vignoles. “If there is an increase in batters cramping, might it counter-intuitively be because of how fit they are these days? Maybe I’m misremembering from when I started watching test cricket 20 years ago as a kid, but batters these days hit the ball much harder and also look to score off more balls - they might not get as much in-innings rest as their predecessors. As noted by everyone watching him bat, Joe Root is a busy player - he’s always looking to turn the strike over, and as a prolific sweeper of the ball is always going up and down. All of which is to say, his legs in particular get a real workout, and that must take a toll in hot and humid conditions. Also, I seem to remember Arsene Wenger talking about how modern footballers were like delicate machines - at the peak of physical fitness, but everything was tuned in a delicate balance which meant that they were more susceptible to wear and tear. Not sure if there’s anything in it but interesting all the same.”I was thinking about this recently – in very simple terms, why is it that pro athletes seem to be pick up more injuries than normal people? These factors are likely relevant.81st over: England 402-3 (Root 139, Brook 90) Ahhhhh, so theyu didn’t take it right away. Is this damage limitation because England had a (marginally!) quieter run since tea? Is there a play here about leaving it until the final act of the day before bad light intervenes? Poor old Abrar, then. And guess what? It’s the most expensive over in a long time: Brook sweeping a powerful boundary and two more twos, with another brace couple from the line of the off stump when driving out to cover. Ten off, which takes the partnership to 150 from 187 balls together. Take the new ball. Take the new ball. 400 up!80th over: England 392-3 (Root 139, Brook 80) Agha Salman gets over number 80 with his offies, trying to shake things up for an over before the tempo changes with Shaheen and Naseem. He’s around the wicket, Root is carving then reversing – no concerns. Surely they will immediately take the second new ball available to them…The Spin column is up! Raf Nicholson on Scotland’s women. They’re a great story.79th over: England 386-3 (Root 134, Brook 79) At last, Abrar’s marathon spell can come to an end with the second new ball coming. He’s bowled 29 wicketless and maidenless overs, 0/137 his analysis. Four of those came in this over from outside the leg stump.78th over: England 382-3 (Root 132, Brook 78) Shot! Root must sense the short ball is coming right away from Jamal after his error in the previous over so he’s camped on the back foot ready to pull and makes no mistake, hammering behind square for four.“In reply to your question regarding the link between Clem Hill, Warwick Armstrong and Victor Trumper,” writes Steve Hudson, “was the link that they all missed the 1912 tour of England because they were in dispute with the Australian Cricket Board?”They were certainly three of the Big Six. Nearly led to the selector being tossed out the window when he got into a punch-on with Hill. Always interested by that era.An email from Andrew Goudie insists only Grace can be considered as England’s finest. Suggests nobody can overtake him? Not sure about that. But again, with the enduring caveat that generational comparisons are purely for fun and not to be taken seriously.77th over: England 376-3 (Root 127, Brook 77) Root tries to switch hit Abrar but doesn’t connect. Penny for his thoughts out there with the new ball around the corner. Two singles come, with the leggie setting it further and further outside the leg stump.“I am so here for this,” writes Mark Oliver of my Sutcliffe nomination for England’s finest. “I have had 2 dogs named Hobbs and Herbie after these two great batsmen Hobbs was The Master. Sutcliffe was the consummate dedicated professional who never gave his wicket away. I think Hobbs is the sexier choice because he was a more exciting batsman (and his weight of runs as well!). I base all this on John Arlott’s amazing biography ‘Profile of the Master’ - which as a sport-crazed kid gave me the best role model I could hope for!” Love that. Childhood books carry extra weight!76th over: England 374-3 (Root 126, Brook 76) Oh no! Aamer Jamal hits Brook’s middle stump but the bails don’t come off! It’s via the bat, plenty of backspin from a defensive shot, collecting his boot and rolling back… but still. Jamal is having a real crack here, earning a top edge from Root the ball before from a delivery that got up higher than the century-maker was anticipating, but there’s nobody at square leg. It feels like the game has shifted just a little bit since tea with both batters struggling and starting to make small mistakes. Pakistan have to stay with it here. One wicket before the second new ball in four overs time and the game could speed up, which is a key ingredient of winning matches in this country: making the most of the busy times when they come.John Jones on the pitch: “After the series two years ago you have to question why Pakistan would prepare another feathered against this England batting line up? Far better to prepare a raging turner from day one and make it a lottery, at least it would make for more interesting cricket.”The challenge is that the pitches in Pakistan don’t have those characteristics. It might be next door to India but the surfaces are so different – like concrete slabs.75th over: England 370-3 (Root 125, Brook 74) Another cry of caaaaaaatch from Abrar when Brook sweeps in the direction of backward square. He isn’t in complete control of the shot but the ball never looks destined to go to hand. Root defends the rest.“What a player Root is, an all-timer, Adam.” Not wrong, Guy Hornsby. “And how far he’s come since the (relative) downward curve after the first ‘Big Four’ conversations. It feels a really long time ago that people were saying it was only a Big Three, now he’s run off into the distance past all of them in Test cricket, and who knows where it’ll end? It’s absolutely not fanciful that he could get close to Sachin. Most of all he’ll be burning to succeed in Australia and get that ton, which I dearly hope he does. But it’s also beautiful seeing these two in the middle. Joe’s got lots of summers yet but this does feel like a passing of a baton, too, from one Yorkshireman to another. Because who knows where Brook will end up, but it’s his world for the next decade, too. We’re lucky to have them.”Root in Australia next winter will be fascinating. Per my comment earlier, you still get people who sincerely think he’s rubbish and a bully because he hasn’t made a ton in Australia. Not from serious people, but those who see that as something to whack him with. Of course, he’ll be aware of this as anyone. Some way off, but can’t wait.Harry Brook stoops low for a sweep shot. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images74th over: England 369-3 (Root 125, Brook 73) Aamer Jamal is bending is back but there’s just nothing there for him. When he’s a touch wide, Brook steers a couple then plays safely past gully for one to keep strike. It’s Brook who is stretching out between overs this time in a way that suggests he might be cramping up too. A bit going on.“It’s already probably been mentioned but is there a dress code for the media at the match?” asks Richard Slassor. “Everyone is in white shirt/blouse and black trousers.”I’ve not been to Multan, which is a more conservative area, so maybe? Certainly wasn’t when we were in Pindi, Karachi and Lahore in 2022. That was a great tour with Australia back for the first time since 1998. Hoping to get back for the Champions Trophy.73rd over: England 366-3 (Root 125, Brook 70) Six off Abrar, all in 1s and 2s. And that means that despite only going for a few overs since tea, the England staff are out there with Joe Root for a pit stop between overs. Athers builds on Nasser’s point from before tea about whether he should retire hurt. It’s not a crazy thought.72nd over: England 360-3 (Root 121, Brook 68) My man Aamer Jamal gets a crack – everything about this bloke is impressive to me. I had the great pleasure of commentating on his debut series in Australia late last year and the guys just does not quit. In other words, just what Pakistan need right this moment. He’s full to Brook straight away who drives with total ease dead straight off the back foot for two. It prompts a conversation on telly where Nasser asks Gower who the best player he’s ever seen for England. He rattles off a handful of names from across the eras. Athers makes that point – it’s impossible to judge across decades, but Root’s record is formidable.What about Herbert Sutcliffe? You could argue he was lucky to have his pro career wedged between the wars but because of WW1 he didn’t get to play a Test until he was 30. From there, he became the first player ever to reach 16 tons, averaged nearly 61, and was on cusp of getting a recall in 1939 at age 45. I know Hobbs is the sexier choice due to his sheer weight of tons, but if we’re playing that game. Oh, and 151 First Class tons with more than 50,000 runs at that level. Okay, okay - I’ll stop.71st over: England 356-3 (Root 120, Brook 65) England back to doing as they have all innings, five runs in the first over after the break. This is helped by three byes right away – it’s always difficult for ‘keepers when batters miss a sweep, as Brook did here. A friend, who knows his onions, got in touch at tea lamenting that this might be drifting a bit compared to Stokes-led teams. My counter is that England might well lead tonight, which would be staggering given Pakistan made 556 and were batting until deep into the final session on day two. Brook is so well suited to a situation just like this.The players are back! I’ve got a cuppa. 40 overs to come, if the light holds.“Good evening Adam.” Phil Withall, great to see your name in my inbox. “With regards to Yorkshire’s finest, Mr Joe Root. I have been advised by a selection of Australians that he is not worthy of comparison with Steve Waugh or Ricky Ponting. I’m slightly confused by this, only slightly because Australians tend not to acknowledge English cricketers. Surely his achievements are at least comparable with theirs, and surely their achievements are inferior to Bradman’s? Is the whole comparative analysis of cricketers pointless? There are so many subjective variables involved. Also this email is surely as pointless as the any comparison of cricketers past and present, I just get irritated by petty parochialism...”I’ve learned, as an Australian who has lived here for a long time, that there’s almost nothing the England team can do that will be regarded as worthwhile from a considerable percentage of fans from my homeland. Just how it is. Also works in reverse, of course, with football-badge-in-the-bio types on twitter who still get very excited discussing sandpaper despite following cricket for about six weeks a year.Some emails? Why not. In relation to a discussion before I arrived, here’s Steve. “The ‘tireless Stephen Nichols’ (54th over) still has work to do, I’m afraid. I don’t know the answer myself, but the question of whether Len Hutton reached one hundred hundreds via an on drive is definitely not through cutting Fleetwood-Smith, the Aussie spinner who retired in 1940. That comment refers to Hutton’s 364 record score in 1938. He reached one hundred hundreds in 1951 against Surrey - or so says Wikipedia…”That shouldn’t be difficult to solve from the cricketarchive card. Volunteer for that?“Favourite threesomes” is the title of Brian Withington’s email! Hooley dooley, is this the OBO or an episode of Industry? Anyway, back to my great OBO pal. “Earlier today Alastair Cook was quoted as suggesting that he might in due course celebrate the Joe Root record with him by opening the bottle that Graham Gooch had bought him when SAC had passed the latter’s record. I’d love to eavesdrop that occasion but I wonder what other nominations there might be for favourite ‘fly on the wall‘ threesomes of three players (living or otherwise) who share some common history?”Nice topic. I’ll go with, say… Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and Warwick Armstrong.Robin Kellett-Navellou has a song to replace the Rooooooot chant. To Joelene:“Joe Root, Joe Root, Joe Root, Joe Roooooooooooot, I’m begging of you, please don’t stop your thing Joe Root, Joe Root, Joe Root, Joe Roooooooooot, One of England’s finest, cricket’s king”Last one for now – I need a cuppa myself. Krishnamoorthy V, good morning. “As there is virtually no chance of a result inside 5 days for this batting marathon to end, should such Tests become ambitious and reduce such high scoring matches to be decided by a single innings. That will bring in some spice to an otherwise a meandering draw.”I don’t agree with this. Part of what England do, whether you love or loathe it, is inject time back into the game by going at 5 an over, as they have here. There’s time.Another superb session for the visitors. It finished with Root and Brook raising their 100 partnership, up to 102 from 123 balls. The only wicket to fall was Duckett, who got a good one from Aamer Jamal on 84 (75 balls!), trapped leg before. 119 runs in a session that lasted just 25 overs, which leaves 40 after the break. With England 205 behind… they could even be in the black by stumps, which is wild. Oh, and Joe Root completed his 35th Test ton between lunch and tea after overtaking Alastair Cook’s England run-scoring record before the long break. Just another day for this all-time great.TEA: England 351-370th over: England 351-3 (Root 119, Brook 64) With six balls left until the break, Shan Masood does as every captain feels they must and throws the ball to a new bowler. Saim Ayub’s off spin isn’t going to get turned into a youtube highlight reel, worked away for five risk-free runs like we’re watching the 32nd over of an ODI. And that’s tea! 69th over: England 346-3 (Root 118, Brook 60) Abrar has the chance to yell ‘caaatch’ himself this over when Brook sweeps, but it ends up down at long-on out the middle of the bat. Excuse the cliche: he does hit the ball in unusual places. Earlier in the over, Root clipped a couple to midwicket then raced through for another single in that direction.Emil Fortune has sent me some research on how far cricketers run in each position ont he field. I’ll take a look at it when the tea break arrives – you can too.68th over: England 341-3 (Root 115, Brook 58) Caaaaatch! The cry goes out from Naseem, giving it everything here at Root when banging it in short enough and quick enough to earn a hooked top edge… but it doesn’t carry to the man at deep backward square as he hoped, instead tricking over the rope. He’s now four overs into his spell and that might be it, despite how many challenging questions he’s asked so far.67th over: England 335-3 (Root 110, Brook 57) Abrar to these two – sweep, sweep, sweep – three added without any drama whatsoever. They’ve now put on 86.“Is it me, or is this turning into a ChatGPT version of any recent England innings?” asks Peter Salmon. “Pope going for 0, Crawley out in the 70s, Duckett failing to turn an 80 into a ton and Root serenely getting three figures. I expect Brook to be out for a beautifully fluent 60-odd, Smith to make 38-ish, and Woakes to make a good 26.”Interviewed Duckett during the one-day series (not out yet) and he said how frustrating it was getting out for scores like today all summer. He’d be furious to cop that when he did having played so masterfully today. But yes, Big Fish, your point is a fair one.66th over: England 332-3 (Root 108, Brook 56) Naseem is bowling a controlled line trying to nick them off but they are both able to play behind point without too much trouble at this stage – two singles to begin. A touch fuller to Root, who square drives out to point for three… that wouldn’t be fun on legs that are cramping. I spent a lot of time as part of the Glenn Maxwell book process (pre-order now, out on 30 October!) talking with him about the cramp he had in the absurd 201 not out he made in Mumbai last year. It led to him having something of a panic attack on the field. I reckon sometimes we think of cramp as something akin to being hit in the box – something to almost laugh at. But when your legs don’t work anymore, it’s a daunting prospect.“Hi Adam.” Hello, Harry Lang. “I’m delighted for Root on reaching his milestones, and great to hear Cook was straight on the phone offering his applause - as of course he would be. How far can Root go from here? The magic appears to be in how much he enjoys himself. Apart from the stern-faced purgatory of his captaincy period, he still looks like an impish schoolboy scrumping apples as he purrs yet another cover drive towards the ropes. Long may he continue to have fun, as it’s a joy and privilege to watch. Best regards from a damp Cotswolds.”Well, he’s up to 12,510 runs and Sachin finished with 15,921. So, can he keep ticking over at about this rate for about four more years? It’s a huge ask. If he can, then the tons record (Tendulkar 51 v Root 35) will probably go as well. Dare to dream, sports fans.65th over: England 326-3 (Root 103, Brook 55) Abrar around the wicket to two set men relies on one of them losing their head. They don’t here, milking three singles.Interesting point from Nasser on telly flagging the possibility of Root retiring hurt given he’s clearly suffering out there in this heat. Remember too, he only missed eight balls in the middle for the whole match. I don’t think it’ll happen, but still. Gary Naylor has thoughts on this. “Do you (or anyone in the OBO Massive) know why players cramp up so often these days?” he asks. “For 30 years or so, I neither saw nor heard of it, but now it seems almost de rigeur after a few hours in the sun. With so many Strength and Conditioning staff (slightly worrying phrase that) with hands-on roles home and abroad, hi-tech gels to wolf down and drinks breaks on demand, you would think things would be getting better rather than worse. Imagine if they bowled 90 overs per day!”I don’t want to get into a conversation about climate change on the OBO but I’d urge you to take a look at the Hit For Six report from 2019 to get a sense of just how different the game often is now even compared to 10 or 20 years ago. That has to be playing a role.",

He gets to the milestone with a gentle cut past point, from his 118th delivery. Eight fours and the six from the previous over along the way. The degree of difficulty here wasn’t the highest he’ll experience – his best knock in Test cricket was the 75 he made on the final day at Leeds last year in a crucial fourth-innings chase – but you’ve still gotta get ‘em.

Maybe I’m misremembering from when I started watching test cricket 20 years ago as a kid, but batters these days hit the ball much harder and also look to score off more balls - they might not get as much in-innings rest as their predecessors. As noted by everyone watching him bat, Joe Root is a busy player - he’s always looking to turn the strike over, and as a prolific sweeper of the ball is always going up and down. All of which is to say, his legs in particular get a real workout, and that must take a toll in hot and humid conditions. Also, I seem to remember Arsene Wenger talking about how modern footballers were like delicate machines - at the peak of physical fitness, but everything was tuned in a delicate balance which meant that they were more susceptible to wear and tear. Not sure if there’s anything in it but interesting all the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about this recently – in very simple terms, why is it that pro athletes seem to be pick up more injuries than normal people?

It’s absolutely not fanciful that he could get close to Sachin. Most of all he’ll be burning to succeed in Australia and get that ton, which I dearly hope he does. But it’s also beautiful seeing these two in the middle. Joe’s got lots of summers yet but this does feel like a passing of a baton, too, from one Yorkshireman to another.
