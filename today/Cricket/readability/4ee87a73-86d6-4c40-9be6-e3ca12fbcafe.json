Nicholas Pooran, still the No. 1, has gone past the 300-run mark after his latest hit: 61 in 34 balls against GT. He is at 349 runs now.Yesterday's No. 2, B Sai Sudharsan, remains today's No. 2, but breached the 300-run mark even before Pooran with his 37-ball 56. So, for a while on Saturday afternoon, we had a new No. 1 as Sai Sudharsan went past Pooran before Pooran snatched the cap back. Sai Sudharsan is at 329 runs, just 20 behind Pooran.Mitchell Marsh, unfortunately, didn't get a go against GT since his daughter is unwell, but remains in third spot with 265 runs.Shardul Thakur added two wickets to his kitty on Saturday, and that has brought him right back into the top three, at No. 2, with 11 wickets, just one behind the leader, Noor Ahmad.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
