This will be Pakistan's first 50-over game since the Champions Trophy 2025, where they were embarrassingly knocked out in the group stage. Pakistan were demolished 4-1 by New Zealand in the recently-concluded T20I series. New Zealand, on the other hand, finished runners-up in the Champions Trophy. Despite missing several key players like Kane Williamson, Mitchell Santner and Rachin Ravindra, they will be the favourites to win the series. (LIVE SCORECARD) Topics mentioned in this article",
