And someone like Chris Woakes, who has played a lot of Test cricket in different conditions against different teams, he’s someone who brings a level of calmness to a group of bowlers.”Jacob Bethell during England’s recent white-ball series against West Indies. Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockThe absence of Broad and Anderson has also been the subject of discussion in the India camp. “It feels so good when both of them are not there,” said their vice-captain, Rishabh Pant. “They’ve been there for England for so many years, but at the same time they have enough ammunition as a bowling lineup. We’ve got to play our cricket and respect the bowlers and the opposition.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionAfter the recent retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma this is a new-look India side, now captained by Shubman Gill. “Obviously it’s a new start for us. Definitely big people have left. Yes, there will be a gap,” Pant said. “But at the same time it’s an opportunity for us to build a new culture, or take the culture forward. Sharing knowledge with each other, having that care and love in the dressing room for each other, that’s something we’re looking forward to. The idea is very simple: look to play positive, brave cricket. You’ve got to keep finding ways to make your team win.”While all three of Tongue’s previous Test appearances have come at home this will be Carse’s first in England after a string of impressive performances over the winter was temporarily halted by an infected toe – an injury that prompted him to briefly consider amputation – that kept him out of the Zimbabwe game.“Over the years I’ve watched a number of great games of Test cricket in England, and to be part of this group for the past eight or nine months has been really exciting,” he said. “A couple of the guys have said this series is something else, that playing Test cricket in England is a different feeling. To be part of this is something I’m very excited about.”",
