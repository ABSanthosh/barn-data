  "text": "Nov 29, 2024 2 minute read News English cricketers have threatened legal action against the ECB following reports that the board would ban them from appearing in franchise T20 leagues around the world. An article published in The Telegraph today (November 29) alleged that the board would not issue NOCs (Non-objection certificates) for players to feature in T20 leagues which run alongside the English domestic season. The leagues affected would include the PSL and Major League cricket, both of which coincide with the English domestic summer. While there has been no official announcement from the ECB, the move is reportedly set to be ratified by the board next week. The policy is allegedly being put forward in order to \"safeguard the quality of the domestic game\", amid concerns that players with higher earning potential in franchise leagues would seek higher reward elsewhere. In response, it has been reported by ESPNcricinfo that players have threatened legal action over the move, and have requested an emergency meeting to discuss the proposal. The report states that several players who have signed white-ball only contracts with their counties and are not centrally contracted to England believe that the move is designed to restrict their opportunities. PCA interim chief executive told ESPNcricinfo: \"The PCA's legal team is currently completing a thorough check of the implementation of the policy. The PCA is continuing to source considered opinions and potential consequences of this policy from players and player representatives.\" Mitchell is also quotes as citing \"clear frustration at the lack of time given for consultation, discussion and debate\" of the policy, and that players had expressed concerns about \"the inconsistencies in which players are likely to be treated\". The PSL will run in a new window from next year, switching to April-May which will clash with the early rounds of the County Championship. As many as 16 English players are currently signed up to play in the PSL, while many other players have deals in the myriad of non-IPL franchise leagues which take place throughout the year. Major League Cricket has also emerged as a threat to The Hundred, with the two competitions significantly overlapping this year. There was concern that, as a result, the quality of players in The Hundred was lower in 2024, with several marquee players not joining the competition until completing their contractual obligations in the US.
