  "text": "England secured their first overseas T20I series victory in over two years, beating West Indies 3-1 on their home soil. It is a welcome result for Jos Buttler's team after a turbulent year across both white-ball formats that saw England surrender both their world titles. With several multi-format players unavailable for the West Indies tour and a few high profile players moved on in the aftermath of their unsuccessful T20 World Cup campaign earlier in the year, there was a fresh feel to Buttler's side. Here's how the 14 England players picked across the series fared: Phil Salt: 8/10 162 runs @ 54, SR: 165.30; one hundred and one fifty Another excellent series for Salt at the top of the order whose T20I batting ranking of No. 2 illustrates his current standing in the format. Failures in the second and third games were bookended by a pair of significant scores, including a match-winning century in the series opener – that was his third T20I hundred, no other England batsman has more than one. Will Jacks: 6/10 112 runs @ 28, SR: 133.33; no fifties No standout score for Jacks but he made starts in all four of his innings. Jacks played second fiddle in two important partnerships; with Jos Buttler in the second T20I, and with Sam Curran in the third as the Surrey pair got the England chase back on track after an early wobble in the powerplay. Jos Buttler: 7/10 125 runs @ 31.25, SR: 168.91; one fifty Back to his best in the second T20I in his new role at three. In general, Buttler looked re-energised after four months out of the game, captaining with more resourcefulness and imagination than we have recently seen. Jacob Bethell: 9/10 127 runs @ 127, SR: 173.97; two fifties This kid looks like he's the real deal. Bethell is a strikingly crisp ball-striker and has a power game that belies his youthful look. He is also an outstanding fielder, one that is already rated as among the best in England. Expect Bethell to be at the heart of England's limited overs renewal over the next few years. He looks totally at home in international cricket. Sam Curran: 7/10 65 runs @ 32.50, SR: 166.66; no fifties No wickets; ER: 9.66 England's standout batter in the series-clinching victory in Saint Lucia; Curran clearly revels in the additional responsibility that comes with batting higher up the order. He didn't take a wicket with the ball. It will be interesting to see how he is used under new head coach Brendon McCullum. Despite previously winning a T20 World Cup player of the tournament award on account of his work with the ball, it may well be that he has more of a future in the England white-ball set-up as a top six batter. Liam Livingstone: 7/10 66 runs @ 33, SR: 146.66; no fifties Three wickets @ 27; ER: 13.50, BBI: 2-16 Provided useful contributions in the successful chases in the second and third games of the series. He picked up two important wickets in that second T20I, the most eye-catching of which was the stumping of Nicholas Pooran who was lured out of his crease by a ball that dipped late and turned away from him. Livingstone went the distance in the fourth game, conceding 30 runs from his sole over. Dan Mousley: 6/10 Eight runs @ 8, SR: 133.33 Two wickets @ 41; ER: 9.11, BBI: 2-29 A peculiar series for a youngster who has made his name in domestic cricket as a batter but was used more with the ball in his first T20I series. His darty 'off-spin' is an interesting and almost unique angle of attack; his economy rate needs to be contextualised by his use predominantly at the back-end of an innings. Jamie Overton: 7/10 Four runs, no dismissal; SR: 100 Four wickets @ 13; ER: 6.24, BBI: 3-20 Another who had an interesting series. Only deemed fit enough to bowl in three of the five games, he was effectively not required with the bat occasionally making it difficult to discern exactly why he was in the XI. But England like what he offers. He is a prolific boundary-clearer on his day, can be difficult to get away with the ball and is an outstanding catcher, both in the slips and at long-off and long-on. Rehan Ahmed: 6/10 Three wickets @ 24; ER: 10.28, BBI: 3-43 Very nearly turned the game in England's favour in the fourth T20I, taking two wickets and affecting a run out in three balls. Ahmed was expensive in the third game but looks an improved white-ball bowler a year on from his previous tour of the Caribbean. Jofra Archer: 7/10 Two wickets @ 36; ER: 7.20, BBI: 1-25 Bowled better than his wicket tally suggests. Started each innings with threat and posed difficult questions for the West Indies batters with his pace, movement and accuracy. Saqib Mahmood: 9/10 Nine wickets @ 10.55; ER: 6.33, BBI: 4-34 Absolutely brilliant with the new ball, breaking the all-time England T20I record for the most powerplay wickets in a series or competition. His ability to move the ball laterally, both through the air and off the pitch, makes Mahmood a real handful, particularly with the new ball. Reece Topley: N/A Limped off with an injury in his sole appearance of the series. Adil Rashid: 8/10 Four wickets @ 16; ER: 8.00, BBI: 3-32 Two excellent outings with the ball before he was rested for games three and four so England could give game time to Ahmed. John Turner: 4/10 One wicket at 64; ER: 10.66, BBI: 1-42 Expensive with the new ball though did well to claw things back towards the end of the fourth T20I. Turner is brisk without being express pace. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
