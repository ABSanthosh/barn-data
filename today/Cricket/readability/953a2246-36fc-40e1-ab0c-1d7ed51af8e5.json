The decision also means that the venue for the final on 9 March will change from Lahore to Dubai if India qualify.Last month the Board of Control for Cricket in India, citing government advice, told the ICC it would not send a team to the tournament, which begins in February. India have not toured Pakistan since 2008; Pakistan last visited their neighbours to take part in the 50-over World Cup in 2023.“The three group matches involving India, as well as the first semi-final, will be played in Dubai,” the ICC said in a statement. “Lahore will host the final on 9 March, unless India qualify, in which case it will be played in Dubai. Both the semi-finals [the second of which will be in Lahore] and the final will have reserve days.”This will be the first Champions Trophy event since 2017, which was won by Pakistan after they defeated India by 180 runs in the final at the Oval in London. The eight-team, 50-over format competition begins in Karachi on 19 February, with Pakistan taking on New Zealand. Rawalpindi will also host three group-stage matches.England are in Group B with Afghanistan, Australia and South Africa in an early test for Brendon McCullum as he takes over white-ball coaching duties. England will face Australia on 22 February and Afghanistan on 26 February – both in Lahore – and then take on the Proteas on 1 March in Karachi.“We are pleased that an agreement has been reached based on the principles of equality and respect, showcasing the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that defines our sport,” the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, said.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Our heartfelt gratitude goes out to the ICC members who played a constructive role in helping us achieve a mutually beneficial solution,” he added. “Their efforts have been invaluable in promoting the interests of international cricket.” The ICC said last week that tournament matches between India and Pakistan, organised in either nation, would be played at neutral venues until at least 2027.The tournament will be the first ICC event to be held in Pakistan since the 1996 50-over World Cup, which was co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka. “Our country is known for its great hospitality and I am sure the fans will not only support our team, but also appreciate the performances of other teams,” said the Pakistan white-ball captain, Mohammad Rizwan.",
