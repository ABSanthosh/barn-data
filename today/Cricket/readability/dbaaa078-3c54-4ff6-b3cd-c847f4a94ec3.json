  "text": "'He's under their skin' - Konstas riles India againMedia caption, Bumrah takes final-ball wicket after altercationAustralia opener Sam Konstas has affected Test opponents India by getting \"under their skin\", according to team-mate Scott Boland.The teenager was involved in a fiery conclusion to day one of the fifth Test in Sydney on Friday.Konstas, 19, exchanged words with bowler Jasprit Bumrah in the final over when India complained Australia were wasting time.After Bumrah dismissed Usman Khawaja two balls later, he and various India team-mates moved to celebrate close to Konstas at the non-striker's end.\"He's playing with a lot of flair and definitely he's under their skin, you can see that in the last few moments there,\" Boland said on Fox Cricket.\"Hopefully he can go tomorrow and bat big.\"What happened in fiery finale?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bumrah dismissed Konstas in the second innings of the fourth Test in MelbourneAustralia, who lead 2-1 and need to avoid defeat in Sydney to win the series, had to face three overs late in the day, having dismissed India for 185.With the clock moving towards the close, India complained when Khawaja appeared to delay in an attempt to ensure there was not time for any further overs.As Bumrah protested, Konstas responded with words to the world number one bowler, and the umpire had to step in to halt the pair's heated discussion.\"They wanted to waste some time,\" India wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant said.\"I feel that was the reason he had a conversation with Jassy [Bumrah]. \"He said something, I didn't hear it, but I feel that's the only thing which he wanted to do to waste some time so we don't bowl one more over.\"After dismissing Khawaja, Bumrah immediately turned to face Konstas although he checked his celebration. Bowler Prasidh Krishna and former captain Virat Kohli ran to celebrate passionately in the vicinity of the teenager before the players left the field with Australia 9-1.'I hope Sam is not getting caught up in the hype'Media caption, Kohli and debutant Konstas in 'spicy' altercation after shoulder bargeThe exchange came after Konstas clashed with India's players while making his debut during last week's fourth Test in Melbourne, won by Australia.Although he played and missed early on there, he caught the eye by ramping Bumrah for two fours and a six in making 60 in his first international innings.During the knock, he was involved in an altercation with Kohli, who was fined for what was deemed a shoulder barge in the middle.In Sydney, Konstas repeated his attacking batting approach, charging the first ball of the innings bowled by Bumrah and later backing away in an attempted cut in the final over.Former Australia coach and batter Darren Lehmann told ABC Grandstand he hoped Konstas was not \"getting caught up in the hype\".\"I don't mind all of the backing up your players and the bravado,\" Lehmann said. \"But you can't win. Australia didn't win - they lost the wicket of Usman.\"I hope Sam is not getting caught up in the hype because I have seen him play really good innings â€“ Test-match innings with good defence.\"Australia debutant Beau Webster said: \"Sammy, he's a very confident young man. \"That's what they do these days these youngsters, they sort of get in, get after it and put themselves out there. And you know, he's got all the skills and all the talent to back it up - so hopefully he has a really good day tomorrow and puts a few runs on the board and gets us into a decent position.\"Media caption, 'Unbelievable' Konstas ramps Bumrah three times in overMore on this story",
