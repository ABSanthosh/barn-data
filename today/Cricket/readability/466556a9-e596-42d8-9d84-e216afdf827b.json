Lyndon James clubbed to mid-on in the opening over, Jack Haynes pulled sixes off Dwarshius and Duffy but skewed a slower ball from the latter to mid-off and Moises Henriques was easily stumped off former Nottinghamshire left-arm spinner Fateh Singh.Clarke's attempt to kick-start a faltering effort brought him a second six as he slog-swept Singh but his attempt to clear extra cover saw him fall to a well-judged catch by D'Oliveira, Sams sliced to backward point and Moores fell to a similar shot, after which Patterson-White's lusty blows proved not enough.Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
