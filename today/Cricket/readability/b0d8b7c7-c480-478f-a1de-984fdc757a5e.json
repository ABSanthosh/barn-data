India rested their premier bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, in Birmingham, and in the series so far all of England’s frontline seamers have bowled more, and spent considerably longer in the field, than any of their opponents.England’s squad for the third Test also includes the two seamers that went unused at Edgbaston: Essex’s Sam Cook, who played his first and so far only game for the side against Zimbabwe, and Jofra Archer, whose appearance for Sussex against Durham last month marked a return to first-class cricket after a four-year absence and is now in line for a first Test cap since February 2021.Stokes said: “The efforts we all put in as a bowling unit there, especially the big quicks – they keep charging in but it’s no secret that we have spent some time in the field and bowled some overs in the first two games, and we’ll have to see how everyone pulls up over the next two days. With it being a quick turnaround there probably will be a decision we have to make.”Both teams expressed surprise and disappointment in the pitch that was produced at Edgbaston, even if the fact that England’s top four averaged just 12 suggests they did not find it too placid. Stokes said that “as the game got deeper it was pretty obvious it was not playing the way we thought it was going to”, and that “the longer it played out, the more it was suiting the Indian team over our team”.The England coach, Brendon McCullum, said the team was flexible with its plans but admitted that the decision at the toss to bowl first had been “slightly wrong”.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“I think as the game unfolded we probably looked back on that toss and said: ‘Did we miss an opportunity there?’ We didn’t expect that the wicket would play quite as it did, and hence we probably got it slightly wrong,” he said. “We’re not rigid with our plans, it’s just we thought this pitch might get better to bat on as we went through the five days, but as we saw it didn’t.”",
