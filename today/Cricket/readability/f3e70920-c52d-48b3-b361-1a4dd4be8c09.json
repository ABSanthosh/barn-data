  "text": "Captain Jos Buttler has rejected the idea England have not trained enough during their difficult tour of India, saying they do not have a \"lazy environment\".England were thrashed by 142 runs in the third one-day international, meaning they end the trip with seven defeats from eight limited overs matches.Former India captain Ravi Shastri and ex-England skipper Kevin Pietersen questioned England's preparation and suggested they had not spent enough time in the nets.\"[I am] not sure that is quite true,\" Buttler, 34, said. \"We try to create a really good environment but don't mistake that for a lazy environment or lack of effort. \"The guys are desperate to perform and improve.\"While England did not train before the second and third ODIs, they did before the first match and also did so regularly during the preceding T20 series. India also opted to not train before the third ODI in Ahmedabad.The tour was the first under new coach Brendon McCullum, who has prioritised a more relaxed team environment since becoming Test coach in 2022. All training sessions under McCullum are optional.The three ODIs were played across seven days. The first match was in Nagpur on Thursday, the second 500 miles away in Cuttack on Sunday and the third a two-hour-40-minute flight away three days later.England have also been managing various injury issues throughout the tour, which began on 22 January and is immediately followed by the Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. \"There have been a couple of times we have not trained but we have done plenty of training throughout the tour,\" Buttler said.England, who have lost four one-day international series in a row, have struggled with the bat throughout the tour, particularly against spin. They were bowled out for 214 in Ahmedabad - the sixth time they have been dismissed across the tour.Speaking on TNT Sports, former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior suggested some of the players should have spent more times in the nets.\"You have to give yourself the best chance to perform,\" he said. \"A lot of the younger guys, you would expect them to make the choice to get the extra nets in and work with McCullum who scored runs in the sub-continent.\"Sometimes you have to make that choice. It is those hard yards that earn you the right to have your day out.\"But former England bowler Steven Finn said practising too much can have a negative impact.\"You play, travel, play. It fatigues you,\" he told TNT Sports.\"It is an eight-week long trip towards the end of the Champions Trophy. On the face of it you think they should be in the nets but you can also compound bad habits.\"On the 2013-14 Ashes tour, I spent the entire tour making bowling complicated in my head by practising.\"The more I practised the worse I got. It took 18 months to untangle the rubbish I put inside my head by complicating the game.\"England have already lost all-rounder Jacob Bethell for the Champions Trophy, which begins on 19 February, because of a hamstring injury. Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith is recovering from a calf issue, bowler Brydon Carse is managing a toe problem and their issues were added to by a groin injury to opener Ben Duckett on Wednesday.He sustained the injury in the field and was clearly hampered while batting as he limped throughout his 34 from 22 balls.England travel to the UAE where Duckett will be assessed before the squad moves to Lahore next week for their Champions Trophy opener against Australia.Duckett can be replaced if necessary but any replacement must be ratified by the International Cricket Council.\"He has been playing really well,\" Buttler said. \"Hopefully it is not too bad. We will find out more in the next few days.\"",
