  "text": "Gautam Gambhir, India’s head coach, has been at the forefront of some bizarre statements over the years, some of which, as social media would say, have not aged well. Gambhir’s short coaching tenure has been tumultuous thus far. Since taking over in July, he has overseen the two-format white-ball tour to Sri Lanka along with two home Test series, against Bangladesh and New Zealand. India lost their first ODI series to Sri Lanka in 27 years with him at the helm before suffering a historic whitewash – a never-seen-before phenomenon in Indian cricket – to the Black Caps last week. Previously known for his bold commentary, Gambhir’s transition to coaching has been marked by reversals of his past opinions and outspoken views, leaving him open to accusations of inconsistency. “I don’t know what Shastri has achieved in his career…” In 2018, then-coach Ravi Shastri boldly declared that the Indian cricket team was the best travelling side of the past 15-20 years. His statement came after a series defeat in England, but Shastri maintained his position, emphasising that this Indian team was putting up a stronger fight in overseas Tests than the previous sides had managed. Gambhir, an integral part of the side in the period Shastri mentioned, had lashed out at him, stating that his comments were childish and that he had no achievements in his playing career either. “I feel like laughing. People who haven’t won anything give these kinds of statements and think the team they coach is the best. I don’t know what Shastri has achieved in his career apart from winning the Audi car during the World Championship in Australia. I don’t think he was a part of an overseas series win. If you haven’t won anything yourself, you end up giving this kind of statement.” After the comments, India ended up winning two successive Test series in Australia, the second hailed as one of the best series wins ever, and were also leading 2-1 in England before the fifth match was postponed. Shastri and skipper Virat Kohli have also been showered with tremendous praise for reviving Test cricket, and revolutionising the fast bowling and fitness cultures in India. “Foreign coaches only come here, they make money and they vanish…” Since Duncan Fletcher’s departure in 2014, India had three Indian head coaches before Gambhir took over. No overseas candidate featured in the support staff under Shastri, Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid either, with Gambhir lauding the move in 2022. “One really good thing that has happened in Indian cricket in the past six-seven years, which I hope can continue, is that Indians have started coaching the Indian cricket team. I am a very, very strong believer in this. Indians should coach the Indian cricket team. All these foreign coaches, whom we end up giving a lot of importance to, they only come here, they make money and they vanish. \"Emotions are involved in sports, and the only people who can be emotional about Indian cricket or Indian sports are the people who have represented their country.” Interestingly, Gambhir buckled the trend and hired Morne Morkel as the bowling coach with Ryan ten Doeschate as an assistant coach. He has worked with both players previously in the Indian Premier League. “A good player whether a right-hander or left-hander will play well in every condition...\" Ahead of the World Cup last year, Gambhir blasted Shastri’s theory of having at least three left-handers in the India XI for the tournament, saying the quality of the player matters instead: “It is not important whether he is a left-hander or a right-hander. The debate that is going on about whether we need three left-handers is a completely useless thought. You look at the quality of the player, not how many left-handers you have. A good player, whether a right-hander or left-hander, will play well in every condition.” However, his coaching tenure has been defined by exactly that, with Gambhir and the management harping on maintaining a left-right combination at the crease, leading to changes in the batting order in almost every game across formats since he took over. A case in point is Sarfaraz Khan, who batted at No.6 (twice), 7 and even 8 against New Zealand, changing his batting position in every innings since his knock of 150 at No.4 in Bengaluru. “[Rohit and Kohli] have a lot of cricket left…” Gambhir had been accused by former India captain Kris Srikkanth of taking a U-turn in his selection philosophy after becoming head coach. According to Srikkanth, Gambhir had voiced the opinion that neither Rohit Sharma nor Kohli would make it to his team for the 2027 ODI World Cup if they did not make runs in the 2024 T20 World Cup. After being selected as the coach, Gambhir left the door ajar for the duo, saying they have a lot of cricket left in them. “One thing I can be very clear of is that both of those guys (Rohit and Virat) have a lot of cricket left in them. I think they have shown what they can deliver on the big stage, whether it's the T20 World Cup or the 50-over World Cup. Hopefully, if they can keep their fitness, the 2027 World Cup as well.” Srikkanth spoke about Gambhir’s comments on his YouTube channel: “Gautam Gambhir has taken a U-turn. Before the T20 World Cup 2024, he was saying if Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma do not perform, they will not sit in my team. Then he took a U-turn now, saying there is no player like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. After becoming head coach, he said that both have a lot of cricket left and hopefully they will be fit for the 2027 World Cup.” “People don’t come to see me smile…” Gambhir, who is known for his intensity and aggression recently opened up about always having his game face on during the IPL this year, saying his profession doesn’t require him to smile. Speaking to R Ashwin on his YouTube channel, he said: “People don't come to watch me smile. Unfortunately, people come to watch me win. That's the kind of profession we guys are in. I can't help it. I'm not in entertainment. I'm not a Bollywood actor, or I'm not a corporate. I'm a cricketer. I’m into performing art.” However, a roller-coaster start to his coaching career has opened up criticism on social media.
