  "text": "A \"hybrid model\" for hosting the Champions Trophy will not be accepted by Pakistan, according to its Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi.Pakistan is due to stage a first global tournament since 1996, an eight-team 50-over competition in February and March next year.However, political tensions between Pakistan and India mean the two countries have not played each other outside major tournaments in 11 years and India have not visited Pakistan since 2008.As a result, there is speculation India could play their matches in a country other than Pakistan, possibly the United Arab Emirates.\"Sports should stay above politics and cricket should not be sacrificed at the altar of politics,\" said PCB chair Naqvi.The situation has not been publicly addressed by the International Cricket Council, which is yet to officially publish fixtures for the event. The tournament is slated to begin on 19 February, 100 days from Monday.Confusion over the schedule is making it difficult for teams, supporters and media to make plans for the event.The tournament is made up of two groups of four, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals. If India's matches are played outside of Pakistan, it leads to the prospect of the semis or final potentially needing two grounds more than 1,000 miles apart, with the eventual venue not known until India's progress is determined.On a potential India objection to travelling to Pakistan, Naqvi said: \"Our stance is clear - they need to give us in writing any objections they may have.\"Until now, no discussion of the hybrid model has happened, nor are we prepared to accept one. The Indian media are reporting it, but no formal communication has reached the PCB.\"In case such situation occurs, I will approach my government and follow its directions.\"Pakistan did travel to India to take part in the 50-over World Cup last year, but when Pakistan hosted the Asia Cup in the same year India played their matches in Sri Lanka.The prospect of the Champions Trophy taking place without India would appear to be a non-starter because of the financial dependency of cricket on the nation.Speaking last month, England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive Richard Gould said: \"If you play the Champions Trophy without India or Pakistan, the broadcast rights aren’t there, and we need to protect them.\"There are a variety of different options available if those circumstances come along. This is a big moment for Pakistan, and hopefully we can have the fullest possible competition in Pakistan. If that’s not possible, we know there are options available.\"England are due to take part in their first major tournament under new white-ball head coach Brendon McCullum. Australia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, South Africa and New Zealand will also compete.",
