  "description": "In a very special episode Nikki Chaudhuri and Melissa Story speak to Afghan women’s cricketers Firooza Amiri, Nahida Sapan, and Benafsha Hashimi. They share their cricketing stories from Afghanistan to Australia, how they discovered their love of cricket and what it’s been like adjusting to their new lives down under. We also hear about what action they would like to see from the ICC and how the global cricket community can help them live their dreams. From Firooza cover driving like Virat Kohli, Benafsha loving to face bouncers, and Nahida’s heartfelt message of hope to women and girls in Afghanistan - these three women’s positivity and enthusiasm is not one to miss. Thank you to Firooza, Nahida and Benafsha again for their time and if you’d like to support the Afghanistan women’s cricket team, please see the link to donate here: https://www.lords.org/refugeefund Learn more about your ad choices.
