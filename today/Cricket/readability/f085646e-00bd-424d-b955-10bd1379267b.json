  "text": "England and Somerset spinner Shoaib Bashir said his game has \"changed massively\" since making his Test match debut at the start of the year. Bashir, who turned 21 last month, has since made 12 Test appearances, taking 41 wickets. He became the youngest England player to take five wickets in a home match when he led the team to victory in the second test against West Indies at Trent Bridge in July, taking the mantle from James Anderson. \"I think cricket-wise my game has changed massively, my mind has opened a lot to how different players play,\" Bashir told BBC Radio Somerset.\"Playing in England is a lot different to playing in India or Pakistan for example, but I've developed variations. \"I've known more about myself as a character, about how resilient I need to be and how much confidence I need to have going into games.\" Bashir was named England's Young Player of the Year at the 2024 Cricket Writers' Club awards earlier this month, an award that dates back to 1950 which he said was a \"great honour\". \"It's a reward for the hard work you put in behind the scenes,\" Bashir added.Bashir was selected ahead of Somerset team-mate and fellow spinner Jack Leach for the series against West Indies, although he had to take a loan spell away from his county to Worcestershire this season to earn more County Championship action. He said Leach, 33, has played a \"massive role\" in his development this year. \"He teaches me so much. I just watch him bowl sometimes on training days. I'll just stand on the side and watch,\" Bashir said.\"I remember when I was playing for the [Somerset Second XI] and hadn't signed yet, Leachy was watching me bowl and I remember afterwards he came up to me and told me how much he liked my action. \"After that point I got signed and, me and Leachy, we speak about bowling all the time.\"Bashir has a contract with Somerset until the end of next season and said he is still very much learning in his career.\"I've already taken a lot from what I have experienced,\" he said.\"As a spin bowler you're bound to get hit for runs and, as a spin bowler, I'm always going to take wickets, I'm always trying to attack, attack, attack rather than worry about my economy rate for example or how many maidens I've bowled.\"I don't think that should matter as long as you're taking wickets and contributing to the game and trying to change the game. That makes more of an impact.\"",
