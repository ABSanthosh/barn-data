  "text": "Pakistan vs Bangladesh Highlights: Salman Ali Agha hit a career-best 56.© AFP PAK vs BAN Highlights 1st T20I: Captain Salman Ali Agha slammed a half-century, while recalled pacer Hasan Ali bagged a five-wicket haul as Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 37 runs in the first T20I of a three-match series in Lahore on Wednesday. Chasing 202 for the win, Bangladesh were cruising at one stage, thanks to quickfire knocks from captain Litton Das (48), Tanzid Hasan (31) and later on from Jaker Ali (36). However, the visitors lost regular wickets in the middle overs with Hasan and Shadab Khan doing the damage with the ball. In the end, they were bowled out for 164. Earlier, skipper Salman struck a career-best 56 to guide Pakistan to 201-7 against Bangladesh. He struck a 34-ball 56, smashing eight fours and a six, while Hasan Nawaz's 22-ball 44, including four sixes, helped Pakistan pass 200 after the hosts won the toss and chose to bat at the Gaddafi Stadium.
