  "text": "Watch: Shaheen Afridi bowled Heinrich Klaasen with a brutal full ball that swung in to castle middle stump in Paarl today (December 17). In the first ODI of the series, Klaasen came in with South Africa teetering at 88-4. After a decent powerplay where South Africa put on 70 for the loss of just one wicket, Ryan Rickleton, Rassie van der Dussen and Tristan Stubbs all fell in quick succession, the latter in the same over. That brought Klaasen to the crease in the 14th over. Steadying the innings in a partnership with Aiden Markram, Klaasen brought up his 50 with a four off Naseem Shah from his 68th ball. He went on the attack afterwards, slamming a six off Saim Ayub before taking another boundary off Naseem. Shaheen was brought back into the attack with six overs left of South Africa's innings, the score reading 214-7. His figures at that point were 0-33 off seven. After Klaasen clubbed a four off his second ball, Shaheen struck with a beauty. Pitching the ball up, he found prodigious movement into the right hander to go through the gap between Klaasen's bat and pad, and wallop straight into his middle stump. From there, South Africa were only able to put on another 21 runs in the remaining five overs. They finished up on 239-9, Shaheen finishing with figures of 1-46 off his 10. Pakistan found themselves in trouble early in the chase, losing Abdullah Shafique for a duck in the second over, bowled by Marco Jansen, and slipping to 52-3 with both Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan back in the dug out.
