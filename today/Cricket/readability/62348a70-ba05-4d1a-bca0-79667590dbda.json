It was seen as impractical to make any major changes to the men’s game at the same time as working on new county partnership agreements, the completion of major match allocation up until 2031 and the sale of the Hundred teams, all at the same time as working on the new women’s structure.That revamped women’s structure – 335 county matches across Tiers 1-3 and including seven flagship finals days, more days at county headquarters and more games under lights – will align with the men’s game for the first time, with the white-ball sponsors Vitality and Metro Bank sponsoring the men’s and women’s versions of their competition. The Championship also has a new sponsor in the insurance company brokers Rothesay.However, 2025 will offer only a temporary moment of reflection: talks are under way with the professional game committee about 2026 and beyond.
