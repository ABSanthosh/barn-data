  "text": "Media caption, Crawley and Duckett exchange words with India in frantic final over on day threeIndia had no right to complain about England's tactics in a dramatic finale to the third day of the third Test at Lord's after their own time-wasting earlier in the match, says bowling coach Tim Southee.Opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed bowler Jasprit Bumrah and called for a physio after being hit on the finger as he successfully ensured he and Ben Duckett only had to face one over before the close, instead of two.India's players reacted angrily to the delays, with captain Shubman Gill gesticulating to Crawley shouting an expletive in his direction.\"It is always exciting to see both sides animated towards the end,\" said Southee, who is England's fast-bowling consultant.\"Not sure what they were complaining about when Shubman was lying down getting a massage in the middle of the day yesterday.\"It's obviously part of the game. It is an exciting way to finish.\"After England bowled India out for 387 - level with the hosts' first-innings score - Crawley and Duckett emerged to bat with five minutes left in the day, which should have been time for two overs.How the dramatic final over unfolded The first delivery of Bumrah's over took place almost two minutes later than scheduled at 18:25 and was left outside off stump by Crawley.Crawley repeatedly stepped away before the third delivery, leaving Bumrah visibily frustrated. Sky Sports had to apologise to viewers for Gill's language after his barbs towards Crawley.After the third delivery was eventually bowled, India's fielders surrounded Crawley to shout encouragement to their bowler.Bumrah's fifth delivery bounced to hit Crawley on the bottom glove. As he called for the physio there were cheers from the England fans and boos from those supporting India.Having initially clapped sarcastically, Gill rushed up to Crawley and held his arms up in an X. Crawley responded by waving a finger at Gill. Duckett then stepped in to respond to Gill's words.Crawley missed the final delivery and immediately turned to the dressing room. More words were sent in the direction of Duckett as he and India's fielders left the field.'We were hoping we could get a wicket'\"Obviously we wanted to bowl two overs,\" India batter KL Rahul said.\"There were six minutes left. Obviously, two overs is a no-brainer that any team will bowl two overs with six minutes to go.\"We were all pumped up either way because we know how difficult it is for a batter to come in to bat for two overs when you have been in the field all day. \"We were hoping we could get a wicket there, and a wicket at the end of the day's play would have been perfect for us.\"This Test has been characterised by stoppages, including a lengthy delay on day two when Gill received a massage to his back while fielding.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shubman Gill made an X gesture to Zak Crawley after the England opener called for the physioSlide 1 of 3, Shubman Gill makes an X gesture to Zak Crawley after England opener calls for physio, Shubman Gill made an X gesture to Zak Crawley after the England opener called for the physio'As good a piece of time-wasting I've seen'England ended the over 2-0, meaning they lead by two runs at the end of the third day.\"It's as good a piece of time-wasting I've ever seen,\" former England captain Michael Vaughan told the Test Match Special podcast.\"India can't complain because yesterday Gill was down with the hamstring strain – Rahul was off the field and wouldn't have been able to open the batting.\"Neither team can complain, but what great drama and what a great day. We're in for a fourth and fifth day that will be fantastic.\"Former England captain Sir Alastair Cook said the series, much anticipated beforehand and tied at 1-1 after the first two Tests, \"needed\" the late drama.\"Everyone has been so friendly, but this always happens in a series of five matches,\" he said.\"There's little moments after playing against each other so many times.\"Duckett was like a dachshund: all those big dogs and he was the one squaring up to [India bowler Mohammed] Siraj.\"Media caption, Rahul's century helped India to match England's first innings total of 387More on this story",
