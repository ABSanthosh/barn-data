He brought up his own half-century off 25 balls with the second of three sixes to come off Motie's first over, crunched over deep midwicket before Will Jacks launched the third over long-on. Jacks fell on the next ball, bowled middle stump attempting to sweep, but by that time England had closed out the powerplay at 73 for 1, compared to West Indies' 58 for 3. Motie couldn't stay away from the action, his brilliant one-handed take at third removing Jos Buttler, batting at No. 3 on his return to action after a five-month injury lay-off, for a first-ball duck.For all his big hitting, Salt's deft punch for four just behind backward point off Joseph in the ninth over was prettier than any of his four sixes up to that moment and highlighted the range of shots which comprised his innings. Bethell mimicked the shot, slightly finer off Shepherd, as he settled into just his third innings in T20Is, playing the perfect supporting role to Salt, his unbeaten 58 coming off 36 balls and including an elegant six over cover off the penultimate ball.He followed that immediately with the winning runs, pulling Shepherd for two to seal victory with 3.1 overs to spare. Salt had moved into the nineties swinging Shepherd to square leg, where the ball shot through the fingertips of Sherfane Rutherford as he tumbled over the boundary for six more before he brought up his ton in what turned out to be the last over of the game with four down the ground. It was Salt's third century in T20Is, all of them coming in the Caribbean against West Indies.In the MahmoodMahmood struck early when Brandon King, a centurion as West Indies won the third and final ODI for a 2-1 series win, slammed his fifth ball - the 11th of the match - straight to short cover. In his next over, Mahmood had two wickets in as many balls as Bethell took an excellent low catch running in from the rope at deep backward square to remove Evin Lewis and then luring Shimron Hetmyer with a superb length ball that moved away ever so slightly as it took an edge through to Salt. It was quite the comeback from Mahmood, playing just his third T20I since January 2022 after suffering two stress fractures in his back. His two other matches in the format since had yielded 2 for 21 and no wicket for 37 against Australia in September, but now he had 3 for 12 from two overs.Meanwhile fellow seamer Reece Topley conceded 20 runs from 15 balls, including Powell's nurdled four through deep third then six over square leg immediately before Topley slipped in his follow-through clutching his right knee. Topley was visibly limping as a brief rain shower arrived, sending the players from the field for just over half an hour. Topley returned after the stoppage, only to be greeted by a lofted drive for six by Powell and that was enough to send the bowler from the field for the rest of the innings with what was later confirmed as a jarred knee as Jamie Overton finished his third over. Mahmood returned to have his figures blighted by conceding 18 runs off his third over, Pooran heaving over the fence at wide long-on, threading four through deep backward point and swinging over deep midwicket for another six.No fearAdil Rashid entered the attack in the seventh over and struck with his second ball, Powell going big again but unable to clear a leaping Overton just inside the boundary at long-on. Although he had handed the wicketkeeping gloves to Salt, returning captain Buttler sprung with the reflexes of a cat to snare a brilliant one-handed catch at slip in Rashid's next over to remove Rutherford. Pooran and Russell forged a defiant partnership, Russell slamming back-to-back sixes off Rashid and moving to a 16-ball 30. But Liam Livingstone managed to end their union when he responded to seeing his third ball deposited back over his head for six by having Russell caught at deep cover by Dan Mousley. Pooran followed for 38, falling to another spectacular catch by Buttler, launching himself high and twisting in the air in the covers off Overton.West Indies looked determined to go down blazing. Rashid claimed his third when he pinned Akeal Hosein at the second attempt with an excellent leg-break. But just as it looked like the hosts' fightback might fizzle, Motie strode to the crease at No. 10 and struck 16 runs off the first three balls he faced, including back-to-back sixes off Rashid. He had raced to 33 off just 14 balls by the time Mahmood had him caught on the deep midwicket boundary to claim his fourth wicket of the match. It ended Motie's ninth-wicket stand with Shepherd, who ended with an unbeaten 35 off 22, their union helping West Indies to a total which had seemed so unlikely earlier.Valkerie Baynes is a general editor, women's cricket, at ESPNcricinfoWIENG100%50%100%WI InningsENG InningsOver 17 • ENG 183/2England won by 8 wickets (with 19 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsInstant answers to T20 questions",

It ended Motie\u0026#39;s ninth-wicket stand with Shepherd, who ended with an unbeaten 35 off 22, their union helping West Indies to a total which had seemed so unlikely earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eValkerie Baynes is a general editor, women\u0026#39;s cricket, at ESPNcricinfo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWI\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eENG\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e100%\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e50%\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e100%\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg viewBox=\"0 0 300 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"0\" x2=\"300\" y1=\"200\" y2=\"200\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"0\" x2=\"300\" y1=\"100\" y2=\"100\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cg\u003e\u003cline x1=\"150\" x2=\"150\" y1=\"0\" y2=\"200\"\u003e\u003c/line\u003e\u003c/g\u003e\u003cpolyline points=\"7.5,115.56 15,115.56 22.5,123.7 30,127.64 37.5,98.6 45,51.400000000000006 52.5,65.6 60,69.44 67.5,143.98 75,135.22 82.5,102.88 90,96.44 97.5,119.66 105,145.64 112.5,150.4 120,131.48000000000002 127.5,113.48 135,92.16 142.5,105.02 150,92.16 157.5,90.34 165,104.76 172.5,105.96 180,157.04 187.5,152.5 195,168.16 202.5,147.34 210,142.5 217.5,153.28 225,175.88 232.5,175.48 240,187.04 247.5,189.38 255,196.62 262.5,198.56 270,199.7 277.5,200\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"#E49042\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/polyline\u003e\u003cdefs\u003e\u003cmask id=\"myMask\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cpolyline fill=\"none\" points=\"7.5,115.56 15,115.56 22.5,123.7 30,127.64 37.5,98.6 45,51.400000000000006 52.5,65.6 60,69.44 67.5,143.98 75,135.22 82.5,102.88 90,96.44 97.5,119.66 105,145.64 112.5,150.4 120,131.48000000000002 127.5,113.48 135,92.16 142.5,105.02 150,92.16 157.5,90.34 165,104.76 172.5,105.96 180,157.04 187.5,152.5 195,168.16 202.5,147.34 210,142.5 217.5,153.28 225,175.88 232.5,175.48 240,187.04 247.5,189.38 255,196.62 262.5,198.56 270,199.7 277.5,200\" stroke=\"white\" stroke-width=\"2\"\u003e\u003c/polyline\u003e\u003c/mask\u003e\u003c/defs\u003e\u003crect fill=\"#03A9F4\" x=\"0\" y=\"100\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" mask=\"url(#myMask)\"\u003e\u003c/rect\u003e\u003ctext x=\"50\" y=\"196\"\u003eWI Innings\u003c/text\u003e\u003ctext x=\"200\" y=\"196\"\u003eENG Innings\u003c/text\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"15\" cy=\"115.56\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"30\" cy=\"127.64\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"30\" cy=\"121.64\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"52.5\" cy=\"65.6\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"67.5\" cy=\"143.98\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"97.5\" cy=\"119.66\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"105\" cy=\"145.64\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"112.5\" cy=\"150.4\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"142.5\" cy=\"105.02\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"195\" cy=\"168.16\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"202.5\" cy=\"147.34\" r=\"3\" stroke-width=\"1\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver 17 • ENG 183/2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEngland won by 8 wickets (with 19 balls remaining)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg width=\"12\" height=\"12\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-noaspect.svg\"/\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePowered by Smart Stats\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/ask\"\u003e\u003cimg width=\"135\" alt=\"AskESPNcricinfo Logo\" src=\"https://wassets.hscicdn.com/static/images/lazyimage-noaspect.svg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstant answers to T20 questions\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
