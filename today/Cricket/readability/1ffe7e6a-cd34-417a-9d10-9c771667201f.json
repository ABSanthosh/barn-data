A massive milestone. PBKS vs MI LIVE: History favours MI! No team has chased down a total of 185 against Mumbai Indians since 2020! Punjab Kings must if they want to seal a Qualifier 1 berth and take top spot in the points table. Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh out to open! PBKS vs MI LIVE: MI 10-15 short? Suryakumar Yadav says that MI are 10-15 runs short! He does say that it will be a challenge for Punjab Kings to chase it down, but emphasizes that MI could have made a few more runs. Good bowling by and large by PBKS, and a target of 185 should ensure a tight encounter! PBKS vs MI LIVE: Terrific final over by Arshdeep! Arshdeep Singh, take a bow! Class from the left-arm seamer. 2 wickets and just 3 runs conceded in the final over, he pretty much nailed every single yorker. Gets SKY out on the last ball, 57 for him in the end.

Suryakumar Yadav mistimes the shot, but it lands safe, they pick up two. 50 off 34 balls! And he gets a boundary on the last ball of the over too! Big, big over for MI. 23 off it! They cross 180, 200 is in sight!MI 181/5 (19) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX, SIX, Naman Dhir! Naman Dhir on the charge! How often has he done this in IPL 2025? Really proving his finishing capabilities. Vyshak has bowled very well today but he is taken to the cleaners by Naman Dhir in the first two balls of the 19th over. And then SKY hits it for 4, straight back over the bowler's head. SKY up to 49!MI 175/5 (18.4) PBKS vs MI LIVE: DROPPED! Oh dear, SKY has been put down! Goes for a pull shot, doesn't time it well, it was going straight to Nehal Wadhera at mid-on but he has put it down! Crucial one to put down at an important stage of the innings.MI 158/5 (18) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX! OUT! Drama! Hardik Pandya slams Marco Jansen for a maximum, but then perishes next ball. Goes for a big swing again, but takes a healthy edge and it is caught behind by wicket-keeper Josh Inglis. Hardik was looking dangerous, but this is a big blow. MI 150/5 (16.2) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX! Now SKY! Into the 40s goes the ever-consistent Suryakumar Yadav. He has stepped up once again when it matters for MI. Slams a six over long-off, Jamieson hasn't hadn't a good evening. Concedes 13 in the over.MI 144/4 (16) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 4! Boundary again for Hardik! Thick edge as Hardik charges, and it rolls away for 4 through third man. Too fine for the fielder to catch up. The MI captain accelerating here, he is played some boundaries to begin with. Jamieson comes back with a sharp short delivery.MI 136/4 (15.3) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 5 to go! 5 overs to go in the Mumbai Indians innings. Suryakumar Yadav is well set. Hardik Pandya is hit a couple of boundaries. The last time MI played in Jaipur, these two stitched an explosive partnership at the back end. They'll be eyeing at least 180 from here.MI 131/4 (15) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX! Hardik Pandya maximum! The Mumbai Indians captain slams a massive one for mid-wicket, against Harpreet Brar. Remember, he was dropped on 0 by Vyshak. Brar ends his spell. 1/36 in 4 overs. MI need these two batters to come good.MI 123/4 (14) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Dropped! Oh dear, Hardik Pandya has been dropped by Vijaykumar Vyshak! Second ball faced by the MI captain, he hit it straight back at Vyshak but it pops out of the bowler's hand. He is still on zero! Could that prove to be costly for Punjab Kings tonight?MI 111/4 (12.4) PBKS vs MI LIVE: OUT! Jacks departs! Vyshak hits back! Changes his pace, slower delivery, Jacks tries the big shot again but skies it. Marco Jansen comes in from long-on and takes a comfortable catch. Jacks goes for 17 in his final match of the season.MI 106/4 (12.3) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX! SIX! Will Jacks is really in the groove here. Pick-up shot, over deep mid-wicket for a maximum. He made that look effortless. 17 runs off just 7 balls now, the Englishman is putting on a show in what will be his final game of IPL 2025.MI 106/3 (12.2) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 100 up or MI Mumbai Indians reach the 100-run mark in the 12th over. Not a great third over by Jansen. Suryakumar is well set, Jacks has hit a boundary. Time for the duo to step things up and accelerate. PBKS have bowled well so far.MI 100/3 (12) PBKS vs MI LIVE: OUT! Tilak departs! Vijaykumar Vyshak strikes! Vyshak with a wide yorker and Tilak ends up slicing it straight to Arshdeep Singh at third man. Tilak departs for just 1 run. Vyshak has been bowling really well so far today.MI 87/3 (10.5) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 83 after 10 Mumbai Indians have managed 83 runs in the first 10 overs. Suryakumar Yadav has just started playing some shots. Tilak Varma is at the crease from the other end. Punjab Kings have kept things fairly tight with the ball so far.MI 83/2 (10) PBKS vs MI LIVE: ROHIT OUT! Rohit Sharma departs! He hasn't had the best time out in the middle, tries to go big against Harpreet Brar but is out caught. Nehal Wadhera with an excellent diving catch at long-on. Rohit misses out on notching up 300 IPL sixes tonight.MI 81/2 (9.3) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SKY's best-ever IPL season Suryakumar Yadav hits another boundary, crosses 25 yet again. He is now up to 609 runs in this IPL season, making it the best IPL campaign of his career to date. He crosses the 605-run total he made during IPL 2025.MI 79/1 (9) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SIX! FOUR! Suryakumar Yadav to the party! Classic SKY. Flick of the wrists, gets the full face of the bat, over deep square-leg for a maximum. Next ball, slammed through the covers for 4! SKY bringing out his range of strokeplay against Kyle Jamieson.MI 75/1 (8.4) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Sweep, 4! Suryakumar Yadav is using the sweep to good effect as Brar comes in for his second over. Times one really well, and it runs away for 4 through fine-leg. Both batters taking their time to settle in still. 9 off the over.MI 64/1 (8) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SKY struggling Not the best start for Suryakumar Yadav. After a boundary on his first ball, he has managed just 2 off the next 7 balls. Vijaykumar Vyshak comes in after the powerplay and bowls a miserly three-run over. Good stuff by the PBKS bowlers so far.MI 55/1 (7) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 52 in the powerplay A decent powerplay for Mumbai Indians. They're going at just short of 9 runs an over, but lost the wicket of Rickelton. The good news for them? Their two experienced batters are at the crease to take the innings forward.MI 52/1 (6) PBKS vs MI LIVE: SKY in, 4! Mumbai Indians have sent Suryakumar Yadav up the order to No. 3! Promoting their most consistent batter, someone who has scored 25+ in every match of this season. Starts off with a risky shot, flying away for a boundary. 50 up for MI.MI 50/1 (5.2) PBKS vs MI LIVE: OUT! OUT! Marco Jansen gets Ryan Rickelton! South African gets South African. Great back of a length delivery, Rickelton mistimes his shot, the ball goes high up but not long enough, and is caught by Shreyas Iyer at mid-wicket. MI 45/1 (5.1) PBKS vs MI LIVE: 6 and 4! Rohit backs up the maximum with an excellent shot over the in-field through the off-side. Picks up 4! After taking the first few overs to settle in, Rohit has targetted the spinner and cashed in. One over to go in the powerplay, the openers nearing a 50 partnership.MI 45/0 (5) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Spinner in the powerplay, Rohit 6! Harpreet Brar is the only frontline spinner in the Punjab Kings lineup today, and he has been handed the ball by the powerplay. And Rohit steps out and slams a maximum over long on! Only two sixes away from 300 now!MI 39/0 (4.3) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Rickelton dealing in boundaries! Excellent shot by Ryan Rickelton! Full from Arshdeep but slammed back over his head by the South African batter for his fourth boundary of the evening. Rickelton doing the early scoring as Rohit settles into the crease. And then he brings out the pull shot two balls later, 4 more!MI 31/0 (3.4) PBKS vs MI LIVE: FOUR! Rohit Sharma gets his first boundary! He struggled to time it in Marco Jansen's first over, with the South African bowling 5 dots. But on the last ball, Rohit manages to connect and picks up a boundary over mid-off. Good shot.MI 23/0 (3) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Rickelton on a roll! The South African opener is in the mood early on here. Two boundaries in the second over, bowled by Kyle Jamieson. First targets the off-side, and then cashes in over mid-on, with the fielders in the circle.MI 17/0 (2) PBKS vs MI LIVE: Rickelton off the mark! We are live in Jaipur! Ryan Rickelton gets off the mark second ball, Arshdeep taking the new ball. Rickelton then slams a boundary through fine leg!

He is just 3 sixes away from reaching the milestone, making it very possible that it could happen today itself. He will open the batting in a few minutes.

PBKS vs MI LIVE: Can SKY reclaim Orange Cap? Mumbai Indians star Suryakumar Yadav has arguably been the best middle order batter of IPL 2025, but he is still 96 runs behind current Orange Cap leader B Sai Sudharsan.
