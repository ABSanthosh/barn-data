  "text": "Four days after leading New Zealand to their maiden T20 World Cup title, Sophie Devine was run out in bizarre fashion in the first ODI against India. India were bowled out for 227 in the first ODI of the three-match series against New Zealand, at Ahmedabad, after Smriti Mandhana won the toss and opted to bat. Mandhana is filling in after Harmanpreet Kaur was ruled out with an injury. For the hosts, debutant Tejal Hasabnis top-scored with 42, Deepti Sharma made 41, and three others scored in excess of 30. For the tourists, the Kerr sisters – Jess (3-49) and Amelia (4-42) – shared seven wickets. Saima Thakor, another debutant, then got Suzie Bates early before Georgia Plimmer and Lauren Down added 33 for the second wicket. Captain Devine walked out at 40-2. Six runs later, she played a ball back to Deepti, who collected it. Perhaps noticing Devine outside the crease, she threw the ball to wicketkeeper Yastika Bhatia, who whipped the bails off. The Indians appealed, and upon realising that Devine’s foot was not grounded inside the crease, television umpire Gayathri Venugopalan ruled her out. Devine, never more than a couple of feet out of her crease, made almost no attempt to get back in, and was run out. New Zealand lost Down on 79. At the time of writing, they were 98-4 in 23.5 overs with Brooke Halliday (30) and Maddy Green (10) at the crease. They need another 130 in 157 balls.
