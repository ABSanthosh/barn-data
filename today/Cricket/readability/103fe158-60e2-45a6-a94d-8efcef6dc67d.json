  "text": "Liam Livingstone will become the sixth man to captain England this year, taking the reins for the one-day international series against West Indies, after yet another setback for Jos Buttler in his return from a calf injury.Buttler, 34, has not played senior cricket since England’s failed defence of the T20 World Cup in June and the problem – a calf strain first picked up while running on the beach during a family holiday – is now proving a concern for the medical staff because of repeated relapses.Originally expected to return for the white-ball series at home against Australia in September, Buttler was forced to watch from the sidelines after reinjuring the muscle during rehabilitation. A second setback occurred while running last week, ruling Buttler out of three ODIs in the Caribbean that begin in Antigua on 31 October, and leaving him battling to be ready for the five-match Twenty20 international series that follows.Michael Pepper, the Essex wicketkeeper-batter, has been named as Buttler’s replacement in the ODIs, with Livingstone now confirmed to be leading that team. Two as-yet unnamed players in Pakistan are also expected to join an inexperienced squad once selection is finalised for the third Test starting this week in Rawalpindi.It continues a year of interim England captains, with injury to Ben Stokes leading to Ollie Pope deputising in four Tests and Harry Brook and Phil Salt having already led the white-ball team during Buttler’s absence. Brook is considered the long-term successor to Buttler here but misses the Caribbean tour because of fixture congestion; Salt has been spared the additional duties while he finds his feet in 50-over cricket.Not that Livingstone is necessarily a lock in England’s first-choice ODI side, having originally been dropped for the series against Australia only to force his way back in through a combination of some solid T20 form and Buttler’s injury. The 31-year-old does at least have experience, having led Lancashire across all formats in the past.Jos Buttler is struggling to recover from a calf injury that he sustained while running on holiday. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAs well as bringing about a long-awaited union with Salt at international level, Pepper’s first call-up represents another blow for Jonny Bairstow’s hopes of an international recall.

The injury also means the one-day internationals against India in January – Brendon McCullum’s first outing as all-format head coach – will be his only 50-over cricket before the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.",
