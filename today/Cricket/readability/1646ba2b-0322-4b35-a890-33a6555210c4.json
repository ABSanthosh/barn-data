A lot of people came to watch today, and we let them down.“At 1-45, even though it was doing a fair bit, we thought we’d done the hard work. Unfortunately, that proved not to be the case.“Clearly we’ve made mistakes, and whether that’s from an execution point of view or shot selection point of view, we’ll review that.”The out-of-form Cameron Bancroft (14 off 29 balls) was the first to fall in the collapse, trapped lbw by Webster.Ash Turner also fell lbw to Webster three balls later, and Josh Inglis was bowled by a Stanlake pearler one ball after that.Cooper Connolly, Hilton Cartwright, Ashton Agar, Jhye Richardson and Joel Paris all posted ducks as WA’s innings was brought to a crashing end.Warriors opener D’Arcy Short top scored with 22 in a sorry looking scoreboard for the three-time defending champions.WA fell short of their previous lowest score, the 59 they posted against Victoria at the MCG in 1969.Webster was the hero for Tasmania, claiming the early scalp of Short before kick-starting the collapse in a career-best display.Stanlake was also hugely effective, with his removal of Inglis among the highlights of the innings.The result marked Tasmania’s first win of the season, after a loss and a no-result from their first two games.",
