But though England had to grind out runs for the first half of their chase, Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Nat Sciver-Brunt found enough gaps to chisel out the 64-run partnership that took England to touching distance of victory.Wyatt-Hodge was stumped with 11 runs still needed, but Sciver-Brunt’s beautiful cover drive for four secured the win with four balls remaining. Sciver-Brunt joked afterwards that the shot would be “up there as one of the top 10 sexiest shots of the tournament”.“The conditions are tough,” Sciver-Brunt added. “Working out the how and making sure we’re all committed to that has been really important and I think we’ve done some great learning over these two games.“We didn’t finish our World Cup in the best of ways last time against South Africa, so we’re really happy to get over the line.”With England chasing a potentially tricky target of 125, Marizanne Kapp had turned the screw in the powerplay by sending down two maiden overs and swinging the ball unpredictably enough to trap Maia Bouchier leg-before.The final result might well have been different had she also removed Alice Capsey for a duck three balls later but the catch was spilled by Anneke Bosch at backward point. Capsey went on to add 19 in 16 balls, including a pair of swept boundaries off three balls from Chloe Tryon.By the time Kapp returned to deliver her final over – the 15th – Sciver-Brunt had settled in, and was able to find the leg-side boundary twice: the over cost 12 runs, ruining Kapp’s tidy figures.Marizanne Kapp is bowled by Sophie Ecclestone, who also rattled Laura Wolvaardt’s stumps.

England also fluffed the chance to run out Kapp first ball, throwing in to the wrong end before Amy Jones’s wild hurl down the pitch went wide and left Kapp time to make her ground.But an agonising innings of 18 off 26 balls from Bosch, during which her side went 44 balls without scoring a single boundary, prevented them from making the most of their speedy start.",
