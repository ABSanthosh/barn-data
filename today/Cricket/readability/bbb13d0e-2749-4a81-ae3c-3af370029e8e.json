  "text": "Sam Konstas and Virat Kohli collided against each other during the fourth Test of the five-match series, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Konstas, the youngest to open batting in Test cricket for Australia, launched into Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj from the very onset. After a few attempts to hoick and scoop and missing most of them, Konstas stood on five off the first 21 balls he faced across six overs. He finally connected in the seventh over, scooping Bumrah for four, then reverse-scooping him for six and a near-six four to break the shackles. By the tenth over, he had raced to 27 in 38 balls. Kohli passed Konstas as the fielders changed ends after the end of the over. The pair shoulder-barged each other (or perhaps one of them rammed into the other) and exchanged looks. “Kohli shifted ground to make contact,” quipped Kerry O’Keefe on air. Konstas followed with two fours, a six, and two twos in the next over, from Bumrah. “This is not a place for the faint-hearted and Sam Konstas doesn't look like he has a faint heart,” added Mark Nicholas when the broadcasters replayed the incident during the over. After the over, Konstas gestured at the packed house at the massive Melbourne Cricket Ground to cheer louder. At the time of writing, Australia were 83-0 after only 16 overs of cricket. Debutant Konstas had made 55 of these, off only 59 balls, while Usman Khawaja 27. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
