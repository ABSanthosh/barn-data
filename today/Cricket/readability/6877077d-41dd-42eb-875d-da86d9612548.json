Why shouldn’t we share our news, music and culture with the rest of the world?Eddie TulasiewiczLondon The BBC’s Russian language service and its World Service (Ministers demand BBC World Service plan for cuts as aid budget slashed, 11 May) were major sources of reliable and objective news for the samizdat (self-published) material that was printed and distributed sub rosa in the Soviet Union. When I was in Russia in July 1959, I would hide copies in the pages of Pravda.When I drove through rural Russia, I saw no samizdat. There, it was the BBC’s overseas services that people tuned in to.
