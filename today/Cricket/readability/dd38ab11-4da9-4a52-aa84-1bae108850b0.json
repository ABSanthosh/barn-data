  "text": "England all-rounder Jamie Overton attempted to 'Mankad' New Zealand international Finn Allen in a BBL clash between Adelaide Strikers and Perth Scorchers today on New Year's Eve, leading to an on-field spat between the two. The incident happened in the eighth over of the Scorchers’ chase. Overton on his way to send down the fourth ball broke the stumps at the non-striker's end as Allen had stepped out of his crease before the bowler completed his action. According to clause 38.3 of BBL's playing conditions, \"If the non-striker is out of his ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be Run out.\" Overton, however, didn’t appeal for a run out: Instead, he was seen notifying the umpire about issuing Allen a warning before giving the batter a mouthful. Replays revealed Allen was just out of his ground when the stumps were broken. Having gone for 18 in his first over, Overton turned things around by conceding the three off the first five balls in the next. However, the war of words seemed to have ignited Allen, who replied with a beautiful six over extra cover immediately after he grabbed the strike following the exchange. Overton yelled a few more words at Allen, who shook his hand and urged him to go. — KFC Big Bash League (@BBL) December 31, 2024 Allen’s 23-ball 50 set up a solid platform for the Scorchers’ run-chase. Cooper Connolly chipped in with 48 off 35, while captain Ashton Turner closed off the chase with an unbeaten 35 off 18. As a result, they gunned down 142 in 14.3 overs to bring up their third win this season in five matches. They moved to second place on the eight-team points table. Having won all their four matches so far, the Sydney Sixers lead the BBL 2024-25 standings, while the Strikers are teetering at seventh with just one win in five matches so far.
