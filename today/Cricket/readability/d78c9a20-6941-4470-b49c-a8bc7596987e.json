The left-hander reached his 100 in 35 balls to register the second-fastest century in IPL history.The former England captain Jos Buttler had earlier scored 50 not out from 26 deliveries and had a front-row seat for the remarkable display, keeping wicket for the Titans as Suryavanshi teed off. Jofra Archer was among the Royals players celebrating with Suryavanshi as they wrapped up an eight-wicket win.Not surprisingly, Suryavanshi was named as the player of the match. Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, the teenager said: “It is like a dream to score a century in the IPL. It feels really good. The results are showing for what I have been practising for the last three to four months. I don’t see the ground so much, just focus on the ball.”Yashasvi Jaiswal, who combined with Suryavanshi for a 166-run opening partnership, said: “Incredible innings, one of the best I’ve seen. Hope he’ll keep doing it for us for a long time. He was incredible today. He just played amazing shots. He works hard in the nets, we can see that. He has the game, he has the temperament and mentality.”Suryavanshi grabbed headlines when he became the youngest player to earn a contract in the lucrative IPL at the age of 13, before making his debut this month and announcing himself in style with a six off the first ball he faced.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionHe played in the domestic Ranji Trophy red-ball competition aged 12 last year and has represented India’s Under-19 side against Australia, scoring a 58-ball century.
