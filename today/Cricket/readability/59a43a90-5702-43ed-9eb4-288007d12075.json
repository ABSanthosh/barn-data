  "text": "India’s biggest Women's T20 World Cup win has enabled them to second place in the Group A standings, leaving them with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals without depending on other results. After India’s 58-run defeat to New Zealand in their tournament opener, Harmanpreet Kaur’s team needed massive wins in their remaining three games to qualify for the top four. Wins against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the latter coming by a margin of 82 runs, have helped them recover their Net Run Rate, which now sits at +0.576. India have one more game, against Australia, on Sunday (October 13) and will be hoping for a big win to overhaul their NRR of +2.524. A loss will hinder their progress but they will not be eliminated despite a defeat. Here's how: What happens if India win against Australia?  India’s best chance will be to defeat Australia, taking them to six points. A big enough victory margin, which will become clear after Australia's game against Pakistan, will see them topple Australia's NRR and take them to the top spot in the points table, guaranteeing them qualification. If they win by a small margin, it will get trickier.  As things stand currently, besides Australia and India, the other teams that can reach six points from the Group will either be Pakistan or New Zealand. New Zealand have a game against the winless Sri Lanka side, which they will be favourites for. A big win will convert their NRR into a positive. The Pakistan-New Zealand match will also be after the India-Australia game, with both being aware of the exact scenarios that will take them through. India will then hope that Pakistan and New Zealand do not overtake their Net Run Rate in the game, irrespective of the result. The best possibility will be to beat Australia and have Pakistan and New Zealand lose their respective matches against Australia and Sri Lanka. It will make the Pakistan-New Zealand match inconsequential, with either team reaching a maximum of four points.  What happens if India lose to Australia? If India lose to Australia, they will end with four points and then will desperately want other results to go their way. They will also be dependent on Net Run Rate one way or another, with one of New Zealand and Pakistan guaranteed to reach at least four points. New Zealand and Pakistan, both with two points each, have two remaining games and can reach six. India would want both New Zealand and Pakistan to lose at least a game. The final qualifications will then depend on the Net Run Rate.  India will be eliminated if they lose to Australia and either New Zealand or Pakistan win both their remaining games.  Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
