  "text": "Rothesay County Championship Division Two, Spitfire Ground, Canterbury (day one)Gloucestershire 365-7: Bracey 109*, Green 100* (retired hurt)Kent: Yet to batKent 2 pts, Gloucestershire 3 ptsMatch scorecardCameron Green hit a century on his Gloucestershire debut as the visitors posted 365-7 on day one of their County Championship game with Kent at Canterbury.Fellow centurion James Bracey made 109 not out and put on 167 with the Australian international, who had to retire not out on exactly 100 with suspected cramp.Nathan Gilchrist kept Kent in it with 5-61 but the hosts were hindered by an indifferent display in the field and an injury to Grant Stewart.After winning the toss Kent stuck with the formula that helped them win their two opening games by choosing to bowl, but they failed to capitalise on a promising start having reduced Gloucestershire to 15-2.Gilchrist got Cameron Bancroft for just two, lbw trying to play across his pads, but Ollie Price was on one when he edged Grant Stewart. Keeper Harry Finch pulled out of the catch expecting it to carry to first slip and it fell short.Ben Charlesworth went in the next over, lbw to Gilchrist, but Kent's already cursed bowling unit then suffered another blow when Stewart pulled up injured midway through the 14th over and had to be replaced by Jas Singh.Singh had Ollie Price lbw for 18 in his next over, to a ball that looked like it might be going down, but Green and Mike Hammond rebuilt the innings and it was 96-3 at lunch.Hammond looked poised for his half-century, only for Singh to rip out his off stump for 48, but that was the highpoint of an otherwise disappointing afternoon session for the hosts. Green never looked troubled and he pushed Jack Leaning for a single to mid-off to reach his 50.It was 225-4 at tea, after which the visitors continued to dominate, although they were given another life when Bracey was on 67. He edged Leaning to first slip but Daniel Bell-Drummond put down a regulation chance.By the time Green reached the late 90s he seemed to be suffering from cramp and was visibly struggling to take singles. When he drove Joey Evison for one he made it to the bowler's end before collapsing to the ground and retiring.Gilchrist was the only bowler who really looked like taking a wicket and he dragged Kent back into it late in the evening session. He got Graeme van Buuren lbw for 19 with the new ball and Tom Price leg before for eight with a full toss that hit him on the shin. Matt Taylor made eight when he gloved a short-pitched delivery to Finch, but Josh Shaw made it to stumps on 18 not out and with Green available to return if needed, Gloucestershire could yet bat deep into day two.ECB Reporters' Network supported by Rothesay",
