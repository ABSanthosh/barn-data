But against Bangladesh in Sharjah, he hit 101 - his second century while batting second - with 42 of those runs coming in sixes alone. That took Afghanistan to victory in their pursuit of 245, and gave them their third successive series win.It was also the first instance of a score getting successfully chased in this series, after totals of 235 and 252 were defended in the previous two games.But it didn't come all that smoothly for Afghanistan. When Gurbaz was caught off Bangladesh's stand-in captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz in the 39th over, and Gulbadin Naib departed in the 41st, Bangladesh sniffed a comeback. Afghanistan were another 57 runs away from victory, with 58 balls and five wickets remaining. However, Azmatullah Omarzai, who had fallen without scoring in both matches this series, got an unbeaten 70 off 77 deliveries to calmly lead Afghanistan to a five-wicket win in the company of Mohammad Nabi, who smashed a quick 34*.Omarzai clubbed five sixes, the last of which went over long-on to seal the win for his side. The victory was set up by Gurbaz's eighth ODI hundred, and his fourth-wicket partnership of 100 with Omarzai, after Afghanistan were 84 for 3 in the 21st over. Such had been Gurbaz's dominance that he had already reached his half-century by that point. All four of his sixes until then had been flung over the leg side, although he did have his share of luck.When on 24, Gurbaz was dropped by substitute fielder Rishad Hossain at point, and on 48, Towhid Hridoy's throw from mid-off went wide of the stumps at the non-striker's end despite Gurbaz having given up after a mix-up with Hashmatullah Shahidi.Gurbaz kept himself busy by ticking the singles and finding the boundary, and when on 56, Jaker Ali missed stumping him out off Mehidy, when one turned down the leg side - although Jaker might have been blinded by Gurbaz skipping down the pitch. Those bits of fortune taken into account, the ball seemed to fly off Gurbaz's bat, with the most impressive shot being a hard and flat six over deep backward square leg off Mustafizur Rahman.Gurbaz and Omarzai ensured the chase remained in Afghanistan's control for much of the innings. The century came up for Gurbaz in the 38th over, by the end of which, Afghanistan required only another 63 runs off the remaining 72 balls. That was when Afghanistan lost Gurbaz and Naib back-to-back, but Omarzai brought up his half-century just after that, following up a haul of 4 for 37 with the ball to earn himself the Player-of-the-Match award.Afghanistan had started the game erratically, dropping Tanzid Hasan twice and giving away extras with the ball. But bowling his second over - and the ninth of the innings - Omarzai had Soumya Sarkar chopping on for 24 at just better than a run a ball to break a 53-run opening stand.That seemed to flick a switch. Nabi, bowling the tenth over, had Tanzid slicing to cover point for 19 off a slow and dipping ball; Mehidy, in the 11th, sent Zakir Hasan back after calling for a run, only to result in Zakir's dismissal on 4; and Rashid Khan, in the 15th, had Hridoy caught at slip for 7. Bangladesh lost 4 for 19 in a period of six overs, when Mehidy, who scored a patient 66, and Mahmudullah, who got a run-a-ball 98, joined hands to add 145 runs for the fifth wicket.But they took their time to settle, as they managed to add only 49 runs off the first 74 balls of their partnership. Three boundaries came during that period, with two off the outside edge of Mehidy's bat.While Mehidy struggled to get even the singles or find the gap, Mahmudullah looked a lot steadier. With Afghanistan keeping a lid on Bangladesh, Mahmudullah hit the first six of the innings when he deposited Nabi over midwicket to end the 35th over. Those hits remained sporadic as Nabi even bowled a maiden over in the 39th.The last ten overs, however, brought Bangladesh 78 runs. It all started when Mahmudullah ended Nabi's spell ended with another six. In the next over, the 42nd, Mahmudullah carved AM Ghazanfar for four through extra cover. He started the 44th with another boundary - this time over Ghazanfar's head - before nailing a sweep off Rashid to propel Bangladesh forward.Seeing that, Mehidy had a change of heart too. With five overs left, he lapped and reverse scooped Omarzai for consecutive boundaries, although perished in the same over when he skied one to extra cover. With Bangladesh at 217 and only 24 balls left, it was down to Mahmudullah to provide the finishing touches; and the double dose of fortune he enjoyed in the 47th over was just what Bangladesh needed for a competitive total.Mahmudullah was given out lbw off Rashid to start the over, but used DRS to overturn the decision. Two legal balls later, he drove back hard at Rashid, who dropped a difficult catch, his hands stung by the blow. Mahmudullah ended with another six over midwicket - this one off Farooqi. He was on 97 with one ball remaining. Omarzai swung one into off, which Mahmudullah could only clip behind square to be run-out while attempting a second.Himanshu Agrawal is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfoBANAFG100%50%100%BAN InningsAFG InningsOver 49 • AFG 246/5Afghanistan won by 5 wickets (with 10 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsInstant answers to T20 questions",
