Salt knuckled down to play his longest ODI innings and lift England from peril at 24 for 4, before Mousley's maiden international fifty and some lower-order hitting helped them up to a far more challenging total than had seemed likely.West Indies were well on top through the first half of the innings, but Salt put on consecutive stands of 70 with Sam Curran and Mousley to provide the semblance of a contest. An injury suffered by Romario Shepherd, who caught his studs in the turf at the start of his seventh over and had to be helped from the field, caused further disruption for West Indies, with brisk cameos from Jamie Overton (32 off 21) and Jofra Archer (38 off 17) helping England to add exactly 100 from the last ten overs.Both captains had wanted to bowl first, with Shai Hope saying \"we're not sure what we're going to get\" from the Kensington Oval surface. With just enough assistance for the seamers plugging away on a good length, West Indies made the best of conditions early on to have England four down and tottering inside the first powerplay.The main source of discomfort for West Indies early on came via an extraordinary on-field contretemps between Alzarri Joseph and Hope, the fast bowler seemingly unhappy with the field set for England's No. 3, Jordan Cox. Joseph could be seen repeatedly remonstrating with his captain from the top of his run-up, and he took his frustration out on the batter, Cox barely seeing a 148kph/92mph lifter that flicked the glove on its way through. Joseph didn't celebrate and walked off at the end of the over, briefly leaving West Indies with 10 men on the field.Matthew Forde had already struck in his second over, responding to being driven for four by Will Jacks with a similar delivery that went away just enough to take the outside edge. Shepherd then enjoyed immediate success when replacing Joseph, as Jacob Bethell slashed at a wide delivery only to be spectacularly held by the leaping Roston Chase at point. Back-to-back maidens followed and when Liam Livingstone fell to another catch at the wicket trying to force a drive off Shepherd, England were flatlining at 24 for 4 with one ball left in the powerplay.One of the England batters still standing was Salt. His half-century in the second ODI was the first time he had batted through the powerplay since June 2022, but he backed up that effort in Barbados - albeit 11 not out off 26 balls told of England's struggle. His one boundary had come via a crisp punch down the ground off Forde, and it wasn't until his 53rd ball that he struck another, heaving cross-batted over midwicket when Shepherd dropped short.Salt, crucially, found a proactive partner in Curran, again up the order at No. 6. He showed more fluency than any England batter to come before him, striking Forde and the returning Joseph for boundaries then greeting the introduction of Gudakesh Motie's left-arm spin with another driven four through the covers.Motie was again picked off in the 19th as Curran went over the head of mid-off, before Salt began to increase the tempo. His six off Shepherd brought up the 50 stand, and he found the boundary again a few overs later with a flat thrash through backward point. But with both batters in the 40s, Roston Chase conjured the breakthrough - two dots balls enough to goad Curran into trying to go big only to skew a catch to mid-off.Salt continued to grind away, bringing up a 79-ball half-century - by far the slowest of his five in ODIs - although he might have fallen shortly after when Chase couldn't get his fingers under the ball at backward point. At the other end, Mousley, in his third international innings, set about aiding the rebuilding effort. The Warwickshire allrounder showcased his ability against spin, scoring his first boundary with a trademark reverse-sweep off Motie before stepping out to deposit Chase over the rope at long-on as the sixth-wicket pair assembled another half-century stand.England were 163 for 5 after 40 overs, eyeing up a strong finish, only to lose Salt to the third ball of the final powerplay. Forde's cutter made the attempt to club the ball over midwicket all the more difficult but it still needed a brilliant running catch from Brandon King out on the boundary, coupled with the awareness to almost immediately release the ball as he went over the rope for Joseph to complete the dismissal.The injury to Shepherd, whose errant delivery was swatted for four by Mousley to add insult, left West Indies a bowler down at the death, with Hope forced to turn to Sherfane Rutherford - and his 3.5 overs of occasional medium pace ended up costing 57 runs. Having got going with a four off Rutherford, Overton hoisted Joseph over long-off for only the third six of the innings before Mousley brought up his fifty, from 64 balls, in the same over.Mousley was caught on the midwicket boundary off Joseph but Overton and Archer swung the bat with gusto through the closing stages - the latter making his highest score for England in any format, skelping Rutherford for four consecutive boundaries (one of which was a no-ball) during a final over that cost 25.Alan Gardner is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo. @alanroderickENGWI100%50%100%ENG InningsWI InningsCurrent Over 38 • WI 225/1WI needed 39 runs from 75 ballsPowered by Smart StatsInstant answers to T20 questionsPlayer NameRBBA Kingnot out95111E Lewiscaught1917KU Cartynot out10498Extras(lb 5, w 6)Total229(1 wkt; 37.4 ovs)\u003c1 / 3\u003e",
