  "text": "MS Dhoni in action during IPL 2025© AFP Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni on Tuesday said the rebuilding process for next year has already begun for the team after a forgettable campaign in the ongoing Indian Premier League. CSK are struggling in the bottom of the points table after a wretched campaign in which they became the first team to be knocked out of the playoffs reckoning. Dhoni, under whose captaincy the franchise has won five IPL titles in the past, had handed over leadership duties to Ruturaj Gaikwad before the start of 2024 season but was brought back to lead the side after an injury to the much younger skipper. \"I think we have already started that process,\" Dhoni said at the toss for their penultimate match against Rajasthan Royals. \"When it comes to our batting department, we want to express ourselves. That's what we did in the last few games. We want to move ahead with it.\"Bowling, we have gone for some runs. Maybe we need one extra bowler who can bowl after the powerplay. We have done well in the last couple of games and we want to continue in the same way,\" the talisman added.CSK have just six points after 12 matches this season, a performance that is a far cry from their incredible exploits of the past when they often dominated the league.Dhoni said the team got down to focus on planning for the future once their playoff hopes were over this season.\"One of the main things when we were out of the tournament was to get answers. It's about getting that combination right and getting that one player in the XI who you can target in the auction.\"At the start of the season, we struggled in the batting department. We have improved in it. It's about sealing your spot for the players going forward.\" After the game against RR, CSK will end their campaign with a match against Gujarat Titans.\"When you are in pressure, you find yourselves looking for options. In these games, you have the opportunity to express yourselves and play your shots. What we have seen from the other teams is that you can play good cricketing shots and have a good strike rate,\" said Dhoni. Topics mentioned in this article",
