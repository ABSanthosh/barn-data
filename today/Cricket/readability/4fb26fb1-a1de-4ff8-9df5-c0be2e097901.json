The draft takes place next Wednesday, with a total of 37 places to be filled in the men’s side and 29 in the women’s squads.Anderson hinted at his interest shortly after swapping his England whites for a consulting role on the coaching staff, saying: “Watching the Hundred this year, seeing the ball swing around, it makes me feel like I could do a job there. There’s definitely a bit of intrigue with the shorter formats because I’ve not played any franchise stuff before.”When the competition first launched, Anderson was notionally affiliated in a non-playing capacity to Manchester Originals – whose home ground of Old Trafford boasts the James Anderson End – but that link was never formalised. The Originals have five spots open in the squad – ranging from the top £200,000 pay bracket to a spot at £63,000 – and space for a senior pace bowler in their ranks.A host of capped England players are up for grabs, including the likes of Jason Roy, Dawid Malan, Rehan Ahmed, Zak Crawley and Dan Lawrence, while there could be interest in rising stars like Rocky Flintoff, Archie Vaughan and Ben McKinney. For those registered in the draft but unsuccessful this time, there is another chance to be picked up as a wildcard signing later in the season.",
