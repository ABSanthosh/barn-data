England were whitewashed in the Ashes 16-0 with barely a whimper and plagued by accusations of fitness and attitude problems. After a review, the head coach Jon Lewis and the captain Heather Knight were sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board.Edwards’ immediate challenges are home series against India and West Indies, before the 50-over World Cup in India and a home T20 World Cup in 2026. But, most urgently, she must appoint a new captain from slim pickings before England’s first game against West Indies at Canterbury on 21 May.“It means the world to me to have the three lions on my chest once again,” Edwards said. “Leading England as captain was my life for 10 years and I will forever be passionate about this team and our legacy. We have such a talented group of players, and I am excited about working with them and improving them both as individuals and as a team.Charlotte Edwards won both the 50- and 20-over World Cups as England captain.

There’s also the mouth-watering prospect of the first ever Olympics for women’s cricket in LA 2028. I’m relishing the prospect of winning trophies and taking this team forward.”The 45-year-old’s illustrious England career, in which she won five Ashes series and both the 50- and 20-over World Cups, came to an end in 2016 when, after 10 years as captain, she was ushered out of the job by the then coach, Mark Robinson.Since hanging up her playing boots in 2018, Edwards has proved to be an equally adept coach. Her achievements include two Women’s Premier League titles with Mumbai Indians, the Hundred in 2023 with Southern Brave and five domestic trophies with the dominant Southern Vipers. She will leave her job at Hampshire to join England.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionClare Connor, the managing director of women’s cricket at the ECB, called Edwards “a proven winner”. “When we drew up the criteria for the job it became apparent very quickly that Charlotte was the outstanding candidate.“She has the experience, passion and expertise to lead this team to success. The results she has achieved as a head coach in multiple environments, since retiring as one of the greatest ever England players, is testament to her relentless drive and the standards she sets for those around her.”",
