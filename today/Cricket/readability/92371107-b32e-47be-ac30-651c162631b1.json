Rabada, who sits second in the International Cricket Council Test bowling rankings, returned home after playing two matches with Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League last month.The Titans said at the time he had done so to tend to an “important personal matter” and the 29-year-old disclosed this was due to returning an adverse analytical finding for a recreational substance.Rabada, who is due to lead South Africa’s attack in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s next month, expressed his regret at his actions and is already looking at drawing a line under the incident although it is unclear when he will be able to resume his career.“I am deeply sorry to all those that I have let down,” he said in a statement released by the South African Cricketers’ Association, the country’s players’ union. “I will never take the privilege of playing cricket for granted. This privilege is much larger than me. It goes beyond my personal aspirations. I am serving a provisional suspension and I am looking forward to returning to the game I love playing.“This moment will not define me. I will keep doing what I have always done, continuously working hard and playing with passion and devotion to my craft.”Rabada underlined his status as South Africa’s pace spearhead and one of the world’s finest bowlers when he became the quickest to reach 300 Test wickets in terms of balls bowled in October last year. He briefly shot back up to the top of the ICC’s Test bowling standings, having first gone to the summit in January 2018, but he has since been leapfrogged by India’s Jasprit Bumrah.Rabada has taken 327 wickets at an average of 22 from 70 Tests while he has amassed a further 168 dismissals in 108 ODIs and 71 wickets in 65 T20 internationals.Cricket South Africa (CSA) confirmed in a statement that Rabada had “returned an adverse analytical finding for the use of a prohibited substance,” before adding: “The incident is regrettable, however, Rabada has reassured CSA and his fans of his commitment to upholding professional standards and has restated his passion to the sport of cricket and the country he represents with purpose.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“CSA is fully committed to drug-free sport and reminds cricket players, both professional and amateur, of the importance of adhering to all regulations.
