  "text": "Yorkshire have become the first team to agree to sell their entire stake in a Hundred team.The Sun Group, owners of Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad, have paid just over £100m for a 100% stake in Northern Superchargers, who are based at Yorkshire's home Headingley.Superchargers are the sixth team to secure the investment, with the Sun Group the first to take full ownership of a franchise.Yorkshire said in a statement that Sunrisers are \"renowned around the world\" and the partnership will \"supercharge the success of the team, and Yorkshire cricket, in the coming years\". Chief executive Sanjay Patel said the agreement was \"a huge milestone\" for the county.\"Having been in consultation with them for some time now, it is clear that they are aligned to the values and future direction of the club and will play a huge part in ensuring we can go on to achieve great success in the coming years,\" he added.Last week Surrey negotiated a £60m price with the owners of Mumbai Indians for a 49% stake in the Oval Invincibles, while keeping the 51% given to them by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).Warwickshire agreed a 49% sale of Birmingham Phoenix to Birmingham City owners Knighthead Capital for £40m and Glamorgan sold the same stake in Welsh Fire to IT entrepreneur Sanjay Govil for £40m.A price of £145m for 49% of Lord's-based London Spirit was agreed between MCC and a Silicon Valley consortium led by Nikesh Arora, while Lancashire became the first county to sell part of their share when agreeing a deal for 70% of the Originals with the owners of Lucknow Super Giants for around £81m.Nottinghamshire are also set to sell a 49% stake in Trent Rockets in the coming days.Billionaire Greek shipping magnate Evangelos Marinakis, who owns Nottingham Forest, was linked with a bid for the Rockets last year.However, a source close to the bidding said Marinakis did not follow up on his initial interest in the Trent Bridge-based franchise.Nottinghamshire have not publicly courted bids from the IPL, but at least one unnamed team are said to be interested.Southern Brave are likely to go to the co-owners of Delhi Capitals after their buyout of hosts Hampshire.The six sales so far come to a total of around £466m, the majority of which will be split among the 18 first-class counties, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and recreational game.It means the value of the six teams in their entirety comes to around £740m.Yorkshire's sale comes after chair Colin Graves said the club, which is owned by members, must become a private structure in order to survive a financial crisis. It owes almost £15m to the Graves family trust, with overall debts of more than £20m.However, with the county set to bank almost £60m thanks to the sale of the Hundred franchises, the controversial plans could be scrapped.All deals now enter an eight-week exclusivity period in order to finalise the partnerships.The Sun Group also own Sunrisers Eastern Cape in the South African T20 league, the SA20.",
