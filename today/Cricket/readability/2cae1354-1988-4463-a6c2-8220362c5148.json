  "text": "Jofra Archer should not play in England's second Test against India at Edgbaston, says former captain Michael Vaughan. Archer played in his first first-class match for four years this week as he seeks to prove his fitness for a return to the Test arena, where he has not featured since 2021.England selector Luke Wright said earlier this month that if Archer comes through the four-day game for Sussex he could be available for the second Test, which starts on 2 July.\"The good thing is that Jofra is back in the equation - but I'd like to see him play another four-day game,\" said Vaughan, who is now a BBC Test Match Special pundit.\"He's not played the longer format for four years so why, on the back of one game for Sussex against Durham, would you rush him back?\"We know the intensity at Test-match level is so different to county cricket. Let him play another four-day game - I would go with the same line-up, as long as the bowlers are fine and there are no niggles.\" The 30-year-old finished with figures of 1-32 from 18 overs in Durham's first innings, his sole wicket being that of opener Emilio Gay, but Sussex head coach Paul Farbrace also urged England to \"be careful\" with Archer. \"He bowled with good pace, good accuracy and his body's in good shape which is fantastic,\" Farbrace told BBC 5 Sports Extra.\"We would all love to see Jofra playing for England because he makes England a much better team, and he would give them a much better chance of winning the big series. \"But let's look after him, let's be careful with him. The conversation we'd had [with England] was that he would play in this game, and then we'd reassess.\"All I will report back to them is that he bowled nicely, he looks like he's in good rhythm, he's bowled 18 overs and it's up to them whether they pick him.\"Archer emerged as one of England's most exciting prospects in 2019 when he bowled the decisive super over in the home World Cup win, before taking 22 wickets at 20.27 across four Tests in the Ashes series that followed. But he has since been plagued by injury - an elbow issue first suffered in 2020 has required several surgeries and he also had a stress fracture in his back in 2022. As a result, Archer's frequent attempts to return to international cricket have been stop-start. He was expected to play in the white-ball series against West Indies at the beginning of this summer but hurt his thumb while playing in the Indian Premier League.Sussex start another County Championship game against Warwickshire on Sunday, which would overlap with the second Test - and Vaughan has backed the bowlers who played in the first Test to be selected again.\"Josh Tongue, the hoover, let him do that again at Edgbaston,\" Vaughan said, referring to the Nottinghamshire seamer's ability to knock over the lower order as he did in both innings at Headingley. \"Chris Woakes needs more of a run out, and then Ben Stokes and Brydon Carse have been fantastic. They're 1-0 up, played some great cricket, so go with the same again.\"",
