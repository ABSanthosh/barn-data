  "text": "Indian Premier League, MullanpurPunjab Kings 219-6 (20 overs): Arya 103 (42)Chennai Super Kings 201-5 (20 overs): Conway 69 (49); Ferguson 2-40Punjab Kings won by 18 runsScorecardOpener Priyansh Arya raced to the second century of the 2025 Indian Premier League with a thrilling 103 from 42 balls in Punjab Kings' 18-run win against Chennai Super Kings.With wickets tumbling around him the 24-year-old left-hander thrashed nine sixes to reach his century in 39 balls and help Punjab reach 219-6.That made his ton the joint fourth-fastest in IPL history and the second-fastest by an Indian, behind Yusuf Pathan's 37-ball hundred in 2010.Arya clubbed the first ball of the match for six over point and was then dropped next ball by bowler Khaleel Ahmed in his follow-through.He was put down again on 35, by Vijay Shankar diving one-handed at backward point, and on 74 he could have been caught at long-off but Mukesh Choudhary stood on the boundary rope.Still, Arya, playing in his first IPL, produced a range of devastating shots, particularly through the off-side as he joined Sunrisers Hyderabad's Ishan Kishan in hitting a century at this year's tournament.Having reached 50 in just 19 deliveries, he hit seamer Matheesha Pathirana for three successive sixes to kick on again.He was finally caught at long-on in the 14th over but had dominated the scoring in taking the score to 154-6. Shashank Singh added a further 52 not out late on.Chennai threatened in pursuing their imposing target but ended on 201-5 and have now lost four matches in a row.New Zealand's Devon Conway hit 69 before retiring out with 13 balls to go, to bring in Ravindra Jadeja. MS Dhoni struck three sixes but, with 28 needed, was smartly caught at short fine leg by Yuzvendra Chahal at the start of the final over.Punjab are one of five teams at the top of the table on six points, while Chennai are second bottom on two.Arya's knock comes after he was bowled for a first-ball duck by England pace bowler Jofra Archer in Punjab's previous match.A former India Under-19 international, Arya caught the eye last year by hitting six sixes in an over in a T20 match in the Delhi Premier League.However, a timely century in December helped him earn his IPL chance.He hit 102 from 43 balls for Delhi against Uttar Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy - India's domestic T20 competition below the IPL - just a day before the 2025 mega auction.That resulted in a bidding war between Punjab, Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru for his services and he was signed for around £350,000 (3.80 crore rupees).He then impressed the Ricky Ponting-led Kings in pre-season practice matches and was given his chance.\"The first practice game we played, after eight balls we all looked at each other and nodded our heads and said 'he has got to play',\" Punjab's assistant coach Brad Haddin said.\"He hit four or five sixes in his first few deliveries and we said 'wow this is different'.\"Arya scored 47 on his IPL debut against Gujarat Titans last month but followed that with eight against Lucknow Super Giants and his golden duck against Archer's Rajasthan Royals.\"He just walked off and said 'I got a good one',\" Haddin said of the Archer dismissal. \"That is what you want. You want your young kids playing with no fear. \"The way he responded to getting out first ball was first-class.\"",
