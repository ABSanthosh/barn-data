Karun looked in stunning form as he slammed a 22-ball half-century and dominated proceedings against Bumrah. He was ultimately dismissed for a 40-ball 89 but his performance earned him a lot of praise. Nair had a small collision with Bumrah while running behind the wickets and that was the start of the argument between the two players. Bumrah was absolutely fuming and after Karun explained his side, things settled down a bit. Karun even had a conversation with Hardik but Rohit Sharma's reaction to the entire situation has already gone viral.
