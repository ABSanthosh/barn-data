  "text": "England are \"hopeful\" that Ben Stokes will be fit to bowl them to a series win on Sunday after KL Rahul and Shubman Gill exposed their reliance on his old-ball threat in Manchester. Stokes, the leading wicket-taker in the series, was deemed too \"stiff and sore\" to bowl during the first 63 overs of India's second innings at Old Trafford and will be assessed overnight by England's medical team.Rahul and Gill added an unbroken 174 for the third wicket in 62.1 overs as India recovered from a nightmare start to bat through two full sessions unscathed. Barring one drop at backward point by Liam Dawson off Brydon Carse, England's seamers struggled to create chances once the ball went soft and missed Stokes' ability to break the game open single-handedly.Stokes prepared to face India with a gruelling rehabilitation programme following hamstring surgery in January and has bowled 129 overs to date, his personal record for a Test series. He retired hurt on the third day after suffering cramp in his left leg but returned later in the evening, going on to score his first Test century in more than two years on the fourth day.Gill, Rahul have their task cut out as India look to bat timeIronman Stokes beats his body and recaptures his peakEngland play down workload concerns after Stokes retires hurt with crampA rare double for Stokes as England score the highest Test total at Old TraffordSuperman Stokes puts England in command but Rahul, Gill keep India in the fight\"He's a bit stiff and sore,\" Marcus Trescothick, England's assistant coach, said, when asked if Stokes would bowl on Sunday. \"He's had quite a big workload in the last few weeks, and then batting in the first innings, he was getting quite a bit of cramp. We are hoping that with another night's rest and a bit more physio work overnight, he'll be back and doing a bit tomorrow.\"Stokes was seen clutching his hamstring while chasing a ball in the outfield, but Trescothick played down the concern. \"It's just a build-up,\" he said. \"It's just such a heavy workload, from where he's been to what he's doing. It's just trying to monitor it, and obviously the cramp that he was getting yesterday, you have that little bit of worry… We'll see what he's like tomorrow.\"After managing his workload carefully across the first two-and-a-half Tests, Stokes bowled 19.2 overs on the final day of their win at Lord's last week and said he spent \"four days in bed\" recovering. He bowled another 24 overs across the first two days in Manchester, taking 5 for 72, but appears to have struggled to recover from such a high volume of overs.Trescothick suggested that England had never planned to bowl Stokes on the fourth afternoon in the belief that his body would benefit from a break, and said that he had gone out to field despite his stiffness to ensure that he is allowed to bowl on the fifth day. \"If he was off the field [today], then he wouldn't be able to come back and bowl tomorrow,\" he explained.Stokes will skip the Hundred next month and has not played a white-ball international for nearly two years, meaning that he may not play competitively between the end of the fifth Test at The Oval next week and the start of the Ashes in November.Michael Vaughan, the ex-England captain, said that England's hope in Australia will rely on his fitness. \"We saw today how much he is missed,\" he said on the BBC's Test Match Special. \"My fingers are crossed that we don't have a moment before the Ashes or in that first Test in Perth.\"I honestly look at this England side and everything they're delivering and think, in Australia, they have a great chance if he's fit. If Ben Stokes is injured [...] and can just be the batter, it has a huge impact on the outcome of an Ashes series overseas.\"Matt Roller is senior correspondent at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",
