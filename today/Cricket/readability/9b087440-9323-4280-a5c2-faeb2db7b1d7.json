  "text": "Former New Zealand captain Tim Southee has announced he will be retiring from Test cricket later this year.Southee, 35, will call time on his Test career following the three-match series with England across November and December, unless the Black Caps qualify for next year's World Test Championship final.Southee's final Test will be at his home ground of Seddon Park in Hamilton between 13 and 18 December.\"Representing New Zealand was all I ever dreamed of growing up,\" Southee said.\"To play for the Black Caps for 18 years has been the greatest honour and privilege, but the time feels right to now step away from the game that has given so much to me.\"It's been an amazing ride and I wouldn't change a thing.\"Southee was part of the New Zealand side that won the inaugural World Test Championship final in 2021.He succeeded Kane Williamson as Test captain in December 2022, standing down from the position, now filled by Tom Latham, last month.The fast bowler has played 102 Test matches, taking 385 wickets at an average of 29.87, second to only Richard Hadlee (431) for most Test wickets as a New Zealand bowler.He is also the only player to have taken more than 300 Test, 200 one-day international and 100 Twenty20 international wickets.\"Tim's durability and resilience has been outstanding,\" said Black Caps head coach Gary Stead.\"He's an incredibly tough competitor who gets himself up for big occasions and is rarely injured.\"Tim cares deeply about the team, its reputation and performances, and he will be missed within the Black Caps environment.\"Following the England Test series next month, New Zealand face Sri Lanka in a white ball series. Southee is yet to decide whether he will feature in those matches.Southee will continue playing domestic and franchise cricket following his Test retirement.The Black Caps have also named uncapped duo Nathan Smith and Jacob Duffy in their squad for the series against England.It is a maiden call-up for all-rounder Smith, 26, who made his international debut in a one-day international against Sri Lanka in November.Kane Williamson returns to the squad after missing the series win in India because of a groin injury, while left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner will join the group for the second and third Tests.New Zealand squad to face England: Tom Latham (c), Tom Blundell (wk), Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner (second \u0026 third Tests), Nathan Smith, Tim Southee, Kane Williamson, Will Young.",
