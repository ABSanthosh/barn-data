Pakistan's nightmare, Mark Chapman, will miss the game at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, owing to a hamstring injury. Tim Seifert, who was announced as Chapman's replacement in the second ODI, will continue to serve as his replacement. Chapman picked up the injury during the series-opener in Napier last week.
