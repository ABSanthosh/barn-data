Agarwal looks to help it over square-leg, seemingly in two minds, but finds Arshdeep Singh in the deep.RCB 56/2 (6.2) RCB vs PBKS LIVE: 55 in powerplay A hotly-contested powerplay here. RCB going at just over 9 runs an over. They got a fast start from Phil Salt, but Kyle Jamieson took the big wicket in the second over of the match. Decent start by Kohli and Agarwal, but nothing breathtaking yet.RCB 55/1 (6) IPL 2025 Final LIVE: Chance, but 4! 50 up for RCB Mayank Agarwal sends it very high into the air, Arshdeep Singh gives chase but fails to hold on and it goes for 4.

Shorter by Jamieson and a brilliant square-cut from Mayank to guide it for 4 through point. Gets a charged-up fist bump from Kohli after that shot. RCB going well in the powerplay.RCB 39/1 (3.3) IPL 2025 Final LIVE: FOUR, Kohli! First boundary for Virat Kohli in the IPL 2025 final!

Mayank Agarwal to the party! It was turning out to be a good over from Arshdeep, but Mayank cashes in on the final ball of the over. Excellent shot, over mid-off, maximum. Great shot for 6. 11 off the over.RCB 30/1 (3) RCB vs PBKS LIVE: Great over by Jamieson Superb over by Jamieson. Two brilliant balls to Mayank Agarwal, the new batter.

BIG WICKET! Phil Salt is gone! Punjab Kings strike back. Jamieson with a slower ball, Phil Salt goes for the big shot but ends up skying it.
