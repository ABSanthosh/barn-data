It is to catch the people who did this.\"They escaped with jewellery, other valuables and a good deal of personal items. Many of those items have real sentimental value for me and my family. They are irreplaceable.\"This is an appeal for any help in finding these people who carried out this act.\"As well as the medal, Stokes posted pictures of three necklaces, a ring and a designer bag.He encouraged anyone with information to call Durham Constabulary on 101 quoting crime reference CRI00575927.A number of footballers have had their homes burgled while away playing in recent years, including Raheem Sterling during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
