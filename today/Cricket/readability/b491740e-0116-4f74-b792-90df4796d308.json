  "text": "A day before the first one-day international against West Indies, England’s players were up and about early on the Colts Ground opposite Aldi. Harry Brook starts as their new permanent white‑ball captain in this sold‑out day‑nighter, a game with eighth hosting ninth in the middle aisle of the men’s ODI rankings.Those rankings sometimes elicit a shrug among the major nations but neither side is one at present. South Africa and Zimbabwe are hosts of the 14-team World Cup in 2027, after which the next eight spots are booked via the International Cricket Council ladder in March that year. West Indies know all about the perils of the qualifying tournament for the other countries, with the original world champions – winners in 1975 – missing out on the 2023 edition in India.Even with the 50-over format on the retreat globally there is a fair bit of cricket to go before then and England could simply do with a series win to start Brook’s captaincy. The role came up after a winter of discontent that led to Jos Buttler falling on his sword: in six ODIs this year they have mustered six defeats, with those against Australia, Afghanistan and South Africa in Pakistan leading to them ending the Champions Trophy at the bottom of the heap.“We are going to bring a lot of energy, competitiveness and fun,” Brook said, setting out the vision he and the head coach, Brendon McCullum, have for this new phase. “We want to try to put opposition bowlers under pressure from their best balls. I feel when I’m batting my best, I do that quite often.”Brook cited Ben Stokes as his leadership muse and in time he could well be his successor as Test captain. The Yorkshireman also put the struggles that followed Buttler’s T20 World Cup win in 2022 down to never having his full-strength side for bilateral series, something he and McCullum are seeking to change.Buttler was actually absent from the optional training on Wednesday, less to give Brook some space and more because he has only just returned from the Indian Premier League. West Indies did not quite have England’s financial muscle to withdraw their players after Operation Sindoor – India’s recent missile strikes on Pakistan – pushed back the end of the IPL. Sherfane Rutherford and Romario Shepherd were in their original squad but are staying in India to complete the tournament.Harry Brook will take charge of his first game as England’s white-ball captain against West Indies at Edgbaston. Photograph: Joe Giddens/PAThe new-look England do not actually feature any new faces, rather some of the recent faces playing in new positions. Brydon Carse returns to give the attack some snarl after a toe injury, while the statement move, if it can be called that, is to promote Jamie Smith to open alongside Ben Duckett – a plan McCullum first floated in Pakistan when Smith was parachuted into No 3 and made scores of 15, nine and nought.“[McCullum] just had this burning desire that Smudge could be an amazing opening batter in one-day cricket,” said Brook, confirming that Buttler would be taking the wicketkeeping gloves. Smith has been promised a long run to make the position his own, with McCullum believing he has the game to ransack the powerplay.Quick GuideEngland v West Indies: first ODI lineupsShowEngland (confirmed): Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood.West Indies (possible): Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Keacy Carty, Shai Hope (wk \u0026 c), Amir Jangoo, Roston Chase, Justin Greaves, Matthew Forde, Alzarri Joseph, Gudakesh Motie, Jayden Seales.Another being backed for a “quite a while” is Jacob Bethell, who has not played for England since a hamstring injury in February but is another returned from the IPL. Unlike the Test team, there is no ambiguity about the 21-year-old coming straight back in and this means operating as one of two spin‑bowling all-rounders alongside Will Jacks.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionBethell was late on parade in the morning and looked no older than some of the net bowlers England had roped in from the local leagues. But chatter about what this left-hander might achieve has been following him since his days growing up in Barbados; chatter to which Shai Hope, the West Indies captain, was happy to contribute.“I first saw him at under-15s on the Police Ground in Weymouth,” said Hope, whose side are fresh from a 1-1 series draw in Ireland. “Seeing what he’s done over the last couple of months, internationally, franchise cricket as well, he’s certainly a formidable talent; one of those players who can go a very long way.“Every time I play against him, every time I see him, yes, he’s not necessarily full-on Bajan [these days], but it’s great to be around him, it gives me a sense of home. I’m happy for him, seeing the success he’s had … but we are enemies this time.”There was a twinkle in Hope’s eye. This is the friendliest of rivalries even if Bethell turning out for England – as part of the IPL contingent who have returned in time – underlines how the playing field is not exactly level.",
