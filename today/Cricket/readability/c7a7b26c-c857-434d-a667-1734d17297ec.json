He survived the lbw shout and the subsequent DRS review, but the immediate swelling and his inability to impart any weight on the foot were worrying signs for India.Pant, India's wicketkeeper and vice-captain, needed the help of a golf-style buggy to get off the field following medical attention from India's coaching staff. He was taken to the medical facility at the ground, where captain Shubman Gill went to see him, and then to a hospital for scans.Liam Dawson, the England spinner who was on the field at the moment, said he wished the best for Pant but \"can't see him playing much more part in this game\". B Sai Sudharsan, who was the non-striker at the moment, described the pain he was in.\"Oh, he was in a lot of pain definitely,\" Sudharsan said. \"But they've gone for scans. We will get to know [more] overnight.\"Sudharsan was asked how much of a loss it would be if the injury turned out to be serious. \"Obviously, he was batting really well,\" Sudharsan said. \"We will miss a batter if he doesn't come back again. So it will definitely have consequences, but at the same time, the batters we have batting right now and there are a few more allrounders inside. So we will try and give our best and bat long so that we negotiate that loss well.\"Pant's innings of 37 off 48 balls was largely restrained but featured several characteristically outrageous shots, including a slog sweep for four off Jofra Archer, followed by an unsuccessful reverse sweep off the next ball.This is the second injury he has sustained in as many Test matches, following a blow on his left index finger while keeping wicket in England's first innings at Lord's. Dhruv Jurel substituted as India's wicketkeeper for the rest of that Test match. Though Pant was in discomfort while batting, he was cleared to play in Manchester.Matt Roller is senior correspondent at ESPNcricinfo. @mroller98",
