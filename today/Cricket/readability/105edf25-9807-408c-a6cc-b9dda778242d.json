  "text": "The 2025 Champions Trophy is set to be played in Pakistan in February but the latest updates suggest the tournament could be shifted out of the country to accommodate India, who are reportedly not willing to travel to the country. The political tensions between the two neighbouring countries have limited game time between them to exclusively ICC events since 2013. While Pakistan have travelled to India four times for different ICC events since then, including for the Women’s ODI World Cup in 2013 and the T20 event three years later, India have not toured Pakistan even once. The last time India went to Pakistan was in 2008. In 2023, the Men’s Asia Cup was scheduled to be hosted in Pakistan but was later switched to a hybrid model, with India playing all their games in Sri Lanka. The 2025 Champions Trophy will be the first time in 28 years that Pakistan will host an ICC event, however, their plans could be in jeopardy according to the latest reports. Will Pakistan host the Champions Trophy? Preparations for the tournament are in full flow in the country, with Karachi recently losing the Test against England due to renovations at the stadium. There have also been several visits by the ICC delegation to inspect the work at the venues in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Karachi. Even though India’s schedule remained unclear, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi has remained hopeful the team will arrive in Pakistan. According to reports on October 9, the ICC is looking at three options for next year’s Champions Trophy. While the hosting rights will remain with Pakistan, the options of a hybrid model, with India’s games being held in Dubai, are being floated. The ICC are also looking at hosting the entire event outside Pakistan with Dubai, Sri Lanka or South Africa emerging as the top contenders. If both Pakistan and India qualify for the final, originally scheduled to be held in Pakistan, top sources suggest that the summit clash will be played at a different venue. A spokesperson in the PCB quashed the rumours. “There is absolutely no truth to the reports suggesting that the Champions Trophy final could be moved outside Pakistan. We are working diligently to ensure that all preparations for the tournament are on track, and we are confident that Pakistan will be able to host a memorable event.” Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
