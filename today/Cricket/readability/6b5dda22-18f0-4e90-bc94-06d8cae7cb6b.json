They will remain in Perth and not travel with the rest of the Sydney Thunder squad on Saturday while they await results of CT scans to assess any further injuries.Ollie Davies and Hugh Weibgen were brought into the Thunder side as concussion substitutes. Davies was in the team hotel at the time of the accident with a virus and quickly made his way to the ground.The incident happen in the 16th over of Scorchers' innings, when Cooper Connolly hit Lockie Ferguson aerially on the leg side. Sams sprinted from the infield with eyes on the ball. At the same time, Bancroft also ran in at full speed from the outfield. They crashed into each other, knocking their heads.The Thunder players quickly ran to the pair, who lay motionless on the ground, and frantically gestured for medical support, which came immediately.Sams appeared to be knocked out and was stretchered off in a mini-ambulance, while Bancroft managed to walk off the ground with a physio's support with blood gushing from his nose.Play was halted for about 20 minutes as Thunder captain David Warner and the team's coaches were involved in discussions with match officials.\"They both are in the hospital, so I'm praying that they can come out soon and be back on the park,\" said Sherfane Rutherford, who hit a boundary off the last ball to lift Thunder to a four-wicket victory. \"I actually saw everything but when I saw the blood, I turned because I'm not a fan of blood. It was pretty tough.\"It was definitely motivation for us. We had a little chat before we went out to bat and it was just [do it] for them.\"Tristan Lavalette is a journalist based in Perth",
