Chief selector George Bailey confirmed on Friday that Labuschagne would miss next week’s first Test against the West Indies.Steve Smith will also miss the match as he recovers from his dislocated finger, with medical staff to assess him ahead of the second Test. Josh Inglis will come into the XI, while it is expected Konstas will open, but Australia will unveil their batting order and bowling attack closer to the start of the first Test next Wednesday.It is the decision to drop Labuschagne that will be the biggest talking point since Bailey took over as chief selector in 2021. Labuschagne was the top-ranked Test batter in the world as recently as two years ago, but has averaged just 27.82 for the past 12 months.He was moved from his regular spot at No 3 to open in the World Test Championship final loss to South Africa last week, for returns of 17 and 22.“Marnus at his best can be a really important member of this team. He understands his output hasn’t been at the level we, or he, expects,” Bailey said in a statement. “We will continue working with him on the areas of his game we feel he needs to rediscover.“We continue to value his skill and expect him to work through the challenge positively.”Konstas’s recall comes after he was left out of the team for Sri Lanka, following the teenager’s high-profile start to Test life with a half-century on debut on Boxing Day against India.Selectors opted to go with Travis Head at the top of the order in Galle, given their preference to have him open on spinning wickets. But that move was only ever temporary, leaving the opening spot free for Labuschagne at Lord’s last week and now seemingly Konstas in the West Indies.Inglis also impressed with a century on debut in Galle in January, before being squeezed out of the side for the Test Championship final.“Steve needs more time for the wound to heal so we’ll give him another week’s rest and assess his functionality after that,” Bailey said. “We have made the decision to give Josh and Sam the opportunity to replace Steve and Marnus.“We are excited to see them get the chance to further their fledgling Test careers. In his only opportunity in Test cricket to date, Josh was outstanding in Sri Lanka, showing great intent and ability to put pressure on the opposition.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe decision to drop the 30-year-old Labuschagne comes after former coach Justin Langer urged officials to keep him in the side this week, with his experience valuable.Usman Khawaja is aged 38 and Smith 36, meaning a transition in the top order looms after David Warner’s retirement from Test cricket last year.“He’s actually a very, very important link in this chain,” Langer said on Monday. “You think about the history of Australian cricket. The best young players come in surrounded by absolute guns.“Michael Clarke, Ricky Ponting, Damien Martyn and Matthew Hayden. They come in and they’re around gun players. If you just all of a sudden bring a couple of kids in, Cameron Green’s still young to the game, and you have to bring another kid in there [to replace Labuschagne].”",
