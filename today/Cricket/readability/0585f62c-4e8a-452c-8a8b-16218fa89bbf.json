He was also a Bangladesh Premier League winner with Dhaka Gladiators in 2013, and has captained Welsh Fire in the Hundred.A powerful top-order batter, Cobb won his first match award in a Blast final for his bowling, taking 4 for 22 as Leicestershire beat Somerset to the title in 2011. Five years later, his innings of 80 off 48 balls secured Northamptonshire's second T20 title as they beat Durham at Edgbaston - the ground he will now call home in his new role.Cobb spent two weeks working with Australia's players as a consultant coach during their ODI series in England last September, an opportunity that was the result of his relationship with Andrew McDonald, his former Leicestershire team-mate. He is following his father Russell - who runs the UCCE set-up at Loughborough University - into coaching.\"Since making my debut 18 years ago, it's been a thoroughly enjoyable ride with plenty of ups and downs,\" Cobb said in a statement on Tuesday. \"I'm immensely thankful for the people I've met, places travelled, and memories created over the years. Cricket has given me so much. Scoring my first hundred at Lord's aged 18 and winning the T20 Blast Finals twice are just some of the memories I'll cherish.\"Recent graduates of the Warwickshire academy include Jacob Bethell and Dan Mousley. \"My challenge is to keep developing homegrown players that can go on to play for the Bears and England,\" Cobb said. \"I'm excited at the chance to lead an academy at such a great club like Warwickshire, one that's had a lot of success over a number of years.\"Get latest cricket updates on WhatsApp",
