  "text": "Rob Key has played down concerns about Jofra Archer’s readiness for Test cricket, insisting England could have fast-tracked his comeback sooner and saying he trusts Ben Stokes not to flog such a precious commodity.Archer, 30, was the standout name when an otherwise unchanged squad was picked for the second Test against India that starts at Edgbaston next Wednesday. But coming after a four-year absence from first-class cricket, and just 18 overs with a red ball for Sussex this past week, the selection also raised eyebrows.Among them were those of the Sussex head coach, Paul Farbrace, who fancies England should stick with the XI that secured a 1-0 lead at Headingley. Key has hinted at this being a possibility, with Archer potentially lined up for the third Test at Lord’s. Either way, England’s managing director has stressed his schedule – a diet of Twenty20 and one-day international cricket these past 18 months – has been a conservative one.“I think we’ve gone slower than we could have done,” Key said on Friday, speaking at an event for the series sponsor, Rothesay. “Jofra has been in a long period where he’s been building up and building up [in white-ball cricket]. The temptation could have been to rush him back sooner. But actually we’ve gone down this road to make sure that we’re in this position now where we’re thinking about playing him.“He could be one of the best bowlers we have had. And you only do that by doing it in Test cricket. Hopefully for the next few years we’ll be fortunate enough to see Jofra have the chance to stake that claim.”Archer’s past injury problems relate to stress fractures in the lower back and elbow, with England getting too giddy when he first burst on to the scene in the World Cup and Ashes summer of 2019. The 42 overs he sent down on an absurdly flat pitch in Mount Maunganui against New Zealand the following winter was a prime example of this, with Key expecting Stokes to avoid the mistake made by his predecessor Joe Root.Ben Stokes (right) knows how to handle an impact bowler like Jofra Archer, according to England managing director Rob Key. Photograph: ReutersKey said: “These are impact players. You don’t want them doing other roles. That’s where you need complementary skills, so you can share a bit more of the work. The temptation at times with Jofra is that he can do a bit of everything. But you’ve got to use him when he can impact the game and Ben is one of the best at that. You have got to be smart with how you use them so they can help you win a game.”A second round of midsummer County Championship matches starts this Sunday, three days before the second Test, and it may be that one or two seamers who are unlikely to feature at Edgbaston – Jamie Overton and Sam Cook missed out last week – are released to play on the third and fourth days of it, as per the regulations.If held back for Lord’s, Archer could in theory return to play the second half of the match between Sussex and Warwickshire at Hove. As the spare batter in the squad, Jacob Bethell will not be released for it, however, and will remain with England until the toss on Wednesday to provide cover for any late injuries or illness.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionKey also provided a positive update on Mark Wood, who has not featured since undergoing knee surgery after the Champions Trophy in March. The fifth Test at the end of July remains a possibility and, just as with his effective entrance midway through the 2023 Ashes, he may not need to prove his fitness with a four-day game.“Wood is someone who could turn up after bowling a bit in the nets, like he did [in 2023], and it’s 96mph, swinging the ball and hitting a length,” said Key. “We’re very fortunate he has the ability to hit his straps pretty much from the start.“Jofra is close to the Mark Wood end of the scale: a pretty pure talent, not a lot of moving parts to his action. He knows exactly what he is doing and what he is about.”",
