If you can be disappointed in how you play and get 170 that is a great effort.\"On spinner Adil Rashid: \"He is the most important player in our team. He bowled fantastically tonight, has so many variations and styles of bowling. We are so fortunate to have him on our team.\"India captain Suryakumar Yadav: \"With Hardik and Axar in we still had the game in our hands. Credit goes to Adil [Rashid], he bowled really well. We wanted to rotate the strike. That is why he is a world class bowler.\"You always learn something from a T20 game. We let them get too much at the end.\"More on this story",
