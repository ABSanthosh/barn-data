Australia's three-match ODI series starts four days after the WBBL final, leaving Healy in significant doubt for international duties.Healy opens up on injury: 'Probably took the wrong risk''Just go all out': Rodrigues looks to Australian mindsetHeat boost WBBL finals hopes, burn Sixers' chancesHealy did not keep in Sixers' last-start loss against Brisbane Heat because of body management, and had entered the tournament with a foot injury that ended her T20 World Cup early. Australia host India in three ODIs, before travelling to New Zealand over Christmas for three more one-dayers.It's understood Healy will be assessed in the next fortnight ahead of those two series, with a squad to be announced next weekend.The injury is not believed to be serious enough to have her in any current doubt for the multi-format Ashes, which begin with an ODI at North Sydney on January 12.Healy had warned on her return from her foot injury that she may need to be managed through the summer.\"There are higher powers sitting above that are quite vocal in what can and can't happen, which I completely understand,\" Healy said earlier this month.  \"Being skipper as well is a fairly big role for me. I want to be available for as much of the summer as I can.\"I've hardly played a game for the Sixers for the past two seasons, and it's a place I really enjoy playing cricket.  I want to be available for every game that I possibly can, but the reality is that might not be the case.\"It's going to be managing the pain, function and what I can and can't do [all summer]. How I pull up from games is going to be really important as well.\"Healy's injury comes as a serious blow to Sixers, who face the prospect of needing to win their last three matches to make the WBBL finals.If Healy does miss international matches, Tahlia McGrath would be expected to deputise as captain again after doing so in the World Cup.",
