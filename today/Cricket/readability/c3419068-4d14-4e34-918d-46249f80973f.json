  "text": "The third T20I between India and South Africa was stopped due to too many flying insects, which were disrupting the players. India posted 219-6 in the first innings and could bowl just one over in South Africa’s run chase before play was stopped due to a swarm of insects that were visibly hampering the players. The second innings, being played under lights, began with Arshdeep Singh taking the new ball against Ryan Rickelton. Even before the innings began, several insects were flying on the ground, later confirmed as flying ants. There were instances in the first over when the batter pulled away from his stance midway through the bowler’s run-up, rubbing his eyes, seemingly due to them. Arshdeep was seen wiping his eyes too, before the on-field umpires converged and discussed the situation with India skipper Suryakumar Yadav. Before Hardik Pandya, who was ready with the new ball at the other end, could bowl the first ball of his over, it was decided that the players walk off. On air, the commentators stated that the insects make a presence before rain. However, there were no showers till the time of writing. Earlier, Tilak Varma became the youngest India player to score a T20I ton, reaching 107 not out in 56 deliveries.
