  "text": "Bowler James Anderson is in talks with Lancashire over continuing to play for the county next summer.England's leading wicket-taker, who turns 43 in July, has not played since retiring from international duty last July.He has since worked with England as a bowling consultant but has expressed a desire to continue playing.Anderson has considered a foray into franchise cricket - he went unsold in the Indian Premier League auction in November - but is set to continue to play for the county he first represented professionally in 2001.While no deal has been agreed for Anderson to continue as an England coach next summer, it is understood Ben Stokes' side are keen for him to return.England's next Test is against Zimbabwe, starting on 22 May, and is followed by a highly-anticipated five-Test series against India from 20 June.Lancashire, who were relegated from Division One last season, have six County Championship fixtures before the Zimbabwe Test.Anderson played once for Lancashire last season before his Lord's farewell and took 7-35 against Nottinghamshire in the first innings.Anderson's retirement came after England opted to look to the future with their bowling attack and he left the international stage with 704 Test wickets - the most by a pace bowler.His first-class tally stands at 1,126 of which 376 have come for Lancashire in 95 matches since his debut in 2002.Anderson has not played any white-ball cricket since 2019 and his last T20 match was in 2014.Lancashire's T20 Blast campaign begins on 29 May.",
