He added: \"Playing under lights will be a fantastic way to celebrate both our game's rich heritage and Test cricket's modern evolution.\"It will also help ensure more people are able to attend and watch what will be a fantastic occasion. We look forward to celebrating this historic occasion further as it draws nearer.\"England's women were heavily beaten in a day-night Test at the MCG in February as part of the Women's Ashes.Australia's men have a formidable record in home Tests played under lights, winning 12 and losing just one of their 13 matches played to date. The match, which will be the latest in the season a Test has been played in Australia since the 1978-79 series against Pakistan, will be a standalone match and not part of an Ashes series or the World Test Championship. England's men will attempt to regain the Ashes later this year when they head to Australia for a five-match series, starting in Perth on 21 November. Australia are next set to tour England in 2027.",
