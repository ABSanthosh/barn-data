  "text": "File photo of MI's Rohit Sharma and RCB's Virat Kohli© BCCI/IPL The BCCI has decided to scrap the contentious Impact Player rule for the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy. The Impact Player concept was introduced in SMAT couple of years ago and was later extended to the Indian Premier League. \"Kindly note that the BCCI has decided to do away with the provision of the ‘Impact Player' for the ongoing season,” the BCCI informed the state associations on Monday. The BCCI's decision to do away with the Impact Player comes shortly after it decided to retain the rule in the IPL till 2027. With record 250 plus total seen in the IPL this year, the Impact Player experiment was questioned by many including India skipper Rohit Sharma.However most of the IPL franchises were in favour of the rule. Rohit had felt that it was holding back the development of all-rounders.\"I generally feel that it is going to hold back (development of allrounders) because eventually cricket is played by 11 players, not 12 players. I'm not a big fan of impact player. You are taking out so much from the game just to make it little entertainment for the people around,\" Rohit said on the Club Prairie Podcast.Saurashtra head coach Niraj Odedra welcomed the BCCI's decision.\"It is nice change. Also the ICC doesn't have this rule in major tournaments So it would be good for cricketers who want to play for India as they graduate from domestic season,\" he said.Meanwhile, five-time Indian Premier League (IPL) champions Mumbai Indians have brought back Mahela Jayawardene as their head coach, a position he previously held at the franchise from 2017 to 2022, including three championship wins.After IPL 2022 season, Jayawardene, the former Sri Lanka skipper, became the franchise's Global Head of Cricket, overseeing the expansion of the expansion of MI's teams across different leagues, working with the coaching staff and delivering a trophy each - with MI (WPL), MINY (MLC) and MIE \"My journey within the MI family has always been one of evolution. In 2017, the focus was on bringing together a talented group of individuals to play the best cricket ever and we did very well.\"Now to return, at the same moment in history, where we look ahead at the future and the opportunity to further strengthen the love of MI, build on the vision of the owners, and continue to add to the history of Mumbai Indians, is an exciting challenge I am looking forward to,\" said Jayawardene in a statement issued by the franchise.With IANS inputs  Topics mentioned in this article",
