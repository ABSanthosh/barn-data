Whether Harry Brook’s captaincy can deliver silverware like Eoin Morgan’s transformative reign remains to be seen but this 238-run mauling of West Indies made for a handy start.Not only did Brook’s men amass 400 for eight after being put in by Shai Hope but, for the first time in the format’s history, they did so without a centurion on the day. Instead it was a collective assault of the bowlers and the poor boundary riders, with four half-centuries and – in another first – every member of the top seven making at least 30.Brook was among those to tuck in, flaying 58 from 45 balls and clearing the rope three times – a statement innings that was later followed by five outfield catches to equal the ODI record held by Jonty Rhodes. But as has already been the case this season – albeit in his first appearance of the summer – Jacob Bethell also commanded some headlines.Straight back from the Indian Premier League, and having generated a fair bit of angst after missing the Test match against Zimbabwe, the 21-year-old top-scored with a 53-ball 82 that had his home supporters in clover. Not that the Warwickshire faithful see Bethell too often these days, nor will they if his current trajectory is anything to go by.It was a calculated intervention. Bethell strode out with the score 221 for four at the start of the 32nd over and patiently chiselled out 19 runs from his first 26 balls. Then came the afterburners, with 63 ransacked from his next 27 that, along with 39 from Will Jacks in his new role at No 7, slammed the door shut on West Indies.Faced with a wall of runs as sheer as El Capitan, West Indies needed to get off to a flyer. Instead they were derailed by a slippery opening burst from Saqib Mahmood, who claimed three for 32, and three for Jamie Overton despite a finger injury. Bethell was in the action, too, his left-arm spin outfoxing Jewel Andrew as the tourists crumbled to 162 all out. Only a 10th-wicket thrash worth 39 prevented England’s biggest win by runs.“It was a pretty exceptional start from the boys – the tempo was spot on – and hopefully we can top that,” said Brook, his side having arrested a run of seven straight defeats. “This is a new era, we’re trying to forget about the past and take one game at a time.”On Bethell, who was named player of the match, Brook added: “He is a confident lad and does not need much more bigging up. We all know he is an exceptional player who is going to have a very long England career. He brings so much to a side.”Even robbed of 23 overs, the sell-out crowd had witnessed 562 runs, 18 wickets, and some pretty unreal fielding along the way. Roston Chase delivered two stellar catches but could only make the podium in this category, Brydon Carse pipping him in the reply with a full-stretch one-handed take on the rope a la Ben Stokes in the 2019 World Cup.Harry Brook scored 58 from 45 balls for England at Edgbaston. Photograph: Nigel Parker/ShutterstockAs well as Ben Duckett continuing his impressive run at opener – the left-hander struck 60 from 48 and averages just shy of 51 in ODI cricket – there was an early look at Jamie Smith up top. England fancy these two can strike up a similar little-and-large partnership to one Duckett enjoys with Zak Crawley in Test cricket and a quickfire 37 from Smith, in an opening stand of 64 from just seven overs, provided some supporting evidence.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionIt was Joe Root who signalled the start of the Morgan era 10 years ago, England’s 408 for nine that day driven by his 71-ball hundred. But after Smith smashed one hard to Brandon King at mid-wicket, the master was content to cruise his way to 57 from 65 balls. An outswinger from Jayden Seales eventually found his edge amid what it is fair to say were mixed-bag figures of four for 84 from nine overs.The day looked ripe for Brook. After an early sighter – something he later stressed he wants his players to note – his bat was suddenly glowing. A charged six off Justin Greaves signalled his intent, followed by a tumbling swept six that was pure innovation. Even the cut shot he got out to – caught at deep point off Seales – was utterly marmalised.Jos Buttler’s first outing back in the ranks briefly crackled to the tune of 37 from 32 balls but the impetus came from Bethell and Jacks – his first 50-over knock at No 7 – adding 98 in just seven overs.Bethell brought out the swivel pull to devastating effect here but a feathered edge behind in the final over saw the wait for that first senior century roll on.But then this has been the Bethell way to date: the promise of what is to come. Brook, beaming after a winning start to the job, and pretty chuffed about the Rhodes record, will be hoping the same goes for his side England at large.",
