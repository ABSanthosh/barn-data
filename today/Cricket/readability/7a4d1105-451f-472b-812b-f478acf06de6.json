TableAustralia secured their place in the Women's T20 World Cup semi-finals with a nine-run win over India, who face a nervous wait to see if they will join them in the final four.The defending champions are certain of topping Group A after winning all four games, but second-placed India need New Zealand to lose to Pakistan on Monday and stay ahead of both sides on net run-rate (NRR) to progress.Needing 152 to win and backed by a large and raucous crowd in Sharjah, India batted aggressively and gamely kept up with the rate.They needed 14 to win off the final over thanks to an excellent 54 from 47 balls from captain Harmanpreet Kaur.But Australia seamer Annabel Sutherland held her nerve, with her over costing just four runs for the loss of three wickets to seal the win.Australia, who were without injured captain Alyssa Healy, earlier recovered from the loss of two early wickets to post 151-8 - their highest score of the tournament.Opener Grace Harris top-scored with 40 from 41 balls, while Ellyse Perry and stand-in captain Tahlia McGrath each added 32.Australia continue to look team to beatMedia caption, Gardner makes diving grab to dismiss RodriguesAustralia have been imperious in the tournament so far, but their preparations for this game were hampered by injuries to Healy and Tayla Vlaeminck.Fast bowler Vlaeminck is out of the tournament with a dislocated shoulder but Healy - who arrived at the stadium on crutches - has not been ruled out and will continue to have a foot injury assessed.But such is Australia's strength in depth those injuries failed to disrupt their seemingly unstoppable march towards a seventh Women's T20 World Cup title.The Southern Stars were reduced to 17-2 when Renuka Singh Thakur removed Beth Mooney and Georgia Wareham in successive balls, only for Harris and McGrath put on 62 for the third wicket.Another wobble saw Australia slip from 79-2 to 101-5 but Perry and Phoebe Litchfield, whose 15 from nine balls included a booming six over square leg, helped them finish with a flourish.India began aggressively and reached 41-2 at the end of the powerplay, ahead of where Australia were at the same stage.They were smothered by Australia's spinners in the middle overs before a fourth-wicket partnership worth 63 between Harmanpreet and Deepti Sharma, who hit 29 from 25, raised hopes of a spectacular win.Despite falling just short, India could still reach the semi-finals. But if they are eliminated it will be their performances earlier in the tournament and not here that did the damage.'Everyone stepped up' - reactionMedia caption, Litchfield ends Australia's innings with big sixAustralia stand-in captain Tahlia McGrath: \"We want to win every game we play, we knew India would come really hard at us and I am proud that we held our nerve at the end.\"The whole team got around me and I had a lot of help out there. Everyone stepped up.\"India captain Harmanpreet Kaur: \"We were trying to do whatever we can, but it's not in our hands anymore. Now, whichever team deserves to be there will be there.\"Player of the match, Australia spinner Sophie Molineux: \"All the senior players took control and everyone went on auto-pilot out there to get the victory.\"It also felt great to bounce back from the injuries in the group.\"Media caption, Kaur 54 almost inspires India to win over AustraliaMore on this story",
