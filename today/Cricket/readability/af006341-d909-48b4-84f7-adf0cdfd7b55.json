It has been claimed that some offences date back to 2023. No charges have been laid.\"We're all aware of what's been going on in the media,\" Sammy told reporters in Grenada. \"I'm very close to my players. I've had conversations with them, making sure their mental space is good.\"One thing I could say is that we believe in justice. We are a community that believes justice must be served. However, there's a process. We will continue to support in whatever way we can to make sure that due process and the right system is followed. As a cricketing board, for me as the head coach, I want justice for everyone.\"But as of now, it's all allegations. And we know the justice system. You've got to wait for things to process the right way.\"When asked about some allegations dating back two years, Sammy, who has been West Indies' white-ball coach since May 2023 and added the Test job earlier this year, said: \"I'm not aware of that part of it.\"He would not be drawn into whether Cricket West Indies (CWI) should launch its own investigation. \"I can't answer to that,\" he said. \"I'm pretty sure they are doing all what they can to make sure, like I said, the right process is followed.\"A CWI spokesperson said: \"Cricket West Indies has not received any communication or official information and is therefore unable to comment at this time.\"Andrew McGlashan is a deputy editor at ESPNcricinfo",
