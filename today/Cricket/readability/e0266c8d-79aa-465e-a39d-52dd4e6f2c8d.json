Carey, who is batting a slot down, inflicted more damage on West Indies after Travis Head (61) and Beau Webster (63) batted with caution in the morning session. The visitors began their innings trailing the Caribbean outfit by 10 runs from the first innings. West Indies did well to bowl Australia out for 180, but could only take a slender 10-run advantage heading into the second innings. (Live Scorecard) Topics mentioned in this article",
