Ben Charlesworth’s dismissal for a charming 160, stumped dawdling down the pitch to Hartley, started a collapse of seven for 85.Ethan Brookes’ six hitting salvo boosted Worcestershire for the second time in the match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, while at Scarborough, Surrey’s Dom Sibley – in action against Yorkshire – became the first man to 1,000 Championship runs this summer, pipping Saif Zaib by 15 minutes.Northants were forced to follow-on against Middlesex at Merchant Taylors’ school, despite Zaib’s 82, which made him the first batter at the club to make 1,000 runs since Ben Duckett in 2016. Ryan Higgins grabbed four first-innings wickets, two in the second, to leave Northants looking to the skies for salvation.Rehan Ahmed once again reigned at the County Ground, though not before Leicestershire’s Luis Reece collected career-best match figures of 11 for 120 . Ahmed then took all four wickets to fall in Derbyshire’s second innings.Kent made a much better stab of their second innings against Glamorgan, thanks to Harry Finch and Grant Stewart; while Tilak Varma’s century kept Hampshire on the scoresheet against Nottinghamshire. Josh Tongue, who replaced Brett Hutton at the start of the day, went wicketless.Eight games continue into day four, some more healthy than other! Do join us tomorrow, thanks for tuning in today, have a lovely evening.Close of play scoresSouthampton: Hampshire 367-6 v Nottinghamshire 578-8decTaunton: Somerset 250 and 89-5 BEAT Durham 145 and 190 By FIVE WICKETSHove: Sussex 204 and 245-7 v Essex 504Edgbaston: Warwickshire 184 and 55-2 v Worcestershire 333 and 243Scarborough: Yorkshire 517-6dec v Surrey 338-4DIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire 189 and 98-4 v Leicestershire 398 and 236-9decSophia Gardens: Glamorgan 327 and 25-2 v Kent 155 and 360Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 381 and 98-0 v Lancashire 557Merchant Taylors’ School: Middlesex 625-8 dec v Northamptonshire 261 and 64-3Kent are folding more quickly than an oiled patio door. 360 for nine, three for Carlson. A lead of 188 – which is something to play with.Time for me to write up for the paper, do chat on BTL.99 for Tilak Varma…Sussex and Essex look likely to be packing their trunks tonight. Jack Carson gives Paul Walter an easy catch. Still 59 behind, three wickets left.And the rain has relented at Merchant Taylors’, the follow-on begun. It took only 4.1 overs for Vasconcelos to find himself back in the pavilion. A fifth for Higgins in the match. Oh, and Sharma for a golden duck. Make that six for Higgins. Northants 10-2.Ethan Brookes is having a very perky match against his old county – a hundred in the first innings, 66 not out in the second, in the midst of some low-scoring companions. The Worcs lead is now 366 which is more than either side has made in the match.And a hapless run-out at Hove, Simpson for two, followed shortly after by Hudson-Prentice, after two quick boundaries, leaves Sussex struggling at 236-6, still 64 behind Essex. Coles still there, unbeaten on 95.Northants are all out, but the rain returns at Merchant Taylors’. Four for Higgins. Northants trail by 364 and will need the bad weather to linger for a little longer.And at the County Ground, a third for Rehan Ahmed, and a miserable match for Wayne Madsen. Nine for Rehan along with his century.Tea-time ish scoresSouthampton: Hampshire 274-5 v Nottinghamshire 578-8decTaunton: Somerset 250 and 89-5 BEAT Durham 145 and 190 By FIVE WICKETSHove: Sussex 204 and 203-3 v Essex 504Edgbaston: Warwickshire 184 v Worcestershire 333 and 208-8Scarborough: Yorkshire 517-6dec v Surrey 162-2DIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire 189 and 45-2 v Leicestershire 398 and 236-9decSophia Gardens: Glamorgan 327 v Kent 155 and 292-5Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 381 and 0-0 v Lancashire 557Merchant Taylors’ School: Middlesex 625-8 dec v Northamptonshire 261-8 rain delayAnother for Rehan Ahmed in the last over before tea. Harry Came plays a wretched poke to Fletch despair on comms. Derbys 45-2. Tea-time scores to follow.At Scarborough, Yorkshire have winkled out both openers, in a game that is so far without incident, unlike some in previous years between these two sides at the seaside. Surrey 161-2, batting practice for Jacks and Patel.Gloucestershire all outThey don’t make the follow-on target, the Lancs lead 176. And that’s six for 116 for Tom Hartley – not his best first-class figures, they came at Hyderabad, but his best for Lancs. A huge relief after sculling around in the seconds for quite a lot of this season. They’ve taken tea and Lancs surely will enforce the follow-on?David Lloyd can’t resist pulling Ahmed and big Josh Hull reaches up and collects the apple. Derby 35-1.Gloucestershire, nine down, are still 32 away from the follow-on. Five wickets for Hartley, two for Green.With ten overs gone, time for Rehan Ahmed at The County Ground, shirt untucked, effervescent run-up, tosses ball from hand to hand. Derby 33-0.Bangladesh are having a Kent-ish start to their T20 game against Pakistan – 25 for five. Kent, meanwhile, have a 94-run lead at The Gardens, thanks to a solid performance down the order. Evison has just been dismissed for 49, but Finch remains on 44.Hello there Mike Daniels! “In the box today for the Legends tournament being held here and at Edgbaston.“England v SA today so will be interesting to see who’s playing but I believe Eoin Morgan is captaining England.“Meanwhile the Eng and Aus 60s are playing the 5th and deciding match of the Grey Ashes at Royal Ascot today, Eng 230-7 currently.”1000 first-class runs for Saif Zaib!The first Northants player since Ben Duckett in 2016- whereafter he was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year and picked for England’s overseas tours.Saif Zaib is congratulated by his team-mates as he returns to the Merchant Taylors' away gazebo after rain - the first Northants player to score 1,000 first-class runs since Ben Duckett in 2016 pic.twitter.com/LkKsBHbQGk— James Coyne (@coynejames) July 24, 2025 Sussex sailing through the afternoon- unbeaten half centuries for Coles and Alsop, a partnership of 122; Rocchiccioli has three, Worcestershire 142-7, lead by 291.Leicestershire declare 236-9 - Derbyshire need 446 to winA juggling caught and bowled by Thomson dismisses Holland ten short of his century, and Handscomb calls them in. Derbyshire have four and a bit sessions to last.So many gorgeous mature dark green trees overlooking the county ground – where Thomson continues to wheel in. And an outbreak of wickets at Cheltenham, where Charlesworth was finally out for a magnificent 160, and Hammond (36) and van Buuren (0) followed soon after. All three wickets to Hartley, who now has 4-91, rivallying Rehan Ahmed and Luis Reece for performance of the round. Glos 331-6, trail by 226.Tilak Varma averages fifty in first-class cricket and duly collects another, this time for Hampshire, at Southampton, while at The County Ground, Luis Reece has folded up and put his pocket another five-fer – Green bowled after a momentum-building 45. The Leics lead 429.Sussex are rebuilding from 33 for two -Tom Alsop approaching fifty. They need to elongate this innings like a stretch of playdoh – still trail Essex by 202.A flamboyant shot by Chris Benjamin, on 46, doesn’t end well. Kent lose a fourth and lead by 13.After a hard morning’s graft, KentAt The County Ground, Ian Holland has reached a quick-fire 60 not out, on a stage of low scores.

Saif Zaib, Northants clinging on with fingernails, 192-5. And an astonishing catch on the boundary by a lurching Zak Chappell at Derby to dismiss Trevaskis – Leics 132-7.A wicket maiden for Thompson, as Hill is caught on the bad stretching half forward. Leics 117-5 lead by 326.At Cheltenham, Lancs – who have already conceded 15 extras as compared to Gloucestershire’s two – have rid themselves of Ollie Price for 31, caught off Hartley. Bancroft remains, 139 not out. Gloucs 255-3 trail by 302.Hello Tim Maitland!“Personally I’m livid at the mealy mouthed fake apology issued by Lancashire yesterday. To wit: “We saw nearly 9,000 supporters arrive at the ground very late despite encouraging early arrival, with all bags subject to searches on entry.“There was plenty of evidence on the Test Match OBO from first-hand witnesses that spectators who showed up in plenty of time were unable to get in. It should have been challenged. It should still be challenged.”“(Is the Big Website and Even Bigger Paper too holy to speak to the urchins doing the OBOs? ;p)“Heh, heh! I love the thought of the grubby OBO urchins. (There’s a reason we don’t get a picture byline.) It is an excellent on-the-spot news resource, you’re right. And yes, god knows how Lancs made such a horlicks of yesterday. They have started clipping tiny plastic tags on all bags for a county match – would have been a logistical nightmare if they were doing that for the Test as well.Yorkshire declare! Revis 110 not outNow the game begins… can Yorkshire’s bowlers whittle something out of the Kookaburra? Excellent acceleration by Revis (13 fours, five sixes) and Dom Bess, unbeaten on 45 off 57 balls.Roderick reaches fifty, before he nicks Webster behind, Worcs 83-1, a lead of 232. Webster having a good match.Like liquid honey: a hundred first-class wickets for Mohammad Abbas at the Rose Bowl, but this time wearing a Nottinghamshire shirt. He has snaffled both openers, both for 52. Hampshire 123-2Porter marches militarily back to his mark, the wicket of Daniel Hughes under his belt. Sussex 43-2, big white clouds building behind the flats at Hove.Leicestershire 57-4 – a fourth for Luis Reece, Handscomb lbw lunging forwards. Ten in the match!Fifties for the in-form Matthew Revis at Scarborough and Fletcha Middleton at Southampton.And Luis Reece continues his work from day one, now adding Sol Budinger and man of the moment Rehan Ahmed to his tally. Nine in the match and counting.A wicket (Phillips) for swoony Chris Green at lovely Cheltenham; a wicket for Sam Cook, back in his natural habitat, Haines for 1.Fifty and out for Simon Harmer, Essex finish with a hearty lead of 300. Now then Sussex.Within a glut of Leicestershire centuries, Rishi Patel falls cheaply for the second time in the match. Leicestershire 14-1.There is play all round the grounds today, and in three of the four women’s Metro Bank one-day cup games. No declaration yet from Yorkshire or Essex – where Simon Harmer is smiting sixes.Off we go!

The surface was the main talking point, with opinions varying depending on the colour of the tracksuit. The Somerset head coach, Jason Kerr, called it “an incredible surface” while Durham’s bowling coach, Graham Onions, was less complimentary about the “excessive turn”. Jack Leach pocketed a six-fer, for the second consecutive game, and Archie Vaughan four, as Durham were bowled out for 190 – leaving Somerset 86 to win. They scraped over the line, despite Callum Parkinson’s four wickets.After a shimmering century on Tuesday, Rehan Ahmed fizzed out six Derbyshire batters for 51 in a dazzling display of leg-spin. Leicestershire lead by 209. Derbyshire’s Luis Reece had earlier collected six for 56 as Leicestershire’s tail collapsed.Chris Green won the heart of Lancashire fans with a wham-bam 160, all long levers and princely smile. When he was eventually dismissed for the record score for a Lancashire No 8, his standing ovation ran into the one welcoming No 11, Jimmy Anderson. Tom Hartley then raced to his first first-class century, a clean-hitting knock, pipping Peter Martin to the highest score by a Lancashire No 10. Anderson then licked his lips and whistled out Cameron Bancroft cheaply, but that was Lancs’ only success as Ben Charlesworth hit an excellent century of his own in a match that looks destined for a high-scoring draw.Ben Kellaway and Colin Ingram batted Glamorgan into an excellent position against Kent, who are making a better fist of their second innings.With his parents in the crowd, Lyndon James rocked to a maiden double hundred as Nottinghamshire declared on 578 at Southampton; Warwickshire are on the rocks after first Ethan Brookes made a career-best 140 against his old club Worcestershire, and then Khurram Shazad fired six batters out for 42.Rain ruined much of the day’s play at Scarborough, with just time for Yorkshire’s Jonny Bairstow to rattle to 72 before being caught off Surrey’s two-match Kookaburra-ball signing Sai Kishore.England man in the wings Jordan Cox hot-footed to a brilliant century for Essex, putting on 184 with Matt Critchley (a fine 123), who both made the most of a temptingly short boundary on the pavilion side. Sussex toiled away, without the rested Ollie Robinson, until thunderstorms stopped play with the Essex lead 247.Middlesex declared on 625 for eight, riches beyond dreams, thanks to hundreds for Kane Williamson (in his first red-ball innings for the club) and Leus du Plooy, and 151 for Max Holden. Northants hauled themselves to 121 for four at stumps.Scores on the doors DIVISION ONESouthampton: Hampshire 80-0 v Nottinghamshire 578-8decTaunton: Somerset 250 and 89-5 BEAT Durham 145 and 190 By FIVE WICKETSHove: Sussex 204 v Essex 475-9Edgbaston: Warwickshire 184 v Worcestershire 333 and 31-0Scarborough: Yorkshire 376-5 v SurreyDIVISION TWODerby: Derbyshire 189 v Leicestershire 398Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 327 v Kent 155 and 106-1Cheltenham: Gloucestershire 179-1 v Lancashire 557Merchant Taylors’ School: Middlesex 625-8 dec v Northamptonshire 126-4PreambleGood morning!
