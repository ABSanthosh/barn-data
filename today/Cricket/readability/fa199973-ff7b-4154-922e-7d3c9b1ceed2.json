  "text": "ReportFifth-wicket stand of 154 in 77 overs follows 45 for 4 on third evening after Yorkshire set 520 targetMatt Critchley turns the ball leg side  •  PA Photos/Getty ImagesEssex 123 (Hill 6-51, Coad 3-20) and 273 for 9 (Critchley 75, Pepper 68, White 4-43, Hill 3-31) drew with Yorkshire 216 (Wharton 63*, Lyth 58) and 426 for 6 dec (Lyth 185, Bairstow 79, Wharton 61)Matt Critchley and Michael Pepper knuckled down for a monumental fifth-wicket stand of 154 in 77 overs to steer Essex to the unlikeliest of Rothesay County Championship draws against Yorkshire at Chelmsford.The pair came together in the depths of despair at 45 for 4 on the third evening and batted for four-and-a-half hours together, spanning 458 balls, and looking to have made it through two complete sessions on the final day. Pepper, though, fell to the last ball before tea after a 229-ball 68 that included five fours and two sixes.Critchley followed after the interval for 75 from 246 balls as Yorkshire scented their second win of the season with three wickets in 21 balls. However, last-wicket pair Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter saw out the final 38 minutes and 82 balls to prevent a second successive defeat.George Hill dismissed both batters to return career-best match figures of 9 for 82, supported by Jack White's season's best 4 for 43, but to no avail as Yorkshire toiled in vain for one more wicket.The target of 520, with 456 still nominally required at the start of day four, was always going to be beyond Essex's compass and it became more a case of settling in to save face.As a sign of what had been anticipated, the Essex flag was flying upside down on its pole beside the pavilion as if in surrender. The plans for survival, however, were set out from the start as Pepper and Critchley blocked and blocked with little alarm. It was not until the 20th ball of the day that they moved off their overnight 64 for 4 when Critchley angled a Ben Coad delivery wide of the slips for 10 third boundaries. They were the only runs scored in the first half-an-hour's play.Indeed, it was only the introduction of Hill after 35 minutes that had the usually flamboyant Pepper opening his morning's account, turning the ball down to fine leg for a single.The first sign of serious aggression came when Critchley hooked Matty Revis so firmly that the square-leg umpire had to take evasive action as it sped to the boundary. Revis attempted a short-ball barrage at Pepper and it nearly came off when the Essex batter gloved one up and over Jonny Bairstow's head behind the stumps.Pepper broke out of his self-imposed shackles by sweeping Dom Bess for one six and adding a second over long leg. In between, he survived a difficult chance off an uppish drive past mid-on.Reprieved, Pepper scampered the single soon after lunch that took him to a 155-ball fifty followed quickly by the century stand that ate up 51 overs. Critchley's fifty was more circumspect, reached with another four guided down to third from his 190th ball faced.Yorkshire's hopes seemed to hinge on the second new-ball, but they failed to make it count immediately and Bess was recalled to the attack after nine fruitless overs. However, to the final ball of the 13th over with it, on the cusp of tea, Pepper was caught leaning into a Hill delivery and departed lbw.Noah Thain lasted 15 balls before he was bowled through the gate by Bess and Critchley's marathon innings ended when he got the faintest of tickles to Hill and was caught behind.Shane Snater held out for 32 balls without scoring before he fell lbw to White. Kasun Rajitha's 21 came off 40 balls before he played down the wrong line and was bowled by Dan Moriarty. But then Porter came in to join Harmer and thwart Yorkshire.Instant answers to T20 questionsCounty Championship Division One",
