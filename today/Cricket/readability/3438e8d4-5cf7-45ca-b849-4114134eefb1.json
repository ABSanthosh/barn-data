Both openers stayed unbeaten as Shubman Gill-led India stared at the possibility of a loss even after five players scored centuries. Ben Duckett scored a ton in 121 balls as he became the first England opening batter to score a century in the fourth innings of a Test since Alastair Cook (109* vs Bangladesh in Mirpur, 2010). Chances were hard to come by. One such came in the 39th over off Mohammed Siraj. He delivered a short ball as Duckett top-edged but Jaiswal, running in from deep backward square-leg, made a mess and dropped. This was Jaiswal's fourth dropped catch of the match - highest in a Test match by an Indian, accoridng to some reports. Siraj was livid with the blunder and made his displeasure known. Even Gambhir was quite grim in the dressing room.  Unending Story From Yashaswi Jaisalwal ; Never Caught A Catch In Important Time .
