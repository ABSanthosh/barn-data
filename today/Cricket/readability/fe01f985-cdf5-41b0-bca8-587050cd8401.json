Watch the post-presentation LIVE... pic.twitter.com/bsmi7sB9zQ— Star Sports (@StarSportsIndia) July 6, 2025 India vs England Live: Bumrah to play Lord's Test! When asked if Jasprit Bumrah will be back to the Playing XI in the third Test against England at Lord's, London, Shubman Gill replied, \"Definitely.\" Notably, the pacer was rested in the second game to manage his workload. Prasidh Krishna is more likely to make way for Bumrah then. He picked just one wicket in this game. India vs England Live: Gill after the game - \"All the things we spoke about after the last game, we were spot on with all of those things. I think the way we came back with our bowling and fielding was tremendous to see. On this kind of wicket we knew that if we got 400-500 runs, it would be enough. Not every game will be like Headingley. [The bowlers] They were magnificent. The way we were able to get through their top order, they bowled brilliantly. Even Prasidh, he didn't get as many wickets but he bowled brilliantly. [On Akash Deep] He hit the right lengths and was getting the ball to move both ways, which was difficult on a pitch like this. He was magnificent for us. I am definitely feeling comfortable with my game and if we are able to win the series with my contributions, it'll be great. As I said before, I want to play as a batsman, and go out as a batsman and make decisions as a batsman. Sometimes you won't take some risks when you're thinking as a captain which you have to do as a batsman,\" said Gill. India vs England Live: Gill named Player of the Match! India Test captain Shubman Gill has been named the Player of the Match. \"The way we came back in bowling and fielding was tremendous to see,\" he said while talking to host broadcaster during the presentation ceremony. \"Definitely feeling comfortable with my game,\" he said commenting on his batting. India vs England Live: Gill leading by example! What a match it was for India new Test captain Shubman Gill! He led by an example as the right-handed batter did the bulk of scoring. He smashed 269 in the first innings and followed it up with a fine-tuned 161. On the captaincy front too, Gill was on the money with his bowling changes and field placements. The 25-year-old captain could not have asked for a better game! India vs England Live: Much more than just a win! This is not just a win for India but a statement in England. The Three Lions chased down 371-run target in the first game and the visitors bounced back from that defeat in a great fashion. They set England an improbable target of 608 runs to chase down in the fourth innings before also showing the magic with the ball. India vs England Live: INDIA WIN!!! INDIA WIN THE MATCH BY 336 RUNS! They have broken the 58-year-jinx of not winning a Test match at Edgbaston, Birmingham. And what a time do it! They were playing without Jasprit Bumrah that too after losing the first game of the series. But they have simply outplayed England in this game. This is a historic win. A victory to remember for ages! Welcome to the Shubman Gill era, folks! India vs England Live: India need one wicket! Akash Deep is tightening one of the spikes on his shoes. Prasidh Krishna is helping him do that. India need just one wicket to win this game. It is just a matter of time from this point.ENG 266/9 (66.4) India vs England Live: SIX! A fuller delivery in the slot on the fifth ball of the over from Akash Deep and Shoaib Bashir slammed it down the ground for a four. This happened after Siraj dropped a tough catch of Brydon Carse on the previous delivery. India vs England Live: WICKET! India vs England Live: The wait continues! Brydon Carse and Josh Tongue are delaying the joy for India here. They have together played 44 balls, adding 19 runs for the eighth wicket. The rescheduled time for Tea is 9:40 and India need to take one wicket by then to get this session extended by half an hour.ENG 245/8 (63) India vs England Live: Siraj into the attack! Mohammed Siraj was handed the ball and he was hit for a four on the very first ball of his spell. Brydon Carse hit the boundary through the cover. It was a good comeback from Siraj as he bowled five dot balls on trot post that.ENG 242/8 (61) India vs England Live: DROPPED! KL Rahul has dropped the catch of Brydon Carse here! The batter got an outside edge on the ball of Ravindra Jadeja and it went to Rahul at first slip. He failed to hold on to it. It seems the ball hit Rahul's thumb and popped out of his hands.ENG 232/8 (57.3) India vs England Live: 5-wicket haul for Akash Deep! India vs England Live: Huge achievement for Akash Deep! India pacer Akash Deep has become the first player in 49 years to achieve a stunning feat. He is the first bowler since West Indies legend Michael Holding to dismiss four out of England's top five batters in a Test inning. Holding achieved the feat back in 1976. India vs England Live: India right on top! Around 41 overs (246 balls) are yet to be bowled today. Can England survive those? India, on the other hand, need just three deliveries to go in their favour. The sky looks blue and clear over the stadium at the moment.ENG 211/7 (55) India vs England Live: Decision overturned! The Prasidh Krishna delivery nipped back into Jamie Smith and hit him on the thigh pad. Umpire raised his finger over an LBW appeal but Smith went upstairs. Ball tracking revealed that it would have gone over the stumps. The on-field decision was thus overturned.ENG 200/7 (52.4) India vs England Live: WICKET! Prasidh Krishna has taken the wicket of Chris Woakes! He gets a wicket after 138 balls in this game. It was a short ball from Prasidh and Woakes wanted to play it on the leg side. He got a top edge and Mohammed Siraj took one of the easiest catches at short mid-wicket. ENG 199/7 (52.1) India vs England Live: Missed the outside edge! That was a beautiful delivery from Akash Deep but he is unlucky that Chris Woakes has not got an edge there. It was bowled at good length, angling into Woakes but the ball swung late and beat the outside edge of the batter.ENG 198/6 (51.5) India vs England Live: Swing is there! The conditions are overcast and Akash Deep got some good swing in the over. He troubled both Chris Woakes and Jamie Smith in the over, but failed to dismiss any of them. The two England batters are fighting really hard and well out there. They have added 43 runs off just 57 balls so far.ENG 196/6 (50) India vs England Live: 6,4,6 - Smith on FIRE!!! Jamie Smith is now playing his shots. He smashed Washington Sundar for two sixes in the over and a four too. A total of 17 runs came in it. Shubman Gill might remove Sundar from the attack as well and go on with pace bowling from both ends.ENG 191/6 (49) India vs England Live: SIX! A flighted delivery from Washington Sundar and Jamie Smith slammed it over the fence for a six. He jumped out of his crease and hit the ball to the wide of long-on for the six. Positive intent from Smith this is!ENG 180/6 (48.1) India vs England Live: Fifty for Jamie Smith! Jamie Smith continues his superb form in the game. After scoring 184 not out in the first innings, he has scored a half-century here. Can he save the game for England? Can he rescue the Three Lions? It all seems really-really tough at this point.ENG 173/6 (47) India vs England Live: Eventful over! Ravindra Jadeja is making the ball talk. He is using those rough patches beautifully, but he is unlucky to not get any wicket so far. This is a test of England's patience as India are moving ahead with an attacking field.ENG 172/6 (46) India vs England LIVE: Jadeja nearly had Smith! Coming over the wicket, Ravindra Jadeja squared up Jamie Smith with a superb delivery. That spun sharply after pitching on the rough and missed the edge of his bat as well as the off-stump by a whisker. A wicket seems round the corner for India!ENG 167/6 (45.1) India vs England LIVE: FOUR! It was a short of length ball from Washington Sundar and Jamie Smith has got a four on it. The ball was bowled outside off-stump, Smith tried to cut it from the back foot but only managed to get a toe-end of his bat. The ball raced to the boundary through third man region.ENG 166/6 (43) India vs England LIVE: India start well, again! It was tight from Washington Sundar as he troubled Chris Woakes in the remaining three balls. The first ball took the outside edge of his bat but fell short of first slip, while the third ball turned too much to hit him on the thigh pad.ENG 153/6 (41) India vs England LIVE: Lights are on! We are set for the second session on the final day of this second Test between India and England. The lights have been turned on for now. Washington Sundar is ready to continue his over. Chris Woakes in on strike, here we go. India vs England LIVE: Lunch on Day 5! Well, well, well, India are almost there! They managed to pick three crucial wickets in the first session on this final day. Akash Deep struck twice before Ben Stokes and Jamie Smith stitched a solid 70-run stand. Washington Sundar removed Stokes on the final over before Lunch, putting India right on top. The visitors need only four wickets to win this game. India vs England LIVE: BIG WICKET! India vs England LIVE: Sharp turn! Ravindra Jadeja fetched some terrific turn in the over and troubled England batters Jamie Smith and Ben Stokes. Some deliveries in the over were simply unplayable. These are good signs for India. We have hardly a couple of overs remaining for Lunch. ENG 151/5 (38) India vs England LIVE: Siraj fumes at Sundar! On the second ball of the 35th over, Mohammed Siraj bowled a short of length delivery to Jamie Smith. The batter tapped the ball at covers and Washington Sundar's fumble there allowed a single to England. Siraj was left fuming over Sundar for that misfield. He even let some expletives out of his mouth in anger. Ravindra Jadeja came in to bowl the 36th over and leaked 9 runs in it. ENG 142/5 (36) India vs England LIVE: Was it a catch? A good length ball from Ravindra Jadeja brushed the gloves of Ben Stokes and fell just inches short of Shubman Gill at leg slip. It was a maiden over from Jadeja. He troubled Stokes as the player failed to play his shots properly.ENG 123/5 (34) India vs England LIVE: Maiden over! Mohammed Siraj has bowled a maiden over to England's Jamie Smith. The duo of Jamie and Ben Stokes is playing well, having added 40 runs off 70 balls for the sixth wicket so far. India just need one breakthrough to enter the tail of England batting.ENG 123/5 (33) India vs England LIVE: India right on top! Three runs came off the Ravindra Jadeja over. England need an improbable 485 runs to win, while India need only 5 wickets. India should win this game and level the series 1-1. Ben Stokes and Jamie Smith, the last recognised pair of batters, are at the crease.ENG 123/5 (32) India vs England LIVE: Siraj starts with a maiden over Good, tight stuff from Mohammed Siraj to begin his spell. Ben Stokes doesn't go for any aggressive shot, he hasn't done in nearly all of the 38 balls he has faced so far today. And now, we will have some spin. Ravindra Jadeja replaces Akash Deep in the attack.ENG 110/5 (29) India vs England LIVE: Here comes Mohammed Siraj! First change, Shubman Gill hands the ball now to Mohammed Siraj. 6 wickets in the first innings, 7 overall in the match. He will be fired up to try and get a wicket now and set India on their way to victory. India vs England LIVE: 12 overs done 12 overs done on Day 5. India have had the perfect start, courtesy of their pacer in form, Akash Deep. India have another 68 overs to try and get the final 5 wickets. Still nearly an hour to go in the first session, after which we will have Lunch.ENG 110/5 (28) India vs England LIVE: FOUR! Third boundary for Jamie Smith! This young man is not going to back down, no matter what the situation is. Beautiful drive, through mid-off, against the in-form Akash Deep. Three boundaries now, all of them against Akash.ENG 110/5 (27.4) IND vs ENG LIVE 2nd Test Day 5: What a ripper from Akash Deep Akash Deep continues to be absolutely terrific. Superb inswinger, zips between Smith's bat and pad as he went for the block. No idea how it hasn't collected the edge. Even Smith heaves a sigh of relief. Fifth over of the spell for Akash now.ENG 100/5 (25.1) India vs England LIVE: 100 up for England England reach 100. They've laboured to get here, and half their batting lineup is in the dugout. Akash Deep is breathing fire, and Prasidh is doing well too. Stokes and Smith facing a real challenge in these conditions for now.ENG 100/5 (24.2) India vs England LIVE: Stokes lucky! Nearly the fifer for Akash Deep! Terrific delivery, once again zipping back in. Inside edge, nearly chopping onto his stumps. Jamie Smith then ends the over with another boundary. Flicked away through fine-leg for 4. ENG 98/5 (24) India vs England LIVE: 4, Stokes First boundary of the match for Ben Stokes. Prasidh Krishna dishes out a half volley to the England captain and it is flicked away for 4 through mid-wicket. And a bizarre error here by Prasidh, it is a back-foot no-ball!ENG 92/5 (22.2) India vs England LIVE: FOUR! Jamie Smith gets his first boundary of the day. Back of a length from Akash Deep for the final ball of the over, and it is handsomely punched through the covers by the in-form wicket-keeper batter. Can he rescue England's blushes yet again?ENG 87/5 (22) India vs England LIVE: OUT! England are 5 down! GONE! Akash Deep gets Brook now! Inswinger, zips back on the knee, Brook couldn't read it. Umpire raises the finger. Brook goes up with a DRS review, but hawkeye says umpire's call. England are 5 wickets down. India are 5 wickets away from a historic victory.ENG 83/5 (21.3) India vs England LIVE: Maiden over by Prasidh! The confidence seems to be rubbing off on the rest of the Indian bowling attack. Prasidh Krishna is keeping things tight in the early phase here, and bowls a maiden over. England captain Stokes opting for caution over early aggression.ENG 83/4 (21) India vs England LIVE: Pressure on Stokes Massive pressure now on Ben Stokes. The England captain has struggled with the bat in recent games, but with his side down 4 wickets, he must bat well to save this Test match. Big, big Test of for the 'Bazball' regime.ENG 83/4 (20) India vs England LIVE: OUT! Akash Deep strikes WICKET! Akash Deep dismisses Ollie Pope, bowled! Uneven bounce from the Akash Deep's delivery and that is what catches Pope by surprise. Beaten, hit on the back of his elbow, before it chops on to his stumps. India need 6 wickets more!ENG 80/4 (19.1) India vs England LIVE: FOUR! Good shot by Harry Brook! Width offered by Prasidh, outside off-stump, and it is whipped away square of the wicket by the in-form English batter. First boundary of Day 5, and England are up and running.ENG 80/3 (19) India vs England LIVE: Shastri shocked by Gill's strategy \"Can't believe that Mohammed Siraj is not opening the bowling. He has taken 7 wickets in this match, but he's sat at mid-on,\" says former India coach Ravi Shastri on commentary. Shubman Gill has opted to open the bowling with Prasidh and Akash Deep.Shastri also expresses surprise that Akash Deep is bowling from a different end than the one he did from yesterday. India vs England LIVE: Akash Deep from the other end Akash Deep opens the bowling from the other end, and concedes just one run in his first over of the day. The 27-year-old pacer breathed fire yesterday, taking two wickets, including an absolute ripper to dismiss Joe Root. Let's see how he fares today.ENG 74/3 (18) IND vs ENG LIVE 2nd Test Day 5: Play starts Prasidh Krishna bowls out the first over of the day, to Ollie Pope and Harry Brook. Just one run from the first over of the day. Decent line and length maintained by Prasidh. He has conceded only 7 runs in his 4 overs in this innings.ENG 73/3 (17) India vs England LIVE: Players are out! The sun is out! The players are out on the pitch.

India need 7 wickets to clinch their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston, ending a 58-year wait.
