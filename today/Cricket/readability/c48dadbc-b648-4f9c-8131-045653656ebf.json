  "text": "One-Day Cup games launch new era of women's domestic cricketImage source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Edgbaston will host the One-Day Cup match between Warwickshire and Hampshire on WednesdayA new era in women's cricket in England begins this week with the opening top-tier fixtures of the One-Day Cup campaign on Wednesday.The domestic game has been in something of a state of flux in recent years, but the 2025 season will take on a new look which the ECB hope will last for years to come.A 35-team county competition of varying standard ended in 2019, and since 2020, counties have fed into eight regional teams, which have formed the top tier of women's cricket, competing in the Charlotte Edwards Cup and Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy.This summer it will be replaced by a three-tiered domestic competition structure made up of teams from individual counties.The ECB has called it \"the next stage in the evolution of women's cricket\" and says it will invest a further £4million to £5m into the game between 2025 and 2028, taking the total to around £16m.The ECB hopes the plans could lead to an 80% increase in professional women's players in England and Wales by 2029.A year ago the eight counties awarded Tier 1 status were Durham, Essex, Hampshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Surrey and Warwickshire.Yorkshire said they were \"surprised and disappointed\" not to be in the top tier, making a case to the ECB, which - a month after the initial announcement - agreed to allow them into Tier 1 from 2026. Glamorgan will be allowed in from 2027.Last July, the ECB announced the Tier 2 clubs: Derbyshire, Glamorgan (until 2027), Gloucestershire, Kent, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex, Sussex, Worcestershire and Yorkshire (until 2026).Overall, the Tier 1 counties will be required to have a minimum of 15 contracted players with a minimum salary of £20,000, the same as new male players. Those counties will be required to invest a minimum of £500,000 on player salary costs, but not exceed £800,000. Women in Tier 2 will have no such guarantee - most will likely be semi-professional, with pay left up to their individual clubs.The eight top-tier sides will contest the One-Day Cup and T20 Blast while the 10 Tier 2 sides will compete in Division Two of those competitions, while more than a dozen more National Counties will join them to take part in the new Women's County Cup.There will be no promotion or relegation for the first three seasons, though the top tier will be expanded in 2029 to include two more teams, but the ECB has not yet decided which ones.You can see the eight Tier 1 squad lists here., externalImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Former England skipper Heather Knight will play for Somerset this season'New format can attract new fanbase'Former England captain Heather Knight hopes the changes to the women's domestic game will help to bring \"a new fanbase\" to the sport.Knight has signed for Somerset's new women's team for 2025, one of eight counties to merge under the same umbrella as their male counterparts and be given Tier 1 status in the revamp.The 33-year-old previously captained Western Storm - which covered the counties of Somerset and Gloucestershire - leading them to titles over her eight years with the club.\"I think it's a really good move for women's cricket to merge with the men's counties and it seems like the next logical step in the development of the women's game to put those together and really drive the women's game forward alongside the men's,\" Knight told BBC Radio Somerset.\"It's an exciting time, probably a little bit of a transition period. It might take a few years to get things bedded in, but I think Somerset have been really welcoming.\"Knight's nine-year stint as England captain ended last month, having led the team to the 2017 World Cup title. Knight, who led the side in eight Tests, 94 one-day internationals and 96 T20s, with 134 wins from her 199 matches in charge, will join her England team-mates, all-rounders Charlie Dean and Danielle Gibson, in Taunton next season.\"I think it'll bring hopefully a new fanbase to women's cricket now that it's under the Somerset umbrella,\" Knight added.Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Megan Belt, left, and Saskia Horley, before Middlesex beat Kent in their opening One-Day Cup Division Two match at Radlett on Sunday'Time to prove Kent should be in Tier 1'While the revamp of the women's game has been largely met with positivity, the impact has not been universally popular.Kent's captain Megan Belt has a full-time job as a teacher at Kent College in Canterbury and with her club confident in their bid for Tier 1 status, Belt was hoping she and her team-mates would be playing professional cricket this summer.\"How we didn't get Tier 1, I don't quite understand,\" the 27-year-old told BBC South East Today.\"It was hard to take when other counties got it and we didn't when we've produced so many England players and our pathway is so strong.\"Former Kent chair Simon Philip described the decision as \"difficult to swallow\".The club have since formed a steering group that includes former Minister for Sport, Dame Tracey Crouch, to help them on their path to the top league as soon as possible.\"It is really tough and if I was a man playing for Kent, I probably wouldn't be a teacher,\" Belt added.\"But women's sport and women's cricket is heading in the right direction, it's time to prove in Tier 2 that we should be in Tier 1 and that's what we're trying to do.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Australia star Ellyse Perry will play for Hampshire this summer'Exciting time for women's game' - PerryAustralia all-rounder Ellyse Perry says she is \"really excited about the opportunity\" to play for Hampshire Hawks in the inaugural Women's T20 Blast this summer.The 34-year-old will join up with the squad in July and be available for six matches in the Blast, as well as two One-Day Cup fixtures.Perry told BBC South Today: \"It feels like a great time in the game. I think there has been lots of exciting things over the last 12 months for women's cricket in general.\"The change in the county system in the UK and what that will mean for the women's game, but equally I think what's been happening globally across the board - there's been so many great and exciting opportunities for more and more women to play and perform.\"The 2025 season will include 52 double bills of men's and women's matches back to back - of which all 18 first-class counties will host at least one.Beth Barrett-Wild, director of the women's professional game at the ECB, said: \"A big driver for the reorganisation has been to enable us to better use the leverage and existing scale of men's county cricket to accelerate fanbase growth for our women's teams and players.\"We believe that by putting our men's and women's competitions and players on the same platform we can exponentially increase the reach of the women's domestic game and intensify the depth of feeling fans have for our women's teams moving forwards.\"The Blast-Off weekend will start the new-look competition, beginning on Thursday, 29 May.The Kia Oval will stage the first Women's Finals Day on Sunday, 27 July.Blast Women's Competition:Bears, Durham, Essex, Hampshire Hawks, Lancashire Thunder, Somerset, Surrey, The Blaze.Blast Women's League 2:North Group: Derbyshire Falcons, Leicestershire Foxes, Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire Rapids, Yorkshire.South Group: Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Kent, Middlesex, Sussex Sharks.Chance to upset Tier 1 sides in CupSurrey have been drawn to play Hampshire, while fellow top-level sides Somerset and Durham will also meet in the new T20 Women's County Cup, which starts in May.The knockout competition will feature 37 teams from across the three tiers of the women's domestic structure.The eight professional Tier 1 sides for 2025 - Durham, Essex, Hampshire, Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Somerset, Surrey and Warwickshire - enter in the third round.Nottinghamshire will play as The Blaze in the competition and Warwickshire as Bears.The format of the cup will gives counties in Tier 2 and Tier 3 the chance to pull off an upset, with the draw offering lower-ranked sides a potential route to Finals Day.The two all-Tier 1 ties mean at least two non-top-flight sides will reach the quarter-finals.Both semi-finals and the final will be played at Taunton on Monday, 26 May.You can find the full draw here.More on this story",
