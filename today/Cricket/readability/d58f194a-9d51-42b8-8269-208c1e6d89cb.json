You can ball-by-ball radio commentary on every game on the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text updates. It is a quick turnaround from such a disappointing World Cup campaign but seamer Kate Cross, who is in the ODI and Test squads, feels that will benefit England. \"Years ago, if you were knocked out of a World Cup, you had to wait until your summer to play cricket again and prove yourself,\" Cross told BBC's No Balls podcast.\"But I feel like cricket has been back on our horizon so quickly after that, against the team who lost the final, so we know we've got a chance to measure ourselves against a really strong team in their own conditions and you're back in the fight straight away.\"The fallout from the World Cup was possibly the harshest that an England women's side has faced, a stark reminder of the increased scrutiny and expectation that comes with the privilege of being a professional athlete. The team's fitness was questioned, alongside their off-field activities and social media presence. Knight and head coach Jon Lewis rejected the accusations and understandably defended their team, but acknowledged their need to improve in pressure moments - though that is something they have been saying for almost two years.Against South Africa, finalists of said World Cup, England have a chance to change these perceptions before entering the Ashes pressure cooker. Lewis and Knight have put faith in their group, too. Top-order batter Alice Capsey was initially dropped from the World Cup squad for the T20 leg of the tour, but has since been recalled after an injury to all-rounder Paige Scholfield, while Danielle Gibson is the only other omission because of a knee problem. Fast bowler Lauren Filer comes into all three squads as a particularly exciting prospect for the Ashes.South Africa have rested star all-rounder Marizanne Kapp and seamer Ayabonga Khaka for the T20 series, but both will likely return for the ODIs and the Test. Lewis has acknowledged the difficulty in replicating high-pressure situations outside of matches, and going into the World Cup his side had barely been challenged in a relatively low-key summer which involved dominant series wins over Pakistan and New Zealand, who eventually won the tournament.But the intense two months ahead should not be lacking in pressure: South Africa will also have fire in the belly after losing the T20 final, while facing the game's dominant force, Australia, in their own backyard is one of cricket's greatest tasks. It will not be easy, considering the significant amount of time they will be spending away from home and against two high-quality teams. But it is a golden opportunity for England to silence critics and regain the form and excitement at the heart of their brand of cricket in 2023, the high-profile summer which saw both England men and women gripped in enthralling Ashes contests.",
