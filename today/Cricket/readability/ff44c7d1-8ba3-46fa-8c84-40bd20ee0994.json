  "text": "England batter Jacob Bethell will miss the Champions Trophy after sustaining a hamstring injury in the first one-day international against India on Thursday.Bethell, 21, was ruled out of England's XI for Sunday's defeat in the second ODI in Cuttack and, although not officially confirmed by England, is set to miss the tournament which begins on 19 February in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. \"It is really disappointing for him,\" said captain Jos Buttler.\"He has been really exciting player. It is a shame injury is going to rule him out.\"Somerset batter Tom Banton, 26, has been called up as cover for the third ODI against India on Wednesday initially.England's first match at the Champions Trophy is on 22 February against Australia. Teams must submit their final squads before 12 February.Bethell, who has impressed across all formats since making his debut last September, scored a battling fifty in England's four-wicket defeat in Nagpur. He also took 1-18 from three overs.Wicketkeeper Jamie Smith also has a calf issue, which ruled him out of the last two matches of the T20 series in India and the first two ODIs.He kept wicket in the warm-ups on Sunday morning and England remain hopeful he will be fit.Banton played the most recent of his six ODIs in 2020. He has also played 14 T20s, most recently in 2022.Having caught the eye as a teenager in domestic cricket, Banton's first foray into internationals was underwhelming, with three fifties across his 20 innings.He is in form at the time of his recall, however. The right-hander is currently the leading run-scorer in the ILT20 in the United Arab Emirates, having scored 493 runs in 11 innings, including two centuries, for MI Emirates.",
