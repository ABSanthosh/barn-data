The one-time world‑beaters have long lost their winning habit, their latest offering a 142-run defeat in Ahmedabad, Rohit Sharma’s team easing to a 3-0 series victory. If that’s not brutal enough, in the aftermath Jos Buttler was having to discuss how much his side trained on the tour.A chase of 357 could not be ruled out when England were 126 for two inside 18 overs, Joe Root building, Tom Banton beginning to bash. But an India attack built on variety instigated the collapse, the wickets shared around, Banton and Gus Atkinson joint top‑scorers with 38.Shubman Gill had strummed away earlier, his 112 backed up by half‑centuries from Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer. Adil Rashid took four for 64, his twirl one of the few things England have enjoyed in recent weeks. They leave with seven defeats and just one win.An injury scare for Ben Duckett adds to the pain. As does the false accusation from Ravi Shastri in the commentary box that England had just one net session on the trip, “if not any”. The tourists practised multiple times during the T20 international series before halting sessions after the first ODI because of mounting injuries amid a tightly packed itinerary.“I think we’ve had a reasonably long tour, a few long travel days,” Buttler, England’s white-ball captain, said. “There have been a couple of times we’ve not trained but we’ve certainly done plenty of training throughout the tour. We obviously try to create a really good environment but don’t mistake that for a lazy environment or a lack of effort. The guys are desperate to perform, do well and improve.”The day began with a change in approach, Buttler choosing to field after consecutive four-wicket defeats. What early damage would Sharma inflict? The India captain had struck an electric 76-ball ton on Sunday evening but contributed just a run here, Mark Wood finding the edge and Phil Salt gobbling up behind.Shubman Gill celebrates after bringing up his century. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesWood was impressive with the new ball, movement to go with his usual pace, but Gill and Kohli calmly constructed a 116-run stand. Gill had been building towards a bigger score after half‑centuries in the previous two games, and he was immaculate while charging down a familiar pitch; this is the ground he calls home in the Indian Premier League for Gujarat Titans. Kohli got to fifty at a run a ball, form rediscovered in his most dominant format.However, Rashid’s drift brought the danger, turn finding the edge of the bat, Kohli’s knock over for 52. Gill advanced to his seventh ODI century in his 50th innings before Rashid ended it with a googly. Iyer perished on 78 to one of the Yorkshireman’s poorer deliveries, the right-hander flicking down the leg side to Salt. Hardik Pandya wanted to damage Rashid’s figures, launching consecutive sixes, but the perfect retort was a leg-break that invited the forward prod and took the stumps. Buttler is correct when he says Rashid is England’s most important player. India still muscled their way past 350.The concern for England heading into their reply was the state of Duckett, who had been struggling with his left leg in the field. He still emerged as an opener with Salt, intent on a thrash even if movement was minimal. A 22-ball 34 from the left-hander included a remarkable eight boundaries, though the damage to his body is still unclear. “We’ll find out more over the next couple of days,” Buttler said.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionRohit Sharma (left) with England’s captain Jos Buttler after the ODI.
