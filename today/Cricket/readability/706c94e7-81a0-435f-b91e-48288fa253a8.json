  "text": "Williamson, who has not played any cricket since being sidelined with a groin injury during the Test tour to Sri Lanka, hit a 122-ball 60 against Auckland in his comeback game on Monday. Walking out at No.3, Williamson batted for almost three hours, hitting seven boundaries during his knock. He was the only batter to make a fifty in the innings, as Northern Districts were bowled out for 268. It was Williamson’s first outing in New Zealand’s first-class tournament in five years, having last played in the Plunket Shield in October 2019. Williamson, who missed New Zealand’s memorable tour of India last month due to the injury, was named in the squad to play England at home. Ahead of the side being named, head coach Gary Stead had sounded confident that the star player would be fit for the England series, which begins at the Hagley Oval on November 28. His return throws New Zealand into a dilemma about their team selection. Williamson’s replacement during the India series, Will Young, made 244 runs and ended with the Player of the Series award. Young has 961 runs in 19 Tests with a high score of 89, made in India during their series in 2021. New Zealand’s hopes of making the World Test Championship final have been reignited after their triumph in India, and they will have three more Tests against England to gain maximum points. It will be their last series in the 2023-25 cycle. Watch Kane Williamson’s knock here: Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
