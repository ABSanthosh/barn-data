An Indian express-pacer was a once-in-a-blue-moon discovery, and his ability to bowl fast yorkers at the death, move the ball off the deck and in the air, and maintain his pace set him apart from the more metronomic fast bowlers that India was used to.In his illustrious international career, Zaheer picked up 311 Test wickets in 92 matches and overall 610 scalps in 309 international matches across all formats for Men in Blue.Zaheer was a member of the 2011 World Cup-winning team and the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy team, which India shared with Sri Lanka due to a lack of results in the finals.Zaheer represented the Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils in the IPL.
