  "text": "Alice Capsey is set to become a high-profile casualty of England's group-stage exit at the T20 World Cup when the squad for the tour of South Africa is named next week.Capsey, 20, will not be part of the group for the T20 and Test legs of the multi-format tour in November and December.As reported by the Telegraph, the all-rounder keeps her place in the one-day squad.Batter Paige Scholfield, 28, is due to be included after making her England debut in Ireland in September.Seen as one of English cricket's brightest young prospects, Capsey did not pass 20 in any of her three innings at the T20 World Cup last month.England failed to make it to the semi-finals, finishing third in their group after a shambolic defeat by West Indies.With the mighty Australia eliminated in the semi-finals by South Africa and unfancied New Zealand going on to lift the trophy, England missed a golden opportunity to end a silverware drought stretching back to 2017.In the aftermath of England's exit, former spinner Alex Hartley said they were let down by their fitness - criticism head coach Jon Lewis rejected.England will play three T20s, three ODIs and a four-day Test on the tour of South Africa, which begins on 24 November. The Test is England's first away to South Africa since 1961 and first overseas against anyone other than Australia or India since a trip to New Zealand in 1992.The squad was due to be named on Friday, but that has been pushed back to next week.On Thursday, Capsey took five wickets and was out for a golden duck as her Melbourne Renegades were beaten by Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash. She was also among the players retained by Delhi Capitals for next year's Women's Premier League (WPL) in India.South Africa-born Scholfield, Capsey's Oval Invincibles team-mate in The Hundred, played in all five matches as a much-changed England team toured Ireland in the run-up to the T20 World Cup.She made 59 runs in the three one-day internationals and another 36 in the two T20s.England are also due to announce a new list of central contracts, deals that will include a pay increase.",
