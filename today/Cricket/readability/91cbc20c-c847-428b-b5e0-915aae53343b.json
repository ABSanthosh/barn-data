  "text": "Jacob Bethell said he would have asked to bat at number three on his Test debut had he not been given the \"surprise\" invitation to do so by England.The 21-year-old made an unbeaten 50 off 37 balls, including the winning runs, in England's eight-wicket defeat of New Zealand in the first Test in Christchurch.Bethell had never previously batted above number four in his first-class career.\"I would have asked for it to be honest,\" said Bethell. \"I like batting up the order so I was really happy that opportunity arose.\"I've always wanted to bat in the top four, so three is perfect.\"Bethell, initially on the New Zealand tour as batting cover, was put in line for his Test debut after an injury to wicketkeeper Jordan Cox.Ollie Pope, England's regular number three, stood in as wicketkeeper. In order to balance his workload, Pope moved down to number six, leaving the vacancy for Bethell.The Warwickshire man managed 10 in the first innings, not looking out of place in difficult batting conditions against the skilful New Zealand attack.In the second innings, with England chasing only 104, Bethell crashed eight fours and a six as England reached their target inside 13 overs at Hagley Oval.\"It's everything I've dreamed of,\" said Bethell. \"It lived up to expectation. It was so fun.\"It was my first experience playing in front of packed grass banks, pristine outfield, good pitches and playing against a good team, so it was great.\"Born in Barbados, Bethell moved to the UK on a cricket scholarship aged 12. His father Graham played club cricket with Matt Root, father of Joe Root, with whom he was at the crease when victory was sealed.\"To walk off with Rooty at the end there was pretty special,\" he said. \"To come out in the second innings and have a chance to walk off with an England win was at the forefront of my mind and luckily I was able to do that.\"Bethell had played 20 previous first-class matches, usually batting at number six or seven for Warwickshire, and said \"we're not going into that\" on his position in the Bears' order.The left-hander made his Test debut without making a century in senior professional cricket, but said he raises his game when he steps up a level, pointing to the three half-centuries he has made in 15 white-ball appearances for England.\"Pretty much every time I've played against better people, I've played better,\" he said.\"The step up to the Hundred, played better. Straight into internationals, played better. I didn't really have a doubt in my mind that coming into Test cricket that I'd have done well.\"Bethell is set for his first season in the Indian Premier League after being signed by Royal Challengers Bangalore in the mega auction. He will be a team-mate of India superstar Virat Kohli.\"Any young overseas player that's gone over there has come back with a wealth of experience,\" said Bethell.\"Getting those experiences around the likes of Virat and that RCB team will stand my game in good stead for the future.\"",
