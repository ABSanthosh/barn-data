  "text": "Royal Challengers Bengaluru have a new-look bowling attack after the IPL 2025 mega auction. Here’s how their bowlers have fared in the latest round of Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2024 matches. Bhuvneshwar Kumar 2-1-1-1 (UP v Arunachal Pradesh) The out-of-four India swing bowler was picked up by RCB for INR 10.75 core, ending his 11-year association with former franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad. Defending Uttar Pradesh's 242-4 against Arunachal Pradesh, he bowled two overs for just a run – 11 out of 12 being dots. The chasing team fell short by 156 runs. Krunal Pandya 4-0-59-0 (Baroda v Saurashtra) The left-arm spinner might be out-of-favour from the national team, but seemed in demand at the auction with RR and RCB engaging in a bidding war. He's bowled economical spells through the tournament so far, picking at least a wicket in each of the games. Captaining Baroda, he was taken to the cleaners by Saurashtra, who went on to score 266-6. He leaked 59 runs off his four overs without any success. During the steep chase, Pandya, at No.6, contributed with a 16-ball 29 but it was not enough for Baroda, who slumped to a 78-run defeat. Rasikh Salam 4-0-30-9 (J\u0026K v Manipur) The talented pacer from the cricketing backwaters of Jammu \u0026 Kashmir earned a contract for the Bengaluru-based side on the back of an impressive Emerging Teams Asia Cup. His 3-30 helped his state side restrict Manipur to 110-8. Notably, Rasikh's every dismissal during the innings was a bowled out. First Test, first fifty.Jacob Bethell smashed the joint-second fastest debut fifty in Test history, sealing the game with the winning runs to complete a perfect start in England whites.Read here ➡️https://t.co/kcKc2dYI0z pic.twitter.com/7EEz7FkIyM — Wisden (@WisdenCricket) December 1, 2024 Suyash Sharma 4-0-23-1 (Delhi v Himachal Pradesh) Ever since Bengaluru let go of Yuzvendra Chahal, they have struggled to find another spinner of his calibre. Suyash, who impressed during his maiden season for Kolkata Knight Riders in 2023, will be key to their chances on the Bengaluru belter. His unorthodox action gives him an edge. Against Himachal Pradesh, the wrist-spinner returned with 1-23 off his four overs, restricting the batting side to 145-8. Delhi gunned down the target with 5.1 overs and five wickets remaining. Mohit Rathee 4-0-35-0 (Services v Andhra) In a high-scoring encounter where Andhra Pradesh notched up 222-8, Rathee was the most economical bowler for Services. Despite not getting a wicket, he is the only bowler to go under nine an over. In response, Services ended their innings at 199-9, with the all-rounder managing a 12-ball five. Manoj Bhandage 4-0-19-3 (Karnataka v Tamil Nadu) Bought back by RCB this year, local boy Bhandage had a key role to play in Karnataka's drubbing of Tamil Nadu, taking 3-19 as the batting team folded for 90. This came after two wicket-less spells v Sikkim and Saurashtra. Follow Wisden for all cricket updates, including live scores, match stats, quizzes and more.
