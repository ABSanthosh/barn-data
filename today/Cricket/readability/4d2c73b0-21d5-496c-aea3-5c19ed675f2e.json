  "text": "Oct 25, 2024 2 minute read News India have named a squad of 18 for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with Rohit Sharma’s side looking for a fifth consecutive Test series victory against Australia. The tourists will have to make do without left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who will undergo treatment on a chronic left groin issue instead. There is also no room for left-arm spinner Axar Patel, with Washington Sundar, the off-spin all-rounder excelling in the ongoing Test against New Zealand, included. India have also picked two uncapped pace-bowling all-rounders, Harshit Rana and Nitish Kumar Reddy. The pair, aged 22 and 21 respectively, are in the infancies of their professional careers. Reddy has played 21 first-class games and Rana just nine. Reddy has played three T20Is for India, while Rana is uncapped at the international level. Also not included is Mohammed Shami, the 34-year-old right-arm quick whose fitness has been a much-discussed topic in recent weeks. Alongside Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep and Prasidh Krishna will make up the pace-bowling contingent, with Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini and Khaleel Ahmed named as reserves. Otherwise, the squad is as expected. Abhimanyu Easwaran will serve as backup opener to Rohit and Yashasvi Jaiswal, and could step in if the India captain is absent for the birth of his child at any point. Dhruv Jurel is the reserve wicketkeeper, with Sarfaraz Khan and KL Rahul set to compete for a middle-order spot, alongside guaranteed starters Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja are the main two spin options. India’s squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (WK), R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar. Reserves: Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini, Khaleel Ahmed India name squad for South Africa T20Is India also named a 15-man squad for their four-match T20I series against South Africa, which begins on November 8. Mayank Yadav, Riyan Parag and Shivam Dube are all unavailable due to injuries. There is no overlap between the T20I and Test squads announced today. India’s squad for South Africa T20Is: Suryakumar Yadav (C), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (WK), Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravi Bishnoi, Arshdeep Singh, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Avesh Khan, Yash Dayal.
