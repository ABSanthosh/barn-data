  "text": "Saqib Mahmood broke the record for the most powerplay wickets claimed by an England bowler in a men's T20I series or competition after taking 3-17 from his four overs in the third T20I of their series against West Indies. Mahmood has enjoyed an outstanding tour of the Caribbean after enduring a miserable run of injuries. The Lancashire seamer has spent the majority of the past two years of the sidelines having threatened to break through and establish himself in England's first choice Test plans after impressing during their trip to the West Indies in early 2022. Mahmood has claimed nine wickets from the opening three games of the five-match series, eight of which have come in the powerplay. He is the first England bowler to take eight powerplay wickets in a single series or competition, breaking David Willey's previous record of seven from the 2016 World T20. Willey played six matches in that tournament. Mahmood is likely to break at least one more record before the series out. His current tally of nine wickets for the series is already the joint most for England in a bilateral men's T20I series, one that he holds with Adil Rashid after his tour of the Caribbean last year. The overall record for the most wickets for England in any form of series or competition is the 13 that Sam Curran took on his way to being named the player of the tournament in England's victorious T20 World Cup campaign two years ago. If Mahmood continues his excellent form, that record is also within reach. England won the toss and elected to bowl first for the third fixture in a row after a delayed start in Saint Lucia. Mahmood and Jofra Archer set the tone for the tourists, restricting West Indies to 37-5 in the powerplay with England captain Jos Buttler going on the attack, at one point deploying a short leg for Archer and keeping both opening bowlers on for the entirety of the first six overs. West Indies mustered up an excellent comeback, though. Skipper Rovman Powell and Romario Shepherd put on 73 for the sixth wicket before a late flourish from Alzarri Joseph (21 off 19) took the hosts to a defendable final total of 145-8 from their 20 overs.
