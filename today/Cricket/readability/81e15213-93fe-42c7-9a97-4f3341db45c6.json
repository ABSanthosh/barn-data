  "text": "Captain Heather Knight says fitness was not the reason for England's shock Women's T20 World Cup exit and is not an \"issue\" in her team.England dropped five catches in a shambolic defeat by West Indies to condemn them to a group-stage exit in the United Arab Emirates last month.In the aftermath, World Cup-winning spinner Alex Hartley said England \"need to get fitter\".Knight's side return to action on Sunday as the first T20 against South Africa in East London kicks off a multi-format series.\"We have some brilliant athletes and some brilliant players that work exceptionally hard to be fit and ready to play,\" Knight told BBC Sport.Speaking to Test Match Special following the elimination, Hartley, part of Knight's team when England last won a trophy in 2017, said: \"About 80% of the England team are fit and athletic enough, but there are girls in that side who are letting the team down when it comes to fitness.\"Head coach Jon Lewis responded by saying: \"I 100% don't agree with that.\"Knight added: \"I don't think it was a reason why we lost the game and I don't feel like it's an issue in this side.\"England's off-field activities in the UAE were also called into question, with some players attending a boat party and posting about it on social media.Lewis and Knight have been keen to give the squad freedom away from cricket in the hope in translates to performances on the field.\"Part of being an England cricketer is touring, experiencing the countries you're in,\" said Knight.\"Here in South Africa, I'm keen to organise a trip to the Apartheid Museum, keen to go on safari, and that's part of being an England cricketer and the joy of touring.\"I'll reassure you our girls work exceptionally hard and looking in on social media isn't just what we do. You don't see the hard work this team does, because we do. A lot. That balance is pretty good.\"England's World Cup disappointment was compounded by the semi-final exit of the dominant Australia. The trophy was lifted by New Zealand, a team England have beaten in their past seven T20s.Knight rejected the notion that her team are prone to buckling in pressure moments, describing the World Cup as a \"bump in the road\".\"We performed pretty badly for eight overs in a competition, but there are so many examples of us handling pressure really well in big moments,\" she said.\"Unfortunately we didn't do that against West Indies, but I think it can be a really good reset for us. It will keep us humble and motivate us to work hard on some things we need to do better and keep growing as a side.\"Knight suffered a calf injury while batting and had to watch from the dressing room as her side struggled in the field during the defeat by West Indies.She is back to fitness after a stint with Sydney Thunder in the Women's Big Bash in Australia.England's World Cup exit also came a month after Knight admitted a charge over a historic racist social media post.In 2012, when she was 21, Knight was pictured in blackface at a party at a cricket club in Kent.\"I was glad for it to come out, then I could move on,\" she said. \"It was a photo from a very long time ago.\"I apologised and it's something I regret, and that's the end of it. It wasn't perfect timing, but I was glad it was out of the way before the World Cup.\"Speaking in May, Knight revealed the period around 2022, when England were heavily beaten in an away Ashes then almost suffered an early exit at the 50-over World Cup, was the most difficult time during her spell as captain.Knight has been skipper since 2016 and had thoughts during the previous 50-over World Cup that it might be her last, but the next one in India is now only about 10 months away.Knight, who will be 34 next month, said: \"That was a thought I had at the time, but the next one comes around quickly.\"I'm not looking too far ahead because we have two massive series in South Africa and Australia. That World Cup is around the corner, but let's see how we go with these ones.\"England's tour of South Africa includes three T20s, three one-day internationals and a four-day Test, mirroring the format of the Ashes series in Australia just after Christmas.Knight does not believe her side have a point to prove in South Africa or Australia following the World Cup showing.\"Setbacks make you more motivated, keep you humble and make you work harder,\" she said.\"I wouldn't say it's proving a point. It's about us continually trying to be better, being in positions to be successful and do what we want to do.\"We're pretty confident that we can continue to evolve as a side and play our best cricket during those big series.\"",
