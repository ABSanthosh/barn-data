  "text": "England seamer Matthew Potts says the pitch for the second Test in Pakistan does not have \"as many demons\" as the tourists first thought.The second consecutive Test in Multan is being played on the same surface used for England's record-breaking win in the first Test.And although Pakistan were reduced to 19-2 inside the first 10 overs, a century from debutant Kamran Ghulam led the hosts to 259-5 at the close of day one.\"You don't judge the score until both teams have batted on it,\" Potts told Test Match Special. \"The pitch certainly appeared like it was a little bit flatter than we first expected. The game is in the balance.\"England won a run-filled first Test last week. In an effort to bring their bowlers into the second Test, Pakistan have re-used the same pitch, a highly unusual situation made possible by the first two Tests being played at the same venue.When Jack Leach became the first England slow bowler since 1889 to strike twice in the first 10 overs of a Test, it appeared the match would be dominated by spin, run-scoring would be devilishly difficult and the contest over in little more than two days.But Ghulam, in the home side in place of superstar Babar Azam, became the 13th Pakistan man to make a Test hundred on debut. As the day progressed, England were kept in touch by their trio of pace bowlers, including Potts, who dismissed Saim Ayub for 77 to end the opener's 149-run partnership with Ghulam.\"It hasn't had as many demons as perhaps we have thought,\" said Potts of the pitch.\"We've seen a couple scuttle low but on the whole, it's been OK. It's on the slow side, but it's been alright.\"According to data analysts Cricviz, the pitch for the second Test was the third most-difficult on which to bat of all opening-day surfaces in 17 matches since Test cricket returned to Pakistan in 2019.Still, that is not unusual. In the same time period, only Sri Lanka has more difficult day-one pitches than Pakistan (data from India is not available).Ayub said: \"Some balls were keeping low so it was difficult to bat. You can see the pitch was slow and turning, double-paced with the fast bowlers.\"The 29-year-old Ghulam added: \"It was a difficult pitch to bat on. Sometimes the ball kept low, sometimes it would turn.\"England's day might have been better had an edge from Muhammad Rizwan off the bowling of Potts been detected.The tourists opted not to review and Rizwan, on six at the time, remains unbeaten on 37.\"There was a half-decent noise going past the bat,\" said the 25-year-old Potts, who is playing in his first overseas Test.\"The guys in front of the bat heard the noise and the guys behind didn't hear anything. If you're unsure about it, it's probably right to remain on the other side.\"It's never nice, little things like that when you're working hard out there, but we've created chances throughout the day and we'll create chances tomorrow as well.\"",
