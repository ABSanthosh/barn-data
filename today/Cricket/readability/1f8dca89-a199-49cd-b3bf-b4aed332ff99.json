I am delighted to be working with this experienced group and excited about what we can collectively achieve for the benefit of the global game.\"The world cricket committee was an independent body which did not hold any formal power, but its recommendations have often been adopted by the ICC. These have included calls for a Decision Review System, the formation of a World Test Championship, the introduction of day-night Test cricket, and the use of a shot clock to improve slow over-rates,The new advisory board will meet virtually throughout the year, and in person after the symposium at Lord's.
