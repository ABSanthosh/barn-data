A fearless Brook slammed an unbeaten century to give England the upper hand in the game against an error-strewn Blackcaps on day two. At stumps Brook was 132 not out with the visitors recovering from 71 for 4 to be 319 for 5, trailing the hosts by 29 runs and with five wickets in hand. Captain Stokes was unbeaten on 37 after being dropped by Tom Latham on 30 -- New Zealand's sixth dropped catch and the third by their skipper. (Live Scorecard) Topics mentioned in this article",
