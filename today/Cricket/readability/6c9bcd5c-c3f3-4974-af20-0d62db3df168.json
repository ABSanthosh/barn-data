  "text": "Australia’s captain Pat Cummins has acknowledged that a “reset” is coming for his team after another top-order capitulation opened the door for a South African upset for the ages.Not having lost an ICC final since 2010, Australia were upstaged by Temba Bavuma’s fighting Proteas at Lord’s in a five-wicket defeat, crushing their hopes of defending the World Test Championship title they won in 2023.Australia’s batting woes were laid bare, particularly in the second innings when only plucky knocks from fast bowler Mitchell Starc and wicketkeeper Alex Carey saved the top-ranked team from utter embarrassment.Batting conditions became ideal at the start of day three when the sun came out. The pitch was suddenly flat and pace bowlers struggled for the movement they got in the first innings.But it was too late for the Australians, who were already 144-8 to start Friday, a lead of only 212.“There’s probably quite a few people in the lineup that wish they could have done a little bit more,” Cummins said.“Obviously, the top three was an obvious one in this game.”Promoted from No 3 to opener in a Test for the first time, the struggling Marnus Labuschagne got starts but ultimately only made 17 and 22 to extend his century drought to almost 24 months.Labuschagne’s opening partner, the 38-year-old Usman Khawaja, was again exposed against express pace after falling to Proteas spearhead Kagiso Rabada for scores of 0 and 7.Khawaja made a career best 232 on slow pitches in Sri Lanka earlier this year, but his recent history against quality fast bowlers is a concern.Cameron Green, who batted at No 3 in his first Test since March 2024 after recovering from back surgery, was also troubled by Rabada and was out for 4 and 0.Green, aged 26, was the only member of the Australian XI in his 20s in this Test.But after suffering a compound dislocation of his right little finger at Lord’s, Steve Smith is almost no chance to play in at least the first Test against the West Indies.Teenager Sam Konstas, who announced himself last Boxing Day, is set to be given an opportunity as opener for Australia’s first tour of the Caribbean in 10 years.If Smith can’t play, Konstas could slot back in to open with Khawaja, while Labuschagne would likely drop down to No 3.But Josh Inglis, who scored a century on debut against Sri Lanka earlier this year, is also in the squad and could be given a chance.“In white-ball series a lot of the time, you build on four-year cycles around World Cups for ODIs,” Cummins said.“Maybe it’s an opportunity in the Test matches to do something similar. But it’s a little bit early to tell.“Coming into this match, you’ve got guys like Sam Konstas and Scotty Boland, Josh Inglis, all those guys who are right on the fringes.“After this Test match, everyone gets thrown back into the conversation, and it’s a little bit of a reset for the first Test against the West Indies.“Give it a 48 hours, everyone kind of digests and works out if we keep the same squad.”",
