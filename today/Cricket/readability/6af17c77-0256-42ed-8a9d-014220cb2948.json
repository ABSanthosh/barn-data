India vs England LIVE: Four runs! First boundary for Gill! Carse pulls this full and wide, just close to the tramline. Gill throws his bat at it. Tongue made a long chase and it seemed that he was in control of it. In the end, he fails to do muchIND: 105/2 (29) India vs England LIVE: Maiden over Maiden over for Chris Woakes in his first one after Lunch. Shubman Gill choosing caution, and letting the balls outside off-stump go. Jaiswal, on the other end, is 8 runs away from his fifty. IND 98/2 (28) India vs England LIVE: Overthrows, 5 runs Oh dear.

The new captain of the Indian Test team, and also their new No. 4, taking over the baton from Virat Kohli. With two quick wickets going down just before Lunch, onus will on Gill to steady the ship again with Jaiswal. India vs England LIVE: Great knock by Jaiswal Yashasvi Jaiswal hadn't scored a ton of runs for India A heading into this match. He had been dismissed by Chris Woakes cheaply in one match as well. However, he has shown his class yet again today. Terrific temperament, some glorious shots, and a brilliantly-paced knock, where he has hardly been troubled. IND vs ENG LIVE 1st Test Day 1: India's session India may have lost two late wickets to end the first session, but they'll be largely happy with how they've fared. Jaiswal has been excellent, Rahul had a few tentative shots but also a few glorious ones. England, though, after struggling for 20-odd overs, have a glimmer of hope and a way back into the game. India vs England LIVE: Sudharsan out for duck! OUT! Nightmare debut for Sai Sudharsan. The talented batter gets a faint edge down the leg-side and it is caught behind by Jamie Smith. Ben Stokes gets the wicket. England have ended the session on a high. And that will be Lunch.IND 92/2 (25.4) India vs England LIVE Score: OUT! KL Rahul departs GONE! One edge too many for KL Rahul.

Welcome breakthrough for England.IND 91/1 (24.5) India vs England LIVE: Both batters into the 40s Boundaries continuing to come for KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. They've now entered the 40s, and will both be eyeing half-centuries before Lunch on Day 1. Can England somehow get a wicket in the 10 minutes remaining in the first session?IND 91/0 (24) India vs England LIVE Score: Wow, Rahul! Another cover drive of the highest quality from KL Rahul. Magnificent timing, driven with class and precision. Ben Stokes is leaking runs here, even though he's achieving the most swing of any bowler so far. India go past 80. The frustration on his face is clear as day.IND 82/0 (22) IND vs ENG LIVE: Boundaries again! Now Jaiswal It is Jaiswal's turn now to deal in boundaries. Targets Brydon Carse, who is back into the attack. First one, a full toss driven through cover. The next is leg byes, drifting behind down the leg side. This opening partnership is cruising towards 100 now.IND 77/0 (21) India vs England LIVE: 4, 4 Rahul! KL Rahul cracks a couple of boundaries in a row against Ben Stokes! Two edges, but both running away for 4. Rahul into the 30s now, joining Jaiswal. India manage 68 runs in the first 20 overs.IND 68/0 (20) IND vs ENG LIVE: Stokes takes the ball Ben Stokes has taken the ball now. Two decent overs in a row from the England captain, with Jaiswal and Rahul seeing him off early doors. 18 overs done, but not a single wicket taken yet by England. Dare I say, not even a big chance created.IND 55/0 (18) India vs England LIVE: 50 up for India! A boundary to start the 15th over, and then three runs. 50 up for India, it's taken them just 15 overs. An excellent opening partnership between Jaiswal and Rahul. England have looked toothless so far, for the most part.IND 52/0 (15) India vs England LIVE: End of the first hour 14 overs done, and end of one hour of play on Day 1. Excellent start by India, England haven't even created a big chance yet. Superb stuff from Jaiswal and Rahul. Jaiswal has dealt in boundaries, while Rahul is upping the gears after a cautious start.IND 44/0 (14) India vs England LIVE: 4! Now KL Rahul! Another cover drive. Boundaries rolling thick and fast, India's run-rate over 3 at this point. Given the new ball and the conditions at play, this has been a top job so far by Rahul and Jaiswal. India nearing 50 now.IND 44/0 (13.2) IND vs ENG LIVE: FOUR! Magnificent! Stand and deliver from Yashasvi Jaiswal. The left-hander has looked absolutely brilliant so far. Another spectacular shot down the ground, past mid-off, and into the fence for 4 runs. He's looked superb today.IND 40/0 (13) India vs England LIVE: Huge appeal! DRS! Great inswinging yorker from Tongue to Jaiswal, the left-hander misses and a big appeal follows from the English team. Seems to be going well outside leg, but Ben Stokes goes up with a DRS review. And guess what, it's pitching outside leg!\"These are the times you want the replay to go away as fast as possible from the giant screen, it can be embarrassing,\" says Ravi Shastri, followed by laughter from the rest of the comm box.IND 36/0 (12.2) IND vs ENG LIVE 1st Test Day 1: Glorious KL Rahul That is superb! KLassy! Wide outside off-stump, swinging away from Woakes, but driven gloriously by Rahul through the covers. India openers continuing their solid start. Opening partnership nearing 50 now.IND 36/0 (11.1) India vs England LIVE Score: Great shot! Top shot by Yashasvi Jaiswal. Penultimate ball of Tongue's first over, pitched up and classily timed down the ground by the left-hander. Excellent timing. Next ball is shorter, Jaiswal goes for a lofted shot though point, but it finds the fielder after taking a bounce. India's total crosses 30.IND 32/0 (11) India vs England LIVE: 10 overs done End of 10 overs on Day 1! After a fast start, with a string of boundaries from Jaiswal, things have slowed down a bit. Woakes and Carse came into shape well. Just 1 run in the last 3 overs. Now Josh Tongue is going to take the ball, replacing Woakes in the attack.IND 27/0 (10) India vs England LIVE: Chance for England! Great inswinger by Chris Woakes, Jaiswal swings but misses, and it crashes onto his pads. Lovely delivery, but would've been missing leg-stump. Can Woakes and Carse now continue to trouble the opening pair? Jaiswal has looked good but Rahul is tentative.IND 26/0 (7) India vs England LIVE: 4 more! Yashasvi Jaiswal on song Yashasvi Jaiswal is looking in glorious touch. Two boundaries in one over. The second one is a lovely shot. Pitched wide outside off-stump and driven with conviction by the left-hander. Fourth boundary for him. He had some iffy games for India A, but he's looked very convincing so far.IND 23/0 (6) India vs England LIVE Score: Rahul's first boundary Edged! But 4 runs! Rahul tempted into a drive, but catches a thick edge that flies off for a boundary. Lucky escape for Rahul. First boundary conceded by Carse. The pacer comes back well, with 5 dots to end the over. String of boundaries for India to start of.IND 14/0 (4) IND vs ENG LIVE: FOUR! Glorious from Jaiswal! Excellent timing, picks up his second boundary. Not an edge this time, pitched up full, and slammed through mid-off by the stylish left-hander. Excellent shot, 6 runs off Woakes' over.IND 10/0 (3) India vs England LIVE: Maiden over! Brydon Carse opens he bowling from the other end, and it's a maiden over to start. Good swing, good movement from the pacer. The sun is out here at Headingley, but there's a hint of cloud as well. Interesting conditions.IND 4/0 (2) India vs England LIVE: Match starts! Chris Woakes to Yashasvi Jaiswal to start the five-match Test series in England! And Jaiswal slams a boundary on the last ball of the over. Five dots to start, but then a gentle defence takes a thick edge through third man for 4!IND 4/0 (1) India vs England LIVE: One minute's silence The England and India players are on the pitch. They're having a minute's silence, in memory of the victims of the Ahmedabad plane crash. Black armbands have been worn by everyone as well. And now, time for the national anthems. IND vs ENG LIVE 1st Test Day 1: Jaiswal warming up Yashasvi Jaiswal is facing some throwdowns on the practice pitches ahead of the start of the match. The left-hander has a big role to play. We know how aggressive he can be, but can he survive the new ball? Chris Woakes did get him out in the India A game cheaply. India vs England LIVE: Massive test for Jaiswal, Rahul Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul will face the daunting task of the new ball and seeing out the opening phase. It is a particularly difficult task for Jaiswal, who is playing a Test match in England for the first time. India vs England LIVE: England playing XI England XI vs India: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Shoaib Bashir.England stick with the same lineup that they had announced a couple of days ago. India vs England LIVE: India playing XI India XI vs England: Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk), Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna. India vs England LIVE: Sudharsan, Shardul, Karun feature! Shubman Gill confirms that India are going ahead with four pacers -- three frontline, with Shardul as the all-rounder. Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair both enter the playing XI. Gill confirms that Sai Sudharsan will bat at No. 3!  India vs England LIVE: ENGLAND WIN TOSS! England captain Ben Stokes wins the toss, opts to bowl! So Shubman Gill and co. will face the new ball early on Day 1. A massive test in store amid mixed conditions at Headingley. This will be interesting! IND vs ENG LIVE 1st Test Day 1: Pujara gave the cap to Sai Sudharsan From one No. 3 to the next? Cheteshwar Pujara was the one to hand over the Test cap to B Sai Sudharsan, and may almost just be passing the baton for success at the coveted No. 3 role. A great moment for a stylish cricketer with a top-notch temperament. India vs England LIVE: Shardul to feature? According to reports, Shardul Thakur has marked his run-up, hinting that he is all set to feature in India's playing XI today. This will confirm a superb comeback for the pacer, who last featured over two years ago.  IND vs ENG LIVE: Sai Sudharsan to make debut! Left-hander Sai Sudharsan has just received his Test cap! That confirms, he is set to make his debut today, and likely bat at No. 3. Massive development taking place. A well-earned Test cap for Sai Sudharsan, who was the Orange Cap winner in IPL 2025. India vs England LIVE: \"Really good batting conditions\" As reported by NDTV's Boria Majumdar, winning the toss and batting first will be the right choice. It will be important for the top order to bat out the first couple of hours and protect their wicket, but as Day 1 goes on, batting will become easier he says. India vs England LIVE 1st Test: Players to wear black armbands Players of both India and England are set to wear black armbands during the first Test, paying homage to the victims of the Ahmedabad air tragedy from last week. An Air India flight, scheduled to travel from Ahmedabad, Gujarat to Gatwick London, crashed seconds after launch, resulting in the death of over 250. A minute's silence will also be observed. India vs England LIVE: 30 minutes to toss We are just half an hour away from toss time for the first Test! Overcast conditions are expected at Headingley for all 5 days of the Test. Winning the toss, therefore, is set to have a big impact on the outcome of the match. IND vs ENG LIVE: How many spinners will India go with? India will surely go with at least one spinner, likely Ravindra Jadeja, given his ability with the bat. However, Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar are also in contention. Kuldeep provides a unique chinaman X-factor, while Washington is more than handy with the bat. India vs England LIVE Score: Nitish Reddy or Shardul Thakur? The pace bowling all-rounder is set to be a toss up between Nitish Reddy and Shardul Thakur. Nitish made a serious impression Down Under, but has seen his form dip. Meanwhile, Shardul has entered the side after brilliant form in domestic cricket, and impressed in the intra-squad match with both bat and ball. India vs England LIVE: Nair vs Sudharsan - No. 3? With Shubman Gill set to bat at No. 4 and Jaiswal and KL Rahul expected to open, the slot for No. 3 is one up for grabs. Youngster B Sai Sudharsan could be in line to make his Test debut, having finished as the highest run-scorer in IPL 2025. On the other hand, Karun Nair slammed a double century for India A against England Lions, batting at No. 3, and could feature.Nair may also find a spot down at No. 6 should India opt to go with an extra batter. IND vs ENG LIVE 1st Test Day 1: What Gill said on playing XI Shubman Gill: \"I was waiting to see the pitch for one last time before deciding the Playing XI. We have one or two combinations, and we'll have one last look at the pitch before finalising it. It has been a drier English summer this time around.\" India vs England LIVE: Playing XI headache! The big task on Shubman Gill and head coach Gautam Gambhir's plate: Nailing the Playing XI. No. 3, No. 6, all-rounder, spinner and pace bowling unit -- all major decisions that could affect the trajectory of the squad. Let's discuss the options.  India vs England 1st Test LIVE: Shubman Gill era begins The big news then -- this is the start of the Shubman Gill era.

Kuldeep provides a unique chinaman X-factor, while Washington is more than handy with the bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \u003cdiv id=\"6_parent\" data-keyevent=\"false\"\u003e\n                \u003ch3\u003eIndia vs England LIVE Score: Nitish Reddy or Shardul Thakur?\u003c/h3\u003e\n                \u003cp\u003eThe pace bowling all-rounder is set to be a toss up between Nitish Reddy and Shardul Thakur.
