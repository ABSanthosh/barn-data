The 37-year-old Rohit started Mumbai's reply under pressure, having averaged just 13.66 this season from six innings.But the veteran batter found his touch at his home stadium, hitting four fours and six sixes to seal a fourth victory for his side, lifting them one place to sixth in the table.Chennai remain rooted to the bottom of the standings, having won just two of their eight games.",
