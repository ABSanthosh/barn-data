The five-time champions have shelled out INR 16.35 crore for Pandya as the franchise’s third retention ahead of IPL 2025. Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela Jayawardene confirmed on the retention announcement show that Pandya would continue as skipper, before the franchise issued a press release stating the same. You can find the retention lists for all ten teams right here. Pandya succeeded Rohit Sharma as Mumbai Indians’ captain last year after completing a historic transfer from Gujarat Titans. After starting his IPL career for the franchise in 2015, the all-rounder moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, captaining them to win the competition in their debut season, followed by a runners-up finish in the next season. However, his homecoming wasn’t a happy one, as Mumbai finished at the bottom of the points table, winning just four out of their 14 outings. Pandya’s personal form, as well as his captaincy, came under scrutiny, with him being often subject to boos from the crowd. But he bounced back in style with vital contributions in India’s triumphant T20 World Cup campaign in June, earning back the crowd support during the team’s victory lap at Wankhede, Mumbai’s home ground. Jasprit Bumrah (INR 18 crore), Suryakumar Yadav (INR 16.35 crore), Rohit Sharma (INR 16.30 crore) and Tilak Varma (INR 8 crore) are the other four retentions for MI.
