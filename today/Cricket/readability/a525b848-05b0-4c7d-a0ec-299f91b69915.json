Photograph: Alex Davidson-ICC/ICC/Getty ImagesAustralia’s greatest strength has always been that they do not need to rely on one player. In many international teams, an opponent needs only to shut down one or two players to gain control of a match. Australia’s immense batting, bowling – and even wicketkeeping – depth means that this is usually not the case. The loss of Ellyse Perry for the 2020 Women’s T20 World Cup final was one of the most talked about moments of the tournament, with questions over whether Australia could triumph without her. The remainder of the team answered that question unequivocally with their now-famous 85-run victory. Healy is undoubtedly important, but the team will not be using her absence as an excuse for the loss to South Africa in the UAE.The eyes of the world will quickly turn to the second semi-final between New Zealand and the West Indies to find out who will meet South Africa in the final. The decider already promises to be a game-changer for women’s cricket as the chasing pack show signs of closing the gap on the three highest-ranked teams in Australia, England and India. But for the top-ranked Australia, the inevitable question is – what now?On the face of it, that question may not even require an answer. Cricket is an unpredictable game. Even the most dominant teams lose games and it was perhaps unfortunate that particular game happened to be a semi-final of a major tournament. Throw in the loss of the captain and it becomes even simpler. Get back to full strength and continue with business as usual.However, the Australian team has a culture that demands excellence. Questions will be asked and answers sought. Consideration will be given to team balance and plans to cover unexpected losses of key players.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionEarlier this year, Australia toured Bangladesh to play a six-match series against a much lower ranked team without taking any uncapped players. When coach Shelley Nitschke was asked about this decision, she cited T20 World Cup preparation (the tournament was scheduled to be played in Bangladesh before being moved to the UAE) as a key reason why the selectors had opted for an experienced squad. But with this unexpected loss, it is worth asking whether short-term succession planning should have been higher on the agenda.The Australian team has been so strong for so long that it has been hard to hold the selectors accountable – domestic players can dominate the WNCL and WBBL for multiple seasons and not even appear to be in consideration for the national team. Even within the squad, there could have been opportunities for Healy to take a back seat and hand over the gloves. While Mooney keeps regularly in domestic competitions, the chance to keep to the specific bowling plans of her Australian teammates in match situations would have been incredibly valuable experience.While this shock loss is disappointing for the Australian team and its fans, it could be the spark for greater accountability, as well as a refresh in selection strategy and game tactics. And while the team would have certainly preferred to be holding the trophy aloft, in the long run this loss could lead the team to even greater heights.",
