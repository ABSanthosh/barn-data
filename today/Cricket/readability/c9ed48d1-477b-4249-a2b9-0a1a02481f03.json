What if Rishabh Pant played like this all throughout the season, what if their bowler's stayed fit.

LSG vs RCB LIVE: What is the H2H? Royal Challengers Bengaluru hold a slender advantage over Lucknow Super Giants when it comes to the overall head-to-head. RCB have 3 wins, while LSG have 2, in their 5 encounters to date. This will be their only match this season. LSG vs RCB LIVE: Last chance for Rishabh Pant Rishabh Pant has had a season to forget. After being signed for Rs 27 crore, a lot of expectations surrounded the wicket-keeper batter. However, after making 151 runs in 13 matches at a strike of just 107, it is fair to say the expectations have not been met this year.Can Rishabh Pant have one final gift for the LSG crowd this year tonight? LSG vs RCB LIVE: Virat Kohli on verge of 2 massive records RCB stalwart Virat Kohli has enjoyed a great season. Kohli has amassed more than 500 runs, and is RCB's leading run-scorer. However, he can achieve 2 massive records tonight:1) Kohli is 24 runs away from becoming the first-ever IPL player to make 9,000 runs.2) Kohli is 1 half-century away from the most number of IPL fifties by a player (currently on 62, tied with David Warner) LSG vs RCB LIVE: LSG playing for pride LSG made all the headlines at the mega auction when Sanjiv Goenka shelled out Rs 27 crore for Rishabh Pant. However, the season hasn't gone to plan, and they were knocked out of the playoff race after just 12 games. However, they did register a big win in their last game against Gujarat Titans, and can spoil the playoff party for RCB too with a win today. LSG vs RCB LIVE: RCB eye top two! With a win, RCB can seal a top two finish in the IPL 2025 points table today. It will be a vital win for them, as a Qualifier 1 berth would help them get two cracks at the IPL final. In fact, a big victory could even see them finish in the No. 1 spot! LSG vs RCB LIVE: Hello and welcome! A very good evening to one and all, welcome to the live coverage of IPL 2025 on NDTV Sports!
