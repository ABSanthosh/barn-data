The team can scarcely afford to lose a key player, needing all the batting depth they can muster as they attempt to overhaul Pakistan’s first-innings total of 556.With Zak Crawley, England’s other first-choice opener, having just returned from a broken finger also sustained while fielding at slip, Ollie Pope stood in for Duckett and was dismissed for a duck as the tourists’ reply got off to a dismal start. But Crawley, with a run-a-ball 64, and Joe Root, with 32, took England to 96 for one at the close, still 460 behind, as the team tries to recover from the best part of two hot and draining days in the field.“They were immensely tough conditions for everyone out there,” said Brydon Carse, who dismissed Naseem Shah and Aamer Jamal for the first two wickets of his Test career.“It’s been tough over the last two days. Obviously it’s draining in the heat, and we didn’t get much out of the wicket. But credit to the team and everyone who kept coming back each session. It’s an incredible environment in there, and the guys keep smiling, keep joking, and keep trying to give their best each session. There’s some tired bodies in that camp at the moment but the lads will rest up and come again.”The pivotal moment of the day came when a brilliant, juggling catch by Chris Woakes on the boundary was ruled out because a foot was brushing the turf on the wrong side of the padding as he collected the ball. “It was a great bit of fielding, but one of those 50/50 chances that just didn’t go our way,” Carse said.Chris Woakes’s smart catch of Salman Agha on the boundary was overruled.

When the tail comes it brings the best out of me, you can say that.”",
