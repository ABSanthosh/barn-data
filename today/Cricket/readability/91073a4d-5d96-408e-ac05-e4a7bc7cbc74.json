  "text": "NewsThe New Zealander has hit form for Perth Scorchers as they hunt for a place in the finalsAAP05-Jan-2025 • 1 hr agoFinn Allen has made up for a slow start to the BBL  •  Sarah Reed - CA / Getty ImagesPerth Scorchers import Finn Allen says it was fair for fans to doubt him following four consecutive failures, and he hopes he's now won them back over.Allen, a devastating top-order batter for New Zealand, started the BBL season with scores of 6, 4, 0 and 0. But a rollicking 50 off 23 balls against Adelaide Strikers on New Year's Eve and 68 off 31 in Friday night's four-wicket loss to Sydney Thunder have Allen back in the groove.Allen's fireworks against Thunder set the 46,471 Optus Stadium crowd alight, with one fan even holding up a sign saying \"sorry I doubted you\". The 25-year-old could see the funny side.Bancroft out of BBL, Sams under concussion protocols after horrific on-field collisionRutherford blitzes Thunder to last-ball win over ScorchersStars shine in Melbourne derby after Cartwright heroics\"I scored 10 runs in four games. I probably should have been doubted,\" Allen said. \"It's nice, a few less people hate me [now]. T20 is pretty fickle. You've got to laugh, otherwise you'll cry.\"It is what it is, you know. People are going to get upset when you don't do well, and they're going to love you when you do well.\"Allen said the backing from the team's coaching staff, including head coach Adam Voges, was crucial for him rediscovering his mojo.\"V was just saying he backs me in to just keep playing my natural game,\" Allen said. \"I think for me, it was just being brave.  It's always easy to go into your shell after four failures, but that's not what's going to bring out the best of me and the best of my game.\"It's almost harder, but I had to be brave, and I guess go out there and play the way I play.\"Allen looms as a key cog for the Scorchers (3-3) as they attempt to snare a finals berth. They will be back in action on Tuesday night when they host Melbourne Renegades.Spinner Ashton Agar (back spasms) is a chance to return for that match, but there are doubts over allrounder Aaron Hardie after he appeared to injure his side while batting on Friday night.Hardie winced in pain and grabbed his side/rib region after attempting a reverse sweep, and he didn't make it out on the field for the Thunder's innings.He missed the start of the season with a quad injury, and he has been scratchy upon his return with scores of 24, 2 and 10.Scorchers will have to wait to see whether Mitchell Marsh, who was axed from the Test team, and Jhye Richardson will be given clearance by Cricket Australia to play against Renegades.",
