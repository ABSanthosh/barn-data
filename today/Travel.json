    "description": "Last week, Hurricane Helene carved a devastating path through 500 miles of the southeastern United States. Unlike the average hurricane or tropical storm, Helene’s worst damage was in inland mountain communities in Appalachia, where it washed away roads, bridges, and, in at least one case, an entire town. As Hurricane Milton prepares to make landfall in central Florida it brings with it what may be the worst storm surge in a century to areas that are still cleaning up debris from the last storm. In the face of this apocalyptic-seeming destruction, stories have emerged of people coming together to support each other, rebuild what was lost, and understand the forces driving these immense, deadly phenomena. Community Responses Amid the heartbreak and destruction, incredible stories have emerged of communities banding together to deliver supplies, raise funds, and rescue both humans and animals. In Asheville, where fallen trees and debris have rendered areas inaccessible by car, mules are transporting much-needed canned food and medicine. In Tampa Bay, rescuers are saving manatees left stranded by receding floodwaters. And in Charlotte, ham radio operators have stepped in to provide emergency broadcasts and welfare checks amid cellular and internet outages. From saving a twice-displaced turtle to hikers rallying support for damaged trails, here are a few of our favorite stories highlighting the helpers. —Sam O'Brien, Gastro Obscura Senior Editor Hurricane Helene Battered North Carolina's Mountain Trails.

On Monday, the hurricane became one of the most powerful ever documented. While its wind speeds decreased briefly on Tuesday, it regained Category 5 strength as it approached Florida’s Gulf Coast, including areas still reeling from Helene. Milton continues to be “an extremely dangerous storm,” according to the National Hurricane Center, but it’s not an act of God—or a big shock to climate scientists. As detailed in Vox, Milton exploded in size and ferocity thanks to extremely warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the Atlantic, other media outlets, and most climate scientists, climate change is the main cause of the Gulf heating up and fueling increasingly intense—and more frequent—hurricanes. Veteran Florida meteorologist John Morales was visibly emotional on a live TV segment discussing Milton’s strength and path, later explaining to Mother Jones that he was experiencing a mixture of anxiety and worry for those in harm’s way and frustration over lack of action on the climate crisis. Milton’s track is particularly worrisome. The greater Tampa area’s geography and recent development boom make it especially susceptible to catastrophic damage from storm surge, as explained in Slate. As millions of Americans face the daunting task of surviving the storms and their aftermath, there is another tempest churning online: a dangerous explosion of conspiracy theories that are, in many cases, disrupting relief efforts and putting lives at risk. With the U.S. presidential election less than a month away, politicians, pundits, and even pranksters are pushing false narratives about the storms and the government’s response, as detailed in Grist. The Federal Emergency Response Agency has been so overwhelmed by the disinformation, according to NPR, that it has set up a response page aimed at debunking many of the baseless claims. That response page requires time and resources that could have gone toward actual disaster relief work at a time when FEMA is critically understaffed and underfunded. As Mother Jones reported on Monday, the agency needs some relief of its own—but it appears unlikely that Congress will meet to consider approving much-needed funding until after the November 5 election. Atlas Obscura is proud to be a part of the Climate Desk collaboration, along with Mother Jones, Grist, and many of the other outlets mentioned above. We encourage you to stay up to date on their coverage as this fluid situation continues to evolve. —Gemma Tarlach, Senior Editor and Writer How to Think About Tourism In the wake of Hurricane Helene, and with Hurricane Milton bearing down, many travelers are likely reconsidering their plans to visit the Southeast in the near future. After all, planning a vacation to a region affected by political upheaval or natural disaster can seem both unwise and insensitive. However, as Jen Murphy writes in this article from Outside, places that rely on the tourism industry are often hit with a one-two punch: first, a disaster strikes, and then visitors stop coming, “often when local communities need tourism dollars most.” Murphy urges travelers to thoughtfully consider how their presence—and their tourism dollars—might impact both affected and unaffected areas, and to reach out to locals for their insights on visiting. —Anne Ewbank, Gastro Obscura Associate Editor",

    "title": "The Return of 'The Squadron Bottle,' a San Francisco Tradition",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/fleet-week-san-francisco-tradition",
    "description": "The InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco has perched at the top of Nob Hill for nearly a century. When it opened in 1926, it was more simply called the Hotel Mark Hopkins, named after the railroad executive that once built a home there. The luxury hotel has hosted presidents, premiers, and all kinds of celebrities. But one famous group of visitors didn’t visit the hotel to stay in a suite. Throughout World War II, military personnel flocked there to take the elevator to the Top o’ the Mark, a bar on its 19th floor. The Top o’ the Mark (or the Top of the Mark, as it’s usually written these days) was converted from a penthouse into what famous San Francisco journalist Herb Caen called “a glass-enclosed saloon” in 1939. People didn’t always head there for the drinks, he added. “The famed cocktail bar floats approximately fifty stories above sea level, and the view is so staggering (fifty miles in every direction) that alcoholic beverages seem superfluous.” To the military personnel visiting during World War II, though, alcohol was not superfluous. The bar, with its lofty view of the ocean, became a symbolic place to drink before shipping out to the Pacific Theater. Life magazine published a story on the phenomenon in July 1944, noting how the bar’s clientele had turned over entirely. Once, it was “the exclusive night spot of San Francisco.” Instead, the journalist wrote, it was \"patronized by beribboned servicemen,” and “democratically crowded to the walls.” Crowded was an understatement. On busy nights, servicemen would wait hours in the hotel lobby to take the elevators up to the Top of the Mark. Some months would see as many as 30,000 military visitors to the hotel bar, where an unusual tradition sprang forth. “One day, it's rumored that an officer from a squadron bought a bottle of bourbon, wrote a note on it, attached it to the bottle, and left it with the bartender,” explains Connie Perez-Wong, creative director at the hotel. Any member of the squadron who came in could have a shot from the bottle. “The only caveat was that whoever had the last shot would need to buy the next bottle,” Perez-Wong says. Servicemen who passed through San Francisco often promised to meet each other again at the Top of the Mark, and many did, making it a meaningful place of reunion and remembrance for those who didn’t return from the war. But eventually, Perez-Wong says, the custom stopped. “I don't know if it was actually stopped or it just died off,” she says. But the story “passed down through the different teams at the hotel.” Then, in 2009, came the revival. According to Perez-Wong, a cadet named Lieutenant Mike Hall, who’d just graduated from Annapolis, came to the bar. “And at the time, the manager of the room knew about this tradition, and he told young Lieutenant Hall,” Perez-Wong says. “And Lieutenant Hall said, ‘By golly, we’ve got to get it restarted.’” Lieutenant Hall bought a bottle and left it behind the bar. In the following years, the collection exploded. Today, guests stepping off the elevator into the Top of the Mark will be greeted by dozens of bottles, some in display cases, some on carts, all covered in notes and surrounded by photographs, badges, patches, and pins. Some notes contain well-wishes for those in active service, while others memorialize those who never came home. “We also have logbooks for anybody that wants to leave a story or leave a dedication,” says Perez-Wong. Today, there’s about 80 bottles in the collection. Some of them will likely be gone soon, since it’s currently Fleet Week, when San Francisco welcomes Navy, Marine, and Coast Guard ships. Civilians can tour ships, listen to military bands, and watch an air show by the Blue Angels. The air show alone usually draws a million people to the city. Perez-Wong says the bar hosts an influx of guests during Fleet Week, as well. Some of them might even buy a bottle to leave behind. Anyone can leave a bottle, and you don’t need to be part of a specific squadron to have a drink, either. “If you present a military ID, you can choose whichever bottle that you want to drink from, basically,” says Perez-Wong. As for what there is to drink, “the story is that it started with a bottle of bourbon,” she says. “So the majority would be either whiskey or bourbon, but we've had purchases of vodka [and] gin. It runs the gamut now.”",

    "title": "Buckminster Fuller Dome Home in Carbondale, Illinois",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buckminster-fuller-dome-home",
    "description": "Considered one of the great inventors and architectural minds of the 20th century, R. Buckminster Fuller is best known for his popularization of the geodesic domes. Geodesic domes—which can be found everywhere from Epcot Center to Antarctica to sports stadiums to your local public park where they often used to cover picnic areas—cover more square footage on the planet than the work of any other architect. Along with building domes, \"Bucky\" Fuller also created the Dymaxion map, the Dymaxion car, the Dymaxion house, and at one time had the longest entry in the annual Who’s Who publication. He was also the published author  of over 30 books, a poet, a lecturer, a holder of dozens of patents, a designer, a philosopher, and a futurist. In 1959, Fuller moved to the small southern Illinois town of Carbondale and joined the faculty of that city’s Southern Illinois University. It would be Fuller’s only academic appointment; he would be with the university for the next 12 years. When he and his wife, Anne, moved to town, Fuller also had build the only dome he himself would ever live in and the only home he’d ever own.   Built on the corner lot of South Forest and West Cherry Streets, the home was built in just one day, April 19, 1960.  The dome could be erected so quickly since, on the morning of its build, its pre-fab, triangular plywood pieces arrived on the back of a truck. With Fuller himself on site, the futuristic, golf ball-looking abode quickly took shape.  The finished dome was a one-bedroom, two-bath home of roughly 1,100 square feet on the ground floor with an additional 400 square feet of additional living space created vita the construction of an internal platform that, when installed, would serve as the home’s second story. This upper loft, which covered about half of the Dome’s main floor space, was accessible by a rather narrow stairway. It would serve as Bucky’s home study or, in a pinch, could be used as a second bedroom.  It has been speculated that Fuller, a devoted sailor, adopted the home’s vibrant outside color scheme (two shades of blue and white) to suggest sailboats on water. Inside, the couple filled their home with an eclectic assortment of family heirlooms, exotic artifacts from some of their worldwide travels, and gifts from some of their very famous friends including a hanging wire sculpture by Ruth Asawa and various modern furniture pieces by Fuller friends Charles and Ray Eames.  The Fullers lived in the \"Bucky Dome,\" as it came to be known, for the next decade. Around 1970, Bucky transferred his office to SIUC’s sister campus in Edwardsville and, after two years there, took a new position in Philadelphia. Fuller died in 1983, only hours after his wife Anne passed away. When the Fullers left Carbondale, they sold their home to their friend Mike Mitchell, who owned it for the next 28 years. Mitchell lived in the dome himself for two years and then made it a rental property.  However, despite Mitchell’s best efforts and those of his many renters, the home slowly fell into disrepair.  In 2001, it was purchased by SIUC professor Bill Perk, who established it as a museum and a not-for-profit. For the next 20 years, Perk and his band of fellow \"Bucky-philes\" worked diligently to restore the home to it original condition and to the way it appeared—inside and out—during the years the Fullers resided there.   Along with stripping off the home’s after-the-fact shingles and repainting its exterior, on the inside, the \"Bucky Board\" has been gifted from the Fuller Estate many of the home’s original furnishings. Today, the home is on the National Register of Historic Places.   Currently, the board is working in the building of a visitor’s center, directly across from the home, so that visitors to the dome can get a full understanding of Fuller’s life, philosophy, importance and time in Carbondale.",

    "description": "Nestled in the serene Dutch countryside, Papiermolen De Schoolmeester is a living testament to centuries of papermaking tradition. This historic mill stands as the only remaining example of traditional paper production powered by wind in the Netherlands.  Paper mills in the Zaanstreek first appeared at the beginning of the 17th century, producing what once was the best quality paper to be found. These paper mills mainly produced paper used for industrial purposes, such as gray or blue paper. De Schoolmeester produced Zaansch Bord, a type of firm paper typically used by book binders and artists as it could be made in various colors and sizes. In 2002, De Schoolmeester underwent a restoration of the foundation and wooden structures inside the mill.",

    "title": "Modern Martyrs in London, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/modern-martyrs",
    "description": "Many of the largest medieval churches across Europe feature façades decorated with statues and other representations of individuals from Christianity, including saints and other biblical figures, but these individuals typically lived centuries ago. Even though their stories are still important to modern Christianity, the lives and experiences of these individuals are set in times beyond living memory. This makes the Modern Martyrs display above the western entrance to Westminster Abbey unique among churches across Europe.  Westminster Abbey itself was largely constructed in the thirteenth century, although many modifications have been made over the centuries.  The façade over the western entrance was completed in the fifteenth century with a set of ten niches for statues.  However, the niches were never actually filled. During restoration works in 1995, the church initiated a plan to fill the niches with a set of statues representing Christian individuals from the twentieth century.  A committee selected ten individuals of various nationalities from various Christian denominations.  All of these people would be martyrs who gave their lives for the sake of others or for the sake of Christianity.  The creation of the statues was guided by the sculptor Tim Crawley, and the statues were unveiled to the public in 1998 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.  These statues were named the Modern Martyrs. Some of the depicted people are quite famous, while others may be much more obscure. The most famous individual is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who led the civil rights movement in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. The next most famous individual may be St. Oscar Romero, an advocate for the poor who was assassinated at the start of the Salvadorean Civil War. The other saint represented among the statues is St. Maximilian Kolbe, who died in the Auschwitz Concentration Camp during World War II.    Most of the other individuals represented among the Modern Martyrs were caught up in some of the most notable events of the 20th century and died because of their Christian faith. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a Polish priest who was also executed by Nazis during World War II, while Lucien Tapedi was a missionary in Papua New Guinea who was killed by the Japanese Army during the same war. Grand Duchess Elizabeth was a Russian nun executed during the Russian Revolution, Chinese pastor Wang Zhiming was killed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and Ugandan archbishop Janani Luwum was murdered for opposing the brutal dictatorship of Idi Amin.  The remaining two individuals among the Modern Martyrs were not people associated in any larger conflict or event but were simply people of great faith who were killed for their Christian beliefs. Esther John evangelized across Pakistan during the 1950s but was found murdered in her bed in 1960. Manche Masemola was just a teenage South African girl with a deep faith in Christianity who was murdered by her parents because of her beliefs; the place where she was buried has since become a major pilgrimage site. Collected together, these ten individuals show that the persecution of Christians is not a thing of the distant past but something that has persisted in modern times. The Modern Martyrs also makes deep comments about how these individuals’ faith and desire to improve the world will still be remembered after the most violent events of the 20th century.",

    "title": "Largest Paving Stone in Belgium in Brussels, Belgium",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/largest-paving-stone-in-belgium",
    "description": "A pedestrian crossing leads from the Rue de la Loi into the Parc de Bruxelles, just in front of the Palais de la Nation (which houses the Belgian Parliament). Pedestrians crossing the street towards the park don't know that they're about to step on the largest cobblestone in Belgium when they reach the sidewalk on the other side. In fact, the limestone slab in front of the gate to the park is eight meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 20 centimeters high. Its weight is 10.6 tons. This slab was presented in 1847 at the Exposition des Produits de l'Industrie nationale (National Industrial Products Exhibition) by Pierre-Joseph Wincqz, the manager of the largest quarry in Soignies, a town 35 kilometers southwest of Brussels that is famous for its limestone. It was installed in the pavement in 1852. The laying of the paving stone in this district is the result of a history that began more than 70 years ago. As early as the end of the 1770s, Brussels was one of the first European cities to lay a pavement of some kind on the Place Royal. However, the purpose of the cobbles was not to separate pedestrians from horse-drawn vehicles—which were almost nonexistent—but to highlight the façades of the houses and protect them from dirt on bad weather days. Especially in the 1820s and 1830s, new pavements appeared sporadically. The lack of a precise set of rules led to a visually cacophonous result. The 1830s and 1840s also saw an increase in the number of horse-drawn carriages, mainly due to the spread of public transport. Walking also became an activity for the bourgeoisie. These two factors necessitated the creation of wide, pleasant pavements (note that pedestrians were still given priority and it was still normal to walk on the road: walking on public roads was not banned until 1936) Finally, the Conseil de Salubrité Publique (Public Health Council)—established in 1836—asked the city to adopt pavement as the norm for the sake of public health. After 10 years of debate, the Organic Regulations of 1846 finally provided a clear and precise framework for the development of pavements throughout the city. (\"Organic\" because it aimed to ensure the coherence of all the elements of the urban space, from the buildings to the street furniture: the street became a total work of art.) Simultaneously, the young Belgian state tried to give itself an image worthy of a real country. The new capital city was the focus of many urban development projects. In the Royal Quarter, which had already been largely built up in the 18th century, the emphasis was on the development of public spaces. This was to underline the importance of this place, which was the seat of the legislative and royal powers. It was in this context that the area around the Parc de Bruxelles was redeveloped between 1847 and 1852. The large slab on the rue de la Loi is evidence of this first development in accordance with the 1846 organic regulations. It would later serve as an example for the rest of the city, which was expanding rapidly at the time. Although the surface of the flagstone had become completely smooth and thus slipping, no explanation was given as to why it was not replaced like the other flagstones on the sidewalk. Either way, this decision ensured the longevity of what is now regarded as the country's largest pavement.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/chime-clock-at-casa-del-arco",
    "description": "The Spanish city of Ciudad Real and the 17th-century novel Don Quixote are closely linked, as the novel is a testimony to the cultural heritage and identity of this part of central Spain. Located in La Mancha, the home of Cervantes' legendary character, the city adopts the adventures of Don Quixote as a symbol of local pride. The novel highlights the landscapes, traditions and spirit of La Mancha, linking Ciudad Real to the timeless tale of idealism and chivalry. Statues, monuments and festivals honor Don Quixote and celebrate his lasting influence. The city sees itself as the keeper of Don Quixote's legacy, preserving the whimsical pursuit of the character's dreams within its own historical and cultural fabric. The building known as Casa del Arco, in front of the town hall, was the town hall of the city from the 15th century until the end of the 18th century, when it was declared a ruin due to various damages to the structure.For this reason, in 1865 a neoclassical town hall was built, which preceded the current one, which , by the way, is not liked by many locals. The Casa del Arco was restored to house a chiming clock in which the automaton figures of Miguel de Cervantes, Sancho Panza and Don Quixote come outside at certain times of the day. It was installed in 2005 to mark the fourth anniversary of the publication of the first part of Don Quixote and the 750th anniversary of the founding of Ciudad Real.",

    "description": "It’s considered a miracle, an engineering marvel, and even a scientific anomaly, depending who you ask. In Santa Fe, New Mexico, the helix-shaped spiral staircase at Loretto Chapel has long puzzled visitors, including architects and physicists. There are several unknowns surrounding the staircase and its late-19th-century origins. First off: how was the 20-foot structure, which includes two 360-degree turns, built without the use of nails or other support? And how has it never wavered, despite so much use, after all these years? Also unknown is the type of wood used to build the staircase, and who built it in the first place. Neither the carpenter nor their materials have ever been identified. Over the years, multiple historians—and, more recently, internet sleuths—have scoured historical records and other sources in various attempts to solve the mystery, with little agreement between them. There are numerous conflicting theories, and the staircase’s construction has been scrutinized in several books and even an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. Today, roughly 250,000 visitors marvel at the chapel and its mystifyingly unsupported spirals each year. For some, the ongoing mystery is an answer in itself. According to chapel curator Richard Lindsley, these absences of information can only lead to one explanation: a divine miracle. “People from all different fields—from faith, from science—have gravitated to it, but no one has given me truly convincing evidence,” says Lindsley, who’s been employed by the chapel for over 30 years. “And that’s why I choose to believe that prayers to St. Joseph were deeply involved.” Once upon a time in New Mexico In 1872, the Sisters of Loretto, a Catholic religious order that originated in Kentucky, commissioned a chapel to be built for their girls’ school in Santa Fe. The blueprint came from prominent French architect Antoine Mouly’s son, Projectus. The chapel would serve as a side project while he worked on the nearby Saint Francis Cathedral with his father. After five years of construction, the Loretto Chapel was consecrated in 1878 as an impressive Gothic Revival building based on the famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. With spirals and buttresses constructed from locally quarried sandstone, plus stained glass windows imported from France via the Santa Fe Trail, the chapel was considered a masterpiece—that is, until everyone realized that Projectus Mouly’s plans did not include access to the chapel's choir loft. Unfortunately, by that time, Mouly had met his untimely death in a shooting; his father had returned to France. The nuns called in a team of carpenters, who after a period of deliberation decided that this problem could never be solved. A staircase would not only detract from the chapel’s grand design, they said; it would also be impossible to build in such a small space. The only feasible way to reach the loft would be by ladder, which the nuns refused as being too inappropriate and hazardous to climb in their habits. Without alternatives, the sisters turned to what they knew best: prayer. During a novena (nine days’ of consecutive prayer to a specific saint or intention), they asked St. Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters, for an answer. Allegedly, on the ninth day, a mysterious, shabby-looking man arrived with a donkey and a toolbox, offering his services. Over the next few months, he made the staircase for the chapel, requesting only complete privacy and several tubs of hot water for the duration. When it was finished, he left suddenly without taking payment. Of course, the sisters were flummoxed to see the result: a sleek, beautiful staircase comprising 33 steps—33 being the age at which Jesus was crucified—held together with only wooden pegs, no nails. Even more incredulously? The wood it was made of certainly did not come from New Mexico. After searching for the man, and never finding him, they concluded that the Loretto Chapel’s staircase must have been built by St. Joseph himself. Searching for the carpenter’s identity To this day, no one knows who built the staircase. Whoever he was, decades of experts have confirmed that he must have been a woodworking master to create a staircase comprising two tightly coiled 360-degree turns free of centering support. According to Reba Weatherford, an archivist at the Loretto Heritage Center in Kentucky, dozens of people have written to the order over the years claiming that a relative of theirs had been the unknown man. One writes: “My grandfather J.H. Rogers disappeared from Omaha, Nebraska in 1881 … When he arrived in Santa Fe, he heard about the need for the stairway and he decided to build the stairway as an atonement for his sins of drinking. That could be the reason for not staying around after it was built to receive any money.” This letter is just one story of many. “In the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of these,” Weatherford says. The most popular theory about the carpenter’s identity has come from Santa Fe historian Mary J. Straw Cook in her 1984 book Loretto: The Sisters and Their Santa Fe Chapel. She posits that the builder was François-Jean “Frenchy” Rochas, citing a 1895 newspaper article about the murder of the reclusive rancher. The article described Rochas as “an expert worker in wood”, and claimed he was the man behind the Loretto Chapel staircase. Cook backed up her claim with an 1881 logbook memo for an $150 check “[p]aid for wood — Mr. Rochas for N. School.” Many familiar with the staircase mystery aren’t satisfied with this theory, however, as the payment was three years after the staircase’s supposed completion and, at that time, the sisters had indeed also commissioned the building of a nearby school. Loretto archivist Weatherford adds, “The [newspaper] clipping has been referenced a lot, that’s for sure. But it does not exist in our records, I don’t know where it exists.” Unfortunately, many such historical records pertaining to the staircase have been hard to find. Some were lost over the years, in the moving of archival records between convents, or burned in several fires that destroyed the schools and convent buildings throughout New Mexico missions in the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries. A structure defying physics, even today The staircase’s design was ingenious for its era, even more so considering how it was made to stay up using only basic hand tools and no electricity. Over the years, the staircase also endured regular use (a 1959 archival photo shows a 20-strong womens’ choir assembled on its steps), though these days, its access is firmly closed to the public. Lindsley, the curator, says he’s spoken to architects who can’t explain the staircase’s durability. “Every carpenter I’ve ever met has been amazed,” Lindsley says. He recalls many stories of scientists and tradespeople visiting the chapel, like the staircase builder from Arizona who once spent eight hours intensely inspecting the staircase. “I was impressed by his wife, who was there and waiting for him [the whole time],” he laughs. A puzzling detail exists, though. Despite being such a master craftsman, the staircase’s builder did leave out one thing: a hand railing to keep the steps from shaking when stepped on. (The twisted stairs, like a giant spring, were known to have a serious bounce.) After a decade, a railing was added, when supposedly the nuns grew tired of crawling down on their hands and knees to prevent tripping. Indeed, it’s strange that a narrow spiral staircase, intended for nuns in traditional robes, wouldn’t come with hand support in the first place. The wood’s unknown origins Experts have determined that the staircase is made of spruce wood, but it’s unclear where the wood came from. It certainly did not come from local lumber yards. Recently, the wood’s inconclusive origins have become what many consider to be an absolute indication that Loretto Chapel’s staircase was a divine act. In 1996, Forrest N. Easley, a retired forester and wood technologist for the U.S. Forest Service, also formerly of the U.S Navy Research and Development Laboratory, studied the staircase over 15 months. He concluded in a study that no spruce existed in the world exactly like it, even suggesting that the wood was so unique that it should be named “Loretto Spruce”. The staircase’s legacy The Loretto Chapel was actively used every day by the students and nuns of the Loretto Academy girls’ school until it closed in 1968. Today, it functions as a privately owned museum, visited by everyone from Catholic pilgrims to school groups; it’s also a popular wedding venue. The Loretto Heritage Center archives highlight the staircase mystery’s impact over the years. This impact can be seen in a film made about the staircase, as well as songs, a comic book, and a children’s book, which archivist Reba Weatherford has blogged about. Each year, she says, the center receives a handful of information requests from curious documentarians and filmmakers. She says the sisters are too busy focusing on the Loretto community’s mission to \"work for justice and act for peace” to pay much attention to the staircase’s fame. Instead they simply enjoy the miracle and mystery. “It’s interesting to have this instance of religious history colliding with pop culture,” she explains. “Especially from an archival perspective, it’s fun since the bulk of what we get are genealogy requests.” Even after 30 years as curator, Richard Lindsley continues to welcome anyone to try to change his mind that the Loretto Chapel’s staircase is anything but a miracle. “I’m always asked my opinion and I have to believe [it’s a miracle],” he says. “And I’ll find out the details on the other side.",

    "title": "Inside the Weird World of Corn Mazes",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/corn-maze-design-and-history",
    "description": "It was a sunny autumn day in Danvers, Massachusetts on Oct. 10, 2011—perfect for some fall fun. Taking advantage of the good weather, a family of four ventured into a headless horseman-themed corn maze at Connors Farm. Things quickly unraveled. As the sun set and the maze closed for the evening, members of the family, which included a five-year-old child and three-week-old baby, realized getting lost wasn’t as amusing as they thought. Eventually, they called the police department, desperate for a way out. \"We thought this would be fun,” the woman said on the phone with the police, according to a NBC News story about the misadventure. “Instead, it's a nightmare. I don't know what made us do this.” Though stressed, the family was never in any real danger. The maze staff were still on site, waiting for them to finish, and would have gone in to find them if needed. And the family simply could have walked through the corn “walls” to the field edge at any time. But panicked parents and kids aren’t that unusual. Anxious corn maze calls to 911 happen more often than you might think. At Cool Patch Pumpkins in Dixon, California, emergency calls from deep inside their massive, 60-acre corn maze, one of the world’s largest, are an annual occurrence. Mazes are supposed to be fun—even the getting lost part, says Brett Herbst, who has been designing mazes in Utah and across the country since 1996. Herbst says there’s an art to making a maze: It must be engaging but not so tricky that people quit. “If you make it too challenging, you lose some people,” he says. While some visitors call the cops when they can’t find their way out, the bigger risk is people getting frustrated and cheating, he adds. People have been experiencing the twists and turns of mazes for millennia, as architectural defenses intended to slow and confuse the enemy, for walking meditations, and yes, as entertainment. Hedge mazes, with dense greenery that towered over players, became popular with European aristocrats in the 17th century, heralding the future fun of the corn maze. The modern corn maze—in which visitors are usually tasked with finding an exit or solving a variety of challenges—is a fairly recent invention, created only in 1993. Don Frantz, a creative director who had worked on Broadway and the Super Bowl’s halftime show, thought of the idea while admiring cornfields from an airplane. He recruited British designer Adrian Fisher to carve a dinosaur named Cornelius the Cobasaurus into a three-acre Pennsylvania field. Workers pulled stalks by hand to create the design. The attraction, dubbed “The Amazing Maize Maze,” quickly garnered media attention and inspired farmers around the country to create their own versions. For example, Herbst runs a company—The Maize—that not only crafts an annual maze in Utah, but also helps hundreds of other farms do the same. While mazes have become more intricate, a lot remains the same from those early days, Herbst says. Corn is typically planted in a grid system, which makes it easy to map out designs using software such as Adobe Illustrator. Then comes the tricky part—actually cutting the maze out. Herbst remembers making his first corn maze using a weed wacker with a saw blade attachment. For the ideal maze, you want to cut the path when the corn is somewhat grown—about three feet high—but not so tall that falling stalks risk knocking down their neighbors, which creates jagged lines, says maze manager David Wissemann. He and his wife create designs for the family company and farm, Mike’s Maze, in Massachusetts. The Wissemanns’ work focuses more on intricate patterns than dead ends. Instead of hoping to get visitors lost, the team builds in games and other sidequests. Wissemann remembers his father, Mike, and landscape designer Will Sillin using a four-wheeler with a GPS unit to carve out their first design in 2000. It worked, but they knew they could do better. The following year, Sillin decided to preserve the fine details of the design by going into the maze with a hoe and weed whacker, taking weeks to clear the path by hand. Now, they bring in Rob Stillford from Missouri, who has a GPS mounted on a Bobcat skid steer that can get the job done in one day. Hiring someone six states away to haul his equipment in for a day job might seem like an expensive choice, but the profits from a corn maze can bring in far more money than the crop itself. “I joke that we get more of our ‘harvest’ in September and October than we do when we go through with the combine in November,” says Wissemann. And Corn mazes are as popular as ever, according to Herbst. In areas hit by drought, however, some farms have had to think outside the box. In 2022, At’l Do Farms outside of Lubbock, Texas, used a mix of sorghum, sunflowers, pearl and foxtail millet, cowpeas, sun hemp, and radishes to create their maze. Herbst and some other farmers have also opted to complement their corn mazes with versions made of sunflowers. The key element, he says, is that you can’t see over or through them too easily. While some 911 callers might disagree, “Getting lost is a lot more fun than what you'd initially think,” says Herbst.",

The nightly light show received the Guinness World Record as the largest permanent architectural projection-mapped display when it first took place in February 2024.  The free show is cast onto what was once the tallest building in Japan using 40 projectors that were specially developed by Panasonic for enhanced durability to withstand outdoor elements and is run using mainly solar-generated electricity. The projection is conducted nightly with each show lasting approximately 15 minutes at half-hour intervals. Each show showcases art and music created by a mix of Japanese and international artists, drawing inspiration from the country's traditions, history, and landmarks.  In April of 2024, Tokyo Night \u0026 Light unveiled the monstrous \"Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo!\" show in recognition of the iconic kaiju franchise's 70th anniversary. This is not the first time that Godzilla has left his mark on the tower however, in Godzilla vs King Ghidorah (1991) the titular kaiju do battle around the battered Tokyo Metropolitan Building.",

    "title": "Fancy Ice Is Art in Your Glass",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-fancy-ice",
    "description": "This article is adapted from the October 5, 2024, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Where I live in California, it’s been an unseasonably warm fall. While cafés and grocery stores are going full-speed ahead with all things autumn, no one I know is running to get a pumpkin spice latte yet, considering the 100-degree plus temperatures. Instead, we’re all still craving anything cold and iced. The other day, I saw my first at-home pebble ice machine, and I was filled with a brief longing to buy one for myself so that I could enjoy textured, crunchy ice whenever I wanted. Alas, all of my ice comes from plastic trays in the freezer. But I’m fascinated by the growing number of people who treat ice as an art. Instead of cloudy, rectangular cubes, some bartenders hand-carve sparkling frozen forms out of perfectly clear ice. Others use special molds, edible flowers, juices, and fruit to create ice that adds flavor and texture to a drink, as well as cooling it down. Focusing so much effort on ephemeral ice might seem impractical. Yet people often fixate on the perfect liquors, the perfect glassware, and the perfect drink-making technique. Ice is an essential part of many beverages, so this week, we’re finding out more about this fascinating frozen art. Cool History Before refrigeration, ice was a flex. Around the world, there are records of the wealthy and powerful sending their servants up high mountains to bring back snow for drinks and desserts. Even those without convenient snowy mountains nearby could enjoy cold treats on hot days by constructing insulated buildings and stocking them with winter ice cut from bodies of water nearby. But this depended on having a cold enough climate during the winter. In the 19th century, fast ships and railroads could carry ice around the world. The United States began shipping ice from its lakes to far-flung locales like the Caribbean and England. But Americans kept plenty of that ice for themselves, adding it to trendy new mixed drinks called cocktails. In the 20th century, home freezers made ice more accessible than ever before. But, until recently, people have stuck to cloudy white cubes to cool down their drinks. Ice Gets Hot Over the past few years, I’ve seen “ice restock” videos appear across my social media feeds. These consist of influencers showing off floppy silicone ice molds filled with colorful frozen liquids and fruits, and the process of popping out aesthetically-pleasing ice into freezer drawers. Comments range from admiring to skeptical, but there’s no denying that the sounds of ice cubes (there’s often an #asmr tag) and the colors of the ice are appealing. Creations like pink, cherry blossom–shaped ice and ice frozen into rose shapes and sprinkled with dried petals almost seem too pretty to submerge in a drink. Of similar interest are videos of bartenders, especially from Japan, painstakingly carving clear ice into spheres or diamonds. But why would a bartender want to take time out from a shift to hand-carve a piece of ice? There’s numerous explanations: certain shapes, such as spheres, melt slower and dilute a drink less, and a good number of small Japanese bars buy their ice in huge chunks that need to be broken down anyway. The Quest for Clear Ice These factoids come from Camper English, the author of The Ice Book: Cool Cubes, Clear Spheres, and Other Chill Cocktail Crafts. Over the last 15 years, English has made a name for himself as the internet’s ice guru, a reputation established by a long-ago quest to create clear ice at home. It all started with a bit of mythbusting, he explains. He attended a cocktail conference where a panel touched on the subject of making clear ice. “So I decided to test the theories that people were suggesting, methodically, at home,” he says. For example, many people think that freezing boiling water will result in clear ice. English tried it. It didn’t work. “It's more of an urban legend than anything else,” he says. So he set out to develop a standardized process. In his book, English describes freezing different kinds of water in different containers, but all his ice ended up cloudy-white in the center. It took a lot of ice and observation before he noticed that the outer edges of his ice cubes stayed clear. On December 28, 2009, he posted this finding: freezing water in an insulated container without a top would result in a piece of clear ice with a cloudy layer at the bottom that could be chipped off. This, he explains to me over the phone, is known as directional freezing. The last part of water to freeze will end up cloudy from trapped air and impurities. Usually, that’s the very center of an ice cube, but using an insulated container without a lid “only freezes from one direction, which is the top down towards the bottom,” he says. You can also get see-through ice from not allowing a cube to freeze solid, keeping the center liquid. Both home and professional bartenders absorbed English’s findings, and there’s now an industry creating tools to make ever-more fanciful clear ice at home. “I'm glad that it's still going all these years later,” says English. He hasn’t gotten tired of ice, either. “I have fun with my reputation as an ice weirdo,” he says. “I rarely keep food in my freezer if I can avoid it because I've always got a few ice projects happening in there.” “You don't think of people who knit a lot as being obsessive or weirdos. My hobby is making ice cubes that are really good,” English laughs. “So save your judgment, people.” English has noticed an uptick in the number of people doing ice projects the last few years. “Initially, the process that I shared was known among bartenders, but it really took off only during the pandemic when a lot more people were trying to make good-looking drinks at home,” he says. In his book, English demonstrates not only how to make clear ice, but also how to suspend flowers and fruit inside cubes, make frozen punch bowls, and how to create frozen spheres to hold cocktails. Ice, he says, can do much more than simply cool down a drink, and even a single cube of clear or colorful ice can make a cocktail feel special. “I often use the analogy of drinking fine champagne out of a Styrofoam cup while sitting in a ditch, as opposed to drinking the same champagne from a crystal flute in a fine-dining cocktail bar,” English says. “It's the same champagne, but the experience is elevated with a better visual environment.”",

Cheap, infinitely customizable and, perhaps most importantly for southern Thais, spicy, it’s one of the most beloved dishes in the south. More a style of eating than a dish, khanom jiin is the name of the noodles in Thai, but it also refers to a spread of curries and a DIY selection of toppings.

(Yes, they’re all spicy.)  Decision made, you then escort your dish to your table, where there’s a vast spread of toppings: a heaping platter of herbs and vegetables to pluck from, crispy dried fish, slices of pineapple, hard-boiled eggs, vegetables simmered in coconut milk, pickled mustard greens and more.

    "title": "Oval Gasholder in London, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oval-gasholder",
    "description": "Some of the older sports stadiums around the world feature either unusual in-built features or eccentric neighborhoods that have developed around them over a century or more. In London, one of the oldest sporting locations is the Oval Cricket Ground, often called the Oval and currently branded as the Kia Oval.  Looming behind the stands on the north side of the cricket ground is a seemingly out-of-place gasholder (or gasometer) commonly called the Oval Gasholder. The history of the cricket ground and the gasholder are surprisingly intertwined. The cricket ground was established in 1845 and was initially the home of the Surrey Cricket Club. In that same year, the Phoenix Gas Light \u0026 Coke Company bought the waterworks on the site to the north of the cricket ground and converted their site into a gasworks. A total of five gasholders were built on the site between 1847 and 1874. The gasholder nearest the cricket ground, which would officially be designated Gasholder Number 1, was erected in 1853. At a height of 135 feet, the Oval Gasholder was the tallest gasholder in the world when it was constructed. The Oval Gasholder, while notably large among the United Kingdom’s Victorian-era gasholders, looks and previously operated in a very similar way to other gasholders across the United Kingdom. It has a steel frame surrounding a collapsible cylindrical structure that holds the gas. When the gasholder is filled, the cylinder expands, but as the gas is distributed by the utility to its customers, the cylinder collapses. Initially these structures held gas created by burning coal but later transitioned to natural gas. Over the decades, the steel frame of the Victorian-era gasholder has towered over the cricket ground’s north stands, providing an unusual industrial backdrop to the sporting events at the site. At first, the venue was used for multiple sports aside from cricket, including football (soccer) and rugby, but it eventually came to be used mainly for cricket. Most famously, starting in 1880, the Oval started hosting international matches between the Australian and England cricket teams. These matches would soon be named “the Ashes,” one of the most famous rivalries in cricket. Going forward from the 1880s, the Oval would serve as the home stadium for England’s cricket team. Meanwhile, the Oval Gasholder continued to be used for gas storage, often decorated with banners that were visible from both the stadium and on television broadcasts. However, with improvements in gas storage in the late 20th century, gasholders like this were no longer needed. All of the gasholders at the site north of the cricket ground were decommissioned in 2014, and almost everything at the site was slated for demolition. The Oval Gasholder, on the other hand, was given Grade II listed status by English Heritage, which means that the structure will be preserved. The former gas works will be redeveloped into housing, which is direly needed in London. This includes the construction of new apartment building inside the frame of the Oval Gasholder, and this has generated significant controversy, although similar apartment buildings have been built inside the frames of other historic gasholders.  Nonetheless, the Oval Gasholder will continue to loom in the background of international cricket games for the foreseeable future.",

    "description": "The eastern Oregon high desert, with its clear air and low population density, has night skies as dark as anywhere in the conterminous 48 states. It's hardly surprising, then, that the University of Oregon has located a research observatory there, on 6,349-foot (1,935-meter) Pine Mountain, just southeast of Bend. The investigations that led to the establishment of the observatory date from the late 1950s, when astrophysicist E.G. “Eb” Ebbighausen was looking for a dark site for his work on binary stars. He found that sites by the Cascade Range, although closer to the campus in western Oregon, were too often cloudy. Consulting with the Forest Service and local astronomy buffs led him to Pine Mountain. Besides Ebbighausen's research on binary stars, other research includes studies of dim galaxies in the 2000s. The 24-inch Boller \u0026 Chivens telescope (mentioned below) also made the first observations, in 1970, of magnestars, white dwarf stars with extraordinarily strong magnetic fields. The current facilities include a 15-inch Fecker Cassegrain telescope, which dates back to 1950. In 1961, Ebbighausen used it in his scouting for a dark-sky site, and it was installed at Pine Mountain Observatory in 1968. It was restored and reinstalled in 2015 and is now used for public outreach and student projects. The Boller \u0026 Chivens 24-inch telescope was the first constructed at the observatory, in 1967. Currently it is also used for outreach and student projects. (Alas, a 32-inch telescope has been out of commission since 2000 due to a catastrophic mechanical failure in its drive.) At present, the focus of the observatory is on undergraduate research and public outreach, with public events on most summer weekends. As Ebbighausen was also the author of a standard astronomy text that was revised into the 1970s, undergraduate research fits well with his legacy. In establishing the observatory, Ebbighausen also focused on grassroots public support, so outreach is also part of his legacy.",

    "title": "Archaeologists Explore Life After Dark in the Ancient Night",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/life-after-dark-ancient-night",
    "description": "This story was originally published on SAPIENS and appears here with permission under a CC BY-ND 4.0 license. As recently as a few decades ago in the Western world, stars dazzled humans with their brightness and the Milky Way could be seen spanning the far reaches of the heavens as night deepened into an unspeakable darkness. In the 21st century, such a scene is becoming a rarity across many parts of the globe as we light up the night like never before. Today our experience of the night differs significantly from that of our ancestors. Before they mastered fire, early humans lived roughly half their lives in the dark. The only night light they had came from the moon when skies were clear. Then, when humans began to gain some control over fire use (probably around 400,000 years ago), everything changed. From that point on, most people have had access to some form of “artificial” light, at least occasionally. Thus began our persistent efforts to light up the night. Even people who lived relatively recently—those with candles, oil lamps, and early electricity—were far more familiar with darkness than we are today. Their nocturnal world simply wasn’t as bright as ours. But what have we gained by illuminating the night? Has anything been lost in our efforts to banish darkness? Were people, and the world, better off when it was darker? The night has always fascinated people, for it brings with it a simultaneously feared and revered part of our existence. Yet the scientific journey into understanding ancient nights has been long in coming: Only recently have archaeologists begun to research what life was like after dark in the ancient world. Were people better off when it was darker? A few years ago, when we began thinking about the night lives of our ancestors, we found little academic work on the subject. The more we thought about the nocturnal, whether it was during the Paleolithic (which coauthor April Nowell studies), or during Classic Maya times (which coauthor Nancy Gonlin researches), the more we realized that very little research had been explicitly conducted on it. That is when we embarked on the process, with the assistance of many of our fellow archaeologists, of putting together the book Archaeology of the Night (2018), which we coedited. Ancient nocturnal habits were numerous and were like the many kinds of nightly activities in which we modern humans engage: sleeping, sex, stargazing, work, ceremonies, secret meetings, and so on. Take the ancient Romans, for example. If you think that a noisy nightlife is a hallmark of the modern world, think again! Ancient Rome was a busy and often loud place. Wheeled vehicles provisioned the city’s taverns and took away its waste, and people partied until dawn during festivals, prompting one poet to write, “The laughter of the crowd passing by awakens me and all Rome is at my bedside.” Rome’s citizens often took advantage of the cover of darkness to pee over their balconies or dump objects into the streets, and to engage in crimes ranging from disturbing the peace to assault. A roving band of police rounded up these criminals, and the individual in charge of this law enforcement squad—a man who had been up all night—was also the judge who sentenced them the next morning for their crimes. Ancient Rome reminds us that something as simple as sleep is not the same everywhere and in every time period. How we sleep, where, when, how much, on what, and with whom all have cultural aspects. Cross-cultural night studies challenge what we take to be universal and natural: Twenty-first-century Westerners think that sleeping for eight hours in a row is a good thing, but a Roman example shows that concepts such as normal sleep patterns are, in fact, culturally defined. A “first sleep” of a few hours and then a “second sleep” was a common pattern. In between those times, ancient Romans engaged in some other activity for a short time, such as deep contemplation, prayer, sex, or reading. In ancient Mesoamerica, the Maya built their cities in the tropics during the Classic (250–900) and Post Classic (900–1521) periods. Nighttimes were busy: hunting, guarding the fields, preparing the next day’s meals, feasting, and celebrations all took place when people weren’t sleeping. As dusk set in and vision waned, other senses became heightened. Jaguars roamed the landscape and insects buzzed about, creating a profusion of sounds unique to the night. Tropical plants bloomed in the cool nighttime air, adding scents to the nocturnal ambience. Crackling fires in torches, hearths, and ceramic vessels illuminated and warmed the cool tropical nights and warded off beings, both real and fantastical, in the dark. Night was both an ominous and sacred time. People made offerings to appease the gods who ruled the underworld, thereby ensuring the rising of the sun. The Moon Goddess rode her deer across the night sky, keeping watch over those who dared to venture into darkness. Sacred ceremonies took place in which royal persons imbibed hot, inebriating cacao drinks and danced at midnight. People across the social spectrum practiced bloodletting—drawing blood with obsidian blades, stingray spines, and thorn-lined ropes—in order to honor their ancestors. Astronomical readings of Venus determined whether war was on the horizon or if peace was prudent. Likewise, in the urban area of Copan, Honduras, for some 250 years (600–850) city dwellers shared a noisy nocturnal life in closely built housing. They slept on their stone benches, which were covered with cloth and padding for comfort. Others who lived outside of the city likely had portable sleeping mats, like those found from the incredibly well-preserved Classic farming community of Joya de Cerén, El Salvador. The Classic Maya wrote about many of these activities, and we are fortunate today to be able to understand their hieroglyphic writing, some of which gives us insight into their nightlife. In other areas of the world, people created lighting technologies that inform us about the relationships they perceived between the night, darkness, and death. Every day at dusk in ancient Egypt, the sun god Ra died in the west, casting the world into darkness. According to ancient Egyptians, the dead also traveled to the west—to Osiris, god of the underworld. Lighting played essential roles in funerary rituals during the dynasties of the New Kingdom period, which began in 1570 B.C. (nearly a thousand years after the Pyramids at Giza were built) and ended in 1069 B.C. “Wicks-on-sticks” are pictured on the famous Book of the Dead papyrus, and one of these lighting devices was discovered in King Tutankhamun’s tomb. These are just a few of the nighttime practices that have taken place around the world over the course of history. In Oman, Bronze Age (3100–1300 B.C.) farmers irrigated their crops in the cool night air to reduce evaporation, and later, in Iron Age Zimbabwe (200–1900), metalworkers fired up their forges at night to escape the blaze of the sun. Over 4,000 years ago in ancient Pakistan at the famous archaeological site of Mohenjo-daro, the removal of night soil (human excrement) was a task that was considered best suited to darkness, and in Polynesia, for centuries, ancient mariners looked to the stars to guide them on their long journeys home. The Vikings living in northern Europe during the Dark Ages used fish-oil, whale-fat, and seal-blubber lamps to light the dark interiors of their pithouses, and in 19th-century Bahamas, enslaved people achieved freedom, if only for a while, under cover of darkness. Fast-forward to today, when the glow from cityscapes drowns out the stars and creates a brilliant night sky our ancestors would not recognize. As we’ve studied the archaeology of the night, we’ve become starkly aware of how much we are losing today by over-lighting the world. Our modern nocturnal footprint is so bright that it is detected from outer space. We have “night mayors” in cities that never sleep, millions of people working night shifts, and health problems associated with the disappearing night as darkness gives way to the brightness of electrical illumination. Recent research demonstrates that circadian rhythms control 10–15 percent of our genes and that interruptions of these rhythms are linked to medical disorders such as heart disease, insomnia, and depression. Some researchers even suggest that certain cancers are likely caused by exposure to excessive nighttime lighting. There are also social implications to our overlit lifestyles: For most of our past, people would gather around campfires at night to tell stories and sing songs, much like many Westerners do today on the rare occasions when we find time to go camping. With the advent of electric light, we don’t need to congregate in one place—we are free to follow more solitary pursuits, bathed in our individual sources of light. On top of the health and social effects among humans, the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the dark environment of night, has brought to our attention the ecological damage we are causing to numerous species all over the world. There are many “poster animals” for the impacts of our harmful light pollution: Sea turtles and migrating birds stand out as those most endangered by humans’ nocturnal habits. Not to mention the fact that more lights require the burning of more fossil fuels and thus an increased contribution to climate change. The IDA provides numerous ideas about how we can regain the dark, such as using dark-sky friendly outdoor lighting and advocating for lighting ordinances in local communities. Even in the brightest countries in the world, such as Japan, it’s possible to preserve an entire area, such as the certified International Dark Sky Place in the national park of the Yaeyama Islands. Each of us can do our part to lessen the brightness of modern nights. Our archaeological inquiries into the night have taught us that while our relationships with the night have shifted, we remain part of the darkness, part of the night. It is essential to our well-being—and that of the planet—that we do what we can to turn out the lights.",

    "title": "The Wendigo and 6 Other Ancient Monsters From Indigenous Folklore",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wendigo-ancient-monsters-from-indigenous-folklore",
    "description": "They have survived in the shadows for millennia. Their names have been whispered over hearths and campfires, invoked as warnings to disobedient children, or perhaps known but never said aloud for fear of attracting their attention: the wendigo, the bunyip, the capelobo. Around the world, Indigenous communities have passed rich storytelling traditions from one generation to the next from time immemorial. Many of the stories have been lost in the upheaval and destruction of the colonial era. Selfless heroes and bold tricksters alike have been forgotten, or faded to a mere wisp of collective memory. But the monsters, ah, the monsters. Ferocious, fanged, skulking, slithering, they seem to have endured better than most. These beings still haunt—and hunt—from Australia to Brazil, Lake Victoria to Lake Winnebago. Here are some of the most memorable ancient terrors from Indigenous lore that still send chills down our spines. Beware the Wendigo, the Frostbitten Flesheater of North America’s Chilly Heartland by J.W. Ocker Few monsters from Indigenous folklore can boast of making it in Hollywood. There’s Krampus, a modern amalgamation of deeply ancient Central European traditions, and the wendigo, which first terrorized the Algonquin, Ojibwe, and other Anishinaabe peoples around the North American Great Lakes. We’ll leave it to you to decide whether the 2021 movie Antlers does justice to the wendigo’s ferocity, but we’re betting the wendigo doesn’t care. It’s too busy looking for its next victim. A potent symbol of human greed, the emaciated creature is insatiably hungry and appears in the lean and desperate season of winter. In the 19th century, some documented regional cases of cannibalism and other unspeakable acts were chalked up to individuals “going wendigo.” The Blood-Sucking Capelobo Haunts Brazil’s Dense Forests by April White The Guajajara, Yudjá, and other Indigenous communities along the rivers of Brazil differ on what the capelobo looks like. Sometimes it’s described as a human-tapir hybrid, or an anteater that walks on two legs. Sometimes it has only one leg. What everyone does agree on, however, is that this brain-slurping, blood-sucking forest creature is relentless, and almost impossible to kill. If you hear its bone-chilling scream echoing through the trees, run or hide. Just don’t look back. The Child-Eating Bunyip Still Haunts Australia’s Wetlands by Sarah Durn Sometimes feathered, sometimes scaly, sometimes covered in malodorous shaggy fur, the bunyip, which goes by many names, can be found across the continent. Its screams cause disease and its appetite for children is bottomless. This ancient terror of riverways and swamps may trace its origin story to Diprotodon, a massive, wombat-like animal that went extinct nearly 50,000 years ago. That may seem like a long time ago, but ancestors of today’s Aboriginal nations were already sharing tales over their hearths back then—and keeping watch for a black shadow moving in the water. The Child-Eating Bloodsucker of Aboriginal Australian Nightmares by April White Australia definitely has its share of ancient monsters with a particular taste for tender, young flesh but, no taller than a child and essentially toothless, the potbellied yara ma tha who might not sound intimidating. Yet stray too close to a fig tree and the creature could swallow you whole—and then spit you back out, still alive but forever changed. Misconstrued as a vampire by European colonists, the yara ma tha who is actually an example of practical Indigenous knowledge distilled into a memorable tale: Real predators often hid among the dense foliage of fig trees, so it was best to keep your distance. The Loch Ness Monster Look-Alike Lurking Beneath Lake Tahoe by Suzie Dundas It seems lake monsters are a dime a dozen—every self-respecting lake has to have one, from Lake Tele’s Mokèlé-mbèmbé in the Republic of the Congo to western New York’s Silver Lake sea serpent, which happens to live nowhere near a sea. Lake monster scholars (it’s a thing) have a theory that tales of these creatures speak to the human need to make sense of the unfamiliar and unknown—what lies beneath, in other words. Today, Tessie is a smiling, tourist-friendly ambassador for the Tahoe area, but its roots are far more unsettling. The Indigenous Washoe, or Wašiw, people of the region have long warned of water babies, malevolent spirits waiting in the depths of Lake Tahoe and other regional lakes. The Man-Eating Dingonek Lurks Beneath East Africa’s Rivers by April White Sprawling across the borders of three countries, Lake Victoria, one of the African Great Lakes, is a principal source of the Nile River. And the smaller rivers flowing into the lake are sources for stories of the fearsome dingonek, perhaps the most poignant river monster of the colonial era. The “fish-beast” was described by British and American hunters and explorers as nearly 20 feet long, with clawed feet and tough scales and a dog-like head—but definitely not a crocodile. The foreigners’ breathless tales are short on Indigenous knowledge and long on their own apparent derring-do, which typically included shooting the dingonek dead (but somehow never retrieving its body). From what we do know of the ancient local lore about the animal, despite its frightful appearance, its presence promised good fortune and health, and its absence heralded suffering. Indeed, in the wake of the foreigners’ dingonek hunts, death and disease followed. In North Dakota, the Hideous Miniwashitu Ushers in Spring by April White Winter in the North American heartland is a brutal season of killer cold, extreme storms, and limited sources of food. It’s no surprise the wendigo emerged during this bleak time of year, as terrifying as it was insatiable. But to the west of the wendigo’s hunting grounds, in what’s now North Dakota, winter birthed a different kind of monster, according to the lore of the Mandan people. The miniwashitu was no looker: Imagine a furry, ferocious, one-eyed rhinoceros with a saw along its spine. But the monster played a vital role along the Missouri River, the artery of trade for the Mandan. In late winter, the miniwashitu used its bulk and the sharp teeth on its back to bust up the river’s thick ice, a sign that winter, with all its ancient terrors, was over at last.",

    "title": "Was ‘Dracula’ the Biggest Flying Creature Ever?",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/largest-flying-creature-ever",
    "description": "“It’s just such an awesome image to think about: a giant flying dragon, essentially, coming down and preying on these dinosaurs,” says Ben Thomas, a paleontology graduate student at the University of Portsmouth, England. Earlier this year, Thomas released a video on his paleontology-themed YouTube channel about his visit to the Altmühltal Museum in Denkendorf, Germany. There, he spoke with paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim about one of the museum’s most remarkable specimens. It’s the fragmentary remains of a pterosaur—a flying reptile—that lived in Transylvania, Romania, 66 million years ago, and just might be the largest animal that has ever flown. Scientists have nicknamed it “Dracula.” The Altmühltal Museum displays a cast of Dracula’s remains, alongside a model skeleton and a life-sized statue of the creature. At an estimated 11.5 feet tall, with a wingspan of 37.4 to 39.4 feet, Dracula was comparable to a giraffe when standing, or a small airplane in flight. “Seeing it on the ground really gives you a proper sense of scale, that these were absolutely terrifying animals if you ever encountered them,” says Thomas. Members of the Azhdarchidae family of pterosaurs, to which Dracula belonged, are famous for their size, but “generally the accepted wingspan for all of the others is about 10 meters [32.8 feet] at most,” says Thomas, making Dracula a giant even among its relatives. The name Azhdarchidae was coined in 1984 for a specimen from Uzbekistan, from the Persian and Uzbek word for “dragon.” So it’s not surprising that when scientists uncovered the mega-Azhdarchid specimen in Transylvania’s Hațeg (pronounced “Hatzeg”) Basin in 2009, they dubbed it Dracula, which literally means “son of the dragon” (or the Devil) in Romanian. The giant pterosaur is also not the first prehistoric creature named or nicknamed for the famous vampire. In 1975, a dinosaur found in Transylvania was dubbed Bradycneme draculae, meaning “Dracula’s ponderous leg,” for its hefty leg bones. The extra-large vampire bat Desmodus draculae coexisted with early humans in the American tropics, where it may have inspired Indigenous mythology. And two prehistoric arthropods found trapped in Burmese amber bear the species name draculi: a wasp with toothy-looking mouthparts, and a tick that drained the blood of dinosaurs. We can safely assume that in life, Dracula the pterosaur was at least as scary as its namesake, but there’s still much about it we don’t know. “One of the big issues with the Dracula specimen,” Thomas explains, “is that it’s very, very fragmentary.” Other fossils of big Azhdarchids from the same time and place as Dracula have been excavated, such as the single confirmed species of the genus Hatzegopteryx (which means “Hațeg wing” after the area of discovery). But none of these fossils are from complete skeletons and Dracula’s remains do not overlap with those of Hatzegopteryx, making it difficult to tell for sure if Dracula represents a new species. Then there’s the question of whether such an enormous creature could actually fly. A 2018 article about Dracula in Scientific American claimed that features of Dracula’s wrist joint “could mean it was not meant for flight.” However, this remains speculation due to how fragmentary Dracula’s remains are. Signage at the Altmühltal Museum indicates to visitors that there is no conclusive evidence ruling out Dracula’s ability to fly, or that of other Azhdarchids. In 2017, Azhdarchid expert and paleoartist Mark Witton told The Guardian that he was certain Hatzegopteryx could achieve “flight speeds that would get a speeding ticket on a U.K. road.”​​ More research is needed, but Thomas agrees: “Maybe [Dracula] was too big to fly—but I don't think so.” According to a 2024 paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, many studies have found support for the idea that the largest pterosaurs could fly. “Generally it's not controversial among pterosaur researchers,” says Thomas. He points to features of Azhdarchid anatomy, “which they would be needing for flight, presumably,” such as partially hollow wing bones to reduce mass, anchor points for strong wing muscles, and other features similar to those found in flying birds today. Paleontologists studying pterosaurs often use birds or bats for comparison, but it’s become increasingly clear just how unique the flying reptiles were. Instead of walking on their back legs like birds, or hopping awkwardly like bats, it is now believed that pterosaurs folded their wings up to walk on four feet, and could be quite agile on the ground. Some paleontologists theorize that pterosaurs launched themselves into flight from all fours, pushing off with their front limbs, a method not seen in any living creature. Thomas explains how pterosaur anatomy confirms the theory of “quad-launching.” While birds have enlarged muscles in their wings for flying and in their legs for launching, “with pterosaurs, you have that all sort of contained in one area” in the chest, he says. “It's essentially a more mass-efficient way of taking off, which is presumably how they got so much bigger than birds.” The largest Azhdarchids were once thought to be similar to modern soaring birds like seagoing albatrosses or canyon-dwelling condors, both of which are ungainly and slow on the ground. Today, Azhdarchids are often compared with storks, which can fly but spend most of their time on foot, hunting small prey or scavenging. Recent speculative dinosaur documentaries like 2022’s Prehistoric Planet depict Azhdarchids like storks, as leggy opportunists who stroll around snapping up whatever they can get in their long, stabbing beaks, from baby dinosaurs to dinosaur carrion. With fellow paleontologist Darren Naish, Mark Witton coined the term “terrestrial stalkers” to describe this lifestyle. Flying costs a lot of energy, and many modern birds avoid it until absolutely necessary. A study of pterosaur flight efficiency suggests that as Dracula and its kin adapted to their “terrestrial stalker” niche and grew bigger, they became less-agile flyers, giving up mastery over the skies for the land. Dracula’s home was one of the most unique environments known to paleontologists. Transylvania’s Hațeg Basin was an island during the Late Cretaceous period some 66 million years ago, at the very end of the age of dinosaurs. There, dinosaurs evolved to be smaller than their mainland relatives due to a lack of space and resources, a phenomenon called “insular dwarfism.” As a result, Thomas explains, some researchers believe that Hațeg Island’s giant, stork-like Azhdarchids, “Hatzegopteryx in particular, would have been the top predator of this ecosystem, preying on dinosaurs…which is pretty spectacular.” Compared with other known Azhdarchids, Hatzegopteryx had an especially muscular neck supporting a large and heavy head and beak, meaning that it might have been able to handle larger prey than its relatives. Did Dracula belong to a species of dinosaur-gobbling Azhdarchid even larger than its cousin Hatzegopteryx? Or was it simply the largest-known individual of an already titanic species? While Thomas hopes that research on Dracula will be published soon, he points out that there are even more mysteries yet to be uncovered when it comes to the land-stalking dragons of Cretaceous Transylvania. Not long after Dracula was first discovered, another major Azhdarchid fossil was found in Romania from the same time period. While it consists only of one fragment of a lower jaw, “it’s apparently the biggest mandible of a pterosaur ever found,” says Thomas. Based on comparison with other pterosaurs, the jaw may have been more than three and a half feet long when the creature was alive, with features that might differentiate it from Hatzegopteryx. “And so maybe there's two species coexisting in this environment,” says Thomas. “But of course,” he adds, “there's always going to be others out there that haven't been discovered yet.”",

    "title": "Death as a Woman: The Accabadora of Sardinia",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/death-as-a-woman-accabadora-sardinia",
    "description": "In Sardinian author Michela Murgia’s 2009 novel Accabadora, a young girl named Maria is adopted by Bonaria Urrai, the respected village seamstress—and an angel of death. Little Maria wonders where Urrai disappears at night, never imagining that she hurries through narrow streets under the cloak of darkness, chanting prayers as she slips into the home of a villager lingering near death to finish the job. Murgia’s seamstress character is a modern reimagination of the folk figure of the accabadora, sometimes spelled S’accabadora, who is described in dozens of traditional Sardinian tales. The older woman, with a black lace shawl draped over her head, is said to walk with her mallet doubling as a cane to the home of the dying. No family members are present, but they have left the door open for her. She turns around holy statues so they will not see what happens next. Then she takes her mallet to the person’s temple, delivering a brutal but swift death. It fits her name, “she who finishes” in Sardinian. Written mentions of the accabadora first appear in the 17th century, where she is cast as a murderer. These folktales date to a time when Sardinia—an island 120 miles from the Italian mainland—was a socially conservative, highly patriarchal society dominated by the Catholic Church. Modern, feminist re-examinations like Murgia’s are now challenging these long-entrenched views. As in Murgia’s fictional account, scholars such as Montclair State University’s Gina Miele argue that the accabadora was no villain; rather, she was villainized by the Church. While it’s unclear whether any Sardinian women actually acted as accabadoras—Miele believes there were women who carried out these “good deaths” but evidence is scant—the folk figure was culturally important to the community. In folktales, the accabadora’s job is to release those lingering on the threshold of death. In addition to this task, the accabadora also often practices midwifery and healing, tasks also reserved for older women with deep knowledge of herbal remedies and other folk medicine. As such, the accabadora holds immense power in the stories, but this power comes at a great price: She commits euthanasia, a mortal sin that, in Catholic teaching, damns her soul. “The mystery around her I think is partially because it was done in secrecy, because it had to be done in secrecy,” Miele says. Christina Welch, a scholar of religion and death studies at the University of Winchester, believes that the accabadora’s ugly, old appearance in many folktales may be a manifestation of the Church’s condemnation of her work, as well as the patriarchal society’s devaluing of older women and traditional “women’s work.” But there’s a key element in many accabadora folktales: Her killings were seen as socially “good deaths” of individuals who, after long and full lives, were ready for death. “She only comes in after the priest has done his bit. You know, these people are fully confessed, ready to go, she just speeds them on their way,” says Welch. In most folk traditions, villains kill people who otherwise would have had long years of life ahead of them. The accabadora is more of a closer, performing a thankless task necessary to achieve resolution. This job, says Miele, is consistent with other roles traditionally reserved for women, including bringing children into the world and preparing the dead for burial. “It had to be done in secrecy.” Miele is writing a book about accabadora folklore and the women who may have performed the role in real life, perhaps as recently as the mid-20th century. Women “bring life in, we heal life,” Miele says. “We mourn and cant and chant as it is gone, and we are the ones, unfortunately, who frequently have to let life go.” Welch sees an interesting juxtaposition that may help explain why the accabadora was so villainized, despite performing a critical role: Her activity could have been seen as encroaching on traditionally masculine territory. “If you think about patriarchal society, it was men that would do the killing,” Welch says. “Men that would go out to war, men that had the power over things, and with the Church, men had the power over life and death and what happened after death. And yet here you have a woman who’s taking on aspects of that role.” Scholars and even many Sardinians disagree about whether any women really did slip through the village streets at night, mallet in hand. But the folk figure of the accabadora endures, now with renewed respect from a small but passionate group of scholars determined to cast her in a different light. “She finished a life, she doesn’t take away a life,” says Miele. “So the work of the accabadora, for me, is sacred work.”",

    "description": "If you venture down the sun-soaked boulevards of Myrtle Beach, you’ll soon stumble upon something rather unexpected: a volcano. Rising 40 feet in the air, it erupts every 20 minutes in fiery spectacle over its kingdom: Hawaiian Rumble, a Mini-Golf Course nestled among the town’s neon-lit tourist attractions. With its island vibes and international reputation, Hawaiian Rumble is anything but an ordinary putt-putt spot. Myrtle Beach, often called the “Mini-Golf Capital of the World,” is home to over 30 imaginatively themed courses. However, Hawaiian Rumble, first opened in 1997, stands out among the rest. Its tiki torches, lush landscaping, and rhythmic Hawaiian tunes transport Mini-Golfers of all ages into a vivid island experience. The course itself is meticulously designed, featuring crafty slopes and cunning hazards to confound amateurs and pros alike. Once a year, Mini-Golf’s finest gather under Hawaiian Rumble’s rumbling volcano to strut their stuff at the Mini-Golf Masters tournament. But for the other 362 days of the year, the course is simply a whimsical escape—a reminder that in Myrtle Beach, even 18 holes of Mini-Golf can feel like an adventure. After all, you never know what you’ll find hidden within the coastal charms of South Carolina. In this brand-new episode of Infrequently Asked Questions, sponsored by Visit Myrtle Beach, we sat down with Bob Detwiler, president of the US ProMiniGolf Association, to tee up some of our most driving questions. Should Mini-Golf be an Olympic sport? Has anyone ever tried to climb the volcano? (Did they succeed?) To find out these answers and see where all the magic happens, watch the video above.",

    "title": "The Video Game 'Black Myth: Wukong' Has Ancient Roots",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-story",
    "description": "This story was originally published on The Conversation. It appears here under a Creative Commons license. The recent launch of the video game “Black Myth: Wukong” has broken numerous records around the world for the number of users. The game is set in the world of the famous Chinese novel Journey to the West, where players battle gods and demons of traditional popular Chinese religion. In the first few weeks following its release in August, “Black Myth: Wukong” had reportedly sold over 18 million copies, making it one of the fastest-selling games of all time. Players take on the role of freeing Sun Wukong, the monkey protagonist from the popular 16th-century novel. The story details the journey of the Chinese monk, Xuanzang, as he makes his way to India in search of Buddhist scrolls. Sun Wukong aids the monk in this trip. Yet, the monkey proves to be the ultimate troublemaker, as Sun Wukong insults popular gods of the Chinese pantheon and insists on besting them in magical battles. Sun Wukong’s fate is sealed when the Buddha imprisons him under a mountain as punishment for all the havoc he created in Heaven. The video game picks up after the end of the story, pitting the player against those whom Sun Wukong had fought in the popular narrative. In so doing, the game continually references the complex and competitive world of traditional Chinese religion in which Buddhist, Taoist, and popular gods are always interacting with one another. As a scholar of Chinese religion, I am interested in the ways narratives of Chinese deities become popular and spread across different contexts. The popularity of “Black Myth: Wukong” is the most recent example in a centuries-old tradition of retelling this story through popular media. Journey to the West was first published in 1592, but the stories were popular long before that. As scholar of Chinese literature Anthony Yu notes, the various tales describing Xuanzong and Sun Wukong’s adventures existed for nearly 1,000 years before they were collected and published in Journey to the West. People in traditional China would hear many of these adventures through oral storytelling, but also through various media such as dramatic performances, poetic tales, and short stories. Traveling opera troupes were one of the most popular ways to tell Sun Wukong’s tale. Professional actors would perform tales of Sun Wukong’s exploits through dramatic renditions coupled with acrobatic fight scenes and dazzling displays of martial arts. These entertaining performances would disseminate information about the gods to both literate and illiterate audiences all throughout China. Stories of Sun Wukong’s mischievous, and often irreverent, behavior made their rounds throughout traditional Chinese society. The monkey hero’s brash attempts at subverting authority and picking fights with divine characters cemented his place as a popular cultural icon. As scholar of Chinese religions Meir Shahar notes, novels such as Journey to the West served as a way to define and transmit an entire pantheon of deities all across the various regions of traditional China. In so doing, these forms of media would reflect the dynamic world of Chinese religion and, at the same time, help shape the way people would come to understand the stories of their own gods. Many of the characters who appear in Journey to the West come directly out of the Chinese pantheon. Guanyin, the Buddhist deity of compassion and one of the most popular gods across East Asia, has her struggles against Sun Wukong; Taoist figures, such as the deified Lao-tzu, the purported author of the Taoist classic Tao Te Ching, battles with the monkey, and ancient Chinese deities like the Queen Mother to the West and the Jade Emperor play a prominent role as authority figures throughout the story. Sun Wukong also battles localized gods like the martial deity Erlang. Many of these figures are also referenced throughout the video game, while some, like Erlang, appear as “bosses” who need to be defeated before moving on to the next level. In the novel, the gods work together to stand in the way of Sun Wukong, representing the authority of the Chinese pantheon. At the same time, Sun Wukong often gets the better of the gods, either through trickery or martial prowess. Eventually, the authority of the gods wins out, with the monkey trapped under the mountain. Yet, this is not the end of Sun Wukong. As the recent release of the video game demonstrates, it is but one more beginning to the monkey’s story. While the game is careful not to promote any one religious identity, the cultural source for these compelling characters remains deeply rooted in the long history of Chinese religions. Today’s gamers get to encounter aspects of Chinese culture in a whole new way. Players who may be unfamiliar with Sun Wukong’s character from the novel can still see Sun Wukong flip in the air, brandish his weapons and defeat his enemies with dramatic flair. Only now the gamer gets to perform these feats through their connection with the video game’s hero. While the gaming experience may be relatively new, enjoying tales of the gods is very old.

    "title": "Tiquira",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/tiquira",
    "description": "Indigenous Brazilians have fermented alcoholic beverages from the cassava root for thousands of years. These beer-like beverages go by names like cauim, caxiri, and tarubá. Fermentation is an important step in cassava processing—the raw root has chemicals that can turn into cyanide in the human body. Native peoples found that a bit of human saliva and some naturally occurring yeast could eliminate these toxins and improve the nutritious value of the tuber. When the technology of distillation arrived to the Munim River region (now in Maranhão), locals who already drank lightly alcoholic cassava beverages began to distill them. Tiquira was born.  The name tiquira is likely derived from the Tupi word tykyre meaning \"to drip.\" But it is a curiosity that the spirit has flourished in only one Brazilian state, Maranhão. Margot Stinglwagner, founder of Guaaja Tiquira, the first modern brand to produce the spirit starting in 2016, says “It’s a spirit that is also unknown in Brazil. A few people have heard about tiquira—but usually only people who have gone to Maranhão once.” Accordingly, the state moved to declare the spirit as a piece of Cultural and Intangible Heritage in September 2023.  Part of the reason that tiquira has remained so isolated is that cachaça, Brazil’s rum, is far easier to produce. Because the rum comes from sugarcane, the sugar for fermentation is already there. “With cassava, you don’t have sugar,” Stinglwagner explains. “You must first transform the carbohydrates into sugar and then you can ferment and distill it.” To achieve this end, Guaaja Tiquira uses food enzymes instead of the traditional human saliva. Guaaja also differs from other distillers because they use full cassava roots where most tiquira moonshiners rely on processed farinha de mandioca, or cassava flour.  “The majority of people produce it illegally,” laughs Stinglwagner. “The state does nothing about it.” Outside of the urban center, tiquira is invariably a homemade product. Generally, tiquira makers don’t separate the \"heads\" (the first drops of liquor from a distillation, which contain harsher alcohols including toxic methanol and other pungent and volatile flavor compounds) from the \"tails\" (the final liquid produced from distillation, which has a low alcohol content and can have unwelcome bitter flavors), meaning the spirit is stronger and may contain more toxins and impurities. Some even macerate marijuana into the combined spirit to produce the doubly-illicit tiquiconha. Maranhenses believe that you cannot get wet or bathe after drinking tiquira, lest you become faint or dizzy. Zelinda Machado de Castro e Lima, one of the great chroniclers of folk culture in Maranhão, has recorded other traditions surrounding the drink. Firstly, it is typical to pierce a cashew with a toothpick and soak it in a glass of tiquira for several hours. It is then sucked as a sort of boozy lollipop. She also writes about the belief that those drinking coffee should avoid tiquira, while locals say that fishermen on the coast used the liquor to sanitize wounds incurred on the job.  Finally, there is the curious question of the color of tiquira. In the tourist markets of São Luís, the spirit is always blushing a translucent violet. “They say that the color of tiquira is from tangerine leaves, but we tried to do it and the color from the leaves is not stable,” says Stinglwagner. “It is also not a strong color. The norms and laws for tiquira prohibit the addition of the leaves.” The violet color may be artificial (perhaps from food dyes), but some tiquiras do have a citrusy flavor.  Tiquira today is still largely relegated to the world of moonshining, but with the government’s recognition of the spirit and new legitimate ventures like that of Guaaja Tiquira, Brazil could be seeing more of the cassava liquor outside of its home in Maranhão.  “All the people say to me, ‘What is this new spirit?,’” says Stinglwagner. “I say, ‘It’s not a new spirit, it’s the oldest spirit from Brazil.’” Know Before You Go Tiquira is widely available in the downtown markets of São Luís, Maranhão. Both the local Mercado Central and touristic Mercado das Tulhas have many vendors selling tiquira. The commercial brand, Guaaja Tiquira, is also available in São Luís at Empório Fribal, in addition to Copacabana Palace and Fairmont Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and Mocotó Bar e Restaurante in São Paulo.",

    "title": "Maultaschen",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/maultaschen",
    "description": "The origins of Germany’s Maultaschen are deliciously devious. Legend has it that, in the late Middle Ages, a lay brother named Jakob invented the stuffed pasta dumplings at the Maulbronn Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in 1147 by Cistercian monks in southwest Germany. One direct translation of Maultaschen is “mouth pockets,” though “Maul” could just as easily refer to Maulbronn. Maultaschen are usually square dumplings (though sometimes they're rolled) and can be fried in a pan or served in broth. Commonly described as Germany’s version of Italian ravioli, they allegedly emerged as a way to use up an unexpected bounty of meat that Brother Jakob stumbled upon in the forest outside the monastery walls. The twist? Although they abhorred waste, these monks weren’t allowed to eat the meat of four-legged animals, especially during the Catholic fasting period of Lent in the spring. So Brother Jakob minced the meat with herbs and onions and wrapped everything inside pasta dough, hiding the forbidden flesh from the eyes of his fellow monks—and even from the eyes of God. In Swabia, the region encompassing much of Baden-Württemberg and part of Bavaria where Maultaschen originated, one of the colloquial names for the food references this deception directly: Herrgottsbescheißerle means “little God-cheaters.” Everyone in Swabia has their version of the legend with more or less embellishment. Ludwig Nestler holds a master’s degree in heritage conservation and works for the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Württemberg, a government organization that oversees monuments like Maulbronn Monastery. His version of the tale includes a sack of stolen meat dropped in the woods by a fleeing thief, which inspires Brother Jakob’s trickery in the kitchen. But he acknowledges that there’s no undisputed “historically correct version” of how Maultaschen came to be. Similarly, everyone in Swabia has their own Maultaschen recipe, with unique ingredients for the minced filling, called Brät. “Traditionally the Brät is made from pork mixed with herbs, onions, and occasionally bread crumbs for texture and stability,” says Nestler. Swabia, however, “was a rather poor region with limited amounts of meat due to rather unfertile land, so being adaptive and innovative has always been a part of the people’s nature.” As Maultaschen became popular, fish and seasonal vegetables like spinach, carrots, beets, and mushrooms became common inclusions. Today, the European Union ties Maultaschen to Swabia with a Protected Geographical Indication, which lists required ingredients the authentic product should feature, but even the necessary inclusions are pretty loose, such as “pork and/or beef and/or veal” for meat Brät and “typical regional vegetables” for meat-free Brät. It speaks to the way the dumplings developed as subsistence food, used to stretch leftovers and reduce food waste. Today, Germans throughout the country enjoy Maultaschen in dozens of flavors in all seasons thanks to grocery stores that stock packaged varieties made by companies like Ditzingen-based Bürger, whose mascot, Erwin, is a Maultasche (the singular form of the plural Maultaschen). But the dumplings remain most popular in southern Germany. Maulbronn Monastery offers a special tour that pairs Maultaschen with wine from the monastery’s vineyards. And many locals, including Nestler’s family, still make them from scratch on special occasions—even during Lent, when meat might otherwise be off the menu. There’s no telling if it’s a fraud good enough to fool God, but it’s worth a shot.",

    "title": "Pont",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/pont-pontarlier-anis",
    "description": "In 1914, absinthe was outlawed in France. In the small mountain town of Pontarlier, the world capital of absinthe, the news devastated the livelihoods of thousands of local workers. Nearly all the town's distilleries closed their doors or relocated. But one producer, Distillerie Guy, remained open, all thanks to adaptation and innovation. Its bestselling drink, Pont (formally known as Pontarlier-Anis), was created as a result of the absinthe ban and remains a beloved classic at the distillery to this day. Pont was the invention of George and Armaund Guy, whose family distillery had been making absinthe since 1890. Following the nationwide ban, the distillers continued to use their absinthe recipe, with one key change: excluding the supposedly “madness-inducing” ingredient, thujone, and replacing it with green anise.  When poured, Pont is clear as the local mountain water it contains, turning to a cloud of white when diluted. It has a frosty freshness, not unlike the sensation of breathing after chewing on a mint, while whipping the tongue with a smooth licorice sweetness.  The licorice taste comes from the distillation of green anise, differentiating it from the star anise used in other anise spirits such as ouzo or pastis. Compared to those spirits, \"Pont is lighter, purer, more subtle,” says Sébastien Siredey, who works at Distillerie Guy. “It is distilled from natural ingredients. It is more haut-de-gamme than pastis.\" Pont also appears in a powerful local mixed drink known as the “Sapont.” The drink is a portmanteau that combines Pont with Sapin, the French word for “fir tree” that's also the name of another liquor produced by Distillerie Guy. Their Sapin is made from local fir trees that provide a sharp botanical flavor. A Sapont mingles together Sapin’s pine-green color and Pont’s snow white, with an icy coolness and wood-infused licorice warmth. As with absinthe, the strength of botanicals lends a slightly medicinal flavor to every bottle of Pont and Sapin. “We are the pharmacy of Pontarlier,” Siredey jokes. Absinthe, Pont’s troublesome predecessor, was in fact used for medicinal purposes, until it was popularized by French soldiers in the war in Algeria, who grew fond of it for more than its purported healing properties.  In 1988, France legalized the sale of absinthe (with regulated thujone levels), but did not allow producers to use the word “absinthe.” This odd stipulation was overturned in 2011 and absinthe made its formal return. But despite the notoriety of the “green fairy” Pont has remained a favorite among local connoisseurs.  When it comes to Distillery Guy, the workers prefer their signature liquor. “At apéro, it’s Pont,\" says Siredey. \"Not one of us drinks absinthe.”",

The roads are full of delivery vans, the station is lined with taxis and the pavements are busy with commuters. I move among them lightly, a roamer bound for distant lands. Well, distant-ish: I’m a coffee to the good, it’s a warm day, and I’m about 20 strides into a 13-mile hiking trail. A pigeon coo-coos from a pub roof. And so the Baker Way begins.In the UK, you’re rarely far from a good walk. According to The Ramblers, there are more than 140,000 miles of footpaths, byways and bridleways in England and Wales alone. Some of these are well-used routes through classic beauty spots, but most go nowhere near a mountain ridge, a clifftop or even a national park. This makes them no less valuable. Continue reading...",

I set out to enjoy a quieter, more laid-back alternative farther north, where the overlooked city of Šibenik is the jumping-off point to a very different side of the Adriatic.First there’s Šibenik itself, which is still relatively devoid of the crowds you see in Croatia’s other coastal cities. Here you naturally gravitate towards the magnificent Unesco-listed St James Cathedral before checking out the cafe terraces on the Riva waterfront and the bars beside the fishing boats moored further up the quayside. Medieval St Michael’s Fortress and its 17th-century Venetian neighbours, St John’s and Barone, loom over the city, the latter two built to protect against Ottoman attacks. They have all been transformed into important cultural institutions – St Michael’s into an amphitheatre for concerts, St John’s an educational centre and cafe and Barone an open-air cinema with augmented-reality displays. Views of the city became even more impressive the higher I climbed to each fortress. Continue reading...",

Alongside the plump fruit and vegetables, drifts of cheese and butter paint the whole scene a deep cream, echoing the Provençal city’s warm limestone and light yellow plaster.Vincent van Gogh was drawn to yellow, which radiates from many of his best-known and best-loved paintings. The Yellow House was his home outside the city’s ramparts when he moved from Paris to Arles in 1888, hoping (and failing) to start an artists’ colony. It was a studio only in the summer, then furnished for living in the autumn. A new park nearby that he dubbed Poet’s Garden inspired pictures that burst with colourful and abundant growth.

The restored Georgian gem is a perfect base for exploring the historic Castlefield districtFor some, a stately home does it. For others, a converted barn. For me, anything rail-related hits the spot. It’s partly respect for transport and proper jobs. It’s also because I was born and raised 1.2 miles (or a mile and 16 chains in the parlance) south of the world’s first inter-city railway line – the Liverpool and Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. Though never a full-blown spotter, I got the transport bug watching 47s and Deltics rumbling along the tracks between St Helens Junction and Newton-le-Willows. Despite the delays and dysfunction that make rail travel so irksome today, I still love trains.It is then a childish buzz as well as a grown-up, heritage-inspired delight to be spending a couple of nights in the Station Agent’s House, the Landmark Trust’s new property in Castlefield, Manchester. The area, at the southern end of main drag Deansgate, is one of the city’s oldest, though its iron bridges and merchants’ warehouses are now overshadowed by high-rise apartment blocks.

The second is the point in autumn when the summer hues shift overnight and the woods take on a whole new coat. In Japanese there is a wonderful term for both, mikkaminumanosakura, meaning a moment of sudden, dramatic change. As we move deeper into autumn, we’re heading for one of these moments, and I’ll be out in the woods trying to catch it.I have spent much of the past two years travelling the length of the UK and Ireland exploring our relationship with trees and woodlands for a new book.

It’s the city of Beyoncé and a feverish fanbase for homegrown hip-hop. It’s the city of two-time baseball World Series winners the Houston Astros. A city of 2.3 million people, with no majority race or ethnicity, Houston is uniquely representative of Texas’s strong diversity, whether you’re looking for incredible cuisine, sightseeing adventures you won’t find anywhere else, or the arts and music extravaganza that is the East End Street Fest, which celebrates all things Mexican and Chicano.Food and drinkBecky Salgado, Houston-based blogger for Becky’s Travel List, never runs out of interesting food recommendations to share with friends and visitors to her hometown. “The food scene in Houston is so diverse,” she says.

Here, he shares some of the most ‘smoking’ places to check out right now …If you’re visiting Fort Worth for the first time, there are certain things every visitor should do: a trip to the Fort Worth zoo, which is considered one of the best in the US, is a must, as is a visit to Stockyards to see one of the twice-daily cattle runs. And don’t forget to catch a rodeo at Cowtown Coliseum – a big part of the city’s age-old cowboy and cowgirl cache, which you can explore further at the nearby National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame and John Wayne: an American Experience.But you also owe it to yourself to pay a visit to Jonathan Morris at the boutique Hotel Dryce to see a different side of the city. A native son of Fort Worth who has gone on to style himself as an entrepreneur (he also owns the undeniably hip Fort Worth Barber Shop) and has moonlighted as a TV show host, Morris has his finger on the pulse of what’s good locally – “I think it’s good to have things that insiders know, but not necessarily everybody knows,” he says.

Any night of the week, you can wander downtown and find live music playing somewhere – from the set of a live television show to a pop-up concert in a convenience store, not to mention incredible cuisine and nightlife where people never take themselves too seriously. We chatted with Madeline Hollern, editor of Austin Monthly, to get her latest favourite recommendations for visitors.Food and drinkThough Austin was always a great place for food trucks and burger joints, Hollern says she’s seen more options opening up from new restaurants in the city this year. “We’re getting more diversity in terms of types of food and price points, which is very welcome,” she says. One of her favourite new restaurants is Bambino, a pizza restaurant offering hand-tossed pies with a daily changing menu in East Austin. Far East Austin is where you’ll find some of the trendiest bars and restaurants in the city. Start your evening at Sign Bar (you’ll recognise it by the melange of neon), and then when you get hungry, head next door to Lao’d Bar. A newcomer on the Austin bar scene, Lao’d Bar represents a departure from the standard bar fare. “It has some of the best food I’ve had all year – it’s incredibly tasty Lao-inspired food, and it’s getting accolades left and right,” says Hollern.

Not only can you observe the gorgeous autumn hues from the leaves of ash, birch and oak but you can see all manner of mosses, liverworts and lichens.

We used this to revisit south-east Asia – not to relive past travelling glories of my 20s (where my destinations usually revolved around partying). Instead we floated around the more “cultured” parts that were not on my radar in days gone by – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (a revelation) and more remote areas of the Philippines and Indonesia. I could list a hundred special moments and locations over the year – but the memory I revisit in my head the most is my daily moped drive to a beach on the Karimunjawa islands in Indonesia. It’s not the crystal-clear sea, smiling locals or amazing food that sticks, but the feeling of absolute freedom and euphoric joy that made me smile from ear to ear on that ride, sometimes laughing to myself hysterically for no reason (I must have looked a bit crazy). It’s joy that I felt from simply being alive. It’s a feeling that can be elusive in life and one I cherish so much. Benjamin Continue reading...",

The réserve intégrale du Lauvitel was established in 1995 to “monitor the natural dynamics of ecosystems” with all human influence removed. This so-called wilderness area was one of the first of its kind in Europe.A video showed an ecologist rowing across a dazzling, teal-hued lake surrounded by pine-strewn peaks. I was immediately fascinated.
