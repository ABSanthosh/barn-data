    "description": "The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku is the canvas for a spectacular projection mapping display known as \"Tokyo Night \u0026 Light.\" At 13,904 square meters, Tokyo Night \u0026 Light projections cover the 48-story building from its fourth to its 32nd floor. The nightly light show received the Guinness World Record as the largest permanent architectural projection-mapped display when it first took place in February 2024.  The free show is cast onto what was once the tallest building in Japan using 40 projectors that were specially developed by Panasonic for enhanced durability to withstand outdoor elements and is run using mainly solar-generated electricity. The projection is conducted nightly with each show lasting approximately 15 minutes at half-hour intervals. Each show showcases art and music created by a mix of Japanese and international artists, drawing inspiration from the country's traditions, history, and landmarks.  In April of 2024, Tokyo Night \u0026 Light unveiled the monstrous \"Godzilla: Attack on Tokyo!\" show in recognition of the iconic kaiju franchise's 70th anniversary. This is not the first time that Godzilla has left his mark on the tower however, in Godzilla vs King Ghidorah (1991) the titular kaiju do battle around the battered Tokyo Metropolitan Building.",

    "title": "Fancy Ice Is Art in Your Glass",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-fancy-ice",
    "description": "This article is adapted from the October 5, 2024, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Where I live in California, it’s been an unseasonably warm fall. While cafés and grocery stores are going full-speed ahead with all things autumn, no one I know is running to get a pumpkin spice latte yet, considering the 100-degree plus temperatures. Instead, we’re all still craving anything cold and iced. The other day, I saw my first at-home pebble ice machine, and I was filled with a brief longing to buy one for myself so that I could enjoy textured, crunchy ice whenever I wanted. Alas, all of my ice comes from plastic trays in the freezer. But I’m fascinated by the growing number of people who treat ice as an art. Instead of cloudy, rectangular cubes, some bartenders hand-carve sparkling frozen forms out of perfectly clear ice. Others use special molds, edible flowers, juices, and fruit to create ice that adds flavor and texture to a drink, as well as cooling it down. Focusing so much effort on ephemeral ice might seem impractical. Yet people often fixate on the perfect liquors, the perfect glassware, and the perfect drink-making technique. Ice is an essential part of many beverages, so this week, we’re finding out more about this fascinating frozen art. Cool History Before refrigeration, ice was a flex. Around the world, there are records of the wealthy and powerful sending their servants up high mountains to bring back snow for drinks and desserts. Even those without convenient snowy mountains nearby could enjoy cold treats on hot days by constructing insulated buildings and stocking them with winter ice cut from bodies of water nearby. But this depended on having a cold enough climate during the winter. In the 19th century, fast ships and railroads could carry ice around the world. The United States began shipping ice from its lakes to far-flung locales like the Caribbean and England. But Americans kept plenty of that ice for themselves, adding it to trendy new mixed drinks called cocktails. In the 20th century, home freezers made ice more accessible than ever before. But, until recently, people have stuck to cloudy white cubes to cool down their drinks. Ice Gets Hot Over the past few years, I’ve seen “ice restock” videos appear across my social media feeds. These consist of influencers showing off floppy silicone ice molds filled with colorful frozen liquids and fruits, and the process of popping out aesthetically-pleasing ice into freezer drawers. Comments range from admiring to skeptical, but there’s no denying that the sounds of ice cubes (there’s often an #asmr tag) and the colors of the ice are appealing. Creations like pink, cherry blossom–shaped ice and ice frozen into rose shapes and sprinkled with dried petals almost seem too pretty to submerge in a drink. Of similar interest are videos of bartenders, especially from Japan, painstakingly carving clear ice into spheres or diamonds. But why would a bartender want to take time out from a shift to hand-carve a piece of ice? There’s numerous explanations: certain shapes, such as spheres, melt slower and dilute a drink less, and a good number of small Japanese bars buy their ice in huge chunks that need to be broken down anyway. The Quest for Clear Ice These factoids come from Camper English, the author of The Ice Book: Cool Cubes, Clear Spheres, and Other Chill Cocktail Crafts. Over the last 15 years, English has made a name for himself as the internet’s ice guru, a reputation established by a long-ago quest to create clear ice at home. It all started with a bit of mythbusting, he explains. He attended a cocktail conference where a panel touched on the subject of making clear ice. “So I decided to test the theories that people were suggesting, methodically, at home,” he says. For example, many people think that freezing boiling water will result in clear ice. English tried it. It didn’t work. “It's more of an urban legend than anything else,” he says. So he set out to develop a standardized process. In his book, English describes freezing different kinds of water in different containers, but all his ice ended up cloudy-white in the center. It took a lot of ice and observation before he noticed that the outer edges of his ice cubes stayed clear. On December 28, 2009, he posted this finding: freezing water in an insulated container without a top would result in a piece of clear ice with a cloudy layer at the bottom that could be chipped off. This, he explains to me over the phone, is known as directional freezing. The last part of water to freeze will end up cloudy from trapped air and impurities. Usually, that’s the very center of an ice cube, but using an insulated container without a lid “only freezes from one direction, which is the top down towards the bottom,” he says. You can also get see-through ice from not allowing a cube to freeze solid, keeping the center liquid. Both home and professional bartenders absorbed English’s findings, and there’s now an industry creating tools to make ever-more fanciful clear ice at home. “I'm glad that it's still going all these years later,” says English. He hasn’t gotten tired of ice, either. “I have fun with my reputation as an ice weirdo,” he says. “I rarely keep food in my freezer if I can avoid it because I've always got a few ice projects happening in there.” “You don't think of people who knit a lot as being obsessive or weirdos. My hobby is making ice cubes that are really good,” English laughs. “So save your judgment, people.” English has noticed an uptick in the number of people doing ice projects the last few years. “Initially, the process that I shared was known among bartenders, but it really took off only during the pandemic when a lot more people were trying to make good-looking drinks at home,” he says. In his book, English demonstrates not only how to make clear ice, but also how to suspend flowers and fruit inside cubes, make frozen punch bowls, and how to create frozen spheres to hold cocktails. Ice, he says, can do much more than simply cool down a drink, and even a single cube of clear or colorful ice can make a cocktail feel special. “I often use the analogy of drinking fine champagne out of a Styrofoam cup while sitting in a ditch, as opposed to drinking the same champagne from a crystal flute in a fine-dining cocktail bar,” English says. “It's the same champagne, but the experience is elevated with a better visual environment.”",

    "description": "In 1955, the Prudential Company completed their newest offices, a sprawling 22-story building that was both the largest insurance office in the Southeastern United States and the first sky scrapper built in Jacksonville since the end of World War II. It was to serve as South-Central Home Office building of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Inspired by the company motto \"Prudential Has The Strength of Gibraltar,\" the British Navy transported a two-and-a-half-ton chunk of the Rock of Gilbraltar and delivered it to the new office building. It was delivered on January 7, 1995 and gifted to the city of Jacksonville. The Rock of Gilbraltar is a limestone monolith that stands near the western entrance to the Mediterranean Sea. It is the northern half of the historic Pillars of Hercules, which according to Ancient Greek legend marked the western edge of the known world.",

    "title": "Oval Gasholder in London, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/oval-gasholder",
    "description": "Some of the older sports stadiums around the world feature either unusual in-built features or eccentric neighborhoods that have developed around them over a century or more. In London, one of the oldest sporting locations is the Oval Cricket Ground, often called the Oval and currently branded as the Kia Oval.  Looming behind the stands on the north side of the cricket ground is a seemingly out-of-place gasholder (or gasometer) commonly called the Oval Gasholder. The history of the cricket ground and the gasholder are surprisingly intertwined. The cricket ground was established in 1845 and was initially the home of the Surrey Cricket Club. In that same year, the Phoenix Gas Light \u0026 Coke Company bought the waterworks on the site to the north of the cricket ground and converted their site into a gasworks. A total of five gasholders were built on the site between 1847 and 1874. The gasholder nearest the cricket ground, which would officially be designated Gasholder Number 1, was erected in 1853. At a height of 135 feet, the Oval Gasholder was the tallest gasholder in the world when it was constructed. The Oval Gasholder, while notably large among the United Kingdom’s Victorian-era gasholders, looks and previously operated in a very similar way to other gasholders across the United Kingdom. It has a steel frame surrounding a collapsible cylindrical structure that holds the gas. When the gasholder is filled, the cylinder expands, but as the gas is distributed by the utility to its customers, the cylinder collapses. Initially these structures held gas created by burning coal but later transitioned to natural gas. Over the decades, the steel frame of the Victorian-era gasholder has towered over the cricket ground’s north stands, providing an unusual industrial backdrop to the sporting events at the site. At first, the venue was used for multiple sports aside from cricket, including football (soccer) and rugby, but it eventually came to be used mainly for cricket. Most famously, starting in 1880, the Oval started hosting international matches between the Australian and England cricket teams. These matches would soon be named “the Ashes,” one of the most famous rivalries in cricket. Going forward from the 1880s, the Oval would serve as the home stadium for England’s cricket team. Meanwhile, the Oval Gasholder continued to be used for gas storage, often be decorated with banners that were visible from both the stadium and on television broadcasts. However, with improvements in gas storage in the late 20th century, gasholders like this were no longer needed. All of the gasholders at the site north of the cricket ground were decommissioned in 2014, and almost everything at the site was slated for demolition. The Oval Gasholder, on the other hand, was given Grade II listed status by English Heritage, which means that the structure will be preserved. The former gas works will be redeveloped into housing, which is direly needed in London. This includes the construction of new apartment building inside the frame of the Oval Gasholder, and this has generated significant controversy, although similar apartment buildings have been built inside the frames of other historic gasholders.  Nonetheless, the Oval Gasholder will continue to loom in the background of international cricket games for the foreseeable future.",

    "description": "Enter Pa Mai, a rustic eatery in landlocked Phuket Town, and before anything else, you’ll be presented with a stainless steel plate of thin, round, gleaming white rice noodles known as khanom jiin. Cheap, infinitely customizable and, perhaps most importantly for southern Thais, spicy, it’s one of the most beloved dishes in the south. More a style of eating than a dish, khanom jiin is the name of the noodles in Thai, but it also refers to a spread of curries and a DIY selection of toppings. Do you want to pair those noodles with a creamy, spicy crab curry? An herbaceous, spicy beef green curry? An incendiary, salty curry of fish and vegetables? (Yes, they’re all spicy.)  Decision made, you then escort your dish to your table, where there’s a vast spread of toppings: a heaping platter of herbs and vegetables to pluck from, crispy dried fish, slices of pineapple, hard-boiled eggs, vegetables simmered in coconut milk, pickled mustard greens and more. Supplement your dish as you wish, then dig in.",

    "title": "Pine Mountain Observatory in Millican, Oregon",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pine-mountain-observatory",
    "description": "The eastern Oregon high desert, with its clear air and low population density, has night skies as dark as anywhere in the conterminous 48 states. It's hardly surprising, then, that the University of Oregon has located a research observatory there, on 6,349-foot (1,935-meter) Pine Mountain, just southeast of Bend. The investigations that led to the establishment of the observatory date from the late 1950s, when astrophysicist E.G. “Eb” Ebbighausen was looking for a dark site for his work on binary stars. He found that sites by the Cascade Range, although closer to the campus in western Oregon, were too often cloudy. Consulting with the Forest Service and local astronomy buffs led him to Pine Mountain. Besides Ebbighausen's research on binary stars, other research includes studies of dim galaxies in the 2000s. The 24-inch Boller \u0026 Chivens telescope (mentioned below) also made the first observations, in 1970, of magnestars, white dwarf stars with extraordinarily strong magnetic fields. The current facilities include a 15-inch Fecker Cassegrain telescope, which dates back to 1950. In 1961, Ebbighausen used it in his scouting for a dark-sky site, and it was installed at Pine Mountain Observatory in 1968. It was restored and reinstalled in 2015 and is now used for public outreach and student projects. The Boller \u0026 Chivens 24-inch telescope was the first constructed at the observatory, in 1967. Currently it is also used for outreach and student projects. (Alas, a 32-inch telescope has been out of commission since 2000 due to a catastrophic mechanical failure in its drive.) At present, the focus of the observatory is on undergraduate research and public outreach, with public events on most summer weekends. As Ebbighausen was also the author of a standard astronomy text that was revised into the 1970s, undergraduate research fits well with his legacy. In establishing the observatory, Ebbighausen also focused on grassroots public support, so outreach is also part of his legacy.",

    "title": "Archaeologists Explore Life After Dark in the Ancient Night",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/life-after-dark-ancient-night",
    "description": "This story was originally published on SAPIENS and appears here with permission under a CC BY-ND 4.0 license. As recently as a few decades ago in the Western world, stars dazzled humans with their brightness and the Milky Way could be seen spanning the far reaches of the heavens as night deepened into an unspeakable darkness. In the 21st century, such a scene is becoming a rarity across many parts of the globe as we light up the night like never before. Today our experience of the night differs significantly from that of our ancestors. Before they mastered fire, early humans lived roughly half their lives in the dark. The only night light they had came from the moon when skies were clear. Then, when humans began to gain some control over fire use (probably around 400,000 years ago), everything changed. From that point on, most people have had access to some form of “artificial” light, at least occasionally. Thus began our persistent efforts to light up the night. Even people who lived relatively recently—those with candles, oil lamps, and early electricity—were far more familiar with darkness than we are today. Their nocturnal world simply wasn’t as bright as ours. But what have we gained by illuminating the night? Has anything been lost in our efforts to banish darkness? Were people, and the world, better off when it was darker? The night has always fascinated people, for it brings with it a simultaneously feared and revered part of our existence. Yet the scientific journey into understanding ancient nights has been long in coming: Only recently have archaeologists begun to research what life was like after dark in the ancient world. Were people better off when it was darker? A few years ago, when we began thinking about the night lives of our ancestors, we found little academic work on the subject. The more we thought about the nocturnal, whether it was during the Paleolithic (which coauthor April Nowell studies), or during Classic Maya times (which coauthor Nancy Gonlin researches), the more we realized that very little research had been explicitly conducted on it. That is when we embarked on the process, with the assistance of many of our fellow archaeologists, of putting together the book Archaeology of the Night (2018), which we coedited. Ancient nocturnal habits were numerous and were like the many kinds of nightly activities in which we modern humans engage: sleeping, sex, stargazing, work, ceremonies, secret meetings, and so on. Take the ancient Romans, for example. If you think that a noisy nightlife is a hallmark of the modern world, think again! Ancient Rome was a busy and often loud place. Wheeled vehicles provisioned the city’s taverns and took away its waste, and people partied until dawn during festivals, prompting one poet to write, “The laughter of the crowd passing by awakens me and all Rome is at my bedside.” Rome’s citizens often took advantage of the cover of darkness to pee over their balconies or dump objects into the streets, and to engage in crimes ranging from disturbing the peace to assault. A roving band of police rounded up these criminals, and the individual in charge of this law enforcement squad—a man who had been up all night—was also the judge who sentenced them the next morning for their crimes. Ancient Rome reminds us that something as simple as sleep is not the same everywhere and in every time period. How we sleep, where, when, how much, on what, and with whom all have cultural aspects. Cross-cultural night studies challenge what we take to be universal and natural: Twenty-first-century Westerners think that sleeping for eight hours in a row is a good thing, but a Roman example shows that concepts such as normal sleep patterns are, in fact, culturally defined. A “first sleep” of a few hours and then a “second sleep” was a common pattern. In between those times, ancient Romans engaged in some other activity for a short time, such as deep contemplation, prayer, sex, or reading. In ancient Mesoamerica, the Maya built their cities in the tropics during the Classic (250–900) and Post Classic (900–1521) periods. Nighttimes were busy: hunting, guarding the fields, preparing the next day’s meals, feasting, and celebrations all took place when people weren’t sleeping. As dusk set in and vision waned, other senses became heightened. Jaguars roamed the landscape and insects buzzed about, creating a profusion of sounds unique to the night. Tropical plants bloomed in the cool nighttime air, adding scents to the nocturnal ambience. Crackling fires in torches, hearths, and ceramic vessels illuminated and warmed the cool tropical nights and warded off beings, both real and fantastical, in the dark. Night was both an ominous and sacred time. People made offerings to appease the gods who ruled the underworld, thereby ensuring the rising of the sun. The Moon Goddess rode her deer across the night sky, keeping watch over those who dared to venture into darkness. Sacred ceremonies took place in which royal persons imbibed hot, inebriating cacao drinks and danced at midnight. People across the social spectrum practiced bloodletting—drawing blood with obsidian blades, stingray spines, and thorn-lined ropes—in order to honor their ancestors. Astronomical readings of Venus determined whether war was on the horizon or if peace was prudent. Likewise, in the urban area of Copan, Honduras, for some 250 years (600–850) city dwellers shared a noisy nocturnal life in closely built housing. They slept on their stone benches, which were covered with cloth and padding for comfort. Others who lived outside of the city likely had portable sleeping mats, like those found from the incredibly well-preserved Classic farming community of Joya de Cerén, El Salvador. The Classic Maya wrote about many of these activities, and we are fortunate today to be able to understand their hieroglyphic writing, some of which gives us insight into their nightlife. In other areas of the world, people created lighting technologies that inform us about the relationships they perceived between the night, darkness, and death. Every day at dusk in ancient Egypt, the sun god Ra died in the west, casting the world into darkness. According to ancient Egyptians, the dead also traveled to the west—to Osiris, god of the underworld. Lighting played essential roles in funerary rituals during the dynasties of the New Kingdom period, which began in 1570 B.C. (nearly a thousand years after the Pyramids at Giza were built) and ended in 1069 B.C. “Wicks-on-sticks” are pictured on the famous Book of the Dead papyrus, and one of these lighting devices was discovered in King Tutankhamun’s tomb. These are just a few of the nighttime practices that have taken place around the world over the course of history. In Oman, Bronze Age (3100–1300 B.C.) farmers irrigated their crops in the cool night air to reduce evaporation, and later, in Iron Age Zimbabwe (200–1900), metalworkers fired up their forges at night to escape the blaze of the sun. Over 4,000 years ago in ancient Pakistan at the famous archaeological site of Mohenjo-daro, the removal of night soil (human excrement) was a task that was considered best suited to darkness, and in Polynesia, for centuries, ancient mariners looked to the stars to guide them on their long journeys home. The Vikings living in northern Europe during the Dark Ages used fish-oil, whale-fat, and seal-blubber lamps to light the dark interiors of their pithouses, and in 19th-century Bahamas, enslaved people achieved freedom, if only for a while, under cover of darkness. Fast-forward to today, when the glow from cityscapes drowns out the stars and creates a brilliant night sky our ancestors would not recognize. As we’ve studied the archaeology of the night, we’ve become starkly aware of how much we are losing today by over-lighting the world. Our modern nocturnal footprint is so bright that it is detected from outer space. We have “night mayors” in cities that never sleep, millions of people working night shifts, and health problems associated with the disappearing night as darkness gives way to the brightness of electrical illumination. Recent research demonstrates that circadian rhythms control 10–15 percent of our genes and that interruptions of these rhythms are linked to medical disorders such as heart disease, insomnia, and depression. Some researchers even suggest that certain cancers are likely caused by exposure to excessive nighttime lighting. There are also social implications to our overlit lifestyles: For most of our past, people would gather around campfires at night to tell stories and sing songs, much like many Westerners do today on the rare occasions when we find time to go camping. With the advent of electric light, we don’t need to congregate in one place—we are free to follow more solitary pursuits, bathed in our individual sources of light. On top of the health and social effects among humans, the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA), a nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the dark environment of night, has brought to our attention the ecological damage we are causing to numerous species all over the world. There are many “poster animals” for the impacts of our harmful light pollution: Sea turtles and migrating birds stand out as those most endangered by humans’ nocturnal habits. Not to mention the fact that more lights require the burning of more fossil fuels and thus an increased contribution to climate change. The IDA provides numerous ideas about how we can regain the dark, such as using dark-sky friendly outdoor lighting and advocating for lighting ordinances in local communities. Even in the brightest countries in the world, such as Japan, it’s possible to preserve an entire area, such as the certified International Dark Sky Place in the national park of the Yaeyama Islands. Each of us can do our part to lessen the brightness of modern nights. Our archaeological inquiries into the night have taught us that while our relationships with the night have shifted, we remain part of the darkness, part of the night. It is essential to our well-being—and that of the planet—that we do what we can to turn out the lights.",

    "description": "Japanese folklore and popular culture are fond of ghost stories, often focusing on their tragic, melodramatic aspects. There is even a \"big three\" of Japanese ghost stories, which always includes Yotsuya Kaidan and Banchō Sarayashiki, while the third place usually goes to either Botan Dōrō or Kasane-ga-fuchi. With the exception of Botan Dōrō, which was adapted from a Chinese story, these ghost stories revolve around real-life figures in feudal Japan, set in actual locations in and around Tokyo. Kasane-ga-fuchi is the only location outside Tokyo and can be found in Joso City, give or take two hours away. It refers to an \"abyss\" of the Kinugawa River running at the back of Hōzō-ji Temple, named after a local girl who met a tragic demise. The story of Kasane was first recorded in the 17th century and is purported to have been based on a true story that transpired between 1612 and 1672. It was later popularized through numerous kabuki and rakugo adaptations. In 1924, the story was adapted into a silent film and has since been remade at least half a dozen times. According to the popular version of the story, a widowed farmer named Yoemon lived in the village of Hanyu with his second wife Osugi, who had a disabled and disfigured daughter named Suke. Yoemon hated the girl so much that he snapped and pushed her into the river one day, leaving her to drown. The following year, Yoemon and Osugi had a daughter and named her Rui, but she grew up to be the spitting image of Suke, so the villagers started to call her \"Kasane,\" another reading of the kanji character for Rui which means \"layer.\" Years later, Kasane cared for a sick drifter named Yagoro and married him once he recovered. Yagoro, however, was not exactly fond of his \"ugly\" wife and brutally murdered her. He immediately remarried—again and again. After the next five wives died of mysterious causes, he finally had a daughter with his seventh wife and named her Kiku. The girl was possessed by the spirits of Kasane and Suke, who accused Yagoro of his sins. The famed Buddhist saint Yuten was called in and successfully exorcized the ghosts, putting the restless souls at peace. The story has many variations, including a few in which Kasane is depicted as a beautiful woman to emphasize the tragedy. The original 17th-century text is mainly dedicated to the heroic deeds of Yūten the exorcist, and some scholars suggest that the work may have been nothing more than Buddhist propaganda. No matter what the case is, the graves of Kasane (Rui), Suke, and Kiku do exist and can be visited at Hōzō-ji Temple, hinting that the tale might have been (at least partially) inspired by actual events after all. Or was it?",

    "title": "Holborn Viaduct in London, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/holborn-viaduct",
    "description": "The River Fleet, which ran from Hamstead in north central London into the River Thames near where Blackfriars Bridge now stands, was considered for centuries to be a disgusting waterway filled with sewage and garbage, including a substantial amount of waste from the butchers based at Smithfield Market. Consequently, in the mid-19th century, major efforts were made to culvert the river, putting it entirely underground, and closer to the river, the covered area was converted into a street. A bridge had previously crossed over the River Fleet between the areas of Holborn and Farringdon, connecting a road named Holborn to another now named Newgate Street. When the river was converted into a street, the steep hills of the former river valley in the location of the bridge made it impractical for horse-drawn carriages and wagons to descend into and then out of the valley. As a result, London’s first overpass was proposed to ease traffic through the site. Construction on the overpass, which would be named the Holborn Viaduct, started in 1863 and finished in 1869, with Queen Victoria officially opening the viaduct on November 6, 1869. The 1,4000-foot-long cast iron and stone viaduct is a truly ornate Victorian masterpiece. The ironworks underneath the bridge include many intricate designs, including dragons and knights’ helmets. Meanwhile, the top level features four bronze statues of women representing agriculture, commerce, fine arts, and science as well as four additional bronze statues of winged lions at the ends of the bridge. Several replica Victorian-era lamps stand evenly spaced along the full length of the railings on the top of the bridge, and several more hang at evenly-spaced intervals underneath. Additionally, a total of four buildings at the ends of the bridge provide staircases that allow pedestrians easy access between the top of the viaduct and Farringdon Road below it (although note that only the two buildings on the south side are original, as the two on the north side were damaged in World War II and reconstructed later). Even though the Holborn Viaduct is a prominent feature of the City of London’s street network, its location away from tourist areas means that it’s a much more familiar sight for London’s local residents and office workers.  Nonetheless, as a grade II listed structed, it is one of London’s most historically and architecturally important bridges.",

    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kalkugnarna",
    "description": "The lime kilns were built in the middle of the 19th century when there was a large lime extraction in the area. As early as 1701, it is stated on a map of Östra Torp's parish that Count Beck-Friis was allowed to \"take lime on the properties no. 1\". This is the oldest known record of lime mining in this area. Today there are about 10 preserved lime kilns northeast of Östra Torps village. The oldest were built in the mid-1800s, the youngest in the 1930s. The ovens are all of the so-called dome type. A \"charge\" was built up inside the oven through a hole in the side. This consisted of limestone interspersed in different layers with coal and it covered the entire dome space. In the floor there was a grate under which the fireplace was located. During the firing, the entrance hole was walled up and the fuel was applied from the back of the dome. Each burning required five to six tons of coal and it lasted about 40 hours. The limestone was heated to about a thousand degrees and after the burning it was \"extinguished\" with water. After the lime was finished burning, it was filled into barrels and transported away via a constructed, narrow-gauge railway. At the turn of the century in 1900, about eighty men were employed partly with the quarrying of the lime and partly with the burning. In 1938, the number was 48 people. The last time lime was burned in Östra Torp was in a kiln in 1951.",

    "title": "Crypt of the Church of St. Mary in Lastingham, England",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/crypt-church-of-st-mary-lastingham",
    "description": "The first ecclesiastic building on this site, in Lastingham, Yorkshire, was a Saxon monastery which was written  about by the Venerable Bede. The monastery was founded in 654 by St. Cedd of Lindisfarne. During the first millennium period of Viking raids in many parts of northern England, the original wood and stone buildings were destroyed. It was not rebuilt until William the Conqueror approved the building of a church at Lastingham in 1078. The altars of the church are thought to be reworked Roman stone. The main body of the church is a magnificent  building showing great examples of Romanesque architecture but it is the magnificent crypt of the church that is unique, as it is thought to be the oldest Norman crypt in the world.  It has walls that are three feet thick and is the the only church crypt in Britain with a nave, aisles and a chancel in the form of an apse at the eastern end. It is almost as if the crypt had been intended as an alternate site for services, mirroring the church above it. The crypt runs underneath the full footprint of the church above it. The crypt was built initially to house the bones of St. Cedd, but at least some of these were later moved by his brother, St. Chad, to Lichfield. The crypt is supported on four stone pillars thought to predate the Norman Conquest, and has not been altered since the time of William the Conqueror. It can be accessed by a staircase descending from nave. It is reported that during the 18th century, the barbaric sport of cock-fighting took place in the crypt—whether the clergy and/or churchwarden knew about this usage is unclear. Within the crypt today is an original ancient burial bier and also the remains of an ancient carved stone cross, previously 24 feet high, which was replaced, in the 19th century by the current (12 foot high) cross at the top of Rosedale Chimney Bank, about four miles away, known as Ana Cross. Like the current cross still does, the impressive old Ana Cross stood atop a Bronze Age burial mound on the open moor. In the body of the church are numerous memorial tablets and inscriptions of which a notable one is to Sidney Ringer, a physician whose research led to the adoption of saline solutions for use as blood replacement (and as a diluent in microbiological and physiological research). Dr Ringer is buried in the church yard.",

Often haunting cemeteries, this infernal beast with pointy ears and glowing eyes is believed to be an omen of death, much like the black dog of British folklore. Though of uncertain origin, the Kardoes is sometimes associated with the Norse god Odin and referred to as the Wodanshelper, perhaps a participant in the mythological Wild Hunt. Numerous local tales describe the Kardoes as a harbinger of injury, a reaper of recently departed souls, and bad luck incarnate. The legendary creature, however, was all but forgotten when sculptor Pieter de Monchy created a statue of it in 1950. It has since become a symbol of the village, bringing local folklore back into focus, if not a major attraction that draws in crowds of tourists every day.",

    "title": "The Wendigo and 6 Other Ancient Monsters From Indigenous Folklore",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wendigo-ancient-monsters-from-indigenous-folklore",
    "description": "They have survived in the shadows for millennia. Their names have been whispered over hearths and campfires, invoked as warnings to disobedient children, or perhaps known but never said aloud for fear of attracting their attention: the wendigo, the bunyip, the capelobo. Around the world, Indigenous communities have passed rich storytelling traditions from one generation to the next from time immemorial. Many of the stories have been lost in the upheaval and destruction of the colonial era. Selfless heroes and bold tricksters alike have been forgotten, or faded to a mere wisp of collective memory. But the monsters, ah, the monsters. Ferocious, fanged, skulking, slithering, they seem to have endured better than most. These beings still haunt—and hunt—from Australia to Brazil, Lake Victoria to Lake Winnebago. Here are some of the most memorable ancient terrors from Indigenous lore that still send chills down our spines. Beware the Wendigo, the Frostbitten Flesheater of North America’s Chilly Heartland by J.W. Ocker Few monsters from Indigenous folklore can boast of making it in Hollywood. There’s Krampus, a modern amalgamation of deeply ancient Central European traditions, and the wendigo, which first terrorized the Algonquin, Ojibwe, and other Anishinaabe peoples around the North American Great Lakes. We’ll leave it to you to decide whether the 2021 movie Antlers does justice to the wendigo’s ferocity, but we’re betting the wendigo doesn’t care. It’s too busy looking for its next victim. A potent symbol of human greed, the emaciated creature is insatiably hungry and appears in the lean and desperate season of winter. In the 19th century, some documented regional cases of cannibalism and other unspeakable acts were chalked up to individuals “going wendigo.” The Blood-Sucking Capelobo Haunts Brazil’s Dense Forests by April White The Guajajara, Yudjá, and other Indigenous communities along the rivers of Brazil differ on what the capelobo looks like. Sometimes it’s described as a human-tapir hybrid, or an anteater that walks on two legs. Sometimes it has only one leg. What everyone does agree on, however, is that this brain-slurping, blood-sucking forest creature is relentless, and almost impossible to kill. If you hear its bone-chilling scream echoing through the trees, run or hide. Just don’t look back. The Child-Eating Bunyip Still Haunts Australia’s Wetlands by Sarah Durn Sometimes feathered, sometimes scaly, sometimes covered in malodorous shaggy fur, the bunyip, which goes by many names, can be found across the continent. Its screams cause disease and its appetite for children is bottomless. This ancient terror of riverways and swamps may trace its origin story to Diprotodon, a massive, wombat-like animal that went extinct nearly 50,000 years ago. That may seem like a long time ago, but ancestors of today’s Aboriginal nations were already sharing tales over their hearths back then—and keeping watch for a black shadow moving in the water. The Child-Eating Bloodsucker of Aboriginal Australian Nightmares by April White Australia definitely has its share of ancient monsters with a particular taste for tender, young flesh but, no taller than a child and essentially toothless, the potbellied yara ma tha who might not sound intimidating. Yet stray too close to a fig tree and the creature could swallow you whole—and then spit you back out, still alive but forever changed. Misconstrued as a vampire by European colonists, the yara ma tha who is actually an example of practical Indigenous knowledge distilled into a memorable tale: Real predators often hid among the dense foliage of fig trees, so it was best to keep your distance. The Loch Ness Monster Look-Alike Lurking Beneath Lake Tahoe by Suzie Dundas It seems lake monsters are a dime a dozen—every self-respecting lake has to have one, from Lake Tele’s Mokèlé-mbèmbé in the Republic of the Congo to western New York’s Silver Lake sea serpent, which happens to live nowhere near a sea. Lake monster scholars (it’s a thing) have a theory that tales of these creatures speak to the human need to make sense of the unfamiliar and unknown—what lies beneath, in other words. Today, Tessie is a smiling, tourist-friendly ambassador for the Tahoe area, but its roots are far more unsettling. The Indigenous Washoe, or Wašiw, people of the region have long warned of water babies, malevolent spirits waiting in the depths of Lake Tahoe and other regional lakes. The Man-Eating Dingonek Lurks Beneath East Africa’s Rivers by April White Sprawling across the borders of three countries, Lake Victoria, one of the African Great Lakes, is a principal source of the Nile River. And the smaller rivers flowing into the lake are sources for stories of the fearsome dingonek, perhaps the most poignant river monster of the colonial era. The “fish-beast” was described by British and American hunters and explorers as nearly 20 feet long, with clawed feet and tough scales and a dog-like head—but definitely not a crocodile. The foreigners’ breathless tales are short on Indigenous knowledge and long on their own apparent derring-do, which typically included shooting the dingonek dead (but somehow never retrieving its body). From what we do know of the ancient local lore about the animal, despite its frightful appearance, its presence promised good fortune and health, and its absence heralded suffering. Indeed, in the wake of the foreigners’ dingonek hunts, death and disease followed. In North Dakota, the Hideous Miniwashitu Ushers in Spring by April White Winter in the North American heartland is a brutal season of killer cold, extreme storms, and limited sources of food. It’s no surprise the wendigo emerged during this bleak time of year, as terrifying as it was insatiable. But to the west of the wendigo’s hunting grounds, in what’s now North Dakota, winter birthed a different kind of monster, according to the lore of the Mandan people. The miniwashitu was no looker: Imagine a furry, ferocious, one-eyed rhinoceros with a saw along its spine. But the monster played a vital role along the Missouri River, the artery of trade for the Mandan. In late winter, the miniwashitu used its bulk and the sharp teeth on its back to bust up the river’s thick ice, a sign that winter, with all its ancient terrors, was over at last.",

    "title": "Was ‘Dracula’ the Biggest Flying Creature Ever?",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/largest-flying-creature-ever",
    "description": "“It’s just such an awesome image to think about: a giant flying dragon, essentially, coming down and preying on these dinosaurs,” says Ben Thomas, a paleontology graduate student at the University of Portsmouth, England. Earlier this year, Thomas released a video on his paleontology-themed YouTube channel about his visit to the Altmühltal Museum in Denkendorf, Germany. There, he spoke with paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim about one of the museum’s most remarkable specimens. It’s the fragmentary remains of a pterosaur—a flying reptile—that lived in Transylvania, Romania, 66 million years ago, and just might be the largest animal that has ever flown. Scientists have nicknamed it “Dracula.” The Altmühltal Museum displays a cast of Dracula’s remains, alongside a model skeleton and a life-sized statue of the creature. At an estimated 11.5 feet tall, with a wingspan of 37.4 to 39.4 feet, Dracula was comparable to a giraffe when standing, or a small airplane in flight. “Seeing it on the ground really gives you a proper sense of scale, that these were absolutely terrifying animals if you ever encountered them,” says Thomas. Members of the Azhdarchidae family of pterosaurs, to which Dracula belonged, are famous for their size, but “generally the accepted wingspan for all of the others is about 10 meters [32.8 feet] at most,” says Thomas, making Dracula a giant even among its relatives. The name Azhdarchidae was coined in 1984 for a specimen from Uzbekistan, from the Persian and Uzbek word for “dragon.” So it’s not surprising that when scientists uncovered the mega-Azhdarchid specimen in Transylvania’s Hațeg (pronounced “Hatzeg”) Basin in 2009, they dubbed it Dracula, which literally means “son of the dragon” (or the Devil) in Romanian. The giant pterosaur is also not the first prehistoric creature named or nicknamed for the famous vampire. In 1975, a dinosaur found in Transylvania was dubbed Bradycneme draculae, meaning “Dracula’s ponderous leg,” for its hefty leg bones. The extra-large vampire bat Desmodus draculae coexisted with early humans in the American tropics, where it may have inspired Indigenous mythology. And two prehistoric arthropods found trapped in Burmese amber bear the species name draculi: a wasp with toothy-looking mouthparts, and a tick that drained the blood of dinosaurs. We can safely assume that in life, Dracula the pterosaur was at least as scary as its namesake, but there’s still much about it we don’t know. “One of the big issues with the Dracula specimen,” Thomas explains, “is that it’s very, very fragmentary.” Other fossils of big Azhdarchids from the same time and place as Dracula have been excavated, such as the single confirmed species of the genus Hatzegopteryx (which means “Hațeg wing” after the area of discovery). But none of these fossils are from complete skeletons and Dracula’s remains do not overlap with those of Hatzegopteryx, making it difficult to tell for sure if Dracula represents a new species. Then there’s the question of whether such an enormous creature could actually fly. A 2018 article about Dracula in Scientific American claimed that features of Dracula’s wrist joint “could mean it was not meant for flight.” However, this remains speculation due to how fragmentary Dracula’s remains are. Signage at the Altmühltal Museum indicates to visitors that there is no conclusive evidence ruling out Dracula’s ability to fly, or that of other Azhdarchids. In 2017, Azhdarchid expert and paleoartist Mark Witton told The Guardian that he was certain Hatzegopteryx could achieve “flight speeds that would get a speeding ticket on a U.K. road.”​​ More research is needed, but Thomas agrees: “Maybe [Dracula] was too big to fly—but I don't think so.” According to a 2024 paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, many studies have found support for the idea that the largest pterosaurs could fly. “Generally it's not controversial among pterosaur researchers,” says Thomas. He points to features of Azhdarchid anatomy, “which they would be needing for flight, presumably,” such as partially hollow wing bones to reduce mass, anchor points for strong wing muscles, and other features similar to those found in flying birds today. Paleontologists studying pterosaurs often use birds or bats for comparison, but it’s become increasingly clear just how unique the flying reptiles were. Instead of walking on their back legs like birds, or hopping awkwardly like bats, it is now believed that pterosaurs folded their wings up to walk on four feet, and could be quite agile on the ground. Some paleontologists theorize that pterosaurs launched themselves into flight from all fours, pushing off with their front limbs, a method not seen in any living creature. Thomas explains how pterosaur anatomy confirms the theory of “quad-launching.” While birds have enlarged muscles in their wings for flying and in their legs for launching, “with pterosaurs, you have that all sort of contained in one area” in the chest, he says. “It's essentially a more mass-efficient way of taking off, which is presumably how they got so much bigger than birds.” The largest Azhdarchids were once thought to be similar to modern soaring birds like seagoing albatrosses or canyon-dwelling condors, both of which are ungainly and slow on the ground. Today, Azhdarchids are often compared with storks, which can fly but spend most of their time on foot, hunting small prey or scavenging. Recent speculative dinosaur documentaries like 2022’s Prehistoric Planet depict Azhdarchids like storks, as leggy opportunists who stroll around snapping up whatever they can get in their long, stabbing beaks, from baby dinosaurs to dinosaur carrion. With fellow paleontologist Darren Naish, Mark Witton coined the term “terrestrial stalkers” to describe this lifestyle. Flying costs a lot of energy, and many modern birds avoid it until absolutely necessary. A study of pterosaur flight efficiency suggests that as Dracula and its kin adapted to their “terrestrial stalker” niche and grew bigger, they became less-agile flyers, giving up mastery over the skies for the land. Dracula’s home was one of the most unique environments known to paleontologists. Transylvania’s Hațeg Basin was an island during the Late Cretaceous period some 66 million years ago, at the very end of the age of dinosaurs. There, dinosaurs evolved to be smaller than their mainland relatives due to a lack of space and resources, a phenomenon called “insular dwarfism.” As a result, Thomas explains, some researchers believe that Hațeg Island’s giant, stork-like Azhdarchids, “Hatzegopteryx in particular, would have been the top predator of this ecosystem, preying on dinosaurs…which is pretty spectacular.” Compared with other known Azhdarchids, Hatzegopteryx had an especially muscular neck supporting a large and heavy head and beak, meaning that it might have been able to handle larger prey than its relatives. Did Dracula belong to a species of dinosaur-gobbling Azhdarchid even larger than its cousin Hatzegopteryx? Or was it simply the largest-known individual of an already titanic species? While Thomas hopes that research on Dracula will be published soon, he points out that there are even more mysteries yet to be uncovered when it comes to the land-stalking dragons of Cretaceous Transylvania. Not long after Dracula was first discovered, another major Azhdarchid fossil was found in Romania from the same time period. While it consists only of one fragment of a lower jaw, “it’s apparently the biggest mandible of a pterosaur ever found,” says Thomas. Based on comparison with other pterosaurs, the jaw may have been more than three and a half feet long when the creature was alive, with features that might differentiate it from Hatzegopteryx. “And so maybe there's two species coexisting in this environment,” says Thomas. “But of course,” he adds, “there's always going to be others out there that haven't been discovered yet.”",

    "title": "Death as a Woman: The Accabadora of Sardinia",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/death-as-a-woman-accabadora-sardinia",
    "description": "In Sardinian author Michela Murgia’s 2009 novel Accabadora, a young girl named Maria is adopted by Bonaria Urrai, the respected village seamstress—and an angel of death. Little Maria wonders where Urrai disappears at night, never imagining that she hurries through narrow streets under the cloak of darkness, chanting prayers as she slips into the home of a villager lingering near death to finish the job. Murgia’s seamstress character is a modern reimagination of the folk figure of the accabadora, sometimes spelled S’accabadora, who is described in dozens of traditional Sardinian tales. The older woman, with a black lace shawl draped over her head, is said to walk with her mallet doubling as a cane to the home of the dying. No family members are present, but they have left the door open for her. She turns around holy statues so they will not see what happens next. Then she takes her mallet to the person’s temple, delivering a brutal but swift death. It fits her name, “she who finishes” in Sardinian. Written mentions of the accabadora first appear in the 17th century, where she is cast as a murderer. These folktales date to a time when Sardinia—an island 120 miles from the Italian mainland—was a socially conservative, highly patriarchal society dominated by the Catholic Church. Modern, feminist re-examinations like Murgia’s are now challenging these long-entrenched views. As in Murgia’s fictional account, scholars such as Montclair State University’s Gina Miele argue that the accabadora was no villain; rather, she was villainized by the Church. While it’s unclear whether any Sardinian women actually acted as accabadoras—Miele believes there were women who carried out these “good deaths” but evidence is scant—the folk figure was culturally important to the community. In folktales, the accabadora’s job is to release those lingering on the threshold of death. In addition to this task, the accabadora also often practices midwifery and healing, tasks also reserved for older women with deep knowledge of herbal remedies and other folk medicine. As such, the accabadora holds immense power in the stories, but this power comes at a great price: She commits euthanasia, a mortal sin that, in Catholic teaching, damns her soul. “The mystery around her I think is partially because it was done in secrecy, because it had to be done in secrecy,” Miele says. Christina Welch, a scholar of religion and death studies at the University of Winchester, believes that the accabadora’s ugly, old appearance in many folktales may be a manifestation of the Church’s condemnation of her work, as well as the patriarchal society’s devaluing of older women and traditional “women’s work.” But there’s a key element in many accabadora folktales: Her killings were seen as socially “good deaths” of individuals who, after long and full lives, were ready for death. “She only comes in after the priest has done his bit. You know, these people are fully confessed, ready to go, she just speeds them on their way,” says Welch. In most folk traditions, villains kill people who otherwise would have had long years of life ahead of them. The accabadora is more of a closer, performing a thankless task necessary to achieve resolution. This job, says Miele, is consistent with other roles traditionally reserved for women, including bringing children into the world and preparing the dead for burial. “It had to be done in secrecy.” Miele is writing a book about accabadora folklore and the women who may have performed the role in real life, perhaps as recently as the mid-20th century. Women “bring life in, we heal life,” Miele says. “We mourn and cant and chant as it is gone, and we are the ones, unfortunately, who frequently have to let life go.” Welch sees an interesting juxtaposition that may help explain why the accabadora was so villainized, despite performing a critical role: Her activity could have been seen as encroaching on traditionally masculine territory. “If you think about patriarchal society, it was men that would do the killing,” Welch says. “Men that would go out to war, men that had the power over things, and with the Church, men had the power over life and death and what happened after death. And yet here you have a woman who’s taking on aspects of that role.” Scholars and even many Sardinians disagree about whether any women really did slip through the village streets at night, mallet in hand. But the folk figure of the accabadora endures, now with renewed respect from a small but passionate group of scholars determined to cast her in a different light. “She finished a life, she doesn’t take away a life,” says Miele. “So the work of the accabadora, for me, is sacred work.”",

    "description": "If you venture down the sun-soaked boulevards of Myrtle Beach, you’ll soon stumble upon something rather unexpected: a volcano. Rising 40 feet in the air, it erupts every 20 minutes in fiery spectacle over its kingdom: Hawaiian Rumble, a Mini-Golf Course nestled among the town’s neon-lit tourist attractions. With its island vibes and international reputation, Hawaiian Rumble is anything but an ordinary putt-putt spot. Myrtle Beach, often called the “Mini-Golf Capital of the World,” is home to over 30 imaginatively themed courses. However, Hawaiian Rumble, first opened in 1997, stands out among the rest. Its tiki torches, lush landscaping, and rhythmic Hawaiian tunes transport Mini-Golfers of all ages into a vivid island experience. The course itself is meticulously designed, featuring crafty slopes and cunning hazards to confound amateurs and pros alike. Once a year, Mini-Golf’s finest gather under Hawaiian Rumble’s rumbling volcano to strut their stuff at the Mini-Golf Masters tournament. But for the other 362 days of the year, the course is simply a whimsical escape—a reminder that in Myrtle Beach, even 18 holes of Mini-Golf can feel like an adventure. After all, you never know what you’ll find hidden within the coastal charms of South Carolina. In this brand-new episode of Infrequently Asked Questions, sponsored by Visit Myrtle Beach, we sat down with Bob Detwiler, president of the US ProMiniGolf Association, to tee up some of our most driving questions. Should Mini-Golf be an Olympic sport? Has anyone ever tried to climb the volcano? (Did they succeed?) To find out these answers and see where all the magic happens, watch the video above.",

    "title": "The Video Game 'Black Myth: Wukong' Has Ancient Roots",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-story",
    "description": "This story was originally published on The Conversation. It appears here under a Creative Commons license. The recent launch of the video game “Black Myth: Wukong” has broken numerous records around the world for the number of users. The game is set in the world of the famous Chinese novel Journey to the West, where players battle gods and demons of traditional popular Chinese religion. In the first few weeks following its release in August, “Black Myth: Wukong” had reportedly sold over 18 million copies, making it one of the fastest-selling games of all time. Players take on the role of freeing Sun Wukong, the monkey protagonist from the popular 16th-century novel. The story details the journey of the Chinese monk, Xuanzang, as he makes his way to India in search of Buddhist scrolls. Sun Wukong aids the monk in this trip. Yet, the monkey proves to be the ultimate troublemaker, as Sun Wukong insults popular gods of the Chinese pantheon and insists on besting them in magical battles. Sun Wukong’s fate is sealed when the Buddha imprisons him under a mountain as punishment for all the havoc he created in Heaven. The video game picks up after the end of the story, pitting the player against those whom Sun Wukong had fought in the popular narrative. In so doing, the game continually references the complex and competitive world of traditional Chinese religion in which Buddhist, Taoist, and popular gods are always interacting with one another. As a scholar of Chinese religion, I am interested in the ways narratives of Chinese deities become popular and spread across different contexts. The popularity of “Black Myth: Wukong” is the most recent example in a centuries-old tradition of retelling this story through popular media. Journey to the West was first published in 1592, but the stories were popular long before that. As scholar of Chinese literature Anthony Yu notes, the various tales describing Xuanzong and Sun Wukong’s adventures existed for nearly 1,000 years before they were collected and published in Journey to the West. People in traditional China would hear many of these adventures through oral storytelling, but also through various media such as dramatic performances, poetic tales, and short stories. Traveling opera troupes were one of the most popular ways to tell Sun Wukong’s tale. Professional actors would perform tales of Sun Wukong’s exploits through dramatic renditions coupled with acrobatic fight scenes and dazzling displays of martial arts. These entertaining performances would disseminate information about the gods to both literate and illiterate audiences all throughout China. Stories of Sun Wukong’s mischievous, and often irreverent, behavior made their rounds throughout traditional Chinese society. The monkey hero’s brash attempts at subverting authority and picking fights with divine characters cemented his place as a popular cultural icon. As scholar of Chinese religions Meir Shahar notes, novels such as Journey to the West served as a way to define and transmit an entire pantheon of deities all across the various regions of traditional China. In so doing, these forms of media would reflect the dynamic world of Chinese religion and, at the same time, help shape the way people would come to understand the stories of their own gods. Many of the characters who appear in Journey to the West come directly out of the Chinese pantheon. Guanyin, the Buddhist deity of compassion and one of the most popular gods across East Asia, has her struggles against Sun Wukong; Taoist figures, such as the deified Lao-tzu, the purported author of the Taoist classic Tao Te Ching, battles with the monkey, and ancient Chinese deities like the Queen Mother to the West and the Jade Emperor play a prominent role as authority figures throughout the story. Sun Wukong also battles localized gods like the martial deity Erlang. Many of these figures are also referenced throughout the video game, while some, like Erlang, appear as “bosses” who need to be defeated before moving on to the next level. In the novel, the gods work together to stand in the way of Sun Wukong, representing the authority of the Chinese pantheon. At the same time, Sun Wukong often gets the better of the gods, either through trickery or martial prowess. Eventually, the authority of the gods wins out, with the monkey trapped under the mountain. Yet, this is not the end of Sun Wukong. As the recent release of the video game demonstrates, it is but one more beginning to the monkey’s story. While the game is careful not to promote any one religious identity, the cultural source for these compelling characters remains deeply rooted in the long history of Chinese religions. Today’s gamers get to encounter aspects of Chinese culture in a whole new way. Players who may be unfamiliar with Sun Wukong’s character from the novel can still see Sun Wukong flip in the air, brandish his weapons and defeat his enemies with dramatic flair. Only now the gamer gets to perform these feats through their connection with the video game’s hero. While the gaming experience may be relatively new, enjoying tales of the gods is very old.

    "title": "American Food Traditions That Started as Marketing Ploys",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/american-food-traditions-that-started-as-marketing-ploys",
    "description": "This article is adapted from the September 28, 2024, edition of Gastro Obscura’s Favorite Things newsletter. You can sign up here. Growing up in suburban New England, fluffernutters—two slices of white bread slathered with peanut-butter and marshmallow goop—were a lunchbox staple for many of my classmates. For the elementary school set, it’s a pretty optimal snack, one that fully dispenses with the vague pretense of fruit in a PB\u0026J in favor of a maximum sugar rush. The combination has been a cult fixture in the northeast for more than a century. We know it’s not good per se, but it holds a place of perverse regional pride that only comes from nostalgia. In 2006, when Massachusetts Senator Jarret Barrios proposed legislation that would forbid schools from serving fluffernutters more than once a week, it caused such a public uproar that Democratic Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein declared, “I’m going to fight to the death for Fluff.” Although Reinstein’s bill to make the fluffernutter the official state sandwich of Massachusetts remains in legal limbo, the word “fluffernutter” has since been added to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. There’s also a Fluffernutter Day (on October 8th) as well as an annual What the Fluff? festival held in Somerville, Massachusetts, with events including “fluff jousting” and “fluff hairdo” (it’s exactly as messy as it sounds). As a kid, I just assumed some other pre-teen had come up with the ingenious idea of smuggling dessert to school in sandwich form. But in reality, the fluffernutter began as a marketing ploy. Emma Curtis, who co-founded the Curtis Marshmallow Company with her brother, first created a recipe for “Liberty Sandwiches” made with peanut butter and their trademarked Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1918. The creme was essentially the same as marshmallows, but minus the gelatin needed for the amorphous mass of corn syrup and egg whites to hold a solid shape.Curtis may have come up with the sandwich, but credit for its key ingredient belongs elsewhere. Joseph Archibald Query, a Canadian living in Somerville, Massachusetts, invented Marshmallow Fluff the year prior, only to sell it in 1920 to the Durkee-Mower candy company when wartime sugar rationing made it too tough to make a profit. Durkee-Mower tried all sorts of tactics to promote Marshmallow Fluff, including a 1930s radio show with dancing girls called the Flufferettes. Then when the 1960s rolled around, a branding agency helped them come up with the term “fluffernutter.” Thanks to a nationwide ad campaign, the name and the sandwich stuck. And that’s hardly the only beloved American food tradition born out of marketing. “Modern American culture is just essentially a product of advertising,” says Christina Ward, author of American Advertising Cookbooks: How Corporations Taught Us to Love Bananas, Spam, and Jell-O. Even most of the Norman Rockwell-esque Thanksgiving spread was born in American test kitchens belonging to General Mills (the faceless entity behind Betty Crocker), Campbell’s, and other corporations. In the early 20th century through the post-war years, Madison Avenue and the increasingly large food conglomerates it repped reshaped the ways in which Americans ate. Here are just a few of the foods and holiday traditions that resulted from that partnership. Peanut Butter and Mayonnaise Sandwiches If a fluffernutter strikes you as pedestrian, try this Depression-era PB\u0026M. Cheap and calorically dense, the unlikely combo was probably born out of real desperation, but it was later seized on by Best Foods, which in the 1950s acquired both Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter. A 1963 ad read, “Skippy and Hellmann’s … together tremendous!”“It came out of that time when all the food companies were amalgamated through all these mergers and acquisitions,” Ward says. “Their advertising, marketing departments, and development test kitchens were charged with, ‘Now we own five different food brands of different things—figure out a way that a consumer can use them all.’”The post-war era saw the rise of the latchkey kid, who might hold down the fort while mom was at her ladies’ club or work. And a peanut butter and mayo sandwich was simple enough that a child could slap it together sans adult supervision after school. “Just conceptually, the whole idea of an after-school snack came out of advertising cookbooks,” Ward says. “And here’s a snack they can make for themselves.” Green Bean Casserole It’s not a coincidence that Campbell’s condensed soups started cropping up in recipes for everything from cakes to casseroles in the mid-20th century. The company distributed recipes claiming that harried housewives could make their lives easier by swapping a canned product for a homemade béchamel sauce. Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup debuted in 1934 and quickly became the default base for tuna noodle casserole, turkey tetrazzini, and even Mormon-style funeral potatoes. Minnesota’s tater tot-loaded hotdish also incorporated cream of mushroom base, which earned the soup a nickname: “the Lutheran binder.”But the one that really takes the cake is green bean casserole, composed of only six ingredients, three of which are canned Campbell’s products. In 1955, Dorcas Reilly invented the recipe for a “Green Bean Bake” in the company’s test kitchen and the rest is history.“They marketed it specifically around Thanksgiving to try and tie it to holiday celebrations,” Ward says. “And sure enough, people did it.” Lemon Pigs In 2017, Anna Pallai, author of 70s Dinner Party: The Good, the Bad and the Downright Ugly of Retro Food convinced her Twitter followers to recreate lemon pigs from a 1971 book as a New Year charm for good luck. These portable porkers are the most foolproof of crafting projects. Each lemon gets four toothpicks for legs, two cloves for eyes, and a curly aluminum foil tail. A penny protrudes from its mouth like an ancient Greco-Roman corpse prepared to cross the River Styx.Recipes for lemon pigs, possibly a nod to German Glücksschwein (sugar pigs thought to bring good luck on New Year's Eve) date back to the 19th century, but the recipe Pallai referenced was derived from 401 Party and Holiday Ideas from Alcoa—a cookbook by an aluminum foil company.Gimmick or not, lemon pigs are something of a Gastro Obscura tradition. You can see our writer Andrew Coletti demonstrating how to make one here. Pineapple Upside Down Cake Ever wonder why 1950s American suburbanites suddenly got so excited about throwing torch-lit, Hawaiian-themed bashes in the backyard? “Dole is specifically responsible for creating this notion of summer picnic luaus for everybody,” Ward says.In 1922, Dole Food Company bought the Hawaiian island of Lānaʻi and converted 20,000 acres into pineapple plantations, giving them a near monopoly on the fruit in the United States.That meant the company had serious incentive to push pineapples everywhere, from Dole Whip, the iconic soft-serve sold at Disney theme parks, to all sorts of recipes designed to turn a backyard in Illinois into a pan-Polynesian tiki fantasy for an evening. “That idea that every place can be Hawai’i for a party came directly from [Dole],” Ward says. Along with that came the idea that canned pineapple could add an exotic flair to literally any dish. In 1925, Dole held a competition for recipes using their product and pineapple upside down cake took the top prize.Inverted, skillet-baked butter cakes with fruit had been around since the late 19th century, but this maraschino-crowned confection took the country by storm—thanks to an aggressive promotional push, of course. German Christmas Pickles It was only after I moved back to the United States from Berlin that I heard about a Weihnachtsgurke, or the “Christmas pickle.” Fashioned in the shape of a fat kosher dill, these ornaments can be found hanging on Christmas trees in Michigan and pockets of the Midwest. Allegedly, they’re a tradition brought over by German immigrants and whoever finds the lucky pickle bags an extra present.Confused, I asked a handful of Germans about tree pickles, and they hadn’t heard of them either. According to legend, a Bavarian soldier fighting in the American Civil War requested a pickle on his deathbed and it magically cured him. An alternate tale claims that the people of Spreewald, a town outside Berlin known for its prolific pickle production, brought the concept over. If both explanations sound suspiciously hokey, that’s probably because Woolworths most likely invented this quirky “ethnic” tradition in the 1800s to sling holiday kitsch. Perhaps my favorite element of the pickle tale is that word has gotten back to Germany, where a number of bemused publications have pondered the dubious origins of the tradition.",

    "title": "Who Is Baba Yaga?",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/who-is-baba-yaga",
    "description": "Excerpted and adapted with permission from Becoming Baba Yaga: Trickster, Feminist, and Witch of the Woods, by Kris Spisak, published September 2024 by Hampton Roads Publishing. All rights reserved. When my grandmother was a little girl and took a shortcut through the woods, she kept her head down. The pine needle path before her feet held her full attention. Birdsong tittered and warbled in the branches overhead. The shadows of horse chestnut and silver birch leaves fell in patches, then blankets, then shrouds. But nothing tempted her attention away from her path until she returned to the sunshine. Baba Yaga, the witch of the Eastern European forests, was real to my grandmother. As a child, she knew without a doubt in her mind that Baba Yaga preyed upon the young, especially those who didn’t listen, those who broke the rules, those who lived by their own internal compass. What was an imperfect girl to do? My mother was born across the ocean from Baba Yaga’s woods but not her influence. The old witch’s presence lingered in threats about straying into the darkness, in sharp words about manners and obedience. As for me, I always considered the familiar Slavic witch a good tale, an echo of my Ukrainian roots not so different from kolomyka circle dances and traditions of pysanky eggs at Easter. She was simply there, on the periphery. However, Baba Yaga has remained a presence in my mind. The old woman, with her legs as skinny as bones, lives deep in the woods in a hut that stands on chicken feet. The structure turns and moves as it likes, but especially away from those who seek to find her. Baba Yaga’s broom isn’t for flying but for sweeping away her tracks. She is rumored to eat her victims for supper if she thinks they deserve it, but she also features in tales of reluctant kindness, of mentorship, and of fairy godmother-like grace. Isn’t it time we all knew her for who she is? Folktale traditions can be difficult to explore, because how does one capture the whispers at bedtime or recollections told back and forth among family and friends, all of which have been built upon centuries and centuries of tellers? There is good; there is evil. Then there is Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga’s identity drifts one direction then another between places and times, but by traveling back into history and crossing her many inhabited lands, we can gather a better understanding of who she may have been, at least to some tellers of her tales. From John Wick to Catherine the Great In contemporary popular culture, her name and character appear more frequently than we realize. The codename of Keanu Reeves’s titular character in the John Wick series is “Baba Yaga” within the dark organization where he operates. Hellboy comics and Dreamworks’ Puss in Boots introduce her as a character. Malware has been named after her. In a 1979 hand-drawn cartoon created by a Soviet-owned film studio, Baba Yaga and her accomplices tried to block the Olympic mascot, Misha the Bear, from playing in the Games. Because the 1980 Moscow Olympics were boycotted by 66 countries, led by the United States, Baba Yaga’s role as interfering nuisance is considered a metaphor for the moment, her bumbling, destructive behaviors a parallel to Soviet impressions of the U.S. Of course, Baba Yaga was a common figure in Soviet-era cartoons from the 1930s onward, often serving the morality tale trope to her young audiences: Be good and follow the rules of a well-organized society or else Baba Yaga will eat you! Baba Yaga was known by the Czech version of her name, Ježibaba, in Antonín Dvořák’s opera Rusalka, which was first performed in Prague in 1901. She has one of the best-known witch arias in operatic history, luring in the listener as she offers aid true to her dark forest roots. Slavic fairy tale collector Vasilii Levshin (1746-1826) is considered the first to capture Baba Yaga stories in writing. And we cannot ignore the 1788 comedic opera, “Baba Yaga,” by Prince Dmitry Gorchakov and Mathias Stabingher. Designed for Catherine the Great’s royal court, the ancient witch’s complex portrayal on stage makes me long to see this performance as it once was. Before the final curtain, Baba Yaga remains the sole character in the spotlight. Was she hunched, clenching a giant pestle? Was she dressed in rags or a gown as black as the dark forests of Russia? So many details are lost to history, even as we do know Baba Yaga closed the show with a solo about a better world that could come to be. Terror. Hideousness. Hope. Possibility. Yes, this is Baba Yaga, the witch, the motivational sorceress, sharing a lesson and a hint of optimism for audiences to take home. But like someone journeying deeper into the woods, weaving between peeling birch trunks and thorns reaching out to pierce us, we must creep beyond the easily accessible written records of history and published creativity. We must track her to places where the forest’s onyx shadows are no different from the raven-inspired hues of night, where owls call no matter the hour, reminding us not to approach with demands but with the respect such an ancient elder surely deserves. Without Comparison Among the Gods In her earliest known written record, Mikhail W. Lomonosov’s 1755 Russian Grammar, Baba Yaga was noted in a table where gods, goddesses, and other deities of the world were connected with notes on their geography. The ancient Slavic god Perun, for example, was related with the Roman god Jupiter. Yet in this first textual documentation, Baba Yaga stood unaccompanied, with no comparisons the world over. She might have won me over in this detail alone, but let’s pause here for a moment. This Russian grammar book is the beginning of her written legacy, but she’s clearly known to the population that may have encountered her there. Her first known written record is hardly an introduction. She’s named among the pantheons of gods and goddesses, no insignificant reputation. Earlier still, woodblock prints known as lubki, popular in the 1600s and 1700s, are our earliest known confirmed representations of her. These decorations, originally fashioned from the carveable layer of wood under the bark of linden trees, hung in the households of those who could not afford more expensive icons. Commonly sold for only a kopek or two, these simple prints were inked with a mixture of soot and burnt sienna boiled in linseed oil. They told stories, even to those who could not read. Lubki captured biblical tales, historical events, and yes, folktales well known and well treasured. According to this artistic record, Baba Yaga was already a familiar character in this time period as well, able to stand on her own pictorially and be clearly identifiable, a familiar presence in the lives and memories of Slavic people across the regions of present-day Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Slovakia, Belarus, and beyond. Was she connected with the Siberian bird goddess, known as a midwife? Her beak-like nose and her hut’s chicken legs may pay their own subtle homage. Was she linked with another ancient Slavic goddess, tied to the underworld and known to be seated in an iron mortar like a throne, iron pestle in her hands? The relationship is far too palpable to ignore. Do her roots lie in tales of Ježibaba, associated not with the collection of children’s bones after eating them but with the collection of baby teeth? Or should we examine the connection with the ancient being that carried the wisdom of time? She was believed to partner with Death as souls transitioned to the opposite side. Sure, “partner with death” sounds a touch macabre, but when wrapping our minds around the persona who guides souls as they enter life and as they leave it, this last role is among the most profound of all, no? These goddesses, terrors, and traditions are all likely connections, fragments that rebuild and reshatter to create the disjointed and bewildering existence Baba Yaga has held in minds for centuries. Some scholars even trace Baba Yaga’s roots to the pre-Indo-European matrilinear pantheon, and logic exists in these foundations. Is her broom made of birch because birch trees are known as “the mother tree,” associated with fertility for centuries? Does this association arise from the tale of how birches were the first saplings that grew after the Ice Age, bringing life back after a frozen, desolate existence? Is it true? I don’t know, but wow is that a good story. One of my favorite approaches to classic tales is in the tradition of the Ukrainian literary master, Lesya Ukrainka, who reimagined well known tales with new parallels and purposes. I mill Baba Yaga tales with a modern eye, as if I had a mortar and pestle of my own, grinding wheat berries down to bran and flour, crushing freshly picked herbs to release their oils and essence. Recipes, medicines, and cocktails are known to transform with muddling. Stories do, too. How did Baba Yaga become Baba Yaga, and what does the old woman still have to say to us? Let’s find out. The Birth of Baba Yaga The devil determined the essence of evil must walk the earth. So he set out to find his ingredients. In a foreign market, a shriek of rage snared his attention. A woman berated a man twice her size as she stepped in front of her children. The devil swept up the woman for his bag. Across the globe in a schoolhouse surrounded by fields of swaying wheat, a classroom bully stood up to challenge the teacher. Yet the teacher’s eyes narrowed and pierced the self-assured gaze of her pupil, sending him back to his desk. The devil liked what he saw and swept the teacher up. He swept up a woman, the smartest in a room of arguing voices, who didn’t speak up to share the answers she knew; a woman who punched hard when a stranger pressed a hand to her skin; and another who screamed when a man told her to smile. A woman clutching wolfsbane, a wife steeping oleander tea, a green-thumbed gardener who nurtured her bougainvillea full of thorns, a widow who ran her fingers through her gray-rooted hair until it stood up on end, and another who unabashedly cursed and swore and raised her glass again with no shame. A woman who followed her gut, ignoring the advice given. A grandmother that cackled with joy as she slammed her door on the modern world, preferring her mortar and pestle, her woodfire stove, and the blissful silence that came when technology and its constant interruptions disappeared. The devil dumped his bag of 12 women into a massive cauldron, muddling them in water from an iced-over stream. The fire underneath crackled. The water bubbled then boiled. A clamminess filled the air of the little hut where he did his work, a hut that began to lurch and pull like it wanted to flee. Who would dare correct the devil? Then the devil took a giant breath and filled his lungs with the women’s steam, a taste like beets or onions or garlic or fire. He took in as much as his immortal body could hold. He held it in for scarcely a second, enough to feel its fury and fight. Then he spit it out. And there before him stood Baba Yaga, the essence of malevolence, from the most evil beings on earth. Or so supposed he. And who would dare correct the devil? While “The Tale of the 12 Nasty Women,” as this narrative is commonly referred to, speaks of Baba Yaga’s own creation, the original doesn’t share any details of the women captured within the devil’s bag. These additions are my own. Still, the mere existence of this story is worth a moment more of our attention. The idea that 12 women combined could potentially be evil itself is at once intriguing and disturbing. However, almost all stories have secrets hiding within, and this one has three. “Baba Yaga, the Bony Leg” was the name of the full poem by Nikolay Alexandrovich Nekrasov that was among the first to include this devil spit story. While Nekrasov’s version could be based on older traditions, few records or hints of this tale are known before his time. Thus, its late addition into the Baba Yaga canon in 1840 doesn’t add any historical weight to this conversation. Nekrasov wasn’t a folklorist doing deep academic research in the area. He was a storyteller. He had a really good story—one that caught on like skull-lantern fire—but when considering Baba Yaga’s lifetime, 1840 was practically last week. So secret number one: Origin stories don’t always come first, and later storytellers don’t always realize the discrepancy. So why start here if the story of the 12 women is clearly late in Baba Yaga’s own character timeline? Well, two more revelations hide in this story’s subtext. Did you notice the existence of the devil in this story? Of course you did. He was right there boiling the women and spitting them out, wasn’t he? The devil’s mere presence speaks to Christianity’s entrance into a region filled with folk practices and different belief systems. The devil had never been a part of Baba Yaga’s stories in their earliest tellings. As Slavic gods, goddesses, and rituals were confronted with a different religion that dared to extricate ancient beliefs and replace them, stories clashed as much as people. The divine feminine was recast as the personification of evil because a patriarchal lens shifted the narrative. Baba Yaga was never originally in cahoots with the devil—the devil is a Christian character. Slavic populations began to encounter Christian priests and monks in approximately the seventh century, and between these first encounters and the 12th century, many aspects of the Christian faith were indeed embraced by great numbers of people. But that didn’t mean that ancient rituals ceased. The faiths intermingled. Inherited traditions lingered over time, even when gods, goddesses, and the original mythology itself disappeared with the memories of passing generations. Vestiges of the past transformed into demonized relics or were absorbed into new mythologies. Let’s return to the secrets of the 12 evil women. Their existence as an origin story is murky. Their plot reminds us that Christianity’s entrance into Baba Yaga’s world recast everything. Rumors linger that young Nikolay Alexandrovich Nekrasov was once asked to leave school early in his education for writing satires of his teachers. Oh little, Nikolay. Did you really? And was this the beginning of it all? All grown up and ready to take on the world with his pen, Nekrasov wrote collections of folktales in verse early in his career—hello, Baba Yaga—but the poetry that is widely considered his greatest literary achievement holds reverberations of his early efforts mocking authority. Nekrasov’s 1879 narrative poem “Who Can Be Happy and Free in Russia?” had the same fighting, kicking, devil’s-spit-filled spirit of Baba Yaga in its own way. Thus, perhaps we shouldn’t condemn him for his creation of the vat of 12 evil women at all. My own retelling might seize upon one more secret: his original sardonic purpose. Who’s to say a storyteller’s true intention? Baba Yaga’s ever-evolving existence certainly has us asking this question time after time.",

    "title": "7 Stories That Show Just How Metal the Nordics Are",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/viking-and-nordic-stories",
    "description": "The Nordics, also known as Norden, include Greenland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, and Finland. These lands are home to some of the most badass historical characters, festivals, and culinary curiosities. Bone chewing, werewolf hunting, and feasts of rotten meats are all fair game among Nordic communities of the past—and sometimes the present. Take a trip to Viking hell, sail fearlessly into the unknown, or dig into some exceptional eats with these seven metal stories from across the Nordic world. Viking Hell Is Just as Metal as You’d Expect by Nicky Nielsen Courageous Vikings who died in battle could expect to head off to Odin’s Hall, Valhǫll (or Valhalla), and there feast with the gods for all eternity or, according to some sources, be chosen by Freja, the goddess of love, to live in the sweet meadows of Folkvangr. But many more Vikings died off the battlefield, done in by disease, malnutrition, and other inglorious ends. While our understanding of what ordinary Vikings could expect in the afterlife is limited, what we do know is rather bleak. How Are These Trees Floating Over a Finnish Road? by Andrea Prada Bianchi In June 1941, a young photographer captured a surreal scene: A Finnish Army car on a dirt road a few miles from the border with the Soviet Union. Above the vehicle, a row of pine trees hangs in the air. It's not a prank or trick of the camera, however. During World War II, when Finland occupied a difficult place in the conflict between Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, it was common for the army to camouflage everything with trees and foliage to deceive Russian planes and observation towers. The First Viking Woman to Sail to America Was a Legendary Traveler by Frank Jacobs She’s been called “the greatest female explorer of all time,” and the “best-traveled woman of the Middle Ages.” Just after the year 1000, she gave birth to the first European baby in North America. And she concluded her global odyssey with a pilgrimage on foot to Rome. Yet few today can name this extraordinary Viking lady, Gudrid the Far-Traveled, even if they have heard of her father-in-law Erik the Red and brother-in-law Leif Erikson. Ancient Gum Reveals Stone-Age Teens Chewed on Bones and Made Poison by Olivia Young Our ancient forebears chewed gum just like us—except their version of “gum” was actually a tarry tree resin, and we can be sure it tasted nothing like Wrigley’s Doublemint. Samples of this birch pitch still embedded with 10,000-year-old tooth marks were discovered in Sweden several decades ago, but a recent study has revealed more about what the prehistoric teenagers ate, along how they used their teeth as tools. The Long, Hidden History of the Viking Obsession With Werewolves by Sarah Durn The story of thieves-turned-werewolves Sigmundr and Sinfjötli is one of the Viking world’s oldest and most popular tales, shared orally for centuries before being written down in the Vǫlsunga Saga around 1270. It turns out the Vikings were a bit obsessed with wolves and the people—in stories, anyway—who become them. There are records of dozens of werewolf stories told around Viking hearths to help pass long, dark Scandinavian winters. Wolves, such as the world-ending Fenrir, are woven into their mythology. Viking warrior bands would growl and howl and bite in battle, and sometimes even attack their compatriots in their frenzy. It’s something victims of Viking raids also saw in the Norsemen who descended on them from the seas; they referred to them as “sea-wolves” and “ware-wolves” in medieval histories. Even after the raids stopped, popular stories linked Viking descendants to werewolves. Thorrablot: This Midwinter Food Festival Honors Iceland's Pagan History from Gastro Obscura Before the 10th century, Icelanders worshiped the Æsir, or Norse gods. During their calendar month of Thorri (which runs from mid-January to mid-February), locals celebrated Thorrablot, a midwinter festival named for either Norwegian king Thorri Snærsson or the God of Thunder himself, Thor. Locals still mark the occasion with traditional Thorrablot foods. Smoked, salted, dried, pickled, and rotten meats are the star of the show, including traditional favorites such as pickled ram’s testicles, rotten shark meat (hákarl), boiled sheep’s head (svið), dung-smoked lamb (hangikjöt), and wind-dried white fish (harðfiskur). For folks with less adventurous tastes, smoked salmon, sausages, rye bread, and flatbread are also on the menu. Participants wash it all down with brennivín, a potent local liquor that’s fondly referred to as “Black Death.” Unearthing the Secret Life of a Viking Warrior Woman by Sarah Durn In 1871 on the sleepy island of Birka, Sweden, Hjalmar Stolpe, a Swedish entomologist turned archaeologist, discovered the lavish grave of a Viking warrior. Around the seated body were the remains of two sacrificed horses, as well as a double-edged sword, a scramasax (a long, thin knife), a bow, a shield, and a spear—every weapon known to the Viking world. It was an astonishing find, especially since Viking warrior graves rarely contain more than three weapons. There was also a full set of hnefatafl, the board game often known as Viking chess, which indicates the strategic thinking and authority of a war leader. A thousand years ago, the site would’ve abutted the Warrior’s Hall, where a garrison lived to protect the bustling Viking town of Birka. The weapons, game pieces, location: Everything told scholars that the man buried in what is known as grave Bj 581 was a prominent, well-respected Viking warrior. No one was really prepared when DNA tests were conducted in 2017 and a new story began to emerge. This was a prominent warrior, all right, but the occupant of Bj 581 wasn’t a man. She was a woman.",

    "title": "10 Fascinating Festivals in Galveston, Texas",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/10-fascinating-festivals-in-galveston-texas",
    "description": "On Galveston Island, the festival scene is more than a single-season affair. Summer is a popular time to visit the Texas island, pulling crowds to beautiful beaches and sand dunes around its 32-mile coast. But ask the locals, and they’ll tell you that a vibrant public life can be found year-round here, thanks to sunny, mild temps keeping the social calendar busy in any season. Galveston’s storied history, as both a busy immigrant port and the birthplace of Juneteenth, certainly sets the festival stage. On top of that, it seems that residents simply love any occasion to entertain. Historical circumstances like the 1900 Great Storm in Galveston, the deadliest U.S. natural disaster to date, have shaped a local character that is resilient, celebratory, and grateful for any excuse to get together.Galveston’s festivals vary widely, from sand sculpting to prawn feasts and art parties, yet they all keep a family-friendly, community-oriented vibe. Southern hospitality and laid-back island life keep the good times rolling. From Victorian-era traditions to festive holiday extravaganzas, there is a celebration here for everyone. Here are 10 festivals in Galveston you should check out during your next visit. Fat Texas Tuesday 1. Mardi Gras Galveston Island’s Mardi Gras celebrations, the third-largest (and one of the oldest) in the U.S., turn out costumes and pageantry with beachy Texan vibes. Every year, around 250,000 partygoers descend onto Galveston to celebrate grand parades and masquerade balls defined by Lone Star sociability. What began in 1867 as a single masked ball has evolved into a celebration showcasing Texan and Gulf Coast traditions. Galveston’s Mardi Gras puts on more than 20 parades in over-the-top fashion with elaborate floats, marching bands, and street performances across the city. Not to be missed is the “Umbrella Brigade Parade”, a Galveston Mardi Gras original, where parasols of all kinds—decorated and designed—are paraded through the streets, often with some fancy choreography. Time Warp 2. Dickens on The Strand At the turn of the century, Galveston, a booming port city, was known for its wealthy high society’s obsession with Victorian England. To celebrate this cultural heritage, Galveston Island hosts Dickens on The Strand every year. The Victorian-themed Christmas festival sees the Strand Historic District’s 19th-century architecture become a scene straight out of turn-of-the-century London. Locals parade through the streets in Victorian-era garb, British-inspired attire, and holiday finery—think a sea of Charles Dickens characters, Queens of England, and Father Christmases, mingling with marching nutcrackers and high-flying Union Jacks. Live entertainment includes caroling, storytelling, and dancing, while vendors sell era-inspired goodies and demonstrate traditional crafts like blacksmithing and glass blowing. Most highly anticipated, though, are the Victorian Bed Races. This beloved event sees teams dressed in old-timey nighties race elaborately decorated beds down the street. It’s a silly tradition, but don’t be fooled: it’s also a competition taken very seriously, with a whole list of rules including many bed specifications. Of course, the best time wins. Survey the Scene 3. ArtWalk Every six to eight weeks, ArtWalk is a Galveston event to look forward to. At this bustling crafting and creativity market, usually hosted on Saturday evenings, local artists showcase and sell their handmade creations. There are trinkets galore, but also larger mixed-media works from paintings to sculptures and photography prints. The atmosphere is always friendly and sociable, with artists chatting about their inspirations and brainstorming special commissions with eager visitors. On the sidelines of the art market, Galveston Island’s downtown historic district turns into a pop-up public gallery. Numerous art institutions and studios, especially those in the Postoffice Street Arts District, fling their doors open for free-entry art parties. The Galveston Arts Center (GAC), located nearby on The Strand, is usually a surefire bet for a great cultural program. More local boutiques and restaurants also join in on the fun, hosting live music, pop-up art shows, and the like. Since ArtWalk is often timed to accompany other events like Dickens on The Strand and Mardi Gras, you may be able to hit up two Galveston festivals in one. Cutting Edge Christmas 4. Holiday in The Gardens At Galveston’s Holiday in the Gardens festival, Christmas cheer goes into innovative overdrive. Moody Gardens, a multi-purpose outdoor park overrun with lush tropical greenery, transforms into a winter wonderland with countless cutting-edge holiday displays. The main event, the Festival of Lights, creates a twinkle-filled fantasy with over two million lights and immersive experiences. Visitors stroll along a mile-long trail, illuminated across animations brought to life with holiday music and other sound effects. Instagrammable chillout areas, like hot chocolate stands and s’more stops, are sprinkled throughout. There’s also ICE LAND’s extraordinary labyrinth of ice sculptures, ranging from life-sized buildings to cartoon characters and even a gigantic ice slide. Ice-carving masters from Harbin, China—globally renowned for incredible ice festivals—use over two million pounds of ice to create intricate, amazing displays. Every winter, a fresh theme ensures the sculpture park’s loyal fan base shows up for the spectacle. Elsewhere across Moody Gardens, even more winter-themed attractions promise wholesome holiday fun. Christmas films are shown with special effects (think classics like Rudolph with real blowing snow in a gingerbread-scented theater); there’s also a holiday market, ice bar, and ice rink. Birthplace of a Holiday 5. Juneteenth Festival Since 2021, Juneteenth has been designated a federal holiday that’s celebrated across the U.S. However, for many families in Galveston, Texas—where the Juneteenth tradition originated—annual June 19th celebrations have been cherished over generations. Every year, the holiday marks the 1865 arrival of Union troops in Galveston to announce the end of slavery in Texas, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Locally, Juneteenth fuses together historical remembrance with street parties, prayers, and more. Readings of General Order No. 3, the decree ending slavery, are read around the city, especially at Juneteenth monuments, of which there are over 200 in Galveston. There’s also a parade with colorful floats, live bands, dancers, and reenactments, as well as a sophisticated black-tie Juneteenth gala. Beyond the annual festival, Juneteenth discovery is a year-round affair in Galveston. Visitors can explore the historical moment’s enduring legacy through guided walks and self-guided tours. There’s also an abundance of fascinating art and archival exhibits open year-round. Art Walk 6. ARToberFEST In Galveston, October is synonymous with creative energy thanks to ARToberFEST. The juried fine art festival, started almost 30 years ago by local visual artists and business owners, is now hosted by The Grand 1894 Opera House’s non-profit. The outdoor festival sees the downtown Postoffice Street Arts District become an open-air atelier with over 120 artists from across the U.S. on display. Spirits stay high across rows of booths showcasing a vast array of mediums: metal, glass and textile work, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, and more. Aside from all the eye candy, the festival’s lively atmosphere includes live music, food trucks, and hands-on artsy activities for all ages. Above all, though, the allure of ARToberFEST is how it brings together artistic expression and community engagement, creating a space for artists to network, and for new fans to find them. Seafood- Palooza 7. Galveston Island Shrimp Festival The Galveston Island Shrimp Festival offers up the flying buffet of a shellfish lover’s dreams. Every September, it celebrates the rich local culture of Southern-style cooking and the Gulf Coast’s seafood bounties with vendor stands and high-pressure culinary showdowns. Fried shrimp, po’boys, scampi, shrimp Creole, shrimp tacos—you name it, you’ll find it served hot and fresh at the festival. There’s also the chance to try different sizes and species of shrimp, including the white and brown varieties which are native to the Gulf Coast. Two highly anticipated events take place each year: first, the Friday kickoff with a Texas-sized fried shrimp dinner for over 800 guests. Not to be outdone, though, is the shrimp gumbo cook-off where restaurants and amateur chefs compete in various categories, putting kitchen techniques and family recipes to the test. Seaside Fantasy 8. Galveston Revue Weekend Time-warp back to the golden age of Galveston as the “Coney Island of the South” at the annual Galveston Revue Weekend. This event, beloved by locals, brings together vintage dress-up and antique appreciation to remember the seaside resort’s 1920s and 1930s heyday as the “Playground of the Southwest”. Every May, the Beach Revue comprises a classic car show, vendors selling retro goods, and nostalgic live music. And the headliner? The famed Bathing Beauties Contest which is said to be the genesis of the U.S. swimsuit pageant phenomenon. Galveston’s tradition blends Southern sass and retro fashion as participants flaunt classic swimwear, parasols, vintage swimming caps, and other accessories. Go Bird or Go Home 9. FeatherFest \u0026 Nature PhotoFest Galveston's annual springtime celebration, FeatherFest \u0026 Nature PhotoFest, is a big deal for bird lovers and nature photographers. The festival attracts outdoors and wildlife enthusiasts from near and far for a week of diverse activities including birdwatching tours, camera workshops, and expert-led educational seminars. Galveston’s position along a major migratory flyway makes it an ideal location for birders to gather. Field trips are focused on a diverse range of species or specific ecosystems, providing opportunities for those just starting out as birders, as well as those longtime enthusiasts looking to spot rare species and truly nerd out. Anyone can come and spread their wings into the scene. FeatherFest also features kids’ activities and painting workshops, plus the chance to bid on nature artists’ unique works. Super Sand Art 10. Galveston Sandcastle Festival The Galveston Sandcastle Competition is a true social media sensation. Every year, the festival is responsible for sand sculptures ranging from gorgeous to gargantuan and gravity-defying. The competition features over 60 teams vying for the prestigious Golden Bucket Award. Spectators come out in droves to watch participants sculpt over five intense hours under the sweaty sun, and afterwards, the sand creations are judged, as well as oohed and ahhed at by thousands. Free sandcastle building ensures anyone can join in the fun. Live music, food trucks, and an epic Sunday brunch also add up for a lively, beach-blessed affair.",

    "title": "Tiquira",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/tiquira",
    "description": "Indigenous Brazilians have fermented alcoholic beverages from the cassava root for thousands of years. These beer-like beverages go by names like cauim, caxiri, and tarubá. Fermentation is an important step in cassava processing—the raw root has chemicals that can turn into cyanide in the human body. Native peoples found that a bit of human saliva and some naturally occurring yeast could eliminate these toxins and improve the nutritious value of the tuber. When the technology of distillation arrived to the Munim River region (now in Maranhão), locals who already drank lightly alcoholic cassava beverages began to distill them. Tiquira was born.  The name tiquira is likely derived from the Tupi word tykyre meaning \"to drip.\" But it is a curiosity that the spirit has flourished in only one Brazilian state, Maranhão. Margot Stinglwagner, founder of Guaaja Tiquira, the first modern brand to produce the spirit starting in 2016, says “It’s a spirit that is also unknown in Brazil. A few people have heard about tiquira—but usually only people who have gone to Maranhão once.” Accordingly, the state moved to declare the spirit as a piece of Cultural and Intangible Heritage in September 2023.  Part of the reason that tiquira has remained so isolated is that cachaça, Brazil’s rum, is far easier to produce. Because the rum comes from sugarcane, the sugar for fermentation is already there. “With cassava, you don’t have sugar,” Stinglwagner explains. “You must first transform the carbohydrates into sugar and then you can ferment and distill it.” To achieve this end, Guaaja Tiquira uses food enzymes instead of the traditional human saliva. Guaaja also differs from other distillers because they use full cassava roots where most tiquira moonshiners rely on processed farinha de mandioca, or cassava flour.  “The majority of people produce it illegally,” laughs Stinglwagner. “The state does nothing about it.” Outside of the urban center, tiquira is invariably a homemade product. Generally, tiquira makers don’t separate the \"heads\" (the first drops of liquor from a distillation, which contain harsher alcohols including toxic methanol and other pungent and volatile flavor compounds) from the \"tails\" (the final liquid produced from distillation, which has a low alcohol content and can have unwelcome bitter flavors), meaning the spirit is stronger and may contain more toxins and impurities. Some even macerate marijuana into the combined spirit to produce the doubly-illicit tiquiconha. Maranhenses believe that you cannot get wet or bathe after drinking tiquira, lest you become faint or dizzy. Zelinda Machado de Castro e Lima, one of the great chroniclers of folk culture in Maranhão, has recorded other traditions surrounding the drink. Firstly, it is typical to pierce a cashew with a toothpick and soak it in a glass of tiquira for several hours. It is then sucked as a sort of boozy lollipop. She also writes about the belief that those drinking coffee should avoid tiquira, while locals say that fishermen on the coast used the liquor to sanitize wounds incurred on the job.  Finally, there is the curious question of the color of tiquira. In the tourist markets of São Luís, the spirit is always blushing a translucent violet. “They say that the color of tiquira is from tangerine leaves, but we tried to do it and the color from the leaves is not stable,” says Stinglwagner. “It is also not a strong color. The norms and laws for tiquira prohibit the addition of the leaves.” The violet color may be artificial (perhaps from food dyes), but some tiquiras do have a citrusy flavor.  Tiquira today is still largely relegated to the world of moonshining, but with the government’s recognition of the spirit and new legitimate ventures like that of Guaaja Tiquira, Brazil could be seeing more of the cassava liquor outside of its home in Maranhão.  “All the people say to me, ‘What is this new spirit?,’” says Stinglwagner. “I say, ‘It’s not a new spirit, it’s the oldest spirit from Brazil.’” Know Before You Go Tiquira is widely available in the downtown markets of São Luís, Maranhão. Both the local Mercado Central and touristic Mercado das Tulhas have many vendors selling tiquira. The commercial brand, Guaaja Tiquira, is also available in São Luís at Empório Fribal, in addition to Copacabana Palace and Fairmont Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, and Mocotó Bar e Restaurante in São Paulo.",

    "title": "Maultaschen",
    "link": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/maultaschen",
    "description": "The origins of Germany’s Maultaschen are deliciously devious. Legend has it that, in the late Middle Ages, a lay brother named Jakob invented the stuffed pasta dumplings at the Maulbronn Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in 1147 by Cistercian monks in southwest Germany. One direct translation of Maultaschen is “mouth pockets,” though “Maul” could just as easily refer to Maulbronn. Maultaschen are usually square dumplings (though sometimes they're rolled) and can be fried in a pan or served in broth. Commonly described as Germany’s version of Italian ravioli, they allegedly emerged as a way to use up an unexpected bounty of meat that Brother Jakob stumbled upon in the forest outside the monastery walls. The twist? Although they abhorred waste, these monks weren’t allowed to eat the meat of four-legged animals, especially during the Catholic fasting period of Lent in the spring. So Brother Jakob minced the meat with herbs and onions and wrapped everything inside pasta dough, hiding the forbidden flesh from the eyes of his fellow monks—and even from the eyes of God. In Swabia, the region encompassing much of Baden-Württemberg and part of Bavaria where Maultaschen originated, one of the colloquial names for the food references this deception directly: Herrgottsbescheißerle means “little God-cheaters.” Everyone in Swabia has their version of the legend with more or less embellishment. Ludwig Nestler holds a master’s degree in heritage conservation and works for the State Palaces and Gardens of Baden-Württemberg, a government organization that oversees monuments like Maulbronn Monastery. His version of the tale includes a sack of stolen meat dropped in the woods by a fleeing thief, which inspires Brother Jakob’s trickery in the kitchen. But he acknowledges that there’s no undisputed “historically correct version” of how Maultaschen came to be. Similarly, everyone in Swabia has their own Maultaschen recipe, with unique ingredients for the minced filling, called Brät. “Traditionally the Brät is made from pork mixed with herbs, onions, and occasionally bread crumbs for texture and stability,” says Nestler. Swabia, however, “was a rather poor region with limited amounts of meat due to rather unfertile land, so being adaptive and innovative has always been a part of the people’s nature.” As Maultaschen became popular, fish and seasonal vegetables like spinach, carrots, beets, and mushrooms became common inclusions. Today, the European Union ties Maultaschen to Swabia with a Protected Geographical Indication, which lists required ingredients the authentic product should feature, but even the necessary inclusions are pretty loose, such as “pork and/or beef and/or veal” for meat Brät and “typical regional vegetables” for meat-free Brät. It speaks to the way the dumplings developed as subsistence food, used to stretch leftovers and reduce food waste. Today, Germans throughout the country enjoy Maultaschen in dozens of flavors in all seasons thanks to grocery stores that stock packaged varieties made by companies like Ditzingen-based Bürger, whose mascot, Erwin, is a Maultasche (the singular form of the plural Maultaschen). But the dumplings remain most popular in southern Germany. Maulbronn Monastery offers a special tour that pairs Maultaschen with wine from the monastery’s vineyards. And many locals, including Nestler’s family, still make them from scratch on special occasions—even during Lent, when meat might otherwise be off the menu. There’s no telling if it’s a fraud good enough to fool God, but it’s worth a shot.",

    "description": "In 1914, absinthe was outlawed in France. In the small mountain town of Pontarlier, the world capital of absinthe, the news devastated the livelihoods of thousands of local workers. Nearly all the town's distilleries closed their doors or relocated. But one producer, Distillerie Guy, remained open, all thanks to adaptation and innovation. Its bestselling drink, Pont (formally known as Pontarlier-Anis), was created as a result of the absinthe ban and remains a beloved classic at the distillery to this day. Pont was the invention of George and Armaund Guy, whose family distillery had been making absinthe since 1890. Following the nationwide ban, the distillers continued to use their absinthe recipe, with one key change: excluding the supposedly “madness-inducing” ingredient, thujone, and replacing it with green anise.  When poured, Pont is clear as the local mountain water it contains, turning to a cloud of white when diluted. It has a frosty freshness, not unlike the sensation of breathing after chewing on a mint, while whipping the tongue with a smooth licorice sweetness.  The licorice taste comes from the distillation of green anise, differentiating it from the star anise used in other anise spirits such as ouzo or pastis. Compared to those spirits, \"Pont is lighter, purer, more subtle,” says Sébastien Siredey, who works at Distillerie Guy. “It is distilled from natural ingredients. It is more haut-de-gamme than pastis.\" Pont also appears in a powerful local mixed drink known as the “Sapont.” The drink is a portmanteau that combines Pont with Sapin, the French word for “fir tree” that's also the name of another liquor produced by Distillerie Guy. Their Sapin is made from local fir trees that provide a sharp botanical flavor. A Sapont mingles together Sapin’s pine-green color and Pont’s snow white, with an icy coolness and wood-infused licorice warmth. As with absinthe, the strength of botanicals lends a slightly medicinal flavor to every bottle of Pont and Sapin. “We are the pharmacy of Pontarlier,” Siredey jokes. Absinthe, Pont’s troublesome predecessor, was in fact used for medicinal purposes, until it was popularized by French soldiers in the war in Algeria, who grew fond of it for more than its purported healing properties.  In 1988, France legalized the sale of absinthe (with regulated thujone levels), but did not allow producers to use the word “absinthe.” This odd stipulation was overturned in 2011 and absinthe made its formal return. But despite the notoriety of the “green fairy” Pont has remained a favorite among local connoisseurs.  When it comes to Distillery Guy, the workers prefer their signature liquor. “At apéro, it’s Pont,\" says Siredey. \"Not one of us drinks absinthe.”",

    "description": "Framed by sparkling blue sea and deep green pines, the less visited Adriatic islands of Zlarin and Prvić offer a mellow end of summer escapeThis tale of two islands – and a city – was not the usual Croatian island-hopping experience, say, from Split to Hvar and Brač. I set out to enjoy a quieter, more laid-back alternative farther north, where the overlooked city of Šibenik is the jumping-off point to a very different side of the Adriatic.First there’s Šibenik itself, which is still relatively devoid of the crowds you see in Croatia’s other coastal cities. Here you naturally gravitate towards the magnificent Unesco-listed St James Cathedral before checking out the cafe terraces on the Riva waterfront and the bars beside the fishing boats moored further up the quayside. Medieval St Michael’s Fortress and its 17th-century Venetian neighbours, St John’s and Barone, loom over the city, the latter two built to protect against Ottoman attacks. They have all been transformed into important cultural institutions – St Michael’s into an amphitheatre for concerts, St John’s an educational centre and cafe and Barone an open-air cinema with augmented-reality displays. Views of the city became even more impressive the higher I climbed to each fortress. Continue reading...",

Alongside the plump fruit and vegetables, drifts of cheese and butter paint the whole scene a deep cream, echoing the Provençal city’s warm limestone and light yellow plaster.Vincent van Gogh was drawn to yellow, which radiates from many of his best-known and best-loved paintings. The Yellow House was his home outside the city’s ramparts when he moved from Paris to Arles in 1888, hoping (and failing) to start an artists’ colony. It was a studio only in the summer, then furnished for living in the autumn. A new park nearby that he dubbed Poet’s Garden inspired pictures that burst with colourful and abundant growth.

The first is at the height of spring, when new leaves and woodland plants are at their most intensely green. The second is the point in autumn when the summer hues shift overnight and the woods take on a whole new coat. In Japanese there is a wonderful term for both, mikkaminumanosakura, meaning a moment of sudden, dramatic change. As we move deeper into autumn, we’re heading for one of these moments, and I’ll be out in the woods trying to catch it.I have spent much of the past two years travelling the length of the UK and Ireland exploring our relationship with trees and woodlands for a new book. I wandered in stunning beech groves in Oxford, pinewoods in the Highlands, ancient oaks in Wicklow and Atlantic rainforest in County Clare. Continue reading...",

Such forests are rare globally as well as in Britain. Not only can you observe the gorgeous autumn hues from the leaves of ash, birch and oak but you can see all manner of mosses, liverworts and lichens. The latter proliferate because of the clean air and wet climate. There are plenty of forest paths to follow – and don’t forget to visit Ashness Bridge for a glorious view of Derwent Water and the fells beyond. Graham Lilley Continue reading...",

The restored Georgian gem is a perfect base for exploring the historic Castlefield districtFor some, a stately home does it. For others, a converted barn. For me, anything rail-related hits the spot. It’s partly respect for transport and proper jobs. It’s also because I was born and raised 1.2 miles (or a mile and 16 chains in the parlance) south of the world’s first inter-city railway line – the Liverpool and Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. Though never a full-blown spotter, I got the transport bug watching 47s and Deltics rumbling along the tracks between St Helens Junction and Newton-le-Willows. Despite the delays and dysfunction that make rail travel so irksome today, I still love trains.It is then a childish buzz as well as a grown-up, heritage-inspired delight to be spending a couple of nights in the Station Agent’s House, the Landmark Trust’s new property in Castlefield, Manchester. The area, at the southern end of main drag Deansgate, is one of the city’s oldest, though its iron bridges and merchants’ warehouses are now overshadowed by high-rise apartment blocks.

The Sea Change film festival, which runs from Friday to Sunday, has been attracting the public and the film industry to Tiree (population about 650) in the Inner Hebrides for the past five years.It’s Scotland’s only annual festival dedicated to celebrating women through film, and hosts screenings, workshops and talks, as well as beach walks, pilates classes and swimming sessions.

    "description": "Guests staying at a new holiday cottage in the grounds of Trebah Gardens will get after-hours access to this sub-tropical paradise and its private coveThe sign on the gate states “Private. No access.” We ignore it and follow a path past a Georgian manor house, its white walls glowing pink in the early evening light. It appears to be empty but as we tiptoe past the large sash windows, I have the uneasy sensation of trespassing. To the far side of the house is a latticed wooden gate, which has been left off the latch.The lawn and flowerbeds in front of the house are neatly manicured, but on the other side of the gate is something altogether wilder. We set off down a narrow path that descends steeply through a lush valley spiked with palm trees and soaring Monterey pines. There’s the sound of trickling water from a waterfall and the leaves of flame-coloured crocosmia tickle our legs as we brush past. At every twist in the path there are new wonders: towering tree ferns, a grove of bamboo 10 metres high, a swathe of rampant hydrangeas with flower heads the size of footballs in every shade of lilac and blue. It’s like a sub-tropical Secret Garden on steroids, and we’ve got it all to ourselves. Continue reading...",

The cell is a beehive hut, or clochán; 1,400 years ago, it offered sleeping quarters to monks. The fluff is a baby seabird – to be precise, the chick of a European storm petrel. As my eyes adjust, I make out the glint of a tiny eye. After dark, the parents will return with food. For now, the chick sits tight.Storm petrels nest only on remote, uninhabited islands, so seeing a chick is a rare privilege.

Any night of the week, you can wander downtown and find live music playing somewhere – from the set of a live television show to a pop-up concert in a convenience store, not to mention incredible cuisine and nightlife where people never take themselves too seriously. We chatted with Madeline Hollern, editor of Austin Monthly, to get her latest favourite recommendations for visitors.Food and drinkThough Austin was always a great place for food trucks and burger joints, Hollern says she’s seen more options opening up from new restaurants in the city this year. “We’re getting more diversity in terms of types of food and price points, which is very welcome,” she says. One of her favourite new restaurants is Bambino, a pizza restaurant offering hand-tossed pies with a daily changing menu in East Austin. Far East Austin is where you’ll find some of the trendiest bars and restaurants in the city. Start your evening at Sign Bar (you’ll recognise it by the melange of neon), and then when you get hungry, head next door to Lao’d Bar. A newcomer on the Austin bar scene, Lao’d Bar represents a departure from the standard bar fare. “It has some of the best food I’ve had all year – it’s incredibly tasty Lao-inspired food, and it’s getting accolades left and right,” says Hollern.

We used this to revisit south-east Asia – not to relive past travelling glories of my 20s (where my destinations usually revolved around partying). Instead we floated around the more “cultured” parts that were not on my radar in days gone by – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (a revelation) and more remote areas of the Philippines and Indonesia. I could list a hundred special moments and locations over the year – but the memory I revisit in my head the most is my daily moped drive to a beach on the Karimunjawa islands in Indonesia. It’s not the crystal-clear sea, smiling locals or amazing food that sticks, but the feeling of absolute freedom and euphoric joy that made me smile from ear to ear on that ride, sometimes laughing to myself hysterically for no reason (I must have looked a bit crazy). It’s joy that I felt from simply being alive. It’s a feeling that can be elusive in life and one I cherish so much. Benjamin Continue reading...",

As we glided past vineyards and lavender fields, I could almost taste the crisp rosé waiting for me in Tain-l’Hermitage, where I stopped to savour local wines and cheeses. The medieval villages along the way felt like stepping back in time. Each moment on deck, with the cicadas singing and the sun setting over the water, deepened my connection to the soul of France.

This so-called wilderness area was one of the first of its kind in Europe.A video showed an ecologist rowing across a dazzling, teal-hued lake surrounded by pine-strewn peaks. I was immediately fascinated.

    "description": "A new documentary, Wild Water, celebrates a hardy group of enthusiasts who hike up boglands to swim year-round in a remote mill pond built during the Industrial RevolutionGaddings Dam was built as a mill pond in about 1833, when the Industrial Revolution positioned West Yorkshire and the north of England as the centre of the developed world’s cotton-spinning and weaving mills. It sits above the market town of Todmorden, out of sight on the moor of Langfield Common, with a sandy beach that claims to be the highest in England.The Gaddings Dam Preservation Company bought the deeds to the reservoir in 2001 for £1,500, on the condition that it was preserved for the people of Todmorden. These days, with restricted access to water in lakes and reservoirs, Gaddings has become a much-valued and popular local swimming spot.The Gaddings Dam Preservation Company bought the deeds to the reservoir in 2001 for £1,500 on the condition that it was preserved for the people of Todmorden Continue reading...",

    "description": "New exhibition showcases photographs of real locations inspired by American film director’s whimsical trademark styleThink of a Wes Anderson film and the muted greys and browns of a rain-soaked day in London are not the first things that spring to mind. But the UK capital is about to host the first European exhibition of photographs inspired by the vibrant aesthetic of the American film director.Accidentally Wes Anderson: The Exhibition, which opens in South Kensington, London, on 8 December, is the latest incarnation of a phenomenon that began on social media six years ago when self-confessed “nerd” and “Anderson fan-boy” Wally Koval started an Instagram account with the same name. He envisaged it as a personal “travel bucket list”, on which he’d share pictures of places he wanted to visit. However, it quickly snowballed to become an online community sharing photographs of locations that reflected the distinctive, colour-saturated look of films such as The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Royal Tenenbaums.London’s brilliant parade (clockwise from top left): Buckingham Palace (@oksanaskora); Woolwich Town Hall (@steven.maddison); Kew Palace (Andrew Afram); JAS Smith \u0026 Sons Umbrella Shop (Eric Reichbaum) Continue reading...",

    "description": "The vandalism at Sycamore Gap may have hogged the headlines, but walking the length of the national trail puts these borderlands into thrilling historical contextHadrian’s Wall has perhaps the most single-minded personality of all the National Trails, tracing as it does the 84 miles from Bowness-on-Solway to Wallsend, which represented the north-west frontier of the Roman empire for nearly 300 years. It was built by the Roman army (the soldiers dug the ditches, quarried the stones and laid them) on the orders of the emperor Hadrian after his visit to Britain in AD 122.The Hadrian’s Wall path celebrates its 20th birthday this year. I’ve now walked all 17 National Trails, including the Coast to Coast path and King Charles III England coast path (officially opening in 2024 and 2025 respectively). I’m not sure why it took me so long to get round to walking the Hadrian’s Wall trail; perhaps it was a perception that it was too busy or that there was too much road walking. All my concerns proved unfounded.‘The wall was built from east to west, but I’d decided to go west to east so the prevailing wind was behind me and my load of camera and camping gear’ Continue reading...",

    "description": "Our photojournalist samples short walks along the new 87-mile route which hugs the border of Cornwall and DevonA few minutes into a “guided” walk along the new Tamara Coast to Coast Way, which roughly traces the border of Cornwall and Devon, my guide is looking sheepish. We’re standing in a grassy field flanked by overgrown hedgerows and with no discernible exit. I was promised a panoramic view of the Tamar river stretching off into the distance.“Are we lost?” I inquire mischievously. “Give me one moment,” comes the reply. “I walked this route in the opposite direction last time!”Will Darwall, manager of the Tamara Landscape Partnership Scheme, a partnership of 21 organisations – including Cornwall Council, Devon County Council, the National Trust and Historic England – which aims to promote the Tamar valley and its communities Continue reading...",
