    "title": "Was an umbrella what motivated Butvilas to achieve pro dream?",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/butvilas-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "The players were awarded their trophies, one for the champion and one for the runner-up. Then came an additional prize: a big box of juice, reserved for the titlist, and an umbrella for the finalist. For a pair of eight-year-olds, this was a drastic difference. Edas Butvilas was brought to tears when he received the umbrella. It was a punch to the gut while his close friend, Vilius Gaubas, left the Lithuanian city of Palanga with the bigger trophy and coveted juice. Years later, that moment stands out as both Butvilas and Gaubas are now rising #NextGenATP stars who are enjoying promising starts on the ATP Challenger Tour. “I lost the final and I remember exactly. I cried for a long time because I wanted the big box of juice and at that time I didn’t care about the umbrella at all, I gave it away to my parents,” Butvilas told ATPTour.com. “The loss wasn’t that painful, but I saw what he got for the prizes, it was really sad. I still remember it. I talk about it sometimes with Vilius.” Entering the 2024 season, there had only been two Lithuanian winners in Challenger history (since 1978): Ricardas Berankis and Laurynas Grigelis. Butvilas, who won last week’s Charleston Challenger, and Gaubas have each secured their maiden title at that level in the past two months. Gaubas is ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, five spots ahead of Butvilas. They are both aiming for maiden qualification for the 20-and-under Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. For Lithuania, a country with a relatively small imprint in tennis history, the future is bright. “This is one of the best things that can happen, that we dreamed of,” Butvilas said of his rise alongside Gaubas. “We grew up together. We are the same age so we were dreaming together, playing together and now rising up like this, it’s just a dream come true.” Butvilas, who grew up in Klaipeda, began playing tennis aged two alongside his father Tomas, who is a tennis coach. When Butvilas was around age 11, his mother, Dana, began taking him to international tournaments.[ATP APP] “I remember going with my mom in the car and we were driving a lot of kilometres together, just playing many tournaments,” Butvilas said. “Around Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, really close. Poland, sometimes Germany, Austria. Sometimes going to Iceland, I’ve been there two times, I think to play Tennis Europe.” Butvilas grew up idolising Roger Federer and former World No. 50 Berankis, whose 15 Challenger titles leads Lithuanians. “He showed that even from a small country like Lithuania, we can do really good in tennis,” Butvilas said. At age 15, Butvilas moved to Alicante, Spain to begin training at the Club Atlético Montemar. Butvilas met coach Ivan Navarro, who has been travelling with the Lithuanian for roughly two years. Butvilas last week earned a milestone victory when he claimed his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title on the hard courts of Charleston, South Carolina. It was just his ninth outing at the Challenger level. Edas Butvilas triumphs at the Challenger 75 event in Charleston. Credit: LTP Challenger Butvilas, now at a career-high World No. 261 in the PIF ATP Rankings, became the first lucky loser Challenger champion since February 2023. “It is still tough to believe it because I was so close to being out of the tournament,” Butvilas said. “I lost in qualies and I got the lucky-loser spot and then everything went my way. “It was really tough conditions there, so hot and humid. In the second round of qualies, I cramped in the last set and almost threw up. I was feeling really bad. Then I got the lucky-loser spot and I had to play the next day again and I won 7-5 in the third. Mentally, I fought a lot that week.” Still early in his career, Butvilas has already learned an important lesson: the tide will turn in your favour if you remain resilient. “I lost many close matches this year. My coach always told me that tennis can change really fast at any point,” Butvilas said. “I just was thinking, ‘Why not this time?’”Did You Know?Butvilas is a two-time junior Slam doubles champion. He won the 2021 Wimbledon boys' doubles event alongside Alejandro Manzanera Pertusa and the 2022 Roland Garros boys' doubles title with Mili Poljicak. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "'Miracle' man Ritschard fuelled by girlfriend's nutritional plan",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ritschard-top-100-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "Alexander Ritschard is powering through 2024 with a newfound edge, surging into the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time on Wednesday. Behind the scenes, a key figure has quietly transformed his approach. The Swiss has been fuelled by a new nutritional programme, curated by his girlfriend, Kat Berglas. Ritschard, 30, has been dating Berglas for seven months, and in that short time, her expertise has helped him surge on the ATP Challenger Tour. “She was the missing piece I kind of needed to do what I’m doing now,” Ritschard told ATPTour.com. “She’s really helped me a lot with my nutrition, helps me feel more fueled and feeling [better]. Since I’ve taken her tips, I feel very healthy.” [ATP APP] In April, Ritschard was as low as World No. 209. He has since claimed three of his four career Challenger titles, including one last week in Lisbon, Portugal, where Ritschard had courtside support from Berglas. When Ritschard first met Berglas, he asked about her profession. Upon learning she was a nutritionist, he asked if she would be willing to help him and Berglas gladly agreed. She created a tailor-made nutritional plan. “I can’t give away all the secrets,” Ritschard joked. “Everyone has a different body, different metabolism. For me personally, I’m someone who burns carbs very quickly and sweats a lot, so I have to eat a lot of carbohydrates and take in a lot of salts and drink a lot of fluids. “She kind of has a whole programme for me. I eat a certain amount the day before, a certain amount the day of, I constantly eat when I play a match. My drink is a very heavy carbohydrate drink. Also, I’m eating a lot of bananas for the potassium and a lot of cereal bars for additional carbs. I’m just really, really carbing up and she keeps an eye on it.” One of two players to make his Top 100 debut Wednesday (Jacob Fearnley), Ritschard’s path to where he is now took an unexpected turn in 2015, when a blocked artery in his right arm cut off blood flow. Ritschard, then a student-athlete at the University of Virginia, was working out when he felt a sharp sting in his shoulder. What initially seemed minor quickly escalated, bringing Ritschard within minutes of potentially facing the unimaginable: the loss of his right arm. “I can only go by what they told me, they said they had to make a decision within the next five minutes and it wasn’t opening. I guess I got lucky, it opened, and blood started flowing again,” Ritschard said last year. Ritschard needed multiple operations to solve the issue. “One just to get the artery open, the second one to remove the problem, which was the rib that was too tight and then my lungs just filled with blood and I had to pump the blood out,” recalled Ritschard, who helped Virginia win three straight NCAA team titles. Post-surgery limitations left Ritschard questioning his future in tennis. He contemplated if he would quit the sport after college. But now he is among an exclusive group, boasting a double-digit number next to his name in the PIF ATP Rankings at World No. 99. Alexander Ritschard celebrates winning the Del Monte Lisboa Belém Open. Credit: Beatriz Ruivo/FPT Ritschard has occasional check-up appointments to ensure everything stays normal with his right arm, and thankfully, there have been no issues. Just last month, the week before he won the Lisbon Challenger title, Ritschard felt his arm going numb while he was sleeping. But doctors put to bed any concern. “That was just me sleeping funny,” Ritschard said. “At the check up, everything looked really, really good.” When Ritschard steps foot on court, or in the doctor’s office, he is reminded of his incredible fortune to even be playing the sport he began at age five. “I got really, really lucky. That’s really the only way I can put it,” Ritschard said. “Even now, I do a check up with the doctor who was part of the surgery and he always laughs when I walk in because he’s like, ‘Man, you are a miracle! This is crazy. I cannot believe you are able to do what you do with what we had to do’. “It’s always funny seeing him, he feels very prideful because he’s like, ‘Yeah, I saved this guy!’” Now, Ritschard is using that same arm — once at risk of being lost — to unleash heavy hitting from the baseline. What could have been a career-ending injury is instead a testament to Ritschard’s remarkable resilience. In the form of his life, Ritschard is the oldest Top 100 debutant since October 2022, when Emilio Gomez achieved the milestone. “I dreamt of being a Top 100 player since I was a kid,” Ritschard said. “So this for me is definitely a very special moment for sure.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are reshaping how our sport is played, and updated match analytics are needed to understand exactly what patterns of play they are gravitating towards to forge their advantage. Alcaraz narrowly defeated Sinner 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) in the China Open final on Wednesday, and an analysis of their forays forward to the net provides ideal insight into how the next generation constructs their points. Approach and volley has been a staple of our sport since its inception. The new norm is actually approach and no volley. Alcaraz and Sinner moved forward to finish the point at the front of the court more than 100 times in the final, with over half of those points not involving a volley. The data set comprises all points where players moved forward in the court towards the net to finish points. It includes serve and volley, return approach, and general rally balls where either player steps towards the net to build or end the point. Approaching The Net/No Volley Hit - Alcaraz = 58% (38/66) no volley hit. - Sinner = 74% (29/39) no volley hit. - Total = 64% (67/105) no volley hit. Alcaraz and Sinner prefer to end net points before they get competitive. Approach shots in today’s game are a different animal than just a few decades ago. Both players crushed their approach shots with significant power and spin, not giving their opponent a chance to wriggle their way out of trouble. Alcaraz and Sinner combined to hit 22 approach winners for the match. Coming forward to finish a point and not having to hit a volley was by far the number-one way points ended when both players ventured forward.   Combined: Volleys Hit - Zero volley hit = 64% (67) - One volley hit = 28% (30) - Two volleys hit = 8% (8) - Total = 105 The number one way to come forward was with a forehand approach shot. Alcaraz Approach Shots - Forehand = 40 - Forehand Return = 1 - Backhand = 9 - Backhand Return = 10 - Serve \u0026 Volley = 6 - Total = 66 Sinner Approach Shots - Forehand = 27 - Backhand = 11 - Serve \u0026 Volley = 1 - Total = 39 [ATP APP] What is fascinating is that Alcaraz employed 11 return approaches in the match, immediately ramping up the pressure on Sinner to hit a passing shot. Alcaraz only missed one of the return approaches. Overall, he came in 10 times with a backhand approach and just once with a forehand approach. With this aggressive tactic, he won an impressive eight of 11 points, including all four he employed in the third set. Lastly, Alcaraz was able to take advantage of the higher winning percentage at the net over the baseline much more when he was returning serve than Sinner. BEIJING CHAMPION 🏆 In a breathtaking final, @carlosalcaraz fights back to defeat the defending champion Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) for the #ChinaOpen title!@chinaopen pic.twitter.com/idvMd6LRiz — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 2, 2024 Alcaraz Start Of The Point \u0026 Finishing At Net - 56% Serving (37) - 44% Returning (29) - Total = 66 Sinner Start Of The Point \u0026 Finishing At Net - 67% Serving (26) - 33% Returning (13) - Total = 39 Successfully moving forward to finish points at net when starting the point with a return of serve is a hidden weapon for Alcaraz. He can first neutralise the point with a strong return or use the short serve in the service box to immediately approach. At any moment, at any point score, both Alcaraz and Sinner were swarming the net to apply pressure to their opponent. These two players are going to set the tone for how our sport is played for years to come. The front of the court is making a revival. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz versus Jannik Sinner has rapidly blossomed into one of the most gripping rivalries in recent memory. Possessing thunderous ballstriking and incredible agility, Alcaraz and Sinner have frequently clashed on the biggest stages and are poised to do so plenty in the next decade. The Spaniard has won three consecutive matches against Sinner to take a 6-4 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. ATPTour.com looks back at all of their meetings. [ATP APP] China Open 2024, Final, Alcaraz d. Sinner 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) It was as much a mental chess match as a physical showdown, a true test of resilience for the entire three hours and 21 minutes — the longest match in Beijing tournament history. Alcaraz prevailed through the twists and turns, securing his third consecutive victory against the Italian. Facing off in a championship match for just the second time, Alcaraz and Sinner delivered upon the highly anticipated excitement. There was monstrous firepower from the baseline and superb shotmaking combined with court coverage that showcased both players’ speed and agility. In Alcaraz’s opinion, it was the kind of edge-of-your-seat match that inspires others to try the sport. “I think for the people who don't watch tennis, probably thanks to these kind of matches, [they] start to watch tennis or even practise it,” Alcaraz said. Alcaraz let slip a 5-2 lead in the opening set, which he eventually lost in a tie-break. World No. 1 Sinner had now claimed 18 of his previous 19 tie-breaks, so when he led 3/0 in the deciding-set tie-break, it seemed the Italian was set to successfully defend his ATP 500 crown. But Alcaraz unleashed free hitting under pressure and tallied seven consecutive points to lift the trophy. The Spaniard’s win brought his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero to tears. “When you're able to beat one of the best, if not the best, tennis player in the world, obviously it seems like you're doing the right things, you're doing the right work,” Alcaraz said. Despite the heartbreak of defeat, Sinner was able to look back at the clash in a positive way. “I feel like it's always great when we meet,” Sinner said. \"We try to push ourself and each other to the limits. He for me is a [reference] point of where I work.” Roland Garros 2024, SF, Alcaraz d. Sinner 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 Both stars entered the Roland Garros semi-finals keen to reach their first final at the clay-court major. Alcaraz and Sinner had each entered the tournament with an injury concern, but found their form and worked their way to the last four. Sinner came flying out of the gates, surging to a set-and-a-break advantage. But as the Italian began to make more unforced errors, Alcaraz raised his level to flip the momentum of the match. The Italian suffered from cramp in his hand and arm early in the third set, but managed to dig deep to take a two-sets-to-one advantage. From there, Alcaraz again turned the match around and his ability to maneouvre himself into winning positions in rallies proved the difference.  The Spaniard hit 65 winners compared to 39 for Sinner, and rallied to reach the final after four hours and nine minutes. While it was a disappointing loss for Sinner, the 22-year-old was already guaranteed to climb to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time on the Monday after the tournament. BNP Paribas Open 2024, SF, Alcaraz d. Sinner 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 Sinner entered his semi-final clash against Alcaraz at the BNP Paribas in March unbeaten on the season. The Italian was a perfect 16-0 on the year, having won his maiden major title at the Australian Open in January. Sinner had played flawlessly through the first three months of the season and entered the match as slight favourite with Alcaraz stepping onto court 11-3 on the year. The 22-year-old’s favourite tag seemed justified after the opening set, with Sinner cruising into a 6-1 lead. Sinner produced the perfect start, hitting six winners to Alcaraz’s one, according to Infosys ATP Stats. However, Alcaraz did not surrender. The Spaniard fought through the opening game of set two and earned a crucial hold to stem the tide. He eliminated the early errors that plagued him in the opening set and began to find his footing in long rallies, finding greater variety to level. The 21-year-old continued to mix up his tactics in the final set and lost just three points on serve in a one-sided decider. By moving back to \"Medvedev territory\" on return, he hurt Sinner with big cuts to begin the point and often began the rallies on the front foot. After two hours and five minutes, Alcaraz sealed victory on his third match point to end Sinner’s unbeaten start to the season. With his win, Alcaraz advanced to his his sixth ATP Masters 1000 final (4-1), denying Sinner his fourth at the time (1-2). It was Alcaraz's first tour-level final since he lost to Novak Djokovic in the previous August in a Cincinnati epic; he had been 0-4 in semi-finals since that defeat. \"I stayed strong mentally,\" said Alcaraz, who pointed to his head after the win. \"I think that's a really important part in this game. You have to be strong mentally if you want to overcome these kind of matches, a set down against someone that's playing an unbelievable game. I'm really happy with the things that I've done after that. \"I changed my style a little bit, I changed my game a little bit and I think it worked very well. I'm really happy to beat Jannik and be in the final again.\" Alcaraz then faced Medvedev in the final, cruising to a straight sets win to clinch his fifth Masters 1000 title. Photo Credit: Getty Images China Open 2023, SF, Sinner d. Alcaraz 7-6(4), 6-1 After Alcaraz won 7-4 tie-breaks to open each of their previous two matches, Sinner claimed the opening-set tie-break by the same scoreline at the China Open. In a marathon opening frame, Sinner twice came back from a break down. He began to take control by moving Alcaraz around the baseline and winning all 15 of his net points in the set. After navigating a tense opening to the second set, fighting off five break points across his first two service games, Sinner sprinted through the finish line. \"For sure in the very top [of the big matches I've played],\" the Italian said of the win. \"I would say every match against him is very tough. We always show great respect, we both play great. When we play against each other, we try to stay on our limits.\" Sinner followed up the victory by beating Medvedev in the Beijing final to claim his fourth tour-level title of the season, equalling his personal-best tally from 2021. Miami Open presented by Itau, SF, Sinner d. Alcaraz 6-7(4), 6-4, 6-2 Two weeks after their Indian Wells showdown, Sinner gained swift revenge with a comeback victory at the Miami Open presented by Itau. In a show-stopping semi-final, Sinner won one of the points of the year: an action-packed 25-ball rally that ended with a delicate, dipping passing shot to bring the crowd to its feet. Despite that moment of magic — and early leads in all three sets — Sinner was on the ropes when he faced two break points at 3-4 in the second. But the Italian answered the bell with a match-changing surge, winning 19 of 21 points to take the set and build a 2-0 lead in the decider. Alcaraz appeared to be struggling physically early in set three, but he willed his way to one final push. In the end, his 22 winners were not enough to overcome 28 off the racquet of his opponent. \"It means a lot. We both played a very, very high level of tennis again. I just tried my best,\" Sinner said after advancing to his second Miami final. \"We both tried to play very aggressive tennis and today it went my way so I'm very happy.\" Sinner was beaten by Daniil Medvedev in the Miami final but went on to win his first ATP Masters 1000 title later in the season in Toronto. BNP Paribas Open 2023, SF, Alcaraz d. Sinner 7-6(4), 6-3 Alcaraz captured his third ATP Masters 1000 crown at the BNP Paribas Open in 2023, returning to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings following his triumph. The Spaniard did not drop a set en route to the title, but was pushed the hardest by Sinner in the pair’s semi-final clash in Indian Wells. In another entertaining battle, the bulk of the drama came in a back-and-forth opening set as Sinner took full advantage of a dip in level from his opponent to turn a 2-4 deficit into a 5-4 lead, winning 11 straight points in the process. Sinner kept the pressure on to create a set point at 6-5, but a uniquely Alcaraz combination — big serve, drop shot, volley winner — erased the chance and ensured the set would be decided in a tie-break. Encouraged by his escape, the Spaniard powered through the tie-break and carried his momentum into set two, when he consolidated an early break with a point-of-the-season contender, planting a topspin lob on the baseline after a Sinner dipper forced him to retreat from the net. He later wriggled out of 0/30 to hold for 5-2, and served out the match with ease behind a pair of punishing forehand winners. “I'm really happy to get through this great match. Jannik obviously is a really great player with great shots,” Alcaraz said. “I would say we're going to have a great rivalry over the years. We are playing in the best tournaments in the world. It's not over here. We are going to play a lot of great matches.” US Open 2022, QF, Alcaraz d. Sinner 6-3, 6-7(7), 6-7(0), 7-5, 6-3 In one of the matches of the 2022 season, Alcaraz and Sinner battled late into the New York night. Across five hours and 15 minutes of twists and turns, the only constant was elite tennis and tireless effort from both men. Alcaraz and Sinner took turns lighting up Arthur Ashe Stadium, flashing their tremendous athleticism and power in equal measures. Sinner dominated the third-set tie-break to take a two-sets-to-one lead and carried his momentum into the fourth set as he scored an instant break. But the fearless Alcaraz erased a match point with Sinner serving at 5-4 and went on a run of four straight games to force a fifth set. Again trailing by a break, the Spaniard repeated that feat by winning four games in a row in the fifth set to claim victory at 2:50 a.m. \"Honestly, I still don't know how I did it,\" Alcaraz said. \"You have to believe in yourself. I believed in my game. It was really difficult to close out the match. I tried to stay calm, but it is difficult in the moment. “The energy I received in this court at 3 a.m., it was unbelievable. Probably in other tournaments, everybody [would go] to their house to rest. But they [stayed] in the court, supporting me. It was unbelievable.”Alcaraz went on to claim his first major title at Flushing Meadows and by doing so he became the youngest World No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings. Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag 2022, Final, Sinner d. Alcaraz 6-7(5), 6-1, 6-1 Facing off in a championship match for the first time, it was Sinner who recovered from dropping the opening set to spoil Alcaraz’s title defence in Croatia. A vital hold of serve in the second game of the second set was crucial to Sinner’s triumph. Already facing pressure after falling a set behind, the Italian fended off six break points in that game alone, preventing a potential runaway victory for Alcaraz. Sinner broke the Spaniard’s serve immediately in the next game and charged to the ATP 250 crown. “That was a crucial point [of the match],” said Sinner. “I knew I had to stay there. I was very happy that I won this game. Then I returned well and raised my level a little bit, and I think I found a solution then.” Photo Credit: Croatia Open Umag Wimbledon 2022, Fourth Round, Sinner d. Alcaraz 6-1, 6-4, 6-7(8), 6-3 Just hours after Wimbledon looked back to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Centre Court, Sinner and Alcaraz provided a glimpse of the future with their first Grand Slam meeting in the fourth round. In the first Centre Court match for both, Sinner overwhelmed Alcaraz with his pure ball-striking and had two match points to wrap up a straight-sets win before Alcaraz found his rhythm to take the third-set tie-break. After converting on his fourth set point, the Spaniard raised his racquet, soaking in the crowd's roar. As the match grew more physical, Sinner stemmed the tide with two battling holds to open the fourth set, then scored the decisive break to edge ever closer to his third major quarter-final. After missing out on three further match points on return at 5-3, Sinner saved a break point as he served out one of the most entertaining matches of the fortnight. A forehand winner — Sinner's 35th of the match — completed the victory after three hours and 35 minutes. “Carlos is a very tough opponent and a very nice person, so it is always a huge pleasure for me to play against him,\" said Sinner, who would fall to Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarter-finals. Photo Credit: Adrian Dennis/Getty Images Rolex Paris Masters 2021, Second Round, Alcaraz d. Sinner 7-6(1), 7-5 “I think Jannik and I will have a great rivalry in the future,” was a near-prophetic comment from Alcaraz after he upset World No. 9 Sinner in their first tour-level meeting. Alcaraz, then 18 years old and World No. 35 in the PIF ATP Rankings, showcased his brave shot selection and heavy hitting to down the eighth seed Sinner, who was competing as a Top 10 player for the first time that week. Alcaraz created 11 break chances, converting two of them, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Court 1 at the Rolex Paris Masters will forever be the stomping grounds of the Alcaraz vs. Sinner rivalry, though the Spaniard had previously beaten the Italian 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 as an unranked 15-year-old on his ATP Challenger Tour debut at Alicante in April 2019, when Sinner was World No. 319.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "In an action-packed September on the ATP Tour, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz soared to more glory. New faces joined the old in the winner’s circle in China to kickstart the Asian swing, with Marin Cilic returning after a three-year hiatus in Hangzhou, and Shang Juncheng establishing a name for himself in front of his home faithful in Chengdu. US Open, New York - Jannik Sinner Jannik Sinner capped a dazzling 2024 campaign on the Grand Slam circuit by lifting his second major trophy at the US Open, adding to his Australian Open triumph in January. The 23-year-old rose to the challenge that was posed in the final by home hope Taylor Fritz, who was bidding to become the first American male to succeed at this level since Andy Roddick at the 2003 US Open. It was a gutsy performance from Sinner throughout the fortnight, eventually raising his level to soar into a commanding lead over Alexander Zverev and Alcaraz in the battle to claim ATP Year-End No.1 presented by PIF. Photo: AFP/Getty Images Chengdu Open, Chengdu - Shang Juncheng It was fitting that Shang Juncheng’s maiden ATP Tour title came on home soil in China, underpinning the impressive rise that the 19-year-old #NextGenATP star has undergone over the past year. With his fairytale run in Chengdu, which included a comprehensive 7-6(4), 6-1 win over top seed Lorenzo Musetti in the final, the flashy left showed why he is one of the most promising talents on the Tour, becoming just the second Chinese man to lift an ATP Tour title (Yibing Wu, Dallas 2023). With the triumph, Shang boosted his hopes of qualification for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, cementing his third-place position in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. Hangzhou Open, Hangzhou - Marin Cilic Marin Cilic carved his name into the history books with his resurgent performance to claim the title in Hangzhou, becoming the lowest-ranked ATP Tour champion since 1990. Arriving in China as No. 777 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the 35-year-old was able to reignite some of his most imposing tennis to edge to victory over Brandon Nakashima and prevent Zhang Zhizhen from creating more Chinese history in the final with a gripping straight-sets win, 7-6(5), 7-6(5). Laver Cup, Berlin - Team Europe It was Alcaraz who stole the show on his Laver Cup debut, picking up Team Europe from the brink of defeat and guiding the group to victory over Team World in a thrilling 13-11 comeback. Entering the final Sunday, Bjorn Borg’s team faced a 4-8 deficit in favour of John McEnroe’s men. Still, the Spaniard provided crucial wins in both doubles and singles to taste victory. After Borg and McEnroe's seven-year tenure as Laver Cup captains, Yannick Noah and Andre Agassi will take over from 2025. Photo: AFP/Getty Images [ATP APP] Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, Japan - Arthur Fils Arthur Fils battled back from the verge of defeat, saving a championship point against countryman Ugo Humbert in the Tokyo final to triumph 5-7, 7-6(6), 6-3 and clinch his second ATP 500 title of the 2024 campaign. A dazzling week in the Japanese capital saw the 20-year-old #NextGenATP star secure four wins over Top 20 opponents, including top seed Fritz, defending champion Ben Shelton, Holger Rune and Humbert. The Frenchman was forced to battle physical issues in each of the rounds from his quarter-final but eventually held his nerve to extend his lead at the top of the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. China Open, Beijing - Carlos Alcaraz Alcaraz began his 2024 Asian Swing in emphatic fashion when he soared to a fourth title of the year in the Chinese capital. The 21-year-old rallied back from the brink of defeat in a gripping final against Sinner that was decided by the finest of margins, reflecting the absorbing nature of their rivalry. Alcaraz, who clinched a 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) victory, became the first man to win an ATP 500 on hard courts, clay and grass in series history (since 2009). [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "If the rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner was a book, it would be a thrilling page-turner that readers could not put down. The latest chapter, Alcaraz’s narrow victory against Sinner in an epic China Open final, delivered the highly-anticipated amount of enthrallment. Back and forth with twists and turns mixed throughout, the ATP 500 final was edge-of-your-seat tennis for all three hours and 21 minutes, the longest match in tournament history. Alcaraz believes that matches like Wednesday's final bring an excitement that will attract new fans to the sport. “I think for the people who don't watch tennis, probably thanks to these kind of matches, [they] start to watch tennis or even practise it. I think it is pretty good,” Alcaraz said. “When Jannik and I face each other, playing against each other, I think it's a really good thing for tennis because we always show a really intense match, really close match, great points, great rallies.” [ATP APP] By winning his fourth title of the season, Alcaraz continued his perfect year against the World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Spaniard fell to Sinner a year ago in the Beijing semi-finals and has since won their three meetings in 2024: Indian Wells, Roland Garros and Beijing. Alcaraz now leads Sinner 6-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “I try to enjoy as much as I can playing against him, but it's not easy. I'm really happy. I mean, when you're able to beat one of the best, if not the best, tennis player in the world, obviously it seems like you're doing the right things, you're doing the right work,” Alcaraz said. “I'm proud of myself with everything I've done the last month, working really hard physically, on the court as well. It has been an intense month. But I'm really happy to end it with the trophy here in Beijing, with a really incredible match.” The 21-year-old’s 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) triumph against Sinner displayed everything fans love about both players. There was monstrous firepower from the baseline and superb shotmaking combined with court coverage that showcased their speed and agility. Watch Extended Highlights It was also a testament to both players’ mental resilience. Alcaraz let slip a 5-2 lead in the opening set, which he eventually lost. The Spaniard held a break advantage in the decider, but was eventually pushed to a final-set tie-break. “It was a really close match. I mean, Jannik could win in straight sets. I could win in two sets. I had my chances in the first set. Didn't take it,” Alcaraz said. “I’m really happy with the way that I managed that moment. I lost the first set with a lot of opportunities, didn't make it. Coming up in the second set, I tried to clear my mind a little bit and just tried to keep going, playing the good tennis that I was doing the first set. “I think both of us showed a really high level of tennis. High level mentally, physically, until the last ball. Running from side to side, showing really good rallies, really good points in the tie-break of the third. I'm really happy to be able to get that win at the end.” Alcaraz had his back against the wall in the final-set tie-break. Sinner had claimed 18 of his previous 19 tie-breaks, including one in the first set of the final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Italian struck two forehand winners on the first two points and then opened up a 3/0 lead. But Alcaraz stormed back, tallying seven consecutive points to capture his 16th tour-level title. “I just tried to keep going, tried not to think about anything else but the next point,” Alcaraz said. “I tried to play the same way I was playing. If I miss it, I miss it. I wanted to think that I went for it all the time. I say that's all that matters.” Alcaraz became the first player to win an ATP 500 crown on all three surfaces (hard, clay and grass) in series history (since 2009). His eight-match win streak is a welcomed sight after suffering a shocking second-round upset at the US Open. Alcaraz, who captured his 200th tour-level win in the Beijing second round, is up to second in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin following his title run. “It was a really special win for me, lifting this trophy in front of my team, part of my family. It was a great moment for me. I guess [Juan Carlos Ferrero] got emotional at the end because we all know what we went through the last month or the last two months. It was a really difficult moment on the court, off the court,” Alcaraz said. “As I said in the speech, thanks to [my team], I started to get the joy back playing the matches, practising, I got motivated again. I really wanted to travel, to play tournaments again. Probably after the American swing, I was a little bit down, I didn't want to touch a racquet for a while. I didn't want to travel, let's say. “After that, we talked a lot during those days, knowing that I have to be back practising, be stronger physically, be stronger mentally just to overcome those problems, let's say. The last month we've been working really, really hard on the court, off the court, just to be able to feel this moment again.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz reigned supreme at the China Open this week in Beijing to leapfrog Alexander Zverev for second in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, only behind rival Italian Jannik Sinner, whom he defeated in the ATP 500 final. In Tokyo, Frenchman Arthur Fils downed four Top 20 opponents to be crowned champion. Can the 20-year-old make a late-season push to go from finalist at last year’s Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF to a Nitto ATP Finals qualifier, just 12 months later? ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as of Wednesday, 2 October. [ATP APP] Carlos Alcaraz - 2nd (6,510 points) The Spaniard was dominant all week in Beijing, where he did not drop a set en route to the final. Alcaraz powered past two rivals — Daniil Medvedev and Sinner — in the semi-finals and final, respectively, to claim 500 points and move one place to second in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Beijing marked the 21-year-old’s fourth title of 2024. Alcaraz, who defeated Sinner in a memorable championship match, has already secured his place at the season-finale Nitto ATP Finals. Arthur Fils - 18th (2,070 points) The young Fils keeps adding milestones to his blossoming career. The Frenchman lifted the Tokyo title, marking his second ATP 500 crown, both of which have come this year (Hamburg). Fils, who saved a championship point Tuesday, is up six places in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.   Ugo Humbert - 19th (2,025 points) You do not have to look much beyond Fils to find the next Frenchman enjoying a standout season. Humbert, who finished runner-up to Fils in Tokyo, has won two titles this season (Marseille, Dubai) and tallied 33 match wins. He is up three places this week in the PIF Live Race To Turin. Tomas Machac - 36th (1,233 points) The Czech is in the form of his life this season, having reached his first tour-level final in Geneva. Machac, 23, upset fifth seed Tommy Paul in the Tokyo second round and went on to reach the semi-finals, collecting 200 points. Buyunchaokete - 66th (696 points) What is better than playing your first tour-level semi-final? By following it up the next week with another semi-final appearance, just as Buyunchaokete did in Hangzhou and Beijing, where he fell to Sinner in the last four. ‘Bu’ gained 200 points, the most he has ever earned in a tournament.

    "description": "Jannik Sinner suffered a heartbreaking defeat on Wednesday evening in the China Open final to rival Carlos Alcaraz. But despite the sting of losing a final-set tie-break with the ATP 500 trophy on the line, the Italian was able to look back at the clash in a positive way. “It’s always nice to be part of these kind of matches. Obviously disappointed it didn't go my way. These kind of matches can really go both ways. But it was not my day,” Sinner said. “He played better in important moments. That's it. I'm proud again of a great week, making finals here. Last year I won here. For sure it's a place where I love to play, so I'm already looking forward for next year.” The Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner, which the Spaniard now leads 6-4, has turned into one of the most captivating rivalries in all of sport. Sinner explained his appreciation for competing with such a tough opponent. “I feel like it's always great when we meet. We try to push ourself and each other to the limits. He for me is a [reference] point of where I work,” Sinner said. “Also today I saw a couple things where I need to get better. It's not only him, there are also other players. “It's always nice to share the court with him. I feel like also the fans, they like it. Usually the matches are quite long, they're physical, there are many turning points… It’s always nice. Feel privileged and honoured to share the court with him. As I said, we both tried to win. We tried to concentrate on every point. Having a great attitude on the court, that makes it happen that it's a very interesting match always.” Watch Extended Final Highlights: Sinner entered the final-set tie-break having claimed 18 of his previous 19 tie-breaks, including one in the first set of the final, according to Infosys ATP Stats. But Alcaraz stormed back from a 0/3 deficit to triumph. “The margins are very small. In the tie-breaks, the small margins, they seem very big. That's it. You have to accept it,” Sinner said. “You have to keep working on a couple of things. I won many tie-breaks in the last period of time. This one, it went away. That's it. It's all good.” The 23-year-old was unable to declare exactly where the match ranks on the list of the best he has played. But he said it “for sure” is in the top five. “7-6 in the third in a final, it's always tough. I had some great matches in the past, even if I'm still young as a player,” Sinner said. “But yeah, I'm always happy to make new experiences, trying to grow. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. That's how this sport is. There are very highs and sometimes there are lows. It's all good. “My season is going very, very consistent, very great. We try to keep building and working for the rest of the season. Now in the next tournament, it's a very important tournament for me because it's only the second time I [am] playing there, but I haven't reached the final stages of the tournament yet. It's already trying to concentrate there and hopefully finishing off the season in a very positive way.” BEIJING CHAMPION 🏆 In a breathtaking final, @carlosalcaraz fights back to defeat the defending champion Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) for the #ChinaOpen title!@chinaopen pic.twitter.com/idvMd6LRiz — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 2, 2024 Now Sinner will quickly turn his attention to the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he will pursue his seventh title of the season and continue his efforts to claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. He leads Alcaraz by 2,820 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. “Shanghai is completely different because the situation is different. Hopefully I get into rhythm quite fast. For sure it's going to be a tough first-round match. Every tournament is difficult to play first rounds,” Sinner said. “For sure there are things where I can improve. We will work on that, trying to become always a better player and also better person. Also the work never stops.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic is back on Chinese soil. It is a treat not only for the local adoring fans, but also for the four-time Rolex Shanghai Masters champion Djokovic. “I wanted to play in China… I said, ‘Okay, I need to play the tournament in Shanghai, it’s the biggest event in China and one of the great 1000 events we have on Tour’. I missed being in China,” Djokovic told ATP Media. “It’s been a while, five years. A lot has happened in the meantime in those five years for me and my career, so I was looking forward to coming and experiencing the love and energy and support that I’ve been getting from Chinese fans all these years.” [ATP APP] Making his 10th Shanghai appearance, the 37-year-old has long felt warm support from Chinese fans stretched across the globe. Now Djokovic is competing in their backyard for the first time since 2019. “I met some of them on the Tour the last couple of years and they were asking me in a way, ‘You need to come back to China and play!’ So I’m happy that I’m here, I really am,” Djokovic said. “It’s one of the most spectacular events. The stadium is just incredible, one of the nicest ones we have on the Tour in our sport.” Djokovic owns the most wins (34) and titles (2012-13, 2015, 2018) in Shanghai tournament history. As is the case almost any time Djokovic steps on court, the World No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings is chasing a milestone this week. The fourth seed will attempt to become the third man in the Open Era to capture 100 tour-level titles and break his tie with Roger Federer for most titles on hard courts (71). Boasting a 34-5 tournament record, Djokovic will open his title quest against home favourite Buyunchaokete or #NextGenATP Alex Michelsen. “I’ve had plenty of success here and in Beijing, won a lot of titles,” said Djokovic. “Hopefully that previous experience and the memories that I have can help me do well this year as well.” Before arriving in Shanghai, Djokovic spent time in Beijing and at the Great Wall of China. Lacoste hosted a special event at the Ju Yong Guan pass, where a tennis court was set up and Djokovic enjoyed hitting some balls with Chinese actor Wang Yibo. Djokovic also visited the Summer Palace and sported a bright green tracksuit while strolling the streets of China’s capital city.Chinese dreams in @Lacoste greens. pic.twitter.com/etwWY2bdKK— Novak Djokovic (@DjokerNole) September 30, 2024 “It brought back the 90s. I’m a kid of the 90s and I remember those days,” Djokovic said with a laugh. “The music and how everybody, like the music artists were dressing up. The tracksuit was a big deal. The colour was really out there. I was walking on the street and people were like, ‘Woah! What’s going on? This is a little bit too much for our eyes!’ We had fun.” It may have brought flashbacks to the past, but perhaps it was also a glimpse of what fans will see more of from Djokovic moving forward. The Beglrade native has been receiving fashion advice from his wife and some friends, who work in fashion. “I’m enjoying the new style to be honest. I’m starting to expand on what I can wear and what I wasn’t wearing for a long time — I’m starting to like it a little bit more. I pay more attention to it,” Djokovic said. “I wasn’t really caring as much for fashion in the past off the court. I was more kind of conversative, jeans or chinos and a polo, that was kind of my vibe for a long time, but now I’m stepping out of the box a little bit and exploring the fashion world.” Djokovic will aim to step in the winner’s circle for the second time this year. The Serbian has tallied a 32-8 season record with his best result coming at the Paris Olympics, where he captured the gold medal. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

The 19-year-old’s prowess from the back of the court was on full display as he battled through fellow #NextGenATP player Coleman Wong, claiming a 6-4, 6-4 victory. Shang fell behind an early break in the second set but soon clicked into gear, rattling off four games on the spin to cross the line in one hour and 36 minutes. Sealed with a kiss 😘 Juncheng Shang defeats Coleman Wong 6-4 6-4 to reach the second round in Shanghai for the first time.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters | #NextGenATP pic.twitter.com/IdISvOa4Ek — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 2, 2024 Shang showed glimpses of the reliable tennis that propelled him to his maiden ATP Tour title at the Chengdu Open two weeks ago, establishing himself as the second Chinese man to lift a tour-level trophy. The No. 52 in the PIF ATP Rankings has set a popcorn second-round contest against World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz, who is fresh off claiming his fourth tour-level title of the year at the China Open in Beijing. “These three weeks have been unreal for me, I have been so positive on the court, trying to be happy, enjoying the crowd,” Shang said of his stellar run of form. “Against Carlos [Alcaraz], it’s never easy, he’s one of the best players in the world. Hopefully I can bring out some good energy.” [ATP APP] Shang wasn’t the only home hope to light up the courts on day one in Shanghai, with Wu Yibing claiming his first tour-level win of the 2024 season. The 24-year-old, who preceded Shang as the first Chinese man to lift an ATP Tour trophy at the Dallas Open last year, comprehensively defeated Sumit Nagal 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the second round. Denis Shapovalov secured the 200th tour-level win of his career with a thrilling triumph over Lorenzo Sonego. The Canadian held his nerve to clinch a 7-6(5), 7-6(8) victory over the Italian, edging 2-1 ahead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Elsewhere, Fabio Fognini survived a second-set fightback to overcome compatriot Luciano Darderi 6-4, 6-7(5), 6-4 for his first win in Shanghai since 2019, where he made the quarter-finals. It is the Italian’s eleventh appearance at the event, and he will face Tommy Paul for a spot in the third round. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz continued his perfect year against his great rival Jannik Sinner with a thrilling championship-match victory on Wednesday at the China Open. The Spaniard dug deep for a 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) triumph against World No. 1 Sinner to lift the title at the ATP 500 in Beijing. Alcaraz let slip a break lead in both the first and third sets but reeled off seven straight points from 0/3 in the deciding-set tie-break to prevail in an absorbing three-hour, 21-minute encounter, the longest match in tournament history. “He could [have won] in two, I could win in two, he could win in three. It was a really close match,” said Alcaraz. “Jannik, once again, he showed that he’s the best player in the world, at least for me. The level that he’s playing, it’s unbelievable. It’s a really high quality of tennis. Of shots, physically, mentally, he’s a beast.” BEIJING CHAMPION 🏆In a breathtaking final, @carlosalcaraz fights back to defeat the defending champion Sinner 6-7(6) 6-4 7-6(3) for the #ChinaOpen title!@chinaopen pic.twitter.com/idvMd6LRiz— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 2, 2024 Alcaraz now leads his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Sinner 6-4 after winning all three of their encounters this season (Indian Wells, Roland Garros, Beijing). The pair’s rivalry, which is set to remain a major headline-maker on the ATP Tour for years to come, has swung back and forth since their first tour-level clash in 2021, but this marks the first time that either man has won three matches in a row against the other. Sinner had won 18 of his past 19 tie-breaks heading into the deciding-set tie-break, but Alcaraz produced some of his best tennis of the match from 0/3 down to storm to victory. “I never lost hope,\" said Alcaraz. \"Honestly I knew that [when I started it] that every tie-break Jannik plays is almost to his side. I thought that in the third set, I’m not going to lie, 3-love down, two mini breaks for him. So I didn’t lose hope, but I thought, ‘Okay, I have to give everything that I have just to try to give myself the opportunity to be close.’ “I played great points just to make 3-all and after that I just thought to go for it. If I lost it, at least I went for it. So that’s all I thought in that moment.” [ATP APP] With his title run on the hard-courts of Beijing, Alcaraz became the first player to win an ATP 500 crown on all three surfaces (hard, clay and grass) in series history (since 2009). The 21-year-old will next join his rival Sinner in the field at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. “During the whole week I’ve been playing great tennis,” said Alcaraz of his Beijing run. “Probably sometimes the luck went to my side a little bit in the matches. But in general I feel great on court, I feel great off the court as well with my team. “It’s really important to feel like you are in a good mood all the time off the court, just try to show good tennis and be calm on the court. I think I couldn’t ask for a better week here in Beijing and I will try to keep going.” Victory for Alcaraz against Sinner also reduced the Spaniard’s deficit to the Italian in the race for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. However, the second-placed Alcaraz is still 2,820 points shy of first-placed Sinner in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which acts a barometer for the race for Year-End No. 1. Despite struggling to find his best level for much of the opening set in Wednesday's final, Sinner dug deep to recover from a 2-5 deficit and move ahead by winning the tie-break. Alcaraz had made a confident start and fired a series of blistering winners off his forehand wing early, but he was unable to close out any of the three set points he earned in the first set. Then came what were arguably the key moments in Alcaraz’s victory. He was under severe pressure on serve at 3-4 in the second set, but clinched a 14-minute game in which he fended off two Sinner break points. He went on to break serve himself in the very next game and, after levelling the match at one set all, Alcaraz built on his momentum by opening an early 3-1 lead in the decider. Sinner was not finished in his bid to become just the second man to successfully defend the Beijing crown after record-six-time champion Novak Djokovic, however. The Italian again recovered to force a tie-break before forging his 3/0 lead. Then came Alcaraz’s late heroics, which finally proved decisive in one of the most memorable matches of the 2024 season. Alcaraz’s prowess when moving forward was crucial to his marathon triumph. The four-time major winner claimed 74 per cent (25/34) of points at the net, according to Infosys ATP Stats, on the way to clinching his ninth consecutive tour-level win in the second-longest ATP Tour final this year after Hamburg (Fils d. Zverev in three hours, 33 minutes). “I had my chances in the first set, didn’t make it,\" said Alcaraz. \"Three set points, didn’t make it. But in general, I’m proud about myself with the way that I [played] the match, the way that I managed everything. Being a set down with a lot of opportunities in the second set... 4-3, break point down and to be able to come back after that… it has been a pretty good time, pretty good match. “I’m really happy that in the third set, even though he broke my serve again and we were really close, I gave myself the chance to keep going, playing aggressively and at the end I’m really happy that I made it.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

I couldn’t really power him off the court, but it also helped me sometimes. So, at the end of the day, I tried to focus on my game and use my serve and forehand as much as I can.” Monfils, the No. 46 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is making his seventh appearance in Shanghai, where his most memorable run came in 2013 after he downed Roger Federer en route to the quarter-finals. He will face Sebastian Baez in the second round this year at the ATP Masters 1000 event. [ATP APP] Earlier, Arthur Cazaux proved too good for Marin Cilic as the 22-year-old outlasted the Croatian with some calculated shotmaking to advance. Cazaux clinched a 6-4, 6-4 victory in one hour and 36 minutes. Cazaux, who set up a second-round clash with Tokyo finalist Ugo Humbert, was one of four French winners on day one in Shanghai. Arthur Rinderknech overcame Reilly Opelka, 6-4, 7-6(5) in a battle of two of the biggest servers on the ATP Tour, before Alexandre Muller put on the afterburners to finish with a flourish against Luca Nardi. Muller rallied to a 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 win over the Italian.  Botic van de Zandschulp also got his campaign underway with a sturdy 7-6(5), 6-2 win over Pablo Carreno Busta.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/medvedev-beijing-2024-sf-reaction",
    "description": "After Carlos Alcaraz defeated Daniil Medvedev in straight sets on Tuesday evening in the China Open semi-finals, something funny happened. Medvedev, who had lost, covered his mouth and began whispering to Alcaraz. The 28-year-old gestured to his chest, then his hair. Alcaraz found it hilarious and cracked up. “I told Carlos next match I'm going to paint my hair blond and put 'Botic' here. Maybe this can help,” Medvedev later said. “Today I played pretty well. I don't see how I could beat him today… Next match I need to try something. Maybe throw him off a little bit. But it's a joke, of course.”   Medvedev referenced Dutchman Botic van de Zandschulp, who stunned Alcaraz in the second round of the US Open. The Spaniard has not lost a set en route to the Beijing final. Although Medvedev fell short to Alcaraz in the ATP 500 semi-final, he was positive about his efforts in Beijing. The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated Gael Monfils, Adrian Mandarin and Flavio Cobolli. “The hard-court season, after the Olympic Games, et cetera, was not perfect for me. US Open was a bit better. Then Laver Cup was two tough losses. Okay, it was third-set tie-break,” Medvedev said. “Coming here, I was not feeling great in confidence, in the approach to my tennis. I won three great matches, playing good against three good players in two sets. I played very good against Carlos.” [ATP APP] Now Medvedev will turn his attention to the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he will try to earn his first title of the season. The fifth seed will face Thiago Seyboth Wild or qualifier Daniel Evans in his opening match. “I’m looking forward to Shanghai to try to continue this positive dynamic,” Medvedev said. “That's what I'm looking for.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-alcaraz-beijing-2024-final-preview",
    "description": "Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are 23 and 21, respectively. But they do not play like it, comport themselves like people that age, nor are they viewed as “young”. Both have already bloomed into full-blown superstars and are poised to lead the sport both at the present and into the future. Showdowns between the pair are not simply tennis matches. They are events, spectacles with the buildup of a heavyweight boxing fight, full of anticipation. Their clash in the final of the China Open on Wednesday will be no different. Alcaraz will take a 5-4 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series into the championship match of the ATP 500. But anything can happen as the two meet for the second consecutive year in Beijing. The only guarantee is excitement. “It’s going to be a tough match. We know each other very well now, but every match is different, so the situation on the court is also a bit different than it was the last two matches. But let’s see,” Sinner said after his semi-final win against Buyunchaokete. “I’m happy to be here again in the final.” Both men enter the clash on extended winning streaks. Sinner has emerged victorious from 15 consecutive matches and Alcaraz has won eight in a row. Sinner is in first in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin by a wide margin, leading second-placed Alcaraz by 2,990 points. The 23-year-old is in great position to become the first Italian to earn ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. He owns a 59-6 record compared to Alcaraz’s 47-9 mark, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. “My season is going very, very good and playing finals is always a great moment,” Sinner said. “I just hope tomorrow is going to be a good match from both of us.” Watch Beijing SF Highlights:   Alcaraz has won their two meetings this year — a three-setter at Indian Wells and a five-setter at Roland Garros — and claimed major trophies at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Sinner, who leads the Tour with six titles in 2024, triumphed at the Australian Open and US Open. It could come down to who is more opportunistic. Alcaraz has been more dominant in Beijing, reaching the final without dropping a set. However, both men have lost serve just three times, with Sinner saving 81 per cent of the break points he has faced (13/16) compared to 57 per cent for Alcaraz (4/7). People compare a big showdown in sport to a clash between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. But that insinuates one breaks down the other. Instead, Sinner and Alcaraz are like dance partners, bringing out the best in one another to produce some of the best tennis in recent memory. “Every time we play against [each other], it's a good match,” Sinner said after defeating Alcaraz in Beijing last year en route to the semi-finals. “We try to play on our limits.” [ATP APP] Both are incredible shotmakers who are capable of turning around a point at any moment. Sinner is a bit more steady in that regard, while Alcaraz is slightly more dynamic with his speed and court coverage. Do not be surprised when they smile at one another after a sensational point. The Sinner-Alcaraz Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry is the opposite of contentious. They are good friends, who even practised together in Villena last December at Juan Carlos Ferrero's eponymous academy. That is not to say that they cross their fingers in the hope of facing off. Alcaraz spoke to the media in Beijing after winning the tournament’s first semi-final against Daniil Medvedev. Who did he want to face, Sinner or Buyunchaokete? “Obviously Bu. I'm not going to lie,” Alcaraz said, cracking a smile. “Jannik is the best player in the world right now.” But both men will want the Beijing title badly. Sinner is trying to join Novak Djokovic as just the second man to successfully defend the China Open title. Alcaraz is attempting to become just the fourth man to claim the trophy without dropping a set (Marat Safin, Djokovic 3x and Andy Murray). The top two players in the world are ready to embrace the moment and put on a show once again. “I really like the battles,” Alcaraz said. “The toughest matches facing the best players in the world.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/shanghai-2024-scouting-report",
    "description": "The best players in the world are ready to take on the ATP Masters 1000 event of the Asian Swing, the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz lead the way, while all eyes will be on Novak Djokovic's return to tournament action. ATPTour.com looks at 10 things to watch in Shanghai. 1) Djokovic back in action: The Serbian, who played one Davis Cup match the week after the US Open, is playing his first tournament since the season’s final major, where he suffered a stunning third-round exit. Djokovic is a four-time champion in Shanghai, where he will try to climb into a Nitto ATP Finals qualifying position. The ninth-placed player in the PIF ATP Live Race will take on Buyunchaokete or #NextGenATP American Alex Michelsen in his opening match. 2) Sinner surging: The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has found a hot stretch of form, winning the Cincinnati Open, US Open and reaching the final in Beijing, where he will face Alcaraz. With six titles to his name this year, the Italian will try to add a Shanghai ATP Masters 1000 crown to his resume. Sinner will open against Taro Daniel or a qualifier. He could face Medvedev, Alcaraz and Djokovic during his run.   3) Alcaraz in form: The Spaniard has won two major titles this year at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, and shows no signs of slowing down. But the 21-year-old will need to be sharp from the start in Shanghai, where he debuted last year. Alcaraz will play a #NextGenATP opponent, Shang Juncheng or Coleman Wong, in the second round. 4) Medvedev former champ: Before the Covid-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of three consecutive editions of the Rolex Shanghai Masters, Medvedev lifted the trophy in 2019. The fifth seed has not yet won a title this season, but will keen to change that in China. He will play Thiago Seyboth Wild or a qualifier in the second round. 5) Chinese stars: Chinese men’s tennis is thriving more than ever. Zhang Zhizhen reached a career-high World No. 31 in July, Shang Juncheng claimed his first ATP Tour title just more than a week ago in Chengdu and Buyunchaokete is playing the best tennis of his life, having made his first tour-level semi-final in Hangzhou and another semi-final in Beijing. Wu Yibing, who became the first Chinese ATP Tour singles champion last year in Dallas, and Zhou Yi will also be in action. 6) Fils headlines #NextGenATP stars competing: Arthur Fils is the first-placed player in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and he brings momentum to Shanghai after claiming the title in Tokyo. The Frenchman plays Roberto Bautista Agut or Roberto Carballes Baena in the second round. Other #NextGenATP players to watch include Shang, Michelsen and Jakub Mensik, who begins his tournament against Pedro Martinez.   7) PIF ATP Live Race To Turin: Medvedev is next in line to qualify for the season finale, with Sinner, Alcaraz and Zverev already locked into a Turin spot. Behind Medvedev are fifth seed Taylor Fritz, sixth seed Casper Ruud and seventh seed Andrey Rublev, the 2023 Shanghai finalist, who will all try to consolidate their standing. Eighth-placed Alex de Minaur is out with injury, opening the door for the likes of Djokovic to shake up the Live Race. 8) Nishikori, Wawrinka among wild cards: Former Top 5 stars Kei Nishikori and Stan Wawrinka are among the wild cards at the season’s eighth Masters 1000 event. Nishikori made the semi-finals in 2011 and Wawrinka is a two-time Shanghai quarter-finalist. Wong, Wu and Zhou are the other three singles wild cards. [ATP APP] 9) Other players to watch: There are plenty of other players who will bring momentum to the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Sixteenth seed Humbert reached the final in Tokyo and will play Arthur Cazaux or Marin Cilic in the second round. Cilic just won a title in Hangzhou. Thirtieth seed Tomas Machac has been enjoying the best season of his career and just made the semi-finals in Tokyo. Ninth seed Grigor Dimitrov is trying to work his way into contention for a place at the Nitto ATP Finals, the event he won in 2017. 10) Tsitsipas Brothers, Fils/Shelton playing doubles: Marcel Granollers/Horacio Zeballos and Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic are the top two seeds in the doubles draws, but there will be no shortage of interesting teams to watch. Stefanos Tsitsipas is competing with his brother, Petros Tsitsipas, Fils is partnering Ben Shelton, Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev are playing together as are Alexander Bublik and Frances Tiafoe.

    "description": "The most gripping Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry of the moment will add another chapter on Wednesday when Jannik Sinner plays Carlos Alcaraz in the China Open final. Sinner set the blockbuster showdown with a 6-3, 7-6(3) victory against home favourite Buyunchaokete Tuesday evening in the Beijing semi-finals. “It’s going to be a tough match. We know each other very well now, but every match is different, so the situation on the court is also a bit different than it was the last two matches. But let’s see,” Sinner said in his on-court interview. “I’m happy to be again here in the final. My season is going very, very good and playing finals is always a great moment. I just hope tomorrow is going to be a good match from both of us.” That grip change tho 🤌@janniksin | @ChinaOpen | #ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/VeDM7xNI4f — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 1, 2024 One year ago, Sinner defeated Alcaraz in the Beijing semi-finals en route to lifting the trophy. It was part of his red-hot finish to the season that rolled into 2024, when the Italian became the first player from his country to claim the No. 1 PIF ATP Ranking. This time when they meet in Beijing, Sinner will bring to the court a 15-match winning streak. Alcaraz is in form himself, having claimed eight consecutive matches and won Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year.   Watch Extended Beijing SF Highlights: [ATP APP] Sinner needed to work hard to set the clash with his great rival. Buyunchaokete had only played one ATP Tour event entering last week’s ATP 250 in Hangzhou, but has proven himself capable of competing with the best players in the world. “Today was a very tough match because I didn’t know him at all, so in the beginning I didn’t know exactly what to expect. But then I tried somehow to get into the rhythm,” Sinner said. “I felt like the first set I was playing some good tennis and then in the second set I dropped a little bit of intensity, which then he raised his level. I had some chances in the second set also like yesterday to break a bit earlier. I couldn’t use them, so I tried to stay there mentally somehow, which a set can go very, very fast away, so I’m happy to be… back in the final here.” The pair traded blows from the baseline, which most players are unable to do with the powerful baseline Sinner. Both men played well under pressure, with the Italian saving all three break points he faced and the Chinese player saving eight of the nine opportunities against his serve. But Sinner was able to rely on his experience in the most critical moments, surging to a 6/1 lead in the second-set tie-break before finishing off his victory in two hours and four minutes. Now he is one win from joining Novak Djokovic as the only players in tournament history to successfully defend the China Open title. But the 23-year-old knows there is a big obstacle, Alcaraz, standing in his way. The Spaniard will take a 5-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead into their showdown. It will be their second meeting in a final — Sinner defeated Alcaraz in three sets for the Umag trophy in 2022. “Of course tomorrow is going to be completely different,” Sinner said. “We know each other very well. It’s going to be tactical, but I’m looking forward to it.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
