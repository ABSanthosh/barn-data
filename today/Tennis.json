As part of our Next Gen Influences series, Quinn caught up with ATPTour.com to talk about Sinner, Paul and other inspirations in his life. [ATP APP] We've had six Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champions at this point. Who do you look up to from that group? I feel like Jannik is a good example. I got to share the court with him last year in the Hamptons leading up to the US Open. I got to get his insights and everything. He's accomplished so much for being just a year or two older than I am, but just hearing his process and just what should be important for me, it was really nice getting to just chat with him. I actually walked into the locker room [during the US Open] and I saw him, and I was able to just give him a handshake, which I feel like a lot of the top guys, maybe they wouldn't do that for someone [like me]. I was ranked 250 in the world and I'm not from the same nation. To be able to be recognised by a guy like that is pretty nice, just to be able to get his thoughts. From a Grand Slam champion, I really appreciated it.  Is that a player who you identify your game with? A little bit. He is just so loose with both sides off the ground, he can absolutely crush the ball. I would like to try and replicate that maybe, being able to just blitz the ball on any certain occasion, but also have the natural touch and flare when coming to the net. From the Next Gen group, a lot of Americans have come through. You are close with Tommy Paul. What is your relationship like with him? Unique, I guess. He treats me as if I'm like his little brother. It is nice having someone that's gone through the sport and is at where he's at. He took a little bit longer to get to where he's at compared to maybe Frances [Tiafoe] or Taylor [Fritz]. So to be able to just get his insights and be able to hear how it's a marathon and it's not a race [has been important]. Everyone goes at their own time. And I feel like for myself, maybe it might take a few more years or a few more months for me to develop and get to where I really want to be, in comparison to maybe some of the other American Next Gen guys that are coming up right now as well. But just to have him as a mentor, he's really helped me through this year. I certainly had some tough moments where I wasn't really feeling like I was playing in a way that I felt comfortable in or just struggling mentally with not getting the results I was hoping for. So for him to take me under his wing and be able to explain to me how he went through the same things when he was younger [has been great]. [It has helped] to have him be able to just coach me through those moments where I could still go out and work every single day and try not to get bummed out about it, but still enjoy the entire process. Who was your biggest tennis idol growing up? The way that a player played, I think Juan Martin Del Potro. I absolutely loved watching him play, his forehand was just incredible. Some would like to say that my game is similar in a sense where big serve, big forehand and use the chip pretty often. I would like to say playing style, probably more towards Del Potro. But just willingness to win, I felt like it was Novak. I loved growing up watching Novak. My mom was a big Novak fan and so I think just with her passion for and love for Novak, I started to watch and enjoy just watching his competitiveness. I think from that side of things, I enjoyed watching him the most. [Del Potro's win] that stands out most to me is when he actually beat Novak in Rio in the Olympics, and just watching how passionate he was. That was just such a massive win for him. You could see the emotion after the match, for Novak as well. I remember seeing him walk off the court in tears and then Juan Martin was in tears as well just because he won. It's crazy just looking at that match. I eventually want to be able to play in the Olympics and compete for the United States. I think having that match kind of locked in my memory is pretty special, and to just see how passionate they were for the game and for that moment, hopefully I can get that in the future. Novak won the Olympics this year. What was it like seeing him do that after following him over the years? He's accomplished tennis. There's nothing more, I don't think, that he can win. It's pretty remarkable what he's done in his career. I know I'm very, very far from any of that. Hopefully I could get to just sniff a little bit of what he's accomplished. Seeing him win that, it's just incredible for him and just getting to share the locker room with a guy like that is pretty special for me. A lot of my teammates from [the University of] Georgia, they all ask me like, 'What's it like seeing Carlos or Novak or Jannik in the locker room?'  I'm like, 'Honestly, I try not to make it feel like they're anyone else'. You walk in the locker room and that's your competition. And so I try and walk in there and just try to enjoy the entire thing, but also recognise that these are the guys that hopefully I'm competing with in the future. Do you have an influence from other sports, maybe an athlete? I really enjoy Anthony Edwards [of the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves]. I love watching him play. He's just electric to watch. I love his trash talking, it is next level. I love his interviews. They're always entertaining to me. He came through Georgia. He left the year before I went there, but my strength and conditioning coach at Georgia, he was the same one that worked with Anthony Edwards, and so just hearing the stories about Anthony and what he was doing in the gym and how if guys were weren't doing what they should be, he held them accountable. I think he was a very, very good leader and kind of helped me when I was on my team, I learned things not even being there, but just hearing stories about how I could improve myself as a leader for our team and improve myself as a competitor.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/zverev-shanghai-2024-tuesday",
    "description": "Alexander Zverev survived a scare on Tuesday against Tallon Griekspoor in the third round of the Rolex Shanghai Masters, requiring eight match points to book his ticket to the last 16. With the triumph, Zverev is into the fourth round of a ninth consecutive ATP Masters 1000, still alive in his quest for a second title in 2024. The World No. 3 regrouped from an out-of-sorts second set to prevail 7-6(6), 2-6, 7-6(5) and extend his lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series to 5-1. “It was a tough match, going back and forth. I thought he was a bit lucky during the third set and I got very lucky in the tie-break, so we equalled each other out,” said Zverev, who is making his sixth appearance in Shanghai. “It was an incredible match, he is someone that I always struggle against. We always have extremely tough matches and, for me, he should be a lot higher ranked than he is. He needs to look at why he is not playing like that every single week. He could be Top 15, Top 10 in the world.” Moving 🔛@AlexZverev digs deep to get past Griekspoor 7-6(6) 2-6 7-5.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/GmESoEsB7a — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 8, 2024 Zverev, who improved to 59-18 on the season, trails only Jannik Sinner in match wins. The German will next face David Goffin. The Belgian is into the fourth round of an ATP Masters 1000 for the first time since the 2022 Madrid Open after rallying from a set deficit to overcome American Marcos Giron 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 in a gripping encounter. Zverev, who reached the Shanghai final in 2019, is bidding to win a fifth different ATP Masters 1000 title after triumphs in Rome (2017, 2024), Madrid (2018, 2021), Cincinnati (2021), and Canada (2017). He is also a two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion and has booked his spot for a seventh appearance this year in Turin. Zverev's resilience came to the fore in the dying embers of the opening set when he converted his second set point to swing the match in his favour. The 27-year-old, however, failed to capitalise on the momentum in an error-strewn set. [ATP APP] Girekspoor, No. 40 in the PIF ATP Rankings, only hit two unforced errors in set two en route to levelling the match at one set apiece. The Dutchman fended off eight break points - four of which were match points in the 12th game - in the deciding set to force a tie-break. It appeared as if the match was turning, but Zverev stormed to a 6/2 lead, producing four further opportunities to close out the clash. After some gutsy tennis from Griekspoor to reduce the deficit to just one point, the Dutchman's hard work was eventually undone by a routine forehand volley that sailed into the net, handing Zverev, who remains alive in his quest to reach the fourth round of all ATP Masters 1000s in 2024, victory on his eighth attempt.

    "description": "Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos wasted little time getting back to winning ways in their opening match at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Having lifted the title at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 last year, the Spaniard and Argentine began their 2024 campaign with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph against Miguel Reyes-Varela and John-Patrick Smith on Tuesday afternoon. Granollers and Zeballos won 85 per cent (35/41) of first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a 77-minute win. They will next take on Jamie Murray and John Peers, who beat Ugo Humbert and Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-0. [ATP APP] The second and third-seeded pairs in Shanghai could not join Granollers and Zeballos in the second round. Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen upset second seeds Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic 2-6, 6-3, 10-5. It was the Belgian duo’s first win in three Lexus ATP Head2Head clashes this year against Arevalo and Pavic, who lead the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. Toyko champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool continued their good form on the hard courts of Asia by downing third seeds Matthew Ebden and Lloyd Glasspool 7-6(6), 7-6(3). Their next assignment in Shanghai is a rematch against their Tokyo championship-match opponents, Ariel Behar and Robert Galloway. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic passed the latest test in his quest for a 100th tour-level title with flying colours on Tuesday as he overpowered Flavio Cobolli 6-1, 6-2 to advance to the fourth round at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. In a contest that thoroughly contrasted his opener against #NextGenATP American Alex Michelsen, Djokovic surged to a dominant win over Cobolli in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. “From the beginning I had a clear game plan of what I needed to do, staying aggressive and trying to use every short ball to take the initiative in the point,” said Djokovic, who improved to 34-8 on the season. “Cobolli was evidently exhausted after last night’s match [against Stan Wawrinka]. I think that has taken a toll, physically, on him today. “I haven’t played too many matches, I think the positive in that is that I’m fresh, so I am happy to play every day [for] as long as it takes.” Feeling right at home 🏡 @DjokerNole takes care of Cobolli 6-1 6-2 to return to the Round of 16 in Shanghai.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/YnTY7OadqN — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 8, 2024 Djokovic will next face Roman Safiullin, who battled back from a set and a break deficit to upset 13th seed Frances Tiafoe in an absorbing third-round clash. Safiullin struck 51 winners en route to a 5-7, 7-5, 7-6(5) victory, prevailing in three hours and four minutes. Rain delays in Shanghai meant that the fans were forced to wait until Tuesday to see the record four-time champion contest his third-round match, but they were treated to a vintage Djokovic performance under the lights. [ATP APP] Djokovic, who is making his first appearance at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 since 2019, was dialled in from the get-go, striking cleanly from both wings to control the baseline exchanges and surge into an early lead. He fired 11 winners in a 29-minute first set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Cobolli weathered the oncoming storm at the beginning of the second set to hold serve twice, but Djokovic kept his foot on the gas to dismantle the Italian’s serve in the fifth game. From there, Djokovic cruised to victory to boost his hopes of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin. The Serb is currently eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 220 points behind Andrey Rublev in seventh.   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Is the Rolex Shanghai Masters where Grigor Dimitrov makes his move in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin? The Bulgarian dealt with a tough third-round draw in style on Tuesday at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 event, where he overcame Alexei Popyrin 7-6(5), 6-2. Dimitrov held firm in a tight first set before accelerating to a victory in which he won 97 per cent (33/34) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. With his 40th tour-level victory of 2024, Dimitrov consolidated 10th place in the Live Race. The 33-year-old knows that a deep run in Shanghai could significantly boost his chances of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals, where he lifted the trophy on his only previous appearance in 2017. “One day at a time at the moment for me,” said Dimitrov, who has struggled on and off with injury since he was forced to retire from his US Open quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe in August. “There’s been so many things that have been moving around, and at the same time I’m very thankful to be out here again. At the same time, putting matches together under my belt, back-to-back, is very important for me.” Statement win 😮‍💨@GrigorDimitrov defeats Alexei Popyrin 7-6(5) 6-2 to reach the round of 16 in Shanghai for the third consecutive time.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/piumC1q1Ut— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 8, 2024 Dimitrov offered just 14 unforced errors to Popyrin’s 28 en route to levelling the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 2-2. With his 88-minute triumph, he also avenged his Masters 1000 defeat to Popyrin in August in Montreal, where the Australian saved three match points against Dimitrov in the third round before going on to lift the title. “I just had to stay in it. It’s a very difficult match,” said Dimitrov. “He’s such a good hitter. Serves amazing, and every high ball around the middle, he just punishes you. So I had to remain very calm and follow my gameplan. I think I was actually striking the ball very well, so I’m happy with the win.” Next up for Dimitrov in Shanghai is a fourth-round meeting with Jakub Mensik. The #NextGenATP Czech earlier downed Alexander Shevchenko 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-2. [ATP APP] Another Top 10 star, Taylor Fritz, also advanced with a straight-sets win on Tuesday. The American breezed past Yosuke Watanuki 6-3, 6-4 to reach the last 16 in Shanghai for the first time in five appearances. His opponent there will be 12th seed Holger Rune, who eased to a 6-4, 7-5 triumph against Jiri Lehecka. The 21-year-old Rune broke serve in the penultimate game of both sets to pull through for a one-hour, 50-minute win against the 33rd-seeded Lehecka. Wednesday’s meeting in Shanghai will be the third Lexus ATP Head2Head clash between Fritz and Rune. Both their previous encounters also came at Masters 1000 events: Fritz prevailed in a fourth-round clash in Miami in 2023, before Rune gained revenge with a fourth-round win in Indian Wells earlier this season.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tsitsipas-muller-shanghai-2024-tuesday",
    "description": "Stefanos Tsitsipas will rekindle his rivalry with Daniil Medvedev after beating Alexandre Muller on Tuesday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The Greek's 6-3, 7-5 win set up a 14th Lexus ATP Head2Head matchup with Medvedev, their first meeting in nearly a year. In a match delayed two days by rain, Tsitsipas was in command against Muller until he lost serve in his attempt to close out the match at 5-3 in set two. But he regrouped to break at love in the final game, finding the range on his forehand to bring up match points and then ripping the shot of the match — a wicked, running forehand pass — to seal the deal. “I lost concentration [after] I was able to play well during the entire match,” reflected Tsitsipas, when asked about losing serve late on. “I guess it brought a bit of frustration into me, because I had two nets that jumped off the net court and landed out. One on my serve, one on my forehand. It was a question of millimetres to get it over. “A few unforced errors here and there caused the break. I did get frustrated because I didn't feel like I deserved that particular break… Regardless of that, I continued. I know that I've been faced with moments like this before, and my biggest asset has been removing those negative thoughts, getting back into the match, and making things work again.” Hear him roar 🦁@steftsitsipas navigates Muller 6-3 7-5 to set up a Round of 16 clash with Daniil Medvedev.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/rdhiFTKhOf — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 8, 2024 The 10th seed picked up his 200th hard-court win by beating Kei Nishikori in his opener and saved the first six break points he faced in Shanghai — three against Nishikori and three against Muller — before a net cord sent a groundstroke long to hand Muller a lifeline. After firing 14 aces against Nishikori, Tsitsipas managed seven against Muller according to Infosys ATP Stats. He expertly backed up his serve against the Frenchman, winning more than 70 per cent of points on both his first and second deliveries. Through to the last 16 at an ATP Masters 1000 for the fourth time this year, the reigning Monte-Carlo champion will next face fifth seed Medvedev for a place in the Shanghai quarter-finals. Medvedev won his first five meetings against Tsitsipas before the Greek answered back with a group-stage win en route to the 2019 Nitto ATP Finals title. Medvedev leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head 9-4, including wins in both of their 2023 meetings, in the Rome and Vienna semi-finals. “He's someone that likes courts like this,” said Tsitsipas of 2019 Shanghai champion Medvedev. “I feel like I'm getting better with time. I feel like I've developed some good shots over the last few weeks. So far, I'm happy with the way my tennis is showing. “What is missing is trying to get a good win under my belt, and that for sure will ensure and will redeem my efforts for so far of trying to get better. My whole goal is to get out there, play the best tennis that I can, and let the rest be done on its own.” [ATP APP] In an all-French matchup, Gael Monfils upset 16th seed Ugo Humbert 7-6(7), 2-6, 6-1. The 38-year-old is the second-oldest player to reach the last 16 in Shanghai history, behind only Roger Federer (also 38) in 2019. Humbert was playing in his third straight match against a countryman after losing to Arthur Fils in the Tokyo final and beating Arthur Cazaux to open his Shanghai campaign. \"It's never easy to play Ugo, he's really aggressive, playing fast off both wings and takes a lot of time from you,\" said Monfils, who will next play third seed Carlos Alcaraz, whom he beat in three sets in Cincinnati. \"Carlos is playing really well now, he's in a confident mood [having] just won a tournament [China Open], so that's going to be a tough one for sure.\"   A pair of Czechs also advanced in Tuesday's early action: #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik beat Alexander Shevchenko 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-2, while 30th seed Tomas Machac defeated Australian qualifier Aleksandar Vukic 6-4, 6-2. The 19-year-old Mensik sits comfortably in fourth place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah and could rise ahead of Shang Juncheng and Alex Michelsen into second place with a deep run this week. Fourteenth seed Ben Shelton continued his perfect start in Shanghai with a straight-sets win against Roberto Carballes Baena, prevailing 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and seven minutes. The American rattled down eight aces and 24 winners, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to setting up an intriguing fourth-round clash with top seed Jannik Sinner. It is a repeat of last year’s fourth-round clash, which Shelton claimed in a deciding-set tie-break. Sinner now leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-1, but Shelton will aim to take inspiration from last year’s triumph over the Italian. Tomas Machac continues to enjoy his maiden appearance in Shanghai with another statement victory, defeating qualifier Aleksander Vukic 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the fourth round. The Czech will next play eleventh seed Tommy Paul, who produced one of the comebacks of the year against Alejandro Tabilo to reach this stage. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Flavio Cobolli has enjoyed one of the biggest rises of any player during the 2024 season and on Tuesday, he will get to test just how far he has come. The Italian, who is at a career-high No. 30 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will face 99-time tour-level titlist Novak Djokovic in the third round of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Before the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, ATPTour.com looks at five things to know about the 22-year-old Cobolli. Flavio dreamt of facing Novak While Cobolli has a great relationship with fellow Italians like Fabio Fognini, he idolised Djokovic. “He’s my idol since when I started to play tennis. I grew up with his videos, his matches and now I’m still going to bed, to sleep with his shots [in my mind],” Cobolli said after defeating Stan Wawrinka Monday in the Shanghai second round. “It’s a great thing to play against him and I want to enjoy every point I will do on this court.” The Italian will try to secure the first Top 10 win of his career. He will arrive on court with an 0-7 record against the elite group. He has broken through in 2024 Last year, Cobolli stepped onto the big stage when he competed in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. But in 2024, he has taken his game to a whole new level. Entering the year, Cobolli had never climbed higher than World No. 95 and owned just six tour-level wins. This season alone has has earned 34 tour-level victories, won at least one match at all four majors and advanced to his first ATP Tour final in Washington. “I was shaking, shaking for all the time. I can't describe the emotion because it's my first time everywhere,” Cobolli said after defeating Ben Shelton to reach the final. “Every tournament is my first time. Every match is my first time. I can prove I can learn from every match.” Flavio’s father was a professional and is now his coach Stefano Cobolli, Flavio’s father, climbed to No. 236 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Ironically, he owns a win against Wawrinka, whom his son defeated Monday in Shanghai. Stefano is now Flavio’s coach. However, their professional partnership only began when Flavio was 17. “He always told me, ‘You have to improve alone. You have to make your life alone, and then I will help you later’,” Cobolli recalled. “‘I’d like to make this work so I can help you later, when you are ready.” [ATP APP] His close friend is a star football player Cobolli is a huge AS Roma fan. One of his best friends, Edoardo Bove, played for the team. The Italians met when they were seven, played football together and have been close ever since. Bove is currently competing for Fiorentina, on loan from Roma. “We keep in touch every day. We have a big relationship. Also, when I'm home, we go to make dinner with our girlfriends, so we have a good relationship also with his family. When I win a match, his father is the first to write to me,” Cobolli said. “We started with tennis, because he was a tennis player also. And then we met in Trigoria, the place where Roma practises.” Cobolli likes tattoos and has many The Italian has several tattoos — some visible while he competes, and some not. One of his most meaningful tattoos is a quote from his idol, football legend and until last month AS Roma manager Daniele De Rossi. It reads: “Sei tu l unica mia sposa sei tu I unico mio amor”. In English, that means: “You are my only wife, you are my only love”. That is a saying De Rossi would put on his captain’s armband when he was a player. 💪 pic.twitter.com/SYqV5IsxQW — Flavio Cobolli (@cobollifla) February 6, 2024 Other tattoos include the saying “going for the win” in Italian, others in Chinese meaning “brave” and “passion”, the wolf of Roma and the symbol of Florence. He also has mountains and what he calls a “grumpy face”. Coblli added: “I like to make tattoos, because I like [having] my body painted, and so there is no reason about that. I just like it. I wake up and I go.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Nishesh Basavareddy will not soon forget Sunday at the ATP Challenger Tour 75 event in Tiburon, California, where the 19-year-old claimed his maiden trophy at that level in his home state. #NextGenATP Basavareddy is the second American teen to triumph on the ATP Challenger Tour this season, alongside fellow California native Learner Tien, who won in Bloomfield Hills and Las Vegas. Basavareddy, who fell to Tien in the Bloomfield Hills final, lost in his three previous title match appearances on the Challenger Tour, but he had no trouble in Tiburon. He raced past Eliot Spizzirri 6-1, 6-1 in just 61 minutes. The World No. 193 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings was aggressive on return, dropping just four second-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.[ATP APP] “I think that is definitely a big asset in my game and probably one of the biggest strengths in my game,” Basavareddy told commentator Mike Cation. “I think that can go a long way because a lot of these guys serve big and if you can neutralise the serves and almost get ahead in the point, I feel like I’m just as good as all these guys from the baseline. “Especially second-serve points, my coach always says, ‘Second-serve return points and second-serve points won kind of decide who is winning matches all the time because everyone can defend their first serve really well and win points there’. If you can defend your second serve and attack other guys’ second serve, you can win a lot of matches. I think that’s been a big focus for me.” This season marks the first time that multiple American teenagers have lifted a Challenger trophy in the same year since 2017, when Frances Tiafoe, Michael Mmoh and Stefan Kozlov achieved the feat. It is just the fifth time in the past 30 years.Welcome to the club, Nishesh Basavareddy ✊The 19-year-old cruises past Spizzirri 6-1, 6-1 in Tiburon to claim his first career Challenger title!#ATPChallenger | @usta pic.twitter.com/6VxzWGdXN6— ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) October 6, 2024 Basavareddy, who finished No. 12 in the ITA singles rankings this past May competing for Stanford University, is the 20th different Challenger champion of 2024 with college tennis experience. Up five places to tenth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Basavareddy is aiming for maiden qualification to the 20-and-under Next Gen ATP Finals, which runs from 18-22 December.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rune-berrettini-shanghai-2024-monday",
    "description": "A long wait for his opening match at the Rolex Shanghai Masters proved to be worth it for Holger Rune. The Dane delivered a resilient performance to down Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in a high-quality encounter on Monday at the ATP Masters 1000. After Rune received a bye in the opening round, his second-round clash with Berrettini was originally scheduled for Saturday. Although persistent rain ultimately kept the players waiting two days longer, they did not disappoint when they finally stepped onto Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena. Rune withstood 16 aces from Berrettini, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a comeback victory featuring plenty of cat-and-mouse exchanges. The 12th seed stayed patient on return to notch late breaks of serve in both the second and third sets and claim his maiden Shanghai win at the second attempt. Coming up clutch 💪@holgerrune2003 outlasts Berrettini 4-6 6-4 6-3 to advance in Shanghai.@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/h9g3ZHlBbT — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 7, 2024 “I think [the match] was pretty good,” said Rune, who now leads Berrettini 3-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “It felt like he didn’t do many things wrong in the first set. I made a few errors, but then he was just on me. He didn’t allow me to make many mistakes. I think the same happened in the second and third sets, just the other way around. Every time he got slightly central or short, I was there to punish his shots. “It was a good match, honestly. I think the tennis was very high quality. We were hitting a lot of winners, good serves, good movement, so I’m very happy to start my tournament like this.” [ATP APP] Now 13-7 at Masters 1000 events in 2024, Rune will meet 33rd seed Jiri Lehecka for a spot in the fourth round in Shanghai. The 21-year-old seeks a deep run this week to help kick-start a late charge towards Nitto ATP Finals qualification: Rune is up one spot to 15th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin after defeating Berrettini, and he could rise as high as eighth by lifting the title in China. “I think I’ve been consistent in many tournaments, but haven’t really gone all the way,” said Rune, whose best result this year was a final run in Brisbane. “It’s just a process. Keep working, keep trying to do the right things. From my side there was a big change from the first set to the last two sets. I was hitting the ball better. I was moving more up to the ball, playing more on my terms, aggressively coming forward. “I’m happy with the way I started this tournament. I think that’s the way for me to play and I’m going to keep going like this.”   In the final match of the day, Flavio Cobolli edged Stan Wawrinka to set a third-round meeting with record-four-time champion Novak Djokovic. The Italian prevailed 6-7(6), 7-6(4), 6-3 on his Shanghai debut despite Wawrinka sending down 17 aces in the pair’s maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. It was a Tour-leading 18th deciding-set victory of the season for Cobolli, who is competing in China at a career-high No. 30 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The 22-year-old is now 34-25 for the season.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fritz-atmane-shanghai-2024-monday",
    "description": "It may have taken 48 hours, but Taylor Fritz ensured his big plans for the final stretch of the 2024 season remain on course with a hard-earned opening victory Monday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The American kept his cool in the face of a free-spirited performance from Terence Atmane to secure a 7-6(4), 7-6(5) triumph at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000. After rain forced the second-round clash to be suspended with Fritz leading 4-3 on serve on Saturday afternoon, the seventh seed on Monday completed a two-hour, three-minute victory under the roof inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena. The US Open finalist Fritz remains fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is in a strong position to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals, where he made his debut in 2022. Yet the American was determined to take things one step at a time after passing a tough test from Atmane in the pair’s maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash. “I don’t want to speak too soon, but I think I’m in a good position,” said Fritz. “I’m not thinking so much about the goal of reaching the finals right now, because I’m fifth in the Race. If the goal is that and I get panicky, it would be like, ‘Let’s just not slip four spots’. My goal right now is to finish the year in the Top 5, keep my place. I think that’s just a better mindset to have, both to qualify for the finals and play good tennis for the rest of the year.” Firing on all cylinders 🔥@Taylor_Fritz97 keeps his perfect Shanghai opening round record intact, defeating Atmane 7-6(4) 7-6(5).@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/Aejpiu9R4L — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 7, 2024 Against Atmane, Fritz crucially saved the only two break points of the opening set from 15/40 in the ninth game, and after clinching the first-set tie-break he established a 4-2 lead in the second set. The Frenchman continued to push Fritz, but the American again found something extra late on to clinch the second set in a tie-break. “I think his ability to basically hit a winner from anywhere on the court made it very tough,” said Fritz. “Because sometimes I almost felt like if I wanted to be the aggressor in the rally, I had to go on when I maybe didn’t want to go on. Then sometimes I had to take just a more defensive, solid approach to the points, let him pull the trigger and if he makes it, he makes it. “That uncertainty of, 'What if he does make it?' is always uncomfortable. He was playing really well, serving well on big points, so it’s great to get through that in two sets.” Fritz’s next assignment in Shanghai will be a third-round clash on Tuesday against Yosuke Watanuki. The 26-year-old Fritz is now 5-0 in opening rounds at the Chinese Masters 1000, but is yet to reach the fourth round across his five appearances. [ATP APP] Another Top 10 star and Turin hopeful, Grigor Dimitrov, also completed victory Monday in a rain-affected second-round clash. The Bulgarian led Zizou Bergs 6-3, 2-4 when their meeting was suspended on Saturday, and upon resumption he battled to a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 triumph. Dimitrov converted five of seven break points he earned against Bergs, according to Infosys ATP Stats, as the 2017 Nitto ATP Finals champion consolidated 10th place in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will hope to build on his good start in Shanghai when he takes on Alexei Popyrin in the third round.

The 13th seed prevailed 6-2, 6-4 against #NextGenATP home favourite Zhou Yi. It was a first win in Shanghai since 2017 for Tiafoe, who will next play Roman Safiullin.

The Day 6 schedule at the ATP Masters 1000 event was reduced to nine singles matches, with play cancelled for the day on outdoor courts. The action continued uninterrupted inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, which is fitted with a retractable roof. All cancelled matches from Monday, which include Stefanos Tsitsipas' meeting with Alexandre Muller and all doubles matches, have been rescheduled for Tuesday. Taylor Fritz kicked off the Monday action under the roof by completing a 7-6(4), 7-6(5) second-round victory, one which began on Saturday before a two-day rain delay, against Terence Atmane. The No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings was followed onto court by his fellow Top 10 star Grigor Dimitrov, who overcame Zizou Bergs 6-3, 3-6, 6-2.

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz was forced to battle hard on Sunday as he earned his eleventh consecutive win to advance to the Rolex Shanghai Masters fourth round. The World No. 2 showed glimpses of his most scintillating tennis as he soared to a 7-6(5), 6-3 win over wild card Wu Yibing, his 50th tour-level win of the year. Having clinched his fourth title of the season at the China Open earlier this week, Alcaraz remains unbeaten since his shock second-round exit at the US Open and has now claimed 100 hard-court wins. “He is recovering his level. He’s coming back from injury, but his level deserves to be at the top for sure,” Alcaraz said of Wu. “If he keeps playing at this level, I’m pretty sure I’m going to see him around more often. I’m just really happy to get through. “I don’t want to say I was surprised, but it was the first time I was playing against him. He just beat [Nicolas] Jarry really easily, 6-2, 6-2, so that’s impressive. I had to be focused on playing my best. I’m not used to feeling the feelings I had on the court. He is a really powerful player, plays really strong, so I felt like I was not dominating the game.” He's DONE IT 🔥@carlosalcaraz takes out Yibing Wu 7-6 6-3 to advance in Shanghai!@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/S3Old8385b — ATP Tour (@atptour) October 6, 2024 Chinese men’s tennis has undergone an eye-catching rise during the Asian swing, but Alcaraz is proving to spoil the party after he defeated #NextGenATP star Shang Juncheng in his Shanghai opener. Leading 3/1 in the tie-break, Wu appeared to be in a strong position to clinch the opening set but Alcaraz held his nerve to storm into the lead. The Spaniard, who found himself in a similar position on Wednesday in the deciding set of the Beijing final against Jannik Sinner, was again able to reproduce a thrilling tie-break comeback. [ATP APP] For large parts of the opening set, Wu ignited some of the tennis that helped him become China’s first ATP Tour champion in Dallas in 2023. Although he lost the tie-break, he continued to push Alcaraz in the second set. The 24-year-old dug deep and made Alcaraz work for his service games but a slight lapse in concentration in the sixth game handed the Spaniard an ultimately decisive break. From there, Alcaraz kept his foot on the gas and crossed the finish line with conviction, finishing with 23 winners in his victory, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Alcaraz is set to face either Gael Monfils or Tokyo finalist Ugo Humbert for a spot in the last eight in Shanghai. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Jannik Sinner showcased his resilience in a gripping comeback win on Sunday to advance to the fourth round of the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The World No. 1 passed the test posed by Tomas Martin Etcheverry, prevailing 6-7(3), 6-4, 6-2 in two hours and 39 minutes to improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. \"It was a very tough match, physically [and] mentally, so I am very happy to get through this one,\" said Sinner, who is seeking a seventh title in 2024 in Shanghai. \"I felt like it was a tough set that I lost. I had my chances [to win the set], but these things can happen. \"Sometimes you have to wait for your chances, which I have done, trying to stay calm mentally, and today that was the key.\" Come for the speed, stay for the forehand 🤩@janniksin | @SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/w3wWs8O6JC— ATP Tour (@atptour) October 6, 2024 Sinner will face either Roberto Carballes Baena or Ben Shelton to secure his spot in the quarter-finals. If he is to face Shelton, the No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings, it would be an intriguing repeat of last year's fourth-round clash, which the American won in a deciding-set tie-break. Both players had opportunities to snatch the opening set, but it was Etcheverry who held his nerve. Facing two set points, the Argentine turned defence into attack with ease to rally out of trouble and pull clear in a tie-break. The 25-year-old won six from seven net points in the opening set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, underpinned by a delightful drop volley to bring up three set points before converting at the first opportunity. [ATP APP] Aiming to match his career-best run in Shanghai, Sinner found an extra gear at the start of the second set. Despite exchanging breaks in the fifth and sixth games, the 23-year-old remained concentrated to level the contest at one set apiece. Etcheverry did well to weather the oncoming storm, saving three break points in the first game of the decider, but the further pressure from Sinner on return eventually proved too much for the World No. 37 as he dropped serve in the third game. From there, Sinner kept his foot on the gas, withstanding three more break points in a lengthy sixth game before cruising to victory. The top seed, who notched the 250th tour-level win of his career against Taro Daniel in the second round, is in strong contention to lift his seventh title of the season after falling short to Carlos Alcaraz in the China Open final last week.

    "description": "Play at the Rolex Shanghai Masters was restricted to Stadium Court on Sunday due to heavy rain. All matches on outside courts were cancelled and rescheduled for Monday at the ATP Masters 1000 event. With a retractable roof on the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, Daniil Medvedev and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner were able to contest their third-round matches in China. They notched three-set wins against Matteo Arnaldi and Tomas Martin Etcheverry, respectively. [ATP APP] Carlos Alcaraz's battle against home hope Wu Yibing is next up on the Stadium Court schedule. Eleventh seed Tommy Paul will then conclude Sunday’s play when he takes on Alejandro Tabilo in a bid to extend his 1-0 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Taylor Fritz, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Holger Rune were among the singles stars waiting to get underway on the outside courts, but their contests will now take place on Monday. All doubles matches were also moved to Monday, when top seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos will aim to kick-start their title defence. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
