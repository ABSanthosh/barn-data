    "description": "There's no motivation in life like receiving a hard-earned reward—our brains are literally wired this way.  When it comes to work, you might hope that that reward would be increased compensation that matches your increased contribution and efforts. But, unfortunately, at a lot of organizations, showing a willingness to take on more work is only showing that you're willing to be paid less for it, leaving you with more to do in the same amount of time with little to no increased compensation. Let's be honest: we live in a world where no one wants to let go of any money they don't have to, and if there are no outside pressures encouraging your employer to pay you more, it's not going to happen—just like asking your landlord to lower your rate isn't going to eventuate any time soon either.As it's often said, \"The second mouse gets the cheese,\" and sometimes being the first \"go-getter\" to stick your neck out is only going to do you harm. Being the first mouse in this situation is only going to spring the trap, netting you, in this case, with more work than your fellows. Meanwhile, you're going to be fighting your employer all the way to give you a raise or increase your compensation to match your newfound responsibilities.That all being said, it remains that some of the best opportunities come from working hard for the right people who are willing to reward you for what you prove to them you're capable of. So, who is to say what the right approach is?This, of course, was the topic of conversation in this online discussion after this worker shared how their boss refused to give them more compensation to go with their ever-increasing responsibilities. They shared their experience with this online community, sparking responses from community members.See the original post along with some key responses from that original thread, below.",

Sure, in theory, any two people should be able to make their relationship work if they get along. But let's be real here: if your partner works a job where you end up seeing far too little of them, love may not, in fact, conquer all.These Redditors shared the various forms of employment they feel are red flags for them, and as many folks in the comments section suggested, this can sometimes feel like a catch-22. Considering that virtually every major industry is mentioned, one would think that they would be better off being unemployed if they wanted a serious relationship. However, of course, most folks don't want that either. Keep scrolling below for this collection of jobs that, according to some single people, are instant red flags.

Sometimes, you'll board the plane and the seat next to you will remain empty for 90% of the boarding process until some random annoying dude who was running late makes it onto the plane at the last minute. Other times, you're seated next to a screaming child who is on his very first flight. Here, we have a passenger who had to deal with an entitled seatmate. This guy quickly took over both armrests and encroached upon the personal space of the Redditor. We have to give this Redditor some credit for refusing to allow this behavior for the full duration of a four hour flight. Instead, they got even in their own petty way.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "When you've been entrusted with the care of children, it's a little difficult to do your job without telling them what to do. Adult input to keep things moving in the right direction is essential to their safety and happiness, and it's kind of impossible to get anything done without it. With that considered, you'd be foolish, as the parent employing said child-carer, to tell that child-carer that they were unable to give your children instruction and \"parent\" them. As if—what? You just expect that your kids are going to behave like sweet little angels without any input whatsoever? Chances are even greater—if you're a parent who thinks and acts this way—that your kids definitely don't know how to be polite and behave due to their parent's consistent enabling of their entitled behavior.This mother fully regretted telling her children's nanny to cast off the reigns and let her little terrors have free reign before turning it in and quitting on the spot.",

    "description": "Getting to reply to your most irritating customer would be a dream come true for many food service workers. Normally if a customer complains about the service, the worker has to fetch their manager and let them handle it, or they have to meet the complaints with a smile and just let the insults roll off their shoulders. However, complaining in an online review leaves some room for creativity, as this server, u/human_ken_doll, found out.This waiter shared a lengthy \"review\" from a diner who was super unhappy with the service. She rated the value, atmosphere, service, and food all with one out of five stars. She then went on to whine about the meal, which took place during a busy Sunday dinner hour. She was upset about numerous things: the staff seemed stressed and rushed, they'd run out of pork roast, and were unhappy that they had to wait about 10 minutes for bread and an hour for their food to arrive. That is quite a long wait, but unfortunately that's just par for the course at some popular dining establishments. You can check out this person's review, as well as the restaurant's response below, and see for yourself if this diner was being reasonable with her review or not. Up next, read about the artist who was utterly mortified to realize they'd destroyed another artist's big project.",

This early, immediate, and measurable success creates the validation necessary for managers—and really anyone in a position of authority—causing them to fall further and further into the pitfall that is micromanagement.  Other than the fact that it ruins morale and generally makes everyone you're working with miserable, micromanagement presents some problems: namely, you'll reach a point, a limit, where you can't possibly handle every request. Everything needing to pass across your desk will make you a bottleneck within the organization, stalling projects as you struggle to handle everything.Education is important, but it isn't everything, and it's important to be practical and work with the people around you rather than preaching what you know (or think you know) to them.This MBA-wielding new manager stormed onto the scene touting lessons about leadership or efficiency despite not knowing much about the application of either. Micromanaging was more of his wheelhouse, and he wanted to be involved in everything, even the most \"trivial\" matters. This led to his downfall, as the team began inundating him with endless requests and pointless emails, swamping the efficiency and productivity of the entire team.",

When you're rooming randomly, there's always a chance that the folks who seemed cool on Facebook are actually raging weirdos with anger issues. You might even end up with entitled roommates who are Class A moochers who were never told \"no\" in their lives. Living on mom and dad's money takes all the fun out of college—so these entitled roommates decide to pick on the original poster (OP), who pays his way through school by himself.The original poster lives with three roommates, two of which are exceptionally entitled. The OP buys and cooks his own food with a tight budget, yet his roommates always insist that he cook for them. After getting badgered by the roommates for a long while, the OP asked them to pay up if he was going to cook them up something good. The fee was a meager $5, a sum that all of the roommates could afford comfortably. After the OP cooks for them, they refuse to pay up. Well, that led to the OP never cooking for them again, and rightfully so.One fateful day, he comes home from work to see all of his food (as well as his GameCube console) gone. So, the OP hides all of the roommates' electronics, and out of anger, the roommates admit to everything they did. The funny part about that? The OP paid a fella to record the whole thing.

    "description": "This person didn't mince words when describing their \"worst job I've ever worked.\" It's a common sentiment among call center workers: people seem to either adore the job and stay for years, or loathe it and leave ASAP. Some people don't mind the grueling work of dealing with upset individuals who need their problems solved yesterday. These workers have patience and the ability to stay calm under pressure. This person found that it was hard to fake sympathy for people who were extremely upset, since they often hurled insults or yelled at them. Some customers will just prevent themselves from getting help. For example, some will refuse to tell the phone operator basic info like their name or birthday because they \"should already know that information.\" Or, like this person, who kept insisting to be transferred elsewhere, despite the call rep knowing that wouldn't solve the issue. Oh well, if the customer's always right, I guess you'll just have to do exactly what they've asked for…Up next, see who you side with in this case of two siblings who can't agree on a Thanksgiving dinner, with one sibling saying, \"My mom thinks I'm putting turkey over my own family.\"",

    "description": "Organizing a kid's birthday party is no easy feat. You have to cater to the desires of your child while also enforcing limits and boundaries so as to not spoil them. You have to be respectful of your guests' experience while balancing that with the experience of the birthday kid. It's a lot to manage, and not everyone is up to the challenge.This Redditor's coworker was planning a birthday party for his daughter, only to discover from the school that there was a new policy requiring parents to invite everyone in the class to birthday festivities to avoid conflicts. Unfortunately, this meant inviting problematic children that his daughter not only didn't like but who were also actively unfriendly to other kids. Thankfully, the Redditor stepped in to give their coworker an idea that would simultaneously comply with the rules but would also keep those problematic kids away.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

Mind you, OP noted that the three of them were siting toward the back of the plane and they were not in a rush to get onto a connecting flight. They were simply being obnoxious. So OP found the best way to block them from getting off, and they ended up not making it to baggage claim until at least five minutes after he got there. Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "Some people assume the worst of others, declaring everyone else to be lazy, foolish, or otherwise plotting and scheming something nefarious. But let's be honest, they're probably doing so to deflect from their own shortcomings—which are probably the exact same things they're accusing others of.Having one of these people as your boss or employer is, of course, going to ensure you a terrible time during every moment you're at work, with constant accusations of slacking, skiving, and even stealing, keeping you constantly on your toes and on edge wondering when the latest barrage of imputations is going to be launched your direction.It's hard to ever allow yourself to relax when chances are that your boss will choose that exact moment to pounce and take your moment of reprieve as evidence of your lack of commitment. Really, all you can do is make sure that you avoid confrontation and find little ways to show them that their micromanaging isn't going to get them anywhere or help anyone.This cook was accused of slacking off when she was texting her husband to see how their sick kitten was faring, taking just a moment to check up and ease her worries. Her boss, who was entirely unsympathetic, began demanding that she \"get to cleaning\" the kitchen, prompting the cook to deep clean the entire thing.",

Because when there's nobody to judge your outfit besides a couple of servers, an old coffee machine, and your dusty ol' laptop, you might as well dress for comfort. However, the micromanager in this story decided to muck up the dynamics of a department where he didn't belong. After a long-standing manager found a newer, better job with another company, there was a leadership vacuum in the IT department downstairs. Without a thought, the position was filled by a brown-nosing, nitpicking manager who decided that he wanted to change the place up to fit HIS idea of the ideal computer department. But u/richie65 didn't want to see his 'office attire' get reduced to unSUITable discomforts. Read on for the whole story (and eventual firing) of a micromanager with no sense for fashion.",

If you went to college, then you know how grueling finals week is. Non-stop hours of studying and working. Taking a break to call your mom just isn't a viable option, getting any sleep hardly is! So, mothers should know better than to freak out if their college kid is not answering their phone.

Unsurprisingly, most employees see a work dress code as a hindrance, viewing their suit-clad boss as a corpo baboon instead of an innovator. In recent years, it's not the best dressed in the room who's the most powerful and influential. Most likely, the richest guy in the room is the dude in a white t-shirt a nice pair of jeans, and a $40,000 understated watch on his wrist. After years of working for a strictly suited company, u/mdlapla, and his coworker buddies had to sit through a mandated meeting about the importance of 'suiting up'. Yuck.

    "description": "Some jobs seem like great opportunities in theory, but in practice, things can go awry pretty quickly. Here, we have a social media strategist who was hired by a boutique dentist's office and was tasked with making video content for his new boss. However, after requesting a W2 on day one, his new employer kept delaying drawing up any paperwork. It became crystal clear to the new hire that this was not going to work out, as he was putting in over 40 hours a week and still had not had the opportunity to sign that initial paperwork. Additionally, it wasn't worth the commute, gas, and tolls every day. So when he confronted his boss about his imminent departure, the dentist tried to make payment a front desk issue. Keep scrolling below to see how the employee dug his heels into the ground and refused to go away until he was properly compensated for those two weeks.

    "description": "Why is it, that signing up for a subscription is so much easier than canceling it? It's a money-grab tactic practiced by big corporations, where they are in most cases legally protected from folks demanding refunds left and right because they didn't read the fine print. Another tactic is giving consumers a free trial for a week, then failing to remind them that they're about to be billed X amount of dollars for the month or year. It's a headache and a half, especially when they revoke their subscription-tier services if you cancel before the trial period is up. What about certain corporations that have bugs in their apps that aren't fixed yet?The original poster of this story had a friend who purchased a subscription on a dating app. After about a week, his friend was unable to cancel the subscription because the app was sending him in circles without completing the cancellation. Then, when his friend tries to speak to representatives on the matter, he's still sent in multiple directions in an attempt to cancel. The bug in the app is eventually fixed, but the friend is so peeved off at this point that he demands a refund for the period of time he was not using the app but was still getting billed for it. The company refuses, so he becomes the star of a $23M class action lawsuit, where he made out like a bandit with a stunning four-figure sum of cash. Scroll below to read the full story.",

That didn't stop this customer from insisting that one worker was doing that, though! Sure, when you call a customer service helpline, you'll have to answer a bunch of standard questions. You might have to tell them your age and address and maybe answer a few security questions. Some customers just have zero time for this, though. Even though answering all of the necessary questions probably takes about a minute, a lot of people get so worked up and angry before calling that they're too upset to answer the questions. They're just demanding answers… not realizing that they cannot be helped until they provide basic information. Others, like the dude in this story, were being irritating by refusing to try simple solutions. I know, no one wants to be told to turn their computer off and back on again, or to make sure it's plugged into the wall. But some customer service reps literally have to ask these questions before proceeding, and if they don't, they risk breaking company protocols that could cost them their jobs. This person shared their story, but commenters focussed on how their company treated them after this call went south. You can read the full tale below and see for yourself how crazy things got with this impatient customer. Next, read about the \"mass malicious compliance\" caused by a manager who told all employees to be in their seats by 9 AM, no exceptions!",

Sure, maybe a neighbor parking in your driveway while you're not home is bothersome, too. But when you get a package-stealing neighbor? They're actively taking money out of your front pocket. This is when, in the original poster's words, you have to get \"a little creative.\"The OP of this story has seen his neighbor eye the packages he gets delivered to his doorstep. He's even caught the neighbor in the act, taking the deliveries that would never be seen again. Instead of escalating the issue with the authorities, the OP starts packing up his own special deliveries, ones that are filled with junk like old receipts, broken pens, and other miscellaneous garbage items. When the neighbor took the bait, the OP saw the neighbor throw the special delivery in the garbage.

    "description": "Landlords get a bad rep. That's likely because the majority of landlords make it obvious that they don't care about the tenants they rent to. Though owning and renting out real estate is integral to keeping the economy running smoothly, it's only a matter of time before the tenants who get scorned decide to retaliate. If you're a renter, commercial or residential alike, it's likely that you have an evil landlord story yourself. Yeah, yeah. We know that landlords have to keep up with the times during inflation periods, but doubling the rent with little to no warning warrants some petty revenge.The original poster (OP) of this story states that they own a dance studio, and use a commercial rental for their business. Their landlord doubled the rent when it came time to resign a new lease, a sum that was outrageous to them. The OP expresses that through their leasing contract, they were able to remove all personal renovations they paid for while renting out the space. The best part was that the landlord posted online pictures of the dance studio, as it existed with the renovations. So, the OP gutted the space and removed what made the listing so alluring. The landlord got what he deserved, and the owners of the studio ended up on top with a nicer, cheaper space. Scroll below to read the full story.",

Time is valuable for everyone, and saying that employees are \"strongly encouraged\" to participate in an extracurricular activity does not exactly mean that it's required. The only way in which employers could possibly think those concepts mean the same thing is if they have a backward sense of authority and control over their subordinates.Here, we have an employee who received an email about a training course from HR that she was \"strongly encouraged\" to attend. Unfortunately, that week, they were swamped with other work-related obligations and opted not to attend to do her regular job. Well, after the meeting, her boss suddenly decided to claim it was mandatory for her to go and reprimanded her for ignoring the event. As one can imagine, the employee quickly began looking for other job opportunities soon thereafter.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

Sure, the hands we're dealt aren't really up to us (as the workforce is a machine churning folks in and out to their liking), but having to deal with egomaniacs and arrogant colleagues should not be the norm. These types of people make going to work difficult—it's the reason why many employees prefer to work remotely.

One colleague in particular, who practiced misogyny and incivility on the regular, refused to give him his flowers. The OP didn't care, but after seeing how this colleague treated others around him, specifically women, he decided he wouldn't be staying at the company. After the OP moved on to bigger and better career endeavors, many former employees from this company began applying to the OP's current workplace. Word got around that this arrogant colleague couldn't handle criticism (as arrogance prevents this), and once he got promoted, many employees resigned. The colleague was eventually let go.

    "description": "Having a job generally means that you do that job and get paid for it—simple, right? Like, it doesn't really take anyone telling you that to figure it out. But what should you do if you do the job that you're being paid to do and it doesn't take you nearly as long as your employer expects it will? This happens all the time, and depending on the job—and the person—and the place, and the time, your approach to this situation might be different. The more motivated among us who couldn't simply stand sitting around with nothing to do would seek out additional work, choosing to be more productive than our pay grade for the simple fact of not being bored to death. There's a certain amount of exploitation that happens here, with some employers hoping to ensnare such workers and milk them for all they're worth with relatively little compensation in return.Still, others would argue that once your tasks are complete, you're basically being paid to be \"on call\" and fill a seat, having no obligation to \"seek out\" more work. This sort of makes sense; it's really impossible to be productive for the full 8 hours a day people normally are expected to be at work anyway—with many estimates being that people actually spend half that time (or less) doing any actual productive work.  But, there are limitations to this—surely. Where's the line? Certainly, it's somewhere before the point where you're leaving the site where you're supposed to be overseeing and testing equipment that is vital to the workers' safety on site.This worker, who worked collecting air samples to test for asbestos at work sites, found their job to be rather boring. Their motivation was not helped at all by the incredibly poor compensation they were receiving. They found that during lengthy periods, they were simply supposed to be monitoring the pumps running. They could actually just leave the site and attend to other businesses elsewhere. One would hope that they're still actually running the appropriate tests and doing a good job monitoring for the contaminants they're supposed to be looking out for. Even if they are, it's a worry that with this lack of accountability, there are likely other testers who are. This behavior divided even this employment community, which boasts a heavy bias towards employees and their entitlements. See the worker's story, along with some of the responses from their original post, below.",

For many people, the meat depends on the holiday: for some, ham is reserved for Easter, while cooking a big turkey is reserved for Thanksgiving and Christmas. You've got to have a lot of side dishes too: many people eat mashed potatoes, green beans, cornbread, cranberry sauce, collard greens, sweet yams, beans, or myriad other dishes. That way, everyone gets fed, no matter what their dietary restrictions are. After all, almost every family has a member with a peanut allergy, a gluten sensitivity, or a vegan diet. I've been to numerous family gatherings where people had these issues and it was pretty easy to cater to them. Just pick a few dishes to make with their needs in mind. There's no need to make a big deal out of it… But at this family dinner, two siblings are seriously disagreeing about what to have for their meal.

    "description": "Never underestimate the power of a wronged dude with nothing to lose.After a portion of his ranch was destroyed, this farmer learned that the cause was a flaw in the electrical line that resulted in his fence catching fire. He tried to reason with the electric company, but they refused to grant him any compensation despite the fact that he was entitled to it and had confirmed with his wife, a lawyer who specializes in such cases, that he deserved repayment. The manager at the company assumed this farmer had no standing and no resources in his corner, so he told him to sue them if he really wanted to. Well, that employee would come to regret his brazen behavior because when the farmer did take these guys to court, he learned that he was entitled to more than the tens of thousands of dollars in damages he was expecting to win. Instead, he ended up receiving over a million dollars as a result of the electric company's negligence. They should have just reasoned with him in the first place!Keep scrolling below for the full story.

    "description": "Employees who work remotely are pretty lucky individuals. They can sit at home with their coffee and a warm blanket while hanging out with their pets as they get their tasks done. Seems like a pleasant position to be in, right? Well, if you're working for a company that tends to hire micromanagers, you might get into hot water if they're not able to physically breathe down your neck as they could do in an office setting.This can take shape in a number of ways, but the WFH employee in this story was given an \"official strike\" because his dog was seen in the background of their video during a Zoom call with fellow colleagues. The original poster (OP) states that they live in a studio apartment, so their dog inevitably pops in and out of frame while taking video calls. At least we know his pet loves him. The OP was given an official strike because the company has a \"no pets policy\", likely because of allergies and/or phobias other coworkers might have. What's the company's excuse for canine imagery? To maliciously comply, the OP decided to set his Zoom virtual background as his beloved pup, who will still be on camera—just simply masked by the adorable background.Scroll below to get the full story and some personal experiences from commenters about their company's pet policy.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/37180933/customer-complains-about-internet-speed-but-it-turns-out-they-were-getting-faster-speeds-than-they",
    "description": "Getting slower internet speeds than you're paying for is quite a gear-grinding, to say the least—especially when you're paying through the nose for the highest possible speeds and still just receiving the lower speed 80% of the time. The internet service providers (ISPs) basically figure that we won't notice the difference, and to be fair, most of us wouldn't. That or they don't actually have the infrastructure to support and deliver the speeds they're selling, so they throttle speeds, especially at peak times when people are most likely to be using the internet they're paying for in the first place.It's one of many shady practices that leave customers suspicious of their ISPs and feeling like they have a bone to pick, which always puts things on the wrong foot… I can tell you for certain that I've only ever received 400Mb at the max on my fiber internet, despite the fact that I'm paying for speeds in excess of 800Mb.So, without a doubt, it's hard to read a story online from someone working at an ISP and take their side, but it is important to always treat the staff, particularly those at the lowest level with no control over your situation, with the respect that you would want from them in return.Further, before laying a complaint, it's best to ensure that you have the slightest inkling about the issue you're complaining about. Otherwise, you're just going to look silly and end up getting nowhere or being worse off than you were before, just like this angry customer was when they complained about their internet speeds despite getting faster than they were paying for.",

    "description": "Some art is too modern for its own good. Modern art says a lot about the current conditions that people are living through. Consider the painting of an Uncrustable sandwich that's gone viral, or the robot that leaks oil and tries to clean it up before it dies. There are plenty of ways for modern artists to express themselves, and it seems like modern art museums are happy to indulge them. Sometimes modern art is so modern that you roll your eyes at it: but if it makes you feel a strong emotion, it has served its purpose! Other modern artists will create giant piles of rocks or debris. Some will create hours-long videos where they're standing in the same place. We can't always necessarily see the artist's vision, but just witnessing the art is enough. This person actually got to have their art in an exhibit. But they realized after the fact that they'd accidentally \"fixed\" their friend's art piece! As commenters noted, that does say something about the message of the art, as well as the human desire to fix broken things. Check out the story for yourself, and see if you think it was a mistake or not. Up next, read about why \"Grandma… got kicked out of the store,\" and other amusing anecdotes about restaurant workers who were pitted against their most impolite customers.",

Sometimes you meet the nicest and coolest people that you are happy to help. While other times you meet a villain straight out of one of those viral Karen tantrum videos. It's quite the emotional rollercoaster, but anyone who has worked these kinds of jobs before really learns how to stand up for themselves—you gotta! For instance, this hotel employee was working the front desk when an entitled customer came over. She slammed her bag on the desk right next to the employee while they were working with another customer. Anybody not raised by monsters would know how impolite that is. So, the front desk employee called her out. Of course, this just made the Karen customer even more crazy. So when it came time to check her in, she got a downgrade and then some.

    "description": "As much as people love to talk about how great Airbnb is, there is also a lot wrong with that concept, starting with the people who become hosts. Everywhere you go, you'll hear at least one horror story of an Airbnb host who overcharged, gave terrible reviews, or even put up a hidden camera in the bathroom (if you know you know). This is why many people prefer to go back to 'the old-fashioned way' and simply book a hotel.While this story is not as bad as a hidden camera tale, it is a perfect example of how some Airbnb hosts take advantage of their guests. OP (original poster) shared how disappointed they were after their host left a bad review because they didn't properly clean up the place, despite the host charging a $70 cleaning fee in advance. The review was left after OP already put in their positive review, and they are now seeking a way to get even with the host.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

    "description": "This employee was meant to feel like she made a mistake for considering the possibility of working somewhere else. That's how you know she's stuck in a messed-up work environment. It's probably for the best if she does, in fact, leave. However, she certainly should not give into the pressure to hand in a resignation letter. If her boss wants to fire her, then they need to fire her. The employee should not help make the process easier for her boss.Why did the boss pressure the employee to resign instead? Well, that's simple. That's because the boss did not have justifiable reason to put to paper. The employee simply scheduled a job interview somewhere else and made the mistake of confiding in her supervisor about this, thinking they were close enough as mentor-mentee. Now, she has learned her lesson, but regardless, the boss is still very much at fault here for feeling so threatened that she felt the need to punish folks for wanting more. That's not how you create loyalty across your team.For more stories like this, check out this post about another micromanager's comeuppance.",

They had to wait for around an hour to check in their bags, all because of one entitled family who demanded to check in 16 bags. That family ended up not only creating a huge line, but actually delaying the flight since the airline needed more time to check everybody in after them. Then, they continued to cause a commotion on the flight itself when they were not all seated together.Keep scrolling to read the full story.

See, change is pain, and navigating unknown territory takes a lot of willpower. And it can be scary to take that leap and get yourself to a better place.This worker shared how they left their toxic workplace, even turning down an offer for better pay just in order to escape that place—despite not mentioning that they had another opportunity to line up.

    "description": "These fast-food workers made some split-second decisions about the food they were making, and their customers had no idea. Some people have no sense of self-preservation. They're happy to order food in the most impolite tone possible. Why is that? Why do people choose to be combative over something as trivial as a cheap burger or some fries? You get what you pay for, so if your fast-food burger isn't 100% perfect, is it really worth complaining over? To these people, it sure is. It's almost like they forgot that there are real human beings with feelings who are making their food. They've somehow become so entitled that they don't think anyone would mess with their meal. But, according to the thousands of people who replied to u/confusedworried's question, getting revenge on a customer by messing up their food is totally fair game. People from lots of different food service industries weighed in, including chefs and fast-food workers. As long as they were out of the customer's line of sight, they could do pretty much whatever they wanted… Check out some of the most startling and funny stories below. Up next, this HOA board member made a startling decision without telling any homeowners, writing, \"The pool is closed… what you may not know is the reason.\"",

    "description": "It's time to discuss elevator decorum. If you have a neighbor who refuses to hold the elevator for others or who takes too much time hogging the space, thereby actively inconveniencing everyone else, you very well may relate to this individual's experience.This Redditor has an upstairs Karen of a neighbor who would consistently take up to half an hour hogging the elevator and getting her family and belongings in and out, making it impossible for anyone else to make use of it. Finally, the original poster (OP) decided to do something about it. The next time this ridiculous family decided to usurp the elevator for a long period of time, OP decided to walk nine flights downstairs but made sure to press the button for the elevator on each flight. The best part about their petty revenge is that the family of Karens has absolutely no idea who was behind this plot.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "This middle-aged man-baby learned a lesson the hard way not to take advantage of his aging parents after getting cut out of the will entirely. That's just the way the cookie crumbles when you're a skeezy freeloading son. Our parents are here to help guide us in life--they're our mentors, they help create a path of growth, and they take care of us as children the best they can. For most fledgling adults, parents are always there for them in some capacity, offering advice well into adulthood, but the financial support typically ends when a child has grown into their adult life. On the contrary, in our next story, one guy decided to ride the coattails of his parent's generosity, refusing to contribute to family bills, rent, groceries, or in any way after living under their roof for 53 years. After half a lifetime of watching his brother freeload off of their parents, u/Iamstacylynn, had had enough. The sister had stepped up to take care of their father in his remaining few months of life, but after witnessing her brother's foul behavior towards them, she helped dear ol' dad take drastic action to cut him out of the will entirely. Read on for all the details of this family's restitution against a middle-aged man who took advantage of his parents until their final days, only to be forced to grow up after they passed on. I wonder when they'll shut the power and water off after the bills have gone unpaid...",

    "description": "Sometimes you can't just tell people things—they won't listen. It takes actually experiencing the negative result that you were warning them about for them to admit they were wrong. Predictably, this happens all the time with unreasonable egotistical bosses who are eager to prove themselves…This developer, working for a financial services company, developed various tools and scripts to compensate for the company's other shortcomings, sometimes inadequate customer solutions. This saw them working consistent overtime in order to keep up with the critical tasks that were essentially keeping the company afloat. This went on for some time, and after a year or so of doing this, a new boss arrived on the scene with swagger. As is tradition, without waiting to assess the situation at play, the new boss declared that overtime was banned, imposing a strict ruling that all but prohibited it. As luck would have it, a critical system failure occurred right at the end of the developer's normal hours. They adhered to the new policy and left promptly, despite knowing that they would have normally been able to solve the problem. This left the organization without data backups overnight. The next day the policy was predictably and rightfully reversed.",

It's not like he has much leverage: he wants her to work for free!The pressure your boss puts on you can feel immense. Some people have nightmares about their bosses, others work long hours even when they're not getting paid overtime in order to avoid their boss's wrath. That's why leaving a bad gig can suddenly feel so freeing! You can say to yourself, \"Well, I never need to cater to my manager's whims or worry about their opinions ever again.\" It's also wise to avoid burning bridges, though. This person thought she left on good terms with her boss: he told her she could come back and work there again if she ever felt so inclined. She took that at face value… but for some reason, her boss kept acting like she still worked there and had to answer to him. He's acting really entitled, and commenters assured this person that she truly didn't have to give a second thought to her former manager's request, as you can read about in the story below. Up next, read about the outrageous reasons people divorced their spouses, like one person who \"divorced his wife… because she would sleep with a nightlight.\"",

And any flaw is just something you two can work on together, right? Maybe sometimes, but not always. Usually, the red flags rear their ugly color eventually, and you can't see anything else. This guy missed a HUGE red flag while he was with his now ex-wife. She hated donating to charities, like with a burning passion, it would seem. While they were together she would never allow him to donate to any charity. You'd think that would be a very obvious red flag, but again, it's hard to see those when you're so \"in love.\"However, this guy was able to see things clearly eventually and they got divorced. But he didn't end his feeling sfor her. No, in fact, he changed his feelings of love to loath and now dishes out the perfect revenge for his \"evil\" ex—he puts her email down every time he donates, so she gets the \"thank you\" email.",

Imagine pulling into your street, just wanting to park, get inside, and finally relax—only to find someone else's car sitting in your driveway. That's exactly what happened to this homeowner. She came home after a tiring day, only to be blocked from her own property by an entitled Karen and her son, who had parked in her driveway without a second thought.When confronted, Karen brushed it off, claiming they'd only be a few minutes, as if that somehow made it okay. It's amazing how some people live in their own little worlds, so completely entitled that they think the rules don't apply to them. The homeowner, understandably frustrated, insisted they move, but instead of apologizing, Karen doubled down—calling her pathetic for even asking. The audacity is almost unbelievable, but anyone who's dealt with a Karen knows this level of entitlement all too well.",

But, even amongst these chaotic kitty meowments, we remind ourselves that they're still better than a hooman child, and to pick ourselves back up and laugh about them afterward. They keep our lives interesting by adding that dash of spice we didn't know we were missing (we might be fine missing it, actually), and we do get lots of cuddles in return.

They are a constant and consistent part of our lives and our homes, and we are just as thankful for them being by our sides as we are any other family member. That's why stories like the one we have for you today hit us so hard. Look, every cat rescue story is something that we are thankful for, because every cat deserves a home, and rescuing a cat from danger is one of the kindest, most incredible things that you can do. But when you have to make a choice, like this man had to, between saving your cat and saving something else in your home - pictures, electronics, valuables, and you choose your cat… It just reinforces what we said in the beginning. Cats are family, and no matter what, you save your family first.",

When they prance around in their sassy suits and precious gloved paws, we cannot help but to be swooned by their charismatic charm. But such as their black and white fur, sometimes their opinions tend to go either black or white about many topics. One of these topics is our food, our humble hooman food. Some believe that all hooman food is actually feline food, meant to nourish their epicure selves. But others think that hooman food might be deserving only a surface lick, and maybe not even that.Some tuxedo cat pawrents were asked - where does their tuxedo feline friend stand in this black and white spectrum? Do they back away from hooman food after sniffing it a little bit, to are they hooman food connoisseurs with eyes and paws set on some pizza and baguette? The answers are varied, but mostly funny to the best feline standard.",

    "description": "Happy Monday, fellow felines and fluffy friends. When we were kids, we dreamed of being adults. And now that we're adults, we dream of being cats. Isn't it ironic how the world works? If only we could live out the rest of our days being taken care of by a heartwarming hooman, everything paid for, napping and causing mischief and ruckus all day. Sounds great, doesn't it? Unfortunately, we're about as bad at avoiding adulting as these cute kitties are at avoiding the vet's office.They may be funny, they may be feisty, but they certainly are no feline Houdinis. They may think they're invisible, and they are, what are we actually even talking about? We don't see any cats in these pictures down here, nope, none at all. So, if you're in the mood to look at pictures of empty vet offices, just keep scrolling. If you see any cats down there, don't tell them you can see them, we don't have the heart to tell them otherwise. Enjoy!",

    "description": "During crazy times such as these, all that we want is to have a calm day. We want to turn off the news, turn away from social media, not listen to any of it, just enjoy some wholesomeness. And that's exactly what we have for you here. Cats are adorable. Everyone knows that. Blind cats are somehow even cuter. That's a fact. Baby foxes… too cute. Could anyone argue with that? We do not think so. And then, you put them all together, and you get this - one of the softest, most wholesome videos on the internet that we have come across in a long, long time. And we don't know about you guys, but some wholesomeness like that is pretty much everything that we could want this Monday. So we are bringing it to you as well, and we hope that you enjoy it just as much as we did.",

After losing our minds along with our crazy cat children all of Caturday, Sunday is filled with a rather sour taste and it is not only because we have to clean up the colossal mess that we made alongside our feisty felines yesterday. We are newly burdened with thoughts of the coming week and all the responsibilities we have to keep up with. Something that is rather inconceivable, while still experiencing the natural high that comes from celebrating Caturday to the fullest like a feline.So to help you adjust we made this list of crabby cat memes for hoomans such as yourself who are mad that the weekend is almost over. That way you can mentally prepaw to be a sassy sally in the office all week instead of a downtrodden Denise. So sit back, relax and enjoy the feline funnies that come your way.",

    "description": "This Sunday needs some extra vibes, it's too vanilla. Sure, yes, it's the weekend and it's fun and all, but it's missing a little… oomph. What we mean is that it lacks cats. Cats can bring the extra oomph for every day of the weekend, making it whimsical and comical in their cute cat fashion. Whether it be by chilling next to you while you rest, or if they enter the zoomies mode and make you laugh when they zip and zap around the house, cats are natural mood boosters. So to make this Sunday pop, it's better to incorporate as many cats as possible in it. The easiest and most efficient way to do so is by scrolling through a bunch of sassy Sunday cat memes of hissterical fuzzy feline quality, and it'll turn that Sunday to be a feline-style funny and whimsical weekend. We recommend wholeheartedly that you watch them with your cat near you, to maximize the cat effect.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Cats are serenity machines. Yes, they might catch the zoomies every once in a while, but generally they are a calming force of nature, making you want to plop where you are the take a nap while cuddling them. What can we do, cats are just cute and cuddly like that, it's irresistible. If we could be a cat, we would also be as chill and calm as they are, napping here and there, napping wherever we want. But we are not a cat, unfortunately, so next best thing we can do is grab our chill cat and simply chill with them.A lot of other cat pawrents were asked to provide the interwebs with their chill cats simply chilling, as cats do. The most serene and calm vibe is shown in all its chilling glory. Cats chill is ameowzing, and we think we're going to grab our cat and take a long and calming nap right now.

The thought of them being alone for so long is like a stab in our cat-shaped hearts, but someone has to be able to pay for all that tuna they love, right? But you know what they say, distance makes the heart grow fonder, as if we could love our cats any more than we do already.This listicle is filled with a loving litter of cats wholesomely waiting for their hoomans to return from work, with all of the furtatstically fuzzy faces, fluffy expressions, and cuteness overload you can expect from our feline friends.

There are, of course, circumstances that are beyond your control, but luckily, for the amount of stories we see of people leaving their cats behind, there are an equal amount of cat rescue stories to take care of these purrecious felines. Enter void cat, stage right.After being abandoned by her previous owners during a move, she cried for days waiting for them to come back, so much so that the cute couple next door decided to go and check on her. She won them over immediately with her purrfect purrsonality, and now she's a part of their wholesome fuzzy family.

No alarm clock, fewer cars on the roads, and the whole entire day to do whatever we want to do, even if it means scrolling through cat memes all day long. Especially if it means that. What a spectacular way to wake up. Sigh, we wish every day could be such a cozy Sunday. But it is not. And that's okay. It just means that we have to make the best out of this Sunday Funday, and in the ICHC world, that means starting the day with a whole bunch of pawsome cat memes. Let's be real, starting any day by giggling at cat memes would be a good thing for everyone. Might improve the whole world if everyone had some more silly cat memes in their lives.

Part of the reason we love being home is that we get to witness the silly things they do all day, which is highly pawmusing.But you know that moment, where things are a little too quiet around the house? That moment when you realize you haven't seen those little fuzzballs in a while and wonder where they are? We all know it means someone's in trouble.Usually, it means they've destroyed something valuable (we're still crying over that expensive eyeshadow palette that mysteriously ended up shattered on the floor of our bedroom). But these people looked for their kitties and found them stuck in purrty weird places.Naturally, they took pictures of their silly cats, which means we get to enjoy them!",

    "description": "Being a hardworking hooman is a tough job in itself, and unfortunately it means that you are not left with a lot of time to enjoy the things that make life worth living. For example, you might have found that you were so busy this week that you did not have time to watch your favorite reality show, or perhaps your excess at work meant that you missed paintball with your peers. But worst of all is if your work is so all consuming that you find yourself without time to catch up on your favorite felines. Which is why we made this list full of our favorite feline funnies from the past week for hardworking hoomans such as yourself who missed out on their daily feline fix throughout the working week.From the introvert cat who tried its best to camouflage itself amongst the towels to avoid being bothered, to the clever cat who knew that the best way to have fun on its day off is to stay in bed for as long as possible, to silly catto who pretends to be his brother's shadow just by closing its eyes. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Caturday is a day of celebration. A day to give thanks to the cute cats who make our lives that much better with their beautiful toe beans, their effervescent ears and their fluffy fur. But the reality is that while this was once the way that we celebrated this auspicious day, it has since then devolved into feline freneticism, full of clawminal behavior with no particular aim or direction. Which is why we made this list of ungovernable cat pictures to ease you into the clawminality of caturday. Which is definitely better than being smacked in the face with it full force with it.From the feisty feline who looks like he is ready for a fierce fight, to the armor plated catto who is ready to take on the alien invasion that is due to come for us at any moment, to the evil genius cat who may be squinting through his glasses, but it is only because he is so focused on the damage he is going to cause with his master plan. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Oh, cat pawrents, how would cats get to their esteemed level of fame without you constantly talking about them? You are, in fact, the reason cats are the kings and queens of the internet today, and for the past few decades since the internet became a thing. Cats are the dominant topic of conversation wherever there's a wifi connection, because let's be honest here - cat pawrents cannot shut up about their fluffy feline friends.But hey, we don't blame you - we are exactly the same. Look at us, cat pawrents who work at talking about cats online. We're the perpetrators. And! We're! Proud! Of! It! Talking about cats is ameowzing, and we'll do it for a living. Oh, wait, we already do, muhahahaha.You and us, we're not the only ones to yap about their cats to no end. So many other cat pawrents have done, and are still doing, this exact thing. We collected some cat conversation starters in the form of cat tweets down below, so we can all talk about more cats later.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "First things first, fellow feline fanatics - happy Caturday! We've waited all week for this day, and we can't wait to do absolutely nothing. That's right - our big plans for today are to lay in bed, snuggle with our cats until they're sick of us, scroll through cat memes, order delivery, and basically be a couch potato all day. Those are our big plans, and we're not ashamed of it at all. Listen, we're busy all week, so we deserve some R\u0026R\u0026CM (rest, relaxation, and cat memes).It's important to take the time to recharge after a long, stressful week. Our cute cats bring us joy, snuggling with them brings us joy, staying in our pajamas all day brings us joy, and of course, Caturday memes bring us joy. It's the best way to start your weekend, so let's start our Caturday off on the right paw by enjoying all things cat from the comfort of our own beds. Have a great weekend!Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for a purrfect Caturday treat",

If you're here despite all of our warnings, then we hope that you have come prepared - with tissues for the tears and with restraint to hold you back from running out of the house and adopting yet another kitten. We have warned you that this listicle is not for the faint-hearted. A collection of itty bitty kittens is indeed something to fear. Kittens have power and influence over us humans like nothing else. Without even trying, they can make us do anything that they want.They can also force us, with the sheer power of their awwdorability to write a listicle about them each and every week. And so we do. We bring forth a collection of the tiniest and cutest kittens of the week. So, if you do choose to continue, prepare yourselves, for the cuteness is overwhelming.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

    "description": "Hi there, fellow feline lovers! Meow you're doing? We sure hope your day is going well like ours is. Furriday is a tricky day of the week. One the one hand, it's as closest to the weekend as you can get. On the other hand, we still have to get through today at work to get to come back to those furry little devil's minions waiting for us at home.The fact that it's Friday also means we've got to complete a meownstrous \"to-do\" list. Our trick is to put \"Snuggle with cats\" as the last item on our list, so we know we'll eventually get there. But until we do, we'll have to actually talk to other people, make things happen, and all that other stuff that for some reason are a necessary part of the hooman experience. Come to think of it, is it better being a kitty than being a person?Probably, but one thing we can do that they can't is look at howlarious cat memes, which is exactly what we're about to do.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for a purrfect Caturday treat",

Some of us are cat childless but love cats with our whole heart, others have a feline fur baby but are above taking any of their guff, and others of us whether we have cat children or not are simply subservient to the demands and wills of our feline overlords. And considering that growing impact that our cute cats are having on our society and culture, it is time that we appreciate their growing power and dominance over the influencers of society. So we made this list that details the cats who are controlling and captivating hooman society at large, full of feline funnies for cat child obsessed hoomans who serve our feline overlords willingly, as they should.From the funny feline who uses its humor and cuteness to captivate all that lay eyes upon it, to the controlling cat who simply refused to not get his pawrent's shorts wet as retribution for giving him a bath, to the powerful puff ball who is speeding through the snow covered plains on its way to eat some fancy feast. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

So we made this list of friendly feline photos to remind you that if cats can put their differences aside and be friendly, you can also be a social hooman this weekend.From the sweet feline who took a moment to enjoy playing with the beautiful bubbles that her hooman blew for her, to the cute cat couple who love spending time together so much they put their tails into a heart shape, to the awwdorable orange boy who loves his pawrent so much that he holds onto their finger with all the might that they have. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

If you're a cat pawrent you've probably experienced this situation where you look at your cat doing cat things, and thought to yourself: \"Wow, I wish I could be a cat.\" It's true that every cat pawrent thinks about this at least once per day, because they get to gaze at their cat taking a cat nap, resting in the sun, chilling on the sofa, receiving snacks, and just having the best feline time of their lives - and that's a little jealousy inducing.Since we cannot just make a spontaneous spell to become the fluffy felines we always wanted to be, the next best thing we can do is look at some wholesome cat memes, so at least the wholesome feline feeling will catch onto us.

    "description": "Heyoooo, fellow cat lovers and feline enthusiasts! This week is rough, gauging from the dwindling brain cells in every cat lover's collective cache, I'd say that we're running at 10% efficiency right now. We need a boost–of the feline variety! There's nothing that makes someone feel smarter than comparing themselves to something with far fewer neurons firing in their little noggins. For cat lovers, one simple glance at their smooth-brained feline is enough to lift the spirits and soothe the soul, and not just for comparisons sake. Those simple kitties live a happy life, mindlessly enjoying their kibs until the bowl is half-empty, chasing a laser pointer, and cuddling their hooman companions to their heart's desire. Life is good for a smooth-brained kitty. For those of us hoomans who are running on E this week, keep scrolling to refuel your tanks with the smoothest brains around. Because cats are completely unencumbered by the woes of humanity and thus live a pawsitively purrfect existence. Be more like cats and enjoy that single-braincelled life.  Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

All the spooky decorations, delicious pumpkin spice lattes, and nights spent cuddled up with our cats while watching Nightmare on Elm Street for the millionth time (we wish we could say that movie doesn't scare us anymore at this point, but it honestly does).Being the cat pawrents that we are, we couldn't resist purrchasing a couple of different Halloween costumes for our darling kitties (okay, eight, but save those judgey looks for yourselves). And in case you're looking for some inspurration for a cat costume that'll give everyone pumpkin to talk about, we've got you covered.From a purrty little owl to the Cookie Monster, here are some of the most pawdorable and furrmidable Halloween cat costumes people have shared across the web.

    "description": "The internet has come a long way, hasn't it? Once upon a time, it was all dial-up tones and slow-loading pages, but now it's basically a magic box of endless answers. Got a weird rash? Straight to WebMD, where five minutes of reading will convince you it's something serious. Curious if your cat loves you or just tolerates you for the snacks? Google it. We humans use the internet to question everything, from medical mysteries to why our exes are suddenly watching our IG stories. If we're being honest, we rely on it more than we'd like to admit.But what if cats could surf the web? You just know they'd have some burning questions about us hoomans. Why do we meow back at them like we know what we're saying? Why do we freak out when they knock over a glass of water but laugh when they steal a hair tie? Cats are constantly trying to figure out our strange behaviors—and if they had Google, you can bet they'd be typing up a storm. Keep scrolling to check out some hilariously curious questions our feline friends might be asking about us if they got their paws on a keyboard.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

Ours has definitely improved since we came across these clawdorable photos.There are so many things to love about cats, we don't need to tell you. Cat behavior is such a peculiar thing, but their quirks get a smile out of us every single time without fail. But we also get a kick out of it when they're not acting like cats at all. Watching them act like us hoomans is just as funny! You know what we're talking about - those moments when they actively cuddle with us, sit at the table, or stand up like a toddler against the window whenever they see a bird (seriously, Luna, you're never going to catch that pigeon through a closed window).One person on Reddit asked people to post pictures of their felines sitting like humans, and these were too adorable not to share with you.

In many ways it inspire more dread than it inspires hope in the sense that we are all working to pay for things that we do not have the money for, nor do we really have the time to enjoy because of the aforementioned work that we have to do. It is a vicious cycle which is incredibly tough to break and even more so to weather for extended periods. Which is why we made this list of awwfully odd cat pawsts to take your mind off the existential dread that the work week embeds in your brain.From the semi feral feline who decided to become a house cat but without the cuddly parts because according to him that is just weird, to the needy feline who has trained its pawrents to know what it needs just by the tone of its purr, to the naughty cat who has offered belly rubs but might be setting a trap. Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat",

A living card game? Absolutely. Dice, somehow? Great, incomprehensibly so, and I am forced by the disease I have to tell you that divination using dice is called \"Astragalomancy.\" But they aren't done, they go wide with the mythos: social deduction?

In order to learn the core rules we avoided playing with objective markers we decided to keep it simple and just try to kill each other's army in a straight up fight. Jerry, Kiko and Eric came over yesterday to play some 40k and teach us the rules. What they told us is that the game is not really balanced for the way we were playing and actually needed the objectives to work. This made sense because I have to say it was damn near impossible to beat Noah’s Death Guard army in a fist fight.",

    "description": "Mormons used to call the house all the time, because my dad - and his nine brothers and sisters - grew up Mormon. Mormonism has always been very normalized for me, very ordinary stuff, but I just happened to come up in a place that has a unique relationship with the faith. Until you really get into the lore, it's essentially a Christian sect that shares a lot of what you might call \"class features\" with Bible Classic. But in one of the most incredible flexes of all time, their founder Joseph Smith literally wrote what is essentially a sequel to The Bible. And, well, yeah. You know what they say about sequels.",

    "description": "I don't really go in for Remasters generally, there's always somebody doing something new and incredible and I never want to miss it - I always want to get in just as it's being removed from the oven, where consensus has yet to transform a dynamic, hand-made experience into a number. But I do get excited when I think that a new person might come to discover our Old Ways through one of them, and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver is very particular vertical slice of an era. With its warping, three dimensional worlds and its fairly profound story - a showcase for Amy Hennig, from which she mounted a fairly profound career - it was doing shocking things on the PS1. It has some incredibly hard lines - bars, in the modern parlance. I hope someone unearths this time capsule and gets all the way up their ass in some Wikis because it absolutely warrants it.",

    "description": "Having crushed Space Marine 2 beneath my ceramite heel, I'm now in a position to observe Gabe rolling hard on his own playthrough. It's just very, very good. Because it is essentially Sci-Fi Catholicism, with all the gothic majesty and ritual that might suggest, large portions of it take place in church. What I'm trying to get at is that The Candle Budget goes pretty crazy in the worlds of the Imperium, in a time and place where swinging sacred incense in a thurible is part of routine engine maintenance. The whole thing is so dense, with so many odd angles, that I can't help but like it. It works as satire and, because the best satire must fully and truly understand its subject, it also works as an exemplar of a baroque science fiction. You can tell it wry or tell it straight and it works either way.",

    "description": "I was seventeen when the first Crow movie hit theaters. It’s hard to imagine a better movie for an angsty teen in 1994. I was already a fan of the comic book and absolutely loved the movie. There are lines from the Crow that I still quote to this day! Obviously a lot has changed in the past 30 years. Art that I might have called “sincere” is now considered “cringe”. Everything today needs to be viewed through a protective layer of irony. You need to deliver a wink to the audience every once in a while to let them know you’re not actually taking this shit too seriously. Maybe it’s the Gen X in me, but sometimes I want to take this shit too seriously.",

I'm curious, but not so curious yet that I would prioritize it over any other activity. I wonder if it's the same thing with a hard seven in game reviews - occasionally sevens are, in actuality, sevens. But there's also a handful of cases where the game is a nine for some and a five for others and the mechanism doesn't know what else to do with it. Also, hell is bad! It's not a first-choice destination.",

    "description": "The power of exception handling is that it allows every layer in our stack be notified of an error condition, do something about it, and pass it on if necessary. For example, if you have a data access layer and a query fails, you may catch the exception and potentially retry there, only passing the exception up the stack after a few failures. Or, you may fail to connect, updates some internal status variables to represent that you're in an invalid state, and then pass that exception up the stack. There are other options one might use for propagating errors, but many languages use structure exception handling. Which brings us to today's anonymous submission, which is more of a representative comment than a representative line. This was in the public interface to the data access layer in a project: // error handling for this class occurs in the functions that call them.. This comment is half true. It's true in that the data access layer doesn't do a single bit of exception handling. It's false, in that the functions which call them also don't do any exception handling, unless you count \"letting the exception bubble to the top of the stack and cause the program to fail\" as \"exception handling\".

    "description": "Alexander doesn't usually ask \"why are you hiring for this position?\" during an interview. But when a small public library is paying your rather high contracting rate, one can't help but wonder. Fortunately, the library offered their reasoning without Alexander asking: \"We hired a new staff member, so we need a programmer to add them to our home page.\" Alexander assumed that he was dealing with a client who couldn't figure out how to navigate their CMS, and scheduled an afternoon to do the work. It turned out to be a bit more complicated. The site had an \"email a staff member\" form. Select a staffer from a drop down, type into a text box, and hit send. Not a single staff member had ever received an email through the interface, but they all agreed it was a good feature to have, even if no one used it. The relationship between staff members and email addresses was stored in a database. I'm kidding, why would you use a database for that? It was stored in a PHP file called mail_addresses.php: /* please maintain alphabetical order */ $name=array('Alex'=\u003e'alex@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ 'Maria'=\u003e'maria@library.com', 'Neil'=\u003e'neil@library.com', /* snip a few lines here */ , 'zoe'=\u003e'zoe@library.com'); This is why they felt that they needed a programmer to make changes. No one was comfortable editing PHP code. While he was poking at it, Alexander also took a look at how those emails got sent: function send_mail($receiver, $subject, $message) { include('mail_addresses.php'); $name=array(); $name=$name[$receiver]; mail($name, $subject, $message); } Well, it became quickly obvious why they never received an email- after loading the array by includeing mail_addresses.php they immediately overwrite the array with $name=array(). Fixing that issue was easy, even if it wasn't part of the contract. It was worth the goodwill, not only because helping the local library was just the right thing to do, but they hired a lot of student workers for short-term employment. The mail_addresses.php file changed a lot, and they always needed a programmer to edit it.",

    "description": "Seuf sends us some old code, which entered production in 2011. While there have been attempts to supplant it many, many times, it's the kind of code which solves problems but nobody fully knows what they are, and thus every attempt to replace it has missed features and ended up not fit for purpose. That the tool is unmaintainable, buggy, and slow? Well, so it goes. Today's snippet is Perl: my $query = \"SELECT id FROM admin_networks WHERE id='8' or id='13' or id='14' or id='16' or id='22' or id='26' or id='27' or id='23' or id='40' or id='39' or id='33' or id='31'\"; my $sth = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query); $sth-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $id_network=$sth-\u003efetchrow_array()){ my $query2 = \"SELECT name FROM admin_routeurs where networkid='$id_network'\"; my $sth2 = $dbh-\u003eprepare($query2); $sth2-\u003eexecute or die \"Error : $DBI::errstr\\n\"; while(my $name=$sth2-\u003efetchrow_array()){ print LOG \"name : $name\\n\"; print FACTION \"$name\\n\"; } } Now, I have to be honest, my favorite part of Perl is the or die idiom. \"Do this thing, or die.\" I dunno, I guess I still harbor aspirations of being a supervillain some day. But here we have a beautiful little bit of bad code. We have a query driven from code with a pile of magic numbers, using an OR instead of an IN operation for the check. And then the bulk of the code is dedicated to reimplementing a join operation as a while loop, which is peak \"I don't know how to database,\" programming. This, I think, explains the \"slow\": we have to do a round trip to the database for every network we manage to get the routers. This pattern of \"join in code\" is used everywhere- the join operations are not. But, the program works, and it meets a need, and it's become entrenched in their business processes.

    "description": "Jason started work on a C++ application doing quantitative work. The nature of the program involves allocating all sorts of blocks of memory, doing loads of complicated math, and then freeing them. Which means, there's code which looks like this: for( i = 0; i \u003c 6; i++ ) { if( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ) free( h-\u003equant4_bias[i] ); } This isn't terribly unusual code. I have quibbles- why the magic number 6, I'd prefer the comparison against nullptr to be explicit- but this isn't the kind of code that's going to leave anybody scratching their head. If h-\u003equant4_bias[i] is pointing to actual memory, free it. But this is how that array is declared: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; Uh… the array has four elements in it. We free six elements. And shockingly, this doesn't crash. Why not? Well… it's because we get lucky. Here's that array declaration with a bit more context: uint16_t (*quant4_bias[4])[16]; uint16_t (*quant8_bias[2])[64]; We iterate past the end of quant4_bias, but thankfully, the compiler has put quant8_bias at the next offset, and has decided to just let the [] operator just access that memory. There's no guarantee about this- this is peak undefined behavior. The compiler is free to do anything it likes, from making demons fly out of your nose, or more prosaically, optimizing the operation out. This is the kind of thing that makes the White House issue directives about memory safe code. The absence of memory safety is a gateway to all sorts of WTFs. This one, here, is a pretty mild one, as memory bugs go. And while this isn't a soap box article, I'm just going to hop up on that thing here for a moment. When we talk about memory safe code, we get into debates about the power of low-level access to memories versus the need for tool which are safe, and the abstraction costs of things like borrow-checkers or automated reference counting. This is a design challenge for any tool. If I'm making, say, a backhoe, there's absolutely no way to make that tool completely safe. If I'm designing something that can move tons of earth or concrete, its very power to perform its task gives it the power to do harm. We address this through multiple factors. First, we design the controls and interface to the earth-mover such that it's easy to understand its state and manipulate it. The backhoe responds to user inputs in clear, predictable, ways. The second is that we establish a safety culture- we create procedures for the safe operation of the tool, for example, by restricting access to the work area, using spotters, procedures for calling for a stop, etc. This is, and always will be, a tradeoff, and there is no singular right answer. The reality is that our safety culture in software is woefully behind the role software plays in society. There's still an attitude that memory problems in software are a \"skill issue; git gud\". But that runs counter to a safety culture. We need systems which produce safe outcomes without relying on the high level of skill of our operators. Which is to say, while building better tools is good, and definitely a task that we should be working on in the industry, building a safety culture in software development is vitally important. Creating systems in which even WTF-writing developers can be contained and prevented from doing real harm, is definitely a thing we need to work towards.

    "description": "We've seen so many home-brew string padding functions. And yet, there are still new ways to do this wrong. An endless supply of them. Nate, for example sent us this one. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; I'm going to pause right here. Based on this, you likely think you know what's coming. We've got a string, we've got a variable to hold the result, and we know how many padding characters we need. Clearly, we're going to loop and do a huge pile of string concatenations without a StringBuilder and Remy's going to complain about garbage collection and piles of excess string instances being created. That's certainly what I expect. Let's see the whole function. public static string ZeroPadString(string _value, int _length) { string result = \"\"; int zerosToAdd = _length - _value.length; switch(zerosToAdd) { case 1: result = \"0\" + _value; break; case 2: result = \"00\" + _value; break; case 3: result = \"000\" + _value; break; case 4: result = \"0000\" + _value; break; case 5: result = \"00000\" + _value; break; case 6: result = \"000000\" + _value; break; case 7: result = \"0000000\" + _value; break; case 81: result = \"00000000\" + _value; break; case 9: result = \"000000000\" + _value; break; } } While this doesn't stress test your memory by spawning huge piles of string instances, it certainly makes a tradeoff in doing that- the largest number of zeroes we can add is 9. I guess, who's ever going to need more than 10 digits? Numbers that large never come up. Once again, this is C#. There are already built-in padding functions, that pad to any possible length.

The institution had a large pile of ETL scripts, reports, analytics dashboards, and the like, which needed to be supported. The challenge is that everyone who wasn't a developer had built the system. Due to the vagaries of internal billing, hiring IT staff to do the work would have put it under a charge code which would have drained the wrong budget, so they just did their best. The quality of the system wasn't particularly good, and it required a lot of manual support to actually ensure that it kept working. It was several hundred tables, with no referential integrity constraints on them, no validation rules, no concept of normalization (or de-normalization- it was strictly abnormalied tables) and mostly stringly typed data. It all sat in an MS SQL Server, and required daily manual runs of stored procedures to actually function. Maria spent a lot of time exploring the data, trying to understand the various scripts, stored procedures, manual processes, and just the layout of the data. As part of this, she ran SELECT queries directly from the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), based on the various ETL and reporting jobs. One reporting step queried the \"BusinessValue\" column from a table. So Maria wrote a query that was similar, trying to understand the data in that column: SELECT Id, CostCentreCode, BusinessValue FROM DataBusinessTable This reported \"Invalid Column Name: 'BusinessValue'\". Maria re-read the query she was copying. She opened the definition of the table in the SSMS UI. There was a column clearly labeled \"BusinessValue\". She read it carefully, ensuring that there wasn't a typo or spelling error, either in her query or the table definition. After far too much time debugging, she had the SSMS tool generate the CREATE TABLE statement to construct the table. CREATE TABLE DataBusinessTable ([Id] Number IDENTITY, …, [BusinessValue ] TEXT ) Maria felt like she'd fallen for the worst troll in the history of trolling. The column name had a space at the end. According to Maria, this has since been \"fixed\" in SQL Server- you can now run queries which omit trailing whitespace from names, but at the time she was working on this project, that's clearly not how things worked. The fact that this trailing whitespace problem was common enough that the database engine added a feature to avoid it is in fact, the real WTF.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/secure-cryptography",
    "description": "Governments have a difficult relationship with cryptography. Certainly, they benefit from having secure, reliable and fast encryption. Arguably, their citizens also benefit- I would argue that being able to, say, handle online banking transactions securely is a net positive. But it creates a prisoner's dilemma: malicious individuals may conceal their activity behind encryption. From the perspective of a state authority, this is bad. Thus, you get the regular calls for a cryptosystem which allows secure communications but also allows the state to snoop on those messages. Of course, if you intentionally weaken a cryptographic system so that some people can bypass it, you've created a system which anyone can bypass. You can't have secure encryption which also allows snooping, any more than you can have an even prime number larger than two. This leaves us in a situation where mathematicians and cryptography experts are shouting, \"This isn't possible!\" and cops and politicians are shouting \"JUST NERD HARDER!\" back. Well, today's anonymous submitter found a crypto library which promises to allow secure communications and allow nation states to break that encryption. They've nerded harder! Let's take a look at some of their C code. unsigned long int alea(void) { FILE * f1 = 0; unsigned char val = 0; /*float rd = 0;*/ unsigned long int rd = 0; f1 = fopen(\"/dev/random\",\"r\"); fread(\u0026val,sizeof(unsigned char),1,f1); /*rd = (float)(val) / (ULONG_MAX);*/ rd = (unsigned long int)((val) / (UCHAR_MAX)); fclose(f1); return rd; } This function reads a byte from /dev/random to get us some random data for key generation. Unfortunately, it's using the XKCD algorithm: this function always returns 0. Note that they divide val by UCHAR_MAX before casting val to an unsigned long int. Which, there's also the issue here that 8 bits of entropy are always going to be 8 bits of entropy- casting it to an unsigned long int isn't going to be any more random than just passing back the 8-bits, because you only read 8 bits of randomness. There's also no reason why they couldn't have simply read an unsigned long's worth of random data. I appreciate the comment which indicates that rd used to be a floating point number. It doesn't make this code any better, but it's nice to see that they keep trying. Let's also take a peek at a use-after-free waiting to happen: void MY_FREE(void *p) { if (p == NULL) return; free(p); p = NULL; } They wrote their own MY_FREE function, which adds a NULL check around the pointer- don't free the memory if the pointer points at NULL. Nothing wrong with that (though this is better enforced structurally with clear ownership of memory, and not through conditional checks, so actually, yes, there's something wrong with that). After we free the memory pointed to by the pointer, we set the pointer equal to NULL. Except we don't. We set the local variable to NULL. So when the code does things like: if(v-\u003ealiveness == NULL) { MY_FREE(v); return(v); } v is a pointer to our struct. If the aliveness value is NULL, we want to delete that data from memory, so we call MY_FREE, and then we return our pointer to the struct- which is unchanged and definitely not null. It's pointing to what is now freed memory. If anyone touches it, the whole program blows up. Here's the upshot: it's almost a guarantee that this program has undefined behavior in there, someplace. This means the compiler is free to do anything, include implement a dual custody cryptographic algorithm which is magically secure and prevents abuse by state actors. It's as likely as nasal demons. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "title": "Tales from the Interview: Cleaning House",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/cleaning-house",
    "description": "Craig had been an IT manager at an immigration services company for several years, but was ready to move on. And for good reason- Craig had suffered his share of moronic helldesk nonsense and was ready to let someone else deal with it. This meant participating in interviews for his replacement. Craig had given a rather generous three months notice, and very quickly the remaining three months were taken up with interviewing possible replacements. Each interview followed the same basic pattern: Craig would greet the candidate, escort them down to the fish-bowl style conference room in the center of the office, where a panel of interviewers ran through a mix of behavioral and technical questions. The interviews were consistently disappointing, and so they'd move on to the next candidate, hoping for an improvement. After the first few interviews, he started making up questions about potentially horrible IT related disasters. \"You see an executive using scissors to cut the Ethernet cable. When pressed, they explain that they want their connection to be wireless. What do you do?\" \"It's the holiday season, and you see someone trying to extend Christmas lights in the break room using a suicide cable, what do you do?\" \"You discover one of the technicians has been hiding a bottle of whiskey in the server room. What do you do?\" This kept Craig entertained, but didn't get them any closer to hiring any of these candidates. One day, they brought in another candidate, and Craig ran the standard interview. His mind wasn't really on the interview- the candidate's resume wasn't the best they'd seen, and it took only a few minutes to establish that they probably weren't the best fit for the role. So Craig spent the time thinking more about whatever absurd question he was going to ask than what was going on in front of him. His mind drifted off, and his eyes wandered around the office. They strayed to the corner office, also fishbowl style, where the CEO sat. And that's when Craig realized he wasn't going to need to make anything up for today's interview. \"What would you do if you saw a member of staff washing their keyboard with Evian mineral water, while sitting at their desk, their computer still on and keyboard still plugged in?\" The candidate was bemused, and just sat silently. For a long beat, they just watched Craig. Craig, obligingly, pointed back to the CEO's office, where the CEO was in the process of doing exactly what Craig had described. The candidate took in the scene. Saw the placard announcing that as the CEO's office. Saw not just one, but two open bottles of Evian. Saw the water spreading everywhere, as the CEO hadn't considered things like \"have some paper towels on hand\". The candidate turned back to Craig, and eloquently shrugged. There was a world-weariness in the shrug, that spoke to long experience with situations like this. It was the shrug of an IT manager that was going to keep a healthy stock of replacement keyboards, and never ever let the CEO have a laptop. In the end, it was that candidate who got the job, not because they had the best interview, or the best resume, but because they knew what they were getting in to, and were ready to deal with it. The keyboard, however, wasn't so lucky. \"How else was I supposed to get the breadcrumbs out of it?\" the CEO asked while Craig replaced the keyboard. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "title": "CodeSOD: A Managed Session",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-managed-session",
    "description": "Some time ago, Roald started an internship on a ASP .Net application. It didn't take long to find some \"special\" code. public string RetrieveSessionString(string sessionName) { try { return Session[sessionName].ToString(); } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } The Session variable is a session object for this user session. Each request carries a token which allows us to pair a Session with a user, making a cross-request per-user global object. That is what it is- but it's weird that we call the parameter sessionName. Maybe that's just a bad parameter name- it might be better called sessionKey or something like that. Of course, the real issue here is it's null handling. Calling ToString on a key that doesn't exist throws a NullReferenceException, so we handle it just to return a null, thus making future NullReferenceExceptions somebody else's problem. Arguably, an empty string would be a better behavior. Still, I hate it. But Roald also found this function's evil twin: public Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e RetrieveSessionDictionary(string sessionName) { try { return (Dictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e)Session[sessionName]; } catch (NullReferenceException) { return null; } } This is the same function, but instead of fetching a string, it fetches a dictionary of string/string pairs. It does the same null handling, but notably, doesn't do any error handling for situations where the cast fails. And suddenly, this makes more sense. They're using the word \"session\" in two different contexts. There's the Session- a series of HTTP requests sharing the same token- and there's a user's session- settings which represent a unit of work. They're storing a dictionary representing a session in the Session object. Which leaves this code feeling just… gross. It makes sense, and aside from the awful null handling, I understand why it works this way. It's just awkward and uncomfortable and annoying. I dislike it. Also, functions which are name RetrieveBlahAsType are generally an antipattern. Either there should be some generics, or type conversions should be left to the caller- RetrieveSession(sessionName).ToString() is clearer with its intent than RetrieveSessionString(sessionName). Maybe that's just my hot take- I just hate it when functions return something converted away from its canonical representation; I can do that myself, thank you.

    "description": "Anders sends us an example which isn't precisely a WTF. It's just C handling C strings. Which, I guess, when I say it that way, is a WTF. while(modPath != NULL) { p = strchr(modPath, ':'); if(p != NULL) { *p++ = '\\0'; } dvModpathCreate(utSymCreate(modPath)); modPath = p; } while(modPath != NULL); We start with a variable called modPath which points to a C string. So long as modPath is not null, we're going to search through the string. The string is in a : separated format, e.g., foo:bar:goo. We want to split it. This function does this by being very C about it. It uses strchr to find the address of the first colon. If we think about this in C strings, complete with null terminators, it looks something like this: \"foo:bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath We then replace : with \\0 and increment p, doing a \"wonderful\" blend of using the dereference operator and the post-increment operator and an assignment to accomplish a lot in one line. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ ^ | | | p modPath So now, modPath points at a terminated string foo, which we then pass down through some functions. Then we set it equal to p. \"foo\\0bar:goo\\0\" ^ | p modPath This repeats until strchr doesn't find a :, at which point it returns NULL. Our loop is guarded by a check that modPath (which gets set equal to p) can't be null, so that breaks us out of the loop. And enters us immediately into another, single line loop with no body, which immediately exits as well. I suspect that originally this was written as a do{}while, and then someone realized that it could just be a plain while{}, and completely forgot to remove the second while clause. This is, honestly, a pretty common idiom in C. It's arguably wrong to even put it here; aside from the bad while clause, you'll see this kind of string handling all the time. But, maybe, that is the WTF. [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift. Get started with Otter today!",

    "description": "It's not brought up frequently, but a \"CodeSOD\" is a \"Code Sample of the Day\". Martin brings us this function, entitled StringOfToday. It's in VB.Net, which, as we all know, has date formatting functions built in. Public Function StringOfToday() As String Dim d As New DateTime d = Now Dim DayString As String If d.Day \u003c 10 Then DayString = \"0\" \u0026 d.Day.ToString Else DayString = d.Day.ToString End If Dim MonthString As String If d.Month \u003c 10 Then MonthString = \"0\" \u0026 d.Month.ToString Else MonthString = d.Month.ToString End If Dim YearString As String = d.Year.ToString Return YearString \u0026 MonthString \u0026 DayString End Function There's not much new here, when it comes to formatting dates as strings.
