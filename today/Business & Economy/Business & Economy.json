    "description": "Many industries depend on the government to finance infrastructure and research before a true private market can develop. In the case of space, there is still a strong need for public-private collaboration. But as costs drop to reach space, more private-sector companies can enter the market. Matthew Weinzierl is a senior associate dean and professor at Harvard Business School, and Brendan Rosseau is a strategy manager at Blue Origin. They explain the evolving role of the U.S. government to foster innovation and competition as the space economy increasingly privatizes. They also identify the emerging opportunities for businesses and individuals. Weinzierl and Rosseau are authors of the book Space to Grow: Unlocking the Final Economic Frontier.",

Indeed, 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies had immigrant founders. While most research focuses on why these people launched their businesses, perhaps more interesting is how they achieved lasting success. Neri Karra Sillaman is an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University and the founder of luxury leather goods company Neri Karra. She's studied these entrepreneurs and shares her findings, which offer lessons for anyone in the corporate world.

    "description": "Often called the Oscars of the food industry, the James Beard Foundation Awards are among the most coveted for chefs in America. But what's sold and packaged as prestige can sometimes become a distraction from managing the business that got you there. Host Matt Brown is joined by The New York Times food critic Brett Anderson \u0026 chef Chintan Pandya (Dhamaka, Semma, Adda, Unapologetic Foods) to learn that an award can not only change a winner's life but an entire industry as a whole.",

    "description": "Cookware is a $73 billion global industry - awash in all kinds of pots and pans. Like, if you’ve ever cooked scrambled eggs, you've probably used a non-stick frying pan. They’re inexpensive and everywhere. But they’ve been dogged by complaints: many can’t handle high heat, like broiling or searing, and they scratch easily. So, when Danny Winer came across a new non-stick technology at a trade show overseas, he jumped on it, co-founding Hexclad with a buddy. Danny was convinced it could be adapted to the U.S. market - and be a hit. He was right! In just under ten years, Hexclad grew into a $500 million company.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson, with music by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Andrea Bruce, with research help from Katherine Sypher.
