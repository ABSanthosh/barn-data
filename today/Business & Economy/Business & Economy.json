Instead of chasing enterprise clients or trying to build a CRM that does everything from web hosting to calendaring, Steli Efti focused on sales teams at small and mid-sized businesses. And he built a product with a tight set of features focused on more client conversations and less data entry. Steli Efti is the co-founder and CEO of Close, a CRM platform designed to eliminate manual data entry and make sales more human and efficient. Before launching Close, he co-founded Elastic Sales (a sales-as-a-service agency) and SwipeGood (a charitable micro-donation startup) Fun fact‚Äîhe once said he spent six years following up twice a year to finally buy the domain close.com.

The product was a hit - but the retail model wasn‚Äôt. Faced with mounting losses, Josh shut down the store and moved into a warehouse to pivot to wholesale. With time, tenacity, and a now-iconic clear jar, Talenti became a national sensation, and in 2014, was acquired by Unilever.
