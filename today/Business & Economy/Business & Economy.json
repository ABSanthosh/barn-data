    "description": "Asking questions is a powerful way to build trust, exchange ideas, and unlock value in organizations. And it is a skill that can be honed to make work conversations more productive, say Leslie K. John and Alison Wood Brooks, professors at Harvard Business School. In this classic episode, they join former host Sarah Green Carmichael to talk through insights from behavioral science research. They share techniques to adjust the frame, tone, and type of questions to improve results—whether you’re looking to get information, find solutions, or just get someone to like you. Brooks and John wrote the article “The Surprising Power of Questions” in the May–June 2018 issue of Harvard Business Review.",

    "description": "Many companies make money by selling goods that need to be constantly replaced; think fast fashion, or tech devices that come out in new versions each year. But according to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, smart organizations are increasingly eschewing that strategy for one focused on products that grow with the consumer through creative design or software updates. He shares several examples and explains how this approach can deliver more value for the buyer – and for the business – over the long term. Govindarajan is the coauthor of the HBR article \"Design Products That Won't Become Obsolete.\"",

    "link": "",
    "description": "The company behind the blockbuster acne fighter, Mighty Patch, was launched in 2017 with a single product sold exclusively on Amazon. It was inspired by similar patches Ju Rhyu had seen while living in Korea. Ju struggled with breakouts herself, and when she tried a patch and saw how well they worked, she was inspired to tailor a patch for the U.S. market. So, while the product wasn’t new, Ju recognized a niche to be filled.Over the next five years, Ju and her co-founders—brothers Dwight and Andy Lee—grew Mighty Patch from a niche product to a cosmetics industry sensation. Seemingly overnight, teens and young adults across America and all over social media could be seen proudly wearing patches on their faces. The Mighty Patch became so successful that in 2022 Hero Cosmetics sold for $630 million. And today, Hero is the number one selling acne treatment brand in the United States.This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei and Sam Paulson.Edited by Andrea Bruce, with research from Olivia Rockeman. Our engineers were Gilly Moon and Robert Rodriguez. You can follow HIBT on X \u0026 Instagram, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.

    "description": "Serial entrepreneur and U.S. National Bobsled Team qualifier Marc Lore joins Guy on the Advice Line, where they answer questions from three early stage founders. Marc also discusses his latest venture - Wonder - and its recent shift away from food prep and delivery vans; plus, what founders should consider when making their own strategic pivots. First we meet Ben in Oregon, who’s wondering if his chocolate factory should double down on an experiential offering in light of increased cocoa prices. Then Lindsey in Utah, who’s looking for ways to convince retailers to carry her portable diaper kits. And Ryan in Colorado, who’s weighing whether to focus on national expansion for his whiskey brand, or deepening market penetration in the Rockies. Thank you to the founders of Chomp Chocolate, Baby a GoGo and 10th Mountain Whiskey and Spirit Company for being part of the show.If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered.
