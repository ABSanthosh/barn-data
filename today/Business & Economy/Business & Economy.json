    "description": "It might seem that high-achievers with important jobs don't need — or even have time for — activities that bring them joy. But it turns out that finding joy at all stages of life (along with achievement and meaningfulness) is essential to feeling satisfied and being a more effective leader. Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow has studied busy executives who do - or do not - find joy and explains the main ways that we can all make the most limited free time, including avoiding passive pursuits and diversifying our activities. Perlow is founder of the Crafting Your Life Project, which created the Life Matrix tool, and coauthor, along with Sari Menster and Salvatore Affinito, of the HBR article \"How the Busiest People Find Joy.\"",

But it seems even more pronounced at work today, as political and economic issues seep into the office. Leaders must have the muscles to handle conflict big and small, argues Peter T. Coleman, a professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, where he directs the Morton Deutsch International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution. He explains essential ingredients to conflict-intelligence, like adaptability and creativity - and how they can help you run a better organization.

He’s the founder of My Body Tutor and DoneDaily, two remote coaching services powered by daily accountability. I invited him to share how he turned simple check-ins into a multi-million dollar company. Adam Gilbert was a personal trainer who was frustrated by seeing clients not follow through on the diet and exercise programs they committed to. So he offered to be their accountability buddy by text. The service he created, My Body Tutor, was profitable from its first month and continues to generate millions 18 years later. His latest company, DoneDaily, offers a similar accountability and coaching program for entrepreneurs.

Instead of chasing enterprise clients or trying to build a CRM that does everything from web hosting to calendaring, Steli Efti focused on sales teams at small and mid-sized businesses. And he built a product with a tight set of features focused on more client conversations and less data entry. Steli Efti is the co-founder and CEO of Close, a CRM platform designed to eliminate manual data entry and make sales more human and efficient. Before launching Close, he co-founded Elastic Sales (a sales-as-a-service agency) and SwipeGood (a charitable micro-donation startup) Fun fact—he once said he spent six years following up twice a year to finally buy the domain close.com.

He was convinced that granular health and heart data would become invaluable to other athletes if it could be bundled into a wearable wrist strap. In 2012, Will founded WHOOP, and after three years the company launched its first model, with Lebron James and Michael Phelps as advocates. But WHOOP struggled to gain traction with mere mortals, and spent years overhauling its business model and fending off big name competitors. Eventually it became one of the most popular wearables on the market, with a valuation well above $3 billion. This episode was researched and produced by Katherine Sypher and edited by Neva Grant, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
