And he built a product with a tight set of features focused on more client conversations and less data entry. Steli Efti is the co-founder and CEO of Close, a CRM platform designed to eliminate manual data entry and make sales more human and efficient. Before launching Close, he co-founded Elastic Sales (a sales-as-a-service agency) and SwipeGood (a charitable micro-donation startup) Fun fact‚Äîhe once said he spent six years following up twice a year to finally buy the domain close.com.

    "description": "Rick Steves spent the summer after high school backpacking through Europe on two dollars a day‚Äîsleeping on the floor, sneaking into museums, and subsisting on a diet of bread and jam. When he came home, he found people were hungry for tips on how to visit Europe on the cheap, so he began teaching classes, and was soon hawking a self-published guidebook out of his car. Eventually, he started leading minibus tours and hosting a travel show on Public TV, steadily growing his business even though he was giving away most of his content. His no-frills approach to travel has persisted as a powerful brand, with 70 guidebooks, an ever-popular travel show, and‚Äîin 2024‚Äîan annual revenue of $120 million.This episode was produced by Rachel Faulkner-White, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.Edited by Neva Grant.You can follow HIBT on¬†Twitter¬†\u0026¬†Instagram, and email us at¬†hibt@id.wondery.com.
