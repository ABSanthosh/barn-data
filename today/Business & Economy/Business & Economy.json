For marketers and product managers, it‚Äôs vital to understand what is driving that resistance to adoption. Julian De Freitas is an assistant professor in the marketing unit at Harvard Business School. He has identified five main ways people see artificial intelligence negatively: that AI is opaque, emotionless, inflexible, autonomous, and not human enough. Through real-life cases and the latest research, he explains how companies can soothe anxieties and encourage consumer adoption.

While many employers and employees still value and support DEI, a growing chorus argues that such programs run counter to meritocratic ideals. Iris Bohnet and Siri Chilazi of the Harvard Kennedy School think there's one principle everyone should be able to agree on -- fairness -- and argue for a data-driven approach to measuring it. They share their research on how to make workplace systems more fair and offer cases we can all learn from. They wrote the book¬†Make Work Fair: Data-Driven Design for Real Results.",

When Monica Nassif started Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs, she‚Äôd already launched an upscale cleaning brand, but it was too pricey for the mass market.¬†Worried that another company might muscle into her lane,¬†Monica decided to knock herself off: she launched Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs with an elegant design and exotic fragrances‚Äì but at a price point that allowed her to target Target. Monica‚Äôs mom Thelma became a beloved mascot for the brand, which‚Äìafter spreading to sinks across America ‚Äî was eventually acquired by S.C. Johnson.This episode was produced by Kerry Thompson with music by Ramtin Arablouei. Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Carla Esteves.
