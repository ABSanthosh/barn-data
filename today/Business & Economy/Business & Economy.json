    "description": "Vlada Lotkina noticed something wrong at her daughter’s school. So she built the solution and sold it for 8-figures. It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

Businesses that use Retention.com can instantly grab email addresses from anonymous website visitors — even if they never fill out a form. To promote his software he made himself into one of the few interesting follows on LinkedIn by picking fights, bringing drama and adding production values.

He previously worked in finance but launched the email marketing company Robly after the 2008 financial crisis jeopardized his career.

He started looking around, diving into old mines, and finding old treasures. He shot video of what he saw and of his renovations. That got hugely popular on social media, helped him raise money and allowed him to fund his project. It’s all in his book, Ghost Town Living, and in this interview.   Brent Underwood is the founder of Cerro Gordo, an ambitious project aimed at reviving a historic ghost town into a tourist attraction and real estate opportunity.

    "description": "My vision for this interview was to hear Noah Kagan’s process for launching companies, like the $80+ million / year AppSumo – the process he wrote about in his book, Million Dollar Weekend. We did that. You’ll hear his step-by-step business launch process. But, when I asked him how he was proving his process, he told me he was creating an alternative to Docusign and started asking me about the problems I have with it. I got so angry listing my problems that I told him I’d fork up whatever money he wanted to buy his alternative. Noah Kagan is the founder of AppSumo, which provides entrepreneurs deals on software and other tools. He’s also a popular YouTuber whose channel just broke 1 million subscribers and the author of “Million Dollar Weekend.” Sponsored byGusto – The easy payroll and benefits software the Mixergy interviewees love.

    "description": "On August 4, 2008, I posted a video up on Mixergy where I looked up into the web cam on my computer and I said “I failed.” And I said that I was going to shut down my invitation business and start doing interviews with entrepreneurs and people in general who I admire so I can learn from them and take back what I’ve learned from them to build a more successful company in the future. And I said that along the way you’d get to watch and learn as I learned directly from my heroes. We did it. A thousand interviews later here I am today bringing back some of the most memorable and most influential interviewees. People who helped me both on camera here with you and off. I invited them on to a Google Hangout to talk about the old days, to ask them some new questions and to do short interviews with them all for you. That’s what this is all about. My goal when I started out was to build a successful company. I think Mixergy is that company. But I wanted to be even more successful. My goal is that I started to talk in interviews afterwards evolved into saying that I would like someone who is watching these interviews to learn from them, to use what they’ve learned and then build a successful company so they can come back and do an interview themselves. I am the founder of Mixergy, home of the ambitious upstart. And this is my 1,000th interview.

I hunt down information that you can use because I’m passionate about helping you build a business that your great-great-grandkids would admire you for. That’s why I kept digging in this interview. I want you (and me too, frankly) to be able to produce the kind of hits that Seth Godin keeps cranking out, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Not only has Seth created 2 big hit businesses, but he’s a writer who keeps introducing ideas that shape the way people think. In his new book, Linchpin, Seth talks about how to be this prolific. As you’ll hear in my interview, much of it is based on opening up your creativity and learning how to confront your fears, which he says come from your “lizard brain.” Imagine what you could accomplish if you were able to do that. Listen to the full program to find out how. Seth Godin’s latest book is Linchpin. You can buy it here or see what others say about it on this Squidoo lens. He also writes the world’s most popular marketing blog. And is the founder of Squidoo.   More interviews -\u003e https://mixergy.com/moreint Rate this interview -\u003e https://mixergy.com/rateint",

    "description": "There was a time when business leaders and managers didn't worry so much about psychology or other social science research. Malcolm Gladwell's writing played a big role in changing that. His popular exploration of tipping points — the phenomenon where small, incremental actions can suddenly fuse into a full-blown social behavior — brought research insights to life and made them mainstream. Now he's revisiting tipping points, this time looking at how they can be used for damaging results. In this episode, HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius speaks to Gladwell about how the author’s ideas have changed, the importance of social science and journalism in today's world of virality, and the unexpected ways leaders should consider human behavior. Gladwell is the author of the new book Revenge of the Tipping Point: Overstories, Superspreaders, and the Rise of Social Engineering.",

But, as with any technology that sees widespread adoption, AI itself won't be enough to build a long-term advantage over competitors, says Jay Barney, professor at the University of Utah's Eccles School of Business. Yes, leaders need to deploy these new tools, especially those that use GenAI, to stay relevant. But they also need to think about how AI can be applied to their business' differentiating competencies and offerings to truly add value. Barney is the coauthor, along with Martin Reeves of Boston Consulting Group, of the HBR article \"AI Won't Give You a New Sustainable Advantage.\"",

But Michael Morris, professor at Columbia Business School, says that term is often misunderstood and that tribal instincts can in fact be very positive influences in society and at work. He uses the lens of cultural psychology to explain the deep-seated instincts behind the human need to join and identify as a group. And he breaks down how team managers and organizational leaders can leverage tribal instincts in positive ways strengthen workplace culture. Morris is the author of the new book Tribal: How the Cultural Instincts That Divide Us Can Help Bring Us Together.",

They offer advice on how to hone all three.

    "description": "Many marketers today focus on getting consumers to consciously change their behavior. But that’s a sure path to failure, according to Leslie Zane, founder of Triggers Brand Consulting. She says neuroscience research shows that mastering instinct is far more effective than persuasion. And she shares her key lessons for aligning with the instinctive mind to improve company brands, new products, social campaigns, or your own personal brand. Zane is the author of the book The Power of Instinct: The New Rules of Persuasion in Business and Life.",

    "description": "When news breaks of a CEO succession, much of the attention is given to the new leader and how they will change the company. But new research shows that the leave-taking process of the outgoing chief executive is often mishandled, with negative impacts on succession and the organization. Rebecca Slan Jerusalim, an executive director at Russell Reynolds Associates, and Navio Kwok, a leadership advisor at RRA, say that boards are often surprised when a CEO gives notice, and they often make that person feel excluded during the handoff process. The researchers share stories from the front lines about CEO psychology, best practices for outgoing leaders and their boards, and broader lessons for effective transitions. Jerusalim and Kwok wrote the HBR article \"The Vital Role of the Outgoing CEO.\"",

Often, leaders wait way too long to sit down with an employee who isn’t meeting expectations. Leadership coach Jenny Fernandez says that increasing the frequency of feedback and consciously developing better relationships with direct reports help make these conversations easier to start. And she shares how the right preparation, tone, and open-minded approach lead to more effective discussions that improve not just the one-on-one relationship, but also team morale and turnover rates.

    "description": "While most good bosses try to be fair and balanced with their direct reports, it's only human to prefer the company and work styles of some team members over others, and employees are keenly aware of those preferences. They see favorites and non-favorites, ingroups and outgroups -- and when those divisions fester, they can destroy team culture and performance. Ginka Toegel, professor at IMD Business School, explains why even well-intentioned managers succumb to favoritism, how workers on both sides are affected, and what we can do to both avoid and rectify the problem.

Discover how adapting to the changing tides can lead to more tremendous success for businesses and marketing professionals; however, why might it not be for everyone?

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interviewed Zach Kromkowski, co-founder of Sention, about the importance of cybersecurity for small businesses and marketing firms. Zach's cybersecurity journey began with a passion for problem-solving and a talent for turning ideas into reality. Blending intelligence, tenacity, and a love for community education, he simplifies cybersecurity through webinars, workshops, and consultations, helping MSPs and enterprises easily enhance their security. We discuss best practices for system hardening, managing security in a distributed workforce, and the significance of password management and compliance standards. The conversation also touches on the risks AI poses in cybersecurity and the necessity of implementing two-factor authentication and VPNs. Zach also emphasizes that adequate security doesn't require a large budget and offers practical steps businesses can take to enhance their security posture.   Key Takeaways Cybersecurity is crucial for marketing firms and small businesses. System hardening can be done without a large budget. Managing security in a distributed workforce requires clear policies. Google Workspace users should regularly review linked accounts. Password managers are essential for secure password storage. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a must for all software. SOC 2 compliance is a common standard for businesses. AI poses unique risks in cybersecurity that need to be addressed. Adding layers of security can deter potential attacks.

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interviewed Brian Gottlieb, founder of Tundraland Home Improvements and author of 'Beyond the Hammer'. He transformed a $3,000 investment into a multi-state enterprise with nearly $1 billion in lifetime sales. An inspirational business leader and Harvard Business School executive education alumnus, Gottlieb champions a leadership philosophy centered on strategy, empowerment, and consistent execution while founding charitable initiatives like “Windows for a Cause” and “Baths for the Brave”. We discuss Brian’s journey in building a successful business from the ground up, emphasizing the importance of belief in leadership, creating a positive company culture, and the impact of community initiatives. Brian shares insights on effective feedback techniques, the significance of employee engagement, and how to align a team around a joint mission. The conversation highlights the role of training and development in fostering a motivated workforce and the importance of understanding employee perspectives through stay interviews.   Key Takeaways Starting a business with limited resources can lead to innovative solutions. Belief in people is crucial for leadership and team success. Aligning a team around a joint mission enhances performance. Creating a positive employee experience is essential for retention. Feedback should be constructive and encouraging to foster growth. Stay interviews provide valuable insights into employee satisfaction. Company culture is shaped by the behaviors tolerated within the organization. Community initiatives can enhance employee engagement and brand reputation. Recruitment should focus on finding individuals who align with the company's mission.

    "link": "https://ducttapemarketing.com/why-subject-lines-matter",
    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interview Jay Schwedelson, a leading marketing expert in the US known for his research-backed approach. He’s the Founder of SubjectLine.com, a top-ranked free subject-line rating tool, and has tested over 15 million subject lines. Jay Schwedelson also founded GURU Media Hub, hosting the GURU conference, the world’s largest email marketing event, attracting over 50,000 attendees annually. His popular podcast, “Do This, Not That!: For Marketers,” is a top-rated marketing podcast in the U.S. Through Outcome Media, Jay’s team runs over 40,000 campaigns annually for top global brands. He’s been recognized as a top industry leader and inducted into the Hall of Fame at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. We discuss the importance of subject lines in email marketing and share tips for improving open rates. We also cover The significance of call-to-action buttons The timing of email sends ESPs' (Email Sending Providers) role The relationship between email and landing pages List hygiene and the impact of AI and privacy on email marketing   Key Takeaways: Subject Lines: Your subject lines are crucial for getting emails opened. Starting the subject line with a number or fully capitalizing the FIRST WORD can increase open rates, and using an ellipsis or a question mark at the end of the subject line can also pique curiosity. Call-to-action buttons: CTAs should be written in the first person to increase click-through rates. The language should focus on what’s in it for your recipient rather than what you want. Timing: We all know the timing of your email depends on the type and target audience. Newsletters do well at the start of the week, while offer-based emails may perform better on weekdays or weekends. Or do they? ESPs: The selection of an ESP should be based on your business’s specific needs. Different ESPs specialize in various types of email marketing, such as B2C or B2B. When you’re tempted to blame your ESP, ask if you chose wisely. Landing Pages: Email and landing pages should be closely connected. Emails should direct recipients to specific landing pages that are optimized for conversion. Social proof, such as testimonials, can make your landing pages more compelling. List Hygiene: List hygiene is essential for maintaining email deliverability. Hard bounces should be immediately removed from the list, and soft bounces should be monitored and removed after multiple occurrences. AI: AI is expected to significantly impact email marketing in the future. Apple’s iOS 18 will introduce AI-driven email bucketing, which will affect how emails are categorized and displayed on mobile devices.   More About Jay Schwedelson: Check Out his Website - https://jayschwedelson.com/ Visit Guru Conference - http://www.guruconference.com/ Add him on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/schwedelson/ Rate, Review, \u0026 Follow on Apple Podcasts If you liked this episode, please rate and review the show.

    "description": "In this episode of The Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I talk about the elusive: Content. What it is, What it’s been, and where it’s going. In other words, Air, King, and now AI-generated? I refer to content not as a tactic but as the voice of strategy. But how can AI be used effectively in content creation? With the approach of producing 'Pillar Content' and breaking it into subtopics. The best use of many AI tools is to 'produce good content in the easiest way possible', which to me is video—producing and repurposing it into various formats. I also discuss the ‘Content Sprint Methodology,’ which involves using AI to generate additional assets based on the original content.   Key Takeaways Content is essential for building trust and authority. AI can be a valuable tool for content creation, but it is best used to generate ideas and enhance original content. Producing pillar content and breaking it into subtopics is an effective strategy for creating valuable and relevant content. Using AI to create videos and repurpose content can save time and effort in content production.

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I aim to stir the pot in yet another solo show by sharing a distinct and uncommon point of view (or five) in marketing. I've never really understood the insane popularity of Simon Sinek’s 'Find your why notion.' I mean, it's been said before, right? Maybe even better. My why is: Why is that particular video so popular?! Regardless, Marketers often make marketing too complicated anyway. Fun fact: complexity in marketing is just disguised incompetence. Chasing trends is a recipe for failure, and you shouldn’t just repurpose your content but make it purposeful. I also draw special attention to the significance of customer experience as the true differentiator and the importance of measuring marketing effectiveness. Stick around for 10 minutes of me crossing the line between fact and opinion as I share all I learned in my experience in the industry in a few words of wisdom, all in one belief system that you can adopt to run your agency better.   Key Takeaways (Or What I Believe) Share a distinct and uncommon point of view about your business and its offerings to differentiate yourself in the market. Focus on solving your ideal client’s problems rather than just promoting your products or services. Create purposeful content and use marketing automation to personalize your interactions with customers. Build long-term relationships with customers and prioritize customer experience as the true differentiator. Measure the effectiveness of your marketing activities to avoid wasting time and money. Use data to gain insights and make informed decisions. Avoid unnecessary complexity in marketing and strive for simplicity and clarity.   Oracle Nobody does data better than Oracle.

    "link": "https://ducttapemarketing.com/ready-to-be-a-fractional-cmo",
    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I do a solo show exploring the misconceptions surrounding the role of the Fractional CMO. As businesses increasingly seek scalable marketing leadership, the demand for fractional CMOs has surged. But not so much the supply. Yes, there is some interest, but there’s a lot of noise and confusion surrounding this idea. People want to learn and are learning by doing but don’t feel quite there yet. If you’re one of those people reading this, Are you ready to put that title on your LinkedIn profile? More so; What does it mean to be a Fractional CMO? What are the skills required? How can this role significantly impact your agency’s growth strategy?   Key Takeaways: Strategic Thinking: A fractional CMO must lead with strategy, developing comprehensive marketing plans aligned with business objectives. This approach ensures that every tactic and channel contributes to the company’s long-term goals. Leadership: Many businesses lack strategic marketing leadership, especially in the $3 to $30 million range. A fractional CMO fills this gap by advocating for the customer and aligning marketing efforts with the broader business strategy. Technical Skills: Besides strategy, a fractional CMO must possess strong technical skills to advise on and implement marketing technologies that optimize operations and enhance efficiency. Industry Knowledge: A fractional CMO needs a broad understanding of various industries and extensive marketing experience. This knowledge allows them to tailor strategies that resonate with different market segments. Data-Driven Decisions: The ability to analyze data and set measurable KPIs is essential. A fractional CMO must demonstrate the impact of marketing initiatives on the company’s bottom line, proving their value through continuous improvement. Strategy First: Lastly, Strategy First! Every engagement should start with a well-defined marketing strategy that aligns with the business’s objectives. This strategy-first mindset allows Fractional CMOs to provide clear direction and measurable results, setting the stage for successful marketing initiatives.

    "description": "Rate, Review, \u0026 Follow on Apple Podcasts In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interviewed Sean Malone, a leading expert in the sales industry and a pioneer in leveraging direct messaging (DM) as a powerful tool for high-conversion sales. With the shift in consumer behavior and the increasing saturation of traditional sales channels, Sean Malone sheds light on why DMs are quickly becoming the new cold calls and how sales teams can harness this untapped powerhouse to drive better results. He explains that integrating DMs into your sales-management strategy could be the key to unlocking more personalized, efficient, and successful sales processes.   Key Takeaways We’ve all experienced the declining effectiveness of traditional cold calls, but have we explored the potential of DMs as a high-conversion sales tool? DMs might just be the final frontier for your business sales strategy. Sean Malone and I discuss DMs, which are emerging as a critical component of modern sales-management strategies. As DMs continue to be a sacred place for most people online, he emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of DM communication, including personalization, timing, and the art of crafting a compelling message that resonates with potential clients—not just anybody. You want a potential client, a lead, not just a dead end, so perhaps don’t pitch until the 5th DM. Incorporating DMs into your sales-management toolkit is a strategic approach that balances automation with a human touch. He explains the benefits of DMs in building stronger customer relationships, increasing engagement, and ultimately driving higher conversion rates. In this episode, you’ll learn how to optimize your sales-management practices with DMs, why they’re becoming an essential sales tool, and how to leverage this approach for your agency's success.   More About Sean Malone: Add Sean Malone on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmalone028/ Check out his Website - https://flowchat.com/ Subscribe to Flow Chat's Youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/c/flowchat If you liked this episode, please rate and review the show.

Each of the chain’s properties was decorated to reflect the character of the college town in which it was based, with photos of famous alums or life-sized sports mascots in the lobby. After 13 years in commercial real estate, Ben got the idea for Graduate after renovating a dilapidated Days Inn in Chicago, and realizing that a hotel can tell a story as well as—maybe even better than—a box of cereal or a pair of shoes. Although the Covid lockdowns threatened to bankrupt Graduate, Ben was able to secure the chain’s future by selling it to Hilton, and today the 35 (+) chain is expected to add dozens more properties.This episode was produced by Devan Schwartz with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.

What they did understand was how to sell it—with a carefree name and label that evoked the beach, and a consistent flavor and low price point that attracted shoppers who normally rejected wine as being too snooty. But winning over that audience took extreme patience, and years of pavement-pounding by Michael. In 2005—twenty years after launch—Barefoot had become ubiquitous, and was acquired by E \u0026 J Gallo, one of the biggest wine brands in the world.  This episode was produced by J.C.

    "description": "Andrew Mason was a 27-year-old with a degree in music when he co-founded one of the fastest growing companies of all time: Groupon. Its deep discounts on everything from sushi rolls to plastic surgery soon became a ubiquitous part of life in cities across the world. In 2011, just three years after launching, Groupon had the largest internet IPO since Google, with a valuation of $12.7 billion.But people began to complain that Andrew was not up to the role of CEO: he was quirky and unpredictable, and unable to navigate the company’s rocket-ship growth and the surge of copycats that threatened it. Soon, Groupon’s revenue slumped, and Andrew was fired from the company he’d started. But like many of the best entrepreneurs, he learned from his failure. Today, Andrew runs a new startup, an audio and video editing platform called Descript. In fact, we use Descript to make this show! This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei.Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Kathrine Sypher.

But for Ben, that presented an irresistible challenge: to create a beverage that evoked the colas and root beers of his youth, but was low in sugar and good for the gut. After years of painstaking effort and one failed brand, Ben and his partner launched Olipop in 2018. Made with fiber and prebiotics and sweetened with Stevia, it joined the growing ranks of “functional sodas,” launching first in natural food stores and spreading quickly to the big chains. This year, the brand is expected to do nearly $500 million in sales, and, as younger consumers drift away from legacy soda, Ben says Olipop will only get bigger.This episode was produced by Sam Paulson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei and Sam Paulson.

So he took matters into his own hands and started making and delivering cookies to students at his school. The operation soon went from a silly side hustle to a real business - and then an all-consuming struggle.

With a retro- feel catalog that turned shopping into an adventure, Banana Republic caught the attention of the media, and sales grew. But so did the headaches of running the business, and in 1983, the Zieglers sold the brand to The Gap. Over the years, Banana Republic lost its distinctive, retro-Safari feel, and the Zieglers departed to start another brand, The Republic of Tea.

As a solution, Nick and his co-founders launched an e-commerce mashup of Whole Foods and Costco, where members purchase healthy foods online at a discount.When it came time to ask venture capitalists for funding, dozens of VC’s said no–but thanks to hundreds of small checks written by health bloggers, Thrive Market pulled together enough money to launch in 2014. Within a year, the founders had proven the VC’s wrong, but still scrambled to fuel the pace of growth, while keeping the business afloat. Today, Thrive Market has over 1.5 million paid members and, last year, brought in over $500 million in sales.

    "link": "",
    "description": "Tara Bosch wasn’t always considered a likely contender for success. At 21 years old, she dropped out of college the summer before her junior year and moved in to her grandmother’s basement. But, with a gummy bear mold from Amazon and a sugar-free candy recipe she tinkered to perfection, Tara got to work on a wild vision: she would create a global company called SmartSweets that would revolutionize the candy aisle and become a top seller of low-sugar candies. In 2020, Tara achieved her goal and sold SmartSweets for $360 million — a mere five years after creating the brand.  This episode was produced by Carla Esteves with music by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Andrea Bruce with research help from Melia Agudelo.
