They share techniques to adjust the frame, tone, and type of questions to improve results—whether you’re looking to get information, find solutions, or just get someone to like you.

But according to Vijay Govindarajan, professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, smart organizations are increasingly eschewing that strategy for one focused on products that grow with the consumer through creative design or software updates. He shares several examples and explains how this approach can deliver more value for the buyer – and for the business – over the long term. Govindarajan is the coauthor of the HBR article \"Design Products That Won't Become Obsolete.\"",

Then Lindsey in Utah, who’s looking for ways to convince retailers to carry her portable diaper kits.

    "description": "When Kip Tindell co-founded The Container Store in 1978, people laughed at him for wanting to sell empty boxes. But Kip and his partners had identified a clear problem—the tyranny of household clutter—and a new category of solutions: metal crates, stackable wicker baskets, sleek lucite canisters. The Container Store’s promise of affordable organization made it an instant hit, and Kip’s wife Sharon soon joined the partnership. Decades later, as online shopping took off, the business faltered; and in 2013, when The Container Store went public, Kip and Sharon came to regret it.This episode was produced by J.C.
