    "description": "Amid the backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, leaders in both the public and private sectors are reevaluating their organizations' policies and goals. While many employers and employees still value and support DEI, a growing chorus argues that such programs run counter to meritocratic ideals. Iris Bohnet and Siri Chilazi of the Harvard Kennedy School think there's one principle everyone should be able to agree on -- fairness -- and argue for a data-driven approach to measuring it. They share their research on how to make workplace systems more fair and offer cases we can all learn from. They wrote the book Make Work Fair: Data-Driven Design for Real Results.",

    "link": "",
    "description": "When Michelle Wahler and Jodi Guber Brufsky set out to launch a yoga wear brand in 2005, they had no idea that it would eventually be acquired—for hundreds of millions of dollars—by one of the most iconic apparel brands in the world. But it took years for Beyond Yoga to get to that point. It grew slowly by partnering with yoga studios and mom-and-pop boutiques, and apart from some initial seed money, it never took on any outside investment. With an obsessive focus on soft fabrics, inclusive sizing and U.S.-based manufacturing, Beyond Yoga eventually began competing with more established brands like Lululemon and Athleta. And in 2021, the brand was acquired by Levi’s for $400 million. This episode was produced by Chris Maccini with music by Ramtin Arablouei. Edited by Neva Grant, with research from Kathryn Sypher. Our engineers were James Willetts, Patrick Murray and Robert Rodriguez. You can follow HIBT on X \u0026 Instagram, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.
