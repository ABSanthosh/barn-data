Next we hear from Matt in Massachusetts, who’s leaning into success growing premium mushrooms for local chefs without getting too big, too fast. Then Joey in Chicago, owner of a restaurant specializing in fried chicken wings and fresh-cut fries, who’s deciding whether to introduce new products or double down on what’s already working.Thank you to the founders of Dini’s Divine Pies, Underground Mushroom Co. and Dak Dak Korean Wings for being part of the show.

    "description": "What started as a design project for Stanford student Evan Spiegel quickly flourished into one of the most-used social media platforms in the world: Snapchat. It only took two years for Mark Zuckerberg to make a multi-billion offer for the company. But Evan turned it down — convinced of Snap’s potential to disrupt human communication in an even bigger way. And while Evan’s path has been anything but smooth, today Snap is valued at more than $13 billion, with ambitions beyond its hero mobile app.This episode was produced by Alex Cheng with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei.

Indeed, 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies had immigrant founders. While most research focuses on why these people launched their businesses, perhaps more interesting is how they achieved lasting success. Neri Karra Sillaman is an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University and the founder of luxury leather goods company Neri Karra. She's studied these entrepreneurs and shares her findings, which offer lessons for anyone in the corporate world.
