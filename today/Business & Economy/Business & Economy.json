    "description": "With some high-profile CEOs demanding workers return to the office five days a week, and others touting the benefits of fully remote work, many companies compromised and ended up somewhere in the middle. But that hybrid compromise can often bring the worst of both worlds. Wharton professor Peter Cappelli and senior HR strategist Ranya Nehmeh have looked deeply at what is going wrong with hybrid - and how leaders can make it right. They explain practical ways to improve meetings, build culture, and inspire commitment from employees in a hybrid model, which is most likely here to stay. Cappelli and Nehmeh are the authors of the forthcoming book¬†In Praise of the Office: The Limits to Hybrid and Remote Work and the HBR article \"Hybrid Still Isn't Working\".

Instead of chasing enterprise clients or trying to build a CRM that does everything from web hosting to calendaring, Steli Efti focused on sales teams at small and mid-sized businesses. And he built a product with a tight set of features focused on more client conversations and less data entry. Steli Efti is the co-founder and CEO of Close, a CRM platform designed to eliminate manual data entry and make sales more human and efficient. Before launching Close, he co-founded Elastic Sales (a sales-as-a-service agency) and SwipeGood (a charitable micro-donation startup) Fun fact‚Äîhe once said he spent six years following up twice a year to finally buy the domain close.com.

    "description": "On a trip to Las Vegas, Chris Riccobono found himself wearing the same J.Crew shirt over and over; it was the only dress shirt he had that looked good untucked. All of his other button-downs were too long and looked sloppy. His buddies all said they had the same problem, so Chris decided to seize the opportunity and launch UNTUCKit with a friend. Keeping his day job as a¬† GE salesman, he embarked on a crash course in how not to make a shirt. Thousands of defective button-downs later, UNTUCKit hit its stride, and the big fashion brands began to copy the untucked look. In 2020, UNTUCKit came within inches of a lucrative acquisition, then nearly went bankrupt, but today has grown into a thriving brand.¬† This episode was produced by J.C.
