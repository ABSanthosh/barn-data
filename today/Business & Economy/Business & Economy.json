    "description": "Vlada Lotkina noticed something wrong at her daughter’s school. So she built the solution and sold it for 8-figures. It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

Businesses that use Retention.com can instantly grab email addresses from anonymous website visitors — even if they never fill out a form. To promote his software he made himself into one of the few interesting follows on LinkedIn by picking fights, bringing drama and adding production values.

    "description": "In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interview Argentina-based author Leigh Shulman. A writing mentor with two decades of experience under her belt. She founded The Inspired Writer Community, an online mentoring community for writers at any stage in their writing lives. Her bestselling book The Writer’s Roadmap: Paving the Way To Your Ideal Writing Life helps thousands find their way in the writing world. Her international writing retreat and website are listed as The Write Life’s top resources for writers, and her words have appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post, Longreads, and Guernica, among others. Leigh lives with her family, where she writes and contemplates (like most writers do) about whether she’s the only person who doesn’t like Dulce de Leche. We discuss the profound impact of writing a book on business success, the importance of storytelling in both fiction and nonfiction and the role of coaching in the writing process. We also explore how books can serve as trust builders, the influence of AI on writing, and strategies for finding time to write amidst busy schedules. Key Takeaways: Writing a book acts as a calling card for businesses. A book can directly lead to client engagement and revenue generation. Books can amplify credibility and visibility in the market. Every business can benefit from telling their story through a book. Books are part of a continuous learning process. Setting clear goals for your book is essential for success. Writing solidifies your process and helps define your next steps. Feedback from readers and peers can guide future writing projects. Both fiction and nonfiction writing share common storytelling elements. Coaching can alleviate the challenges and self-doubt in writing.
