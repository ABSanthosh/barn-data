    "description": "In this episode of the Duck Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of being interviewed by Sara Nay. Sara Nay is the COO of Duct Tape Marketing. She oversees day-to-day operations to support the growth of Duct Tape Marketing and the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network. She focuses on strategic planning, goal setting, and directing the company's operations in support of its goals. And on a personal note, she’s also my daughter—which makes me “Pop Pop” to her kids! In this episode, we change it up a bit as I become the interviewee. We explore my journey into entrepreneurship, why I started my own business, why I didn’t work for someone else (the answer will surprise you), my passion for small businesses, and the evolution of marketing over the years. I reveal lessons from my polar opposite parents and my former fears about running a business. We also dive into my favorite topic: the impact of AI on small businesses, the opportunities and challenges they face, and the importance of curiosity and innovation in business. I wrapped up with a glimpse into my future aspirations—what might life look like after Duct Tape? And I answered the timeless question: What’s my all-time favorite business book?

    "description": "In this episode of the Duck Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing David Edelman, a seasoned digital transformation and marketing expert. As CMO, Edelman guided Aetna (now part of CVS Health) through becoming a digitally oriented, customer-centric brand. He built McKinsey’s Digital Marketing Strategy Practice and had leadership roles at BCG and Digitas. Repeatedly recognized by Forbes as one of the “Most Influential CMOs in the World” and by AdWeek as one of the “Top 20 Marketing and Technology Executives,” his work has attracted over 1.1 million followers to his LinkedIn blog. Currently, David advises top executives on AI and personalization. In this episode, we dive into the ever-evolving world of personalization in business, uncovering the game-changing role of AI in redefining how companies connect with their audiences. Edelman emphasizes the importance of creating customer experiences at scale and the competitive advantage that effective personalization has. Edelman explores the advantages of personalization, while highlighting the ongoing challenges of overstepping boundaries—a pitfall many of us have encountered firsthand. He shares practical examples of how AI enhances customer interactions and tackles concerns about data privacy and the potential discomfort of overly personalized marketing. The conversation also touches on the challenges marketers face in content creation and the need for more thoughtful, effective communication strategies. Key Takeaways: Personalization is about creating customer experiences at scale. AI enhances personalization by analyzing customer data. The privacy factor in personalization must be managed carefully. 70% of consumers are comfortable with data use for value. Speed of learning is crucial for competitive advantage. Companies often have more data than they realize, but it's fragmented. AI can help integrate data from various sources effectively. Successful personalization can lead to increased customer satisfaction. Content should be bite-sized and easily digestible for consumers. Empowering customers with their data can enhance their experience.

It’s called ClassTag, and it’s a platform where teachers, parents and school administrators can communicate and send out announcements. No flyers, no ridiculously long emails… My favorite part is that she’s a Mixergy listener herself. She literally called a previous guest of mine and got him to invest before her business took off. Vlada Lotkina is the co-founder and CEO of ClassTag, an edtech platform that simplifies communication between teachers and parents. She grew up in Ukraine and watched as her father pursued entrepreneurship during the fall of the soviet union. As a mother in the U.S., her own frustrations with poor school-parent communication inspired her. She eventually exited ClassTag for 8-figures.

    "description": "Imagine you’re leading a small organization, but you’re struggling to recruit and afford the senior talent you need to grow. You could hire a part-time executive. So-called “fractional leadership” is common in startups and is spreading to other businesses and nonprofits. But while a fast-growing number of senior leaders seek this work arrangement, many companies are unsure of how to go about it. Tomoko Yokoi and Amy Bonsall are experts on the practice. Yokoi is a researcher at the TONOMUS Global Center for Digital and AI Transformation at IMD Business School. Bonsall is a former executive at IDEO and Old Navy who works as a part-time chief product officer with several organizations. They explain when and how fractional leadership works best—for the individual as well as the organization—and how to do it right. Yokoi and Bonsall wrote the HBR article “How Part-Time Senior Leaders Can Help Your Business.”",

    "description": "Scott and Missy Tannen knew nothing about bed linens when they dreamed up the idea of launching a bedding company, but that didn’t stop them from setting ambitious goals: super soft sheets, 100% organic cotton, and a supply chain that was traceable from end to end. Thanks to an article in the Wall Street Journal and a $2 million advertising bet on The Howard Stern Show, Boll \u0026 Branch grew rapidly, but also faced crippling cash crunches, forcing the Tannens to scramble for loans and borrow against their own home. Today, Boll \u0026 Branch is one of the most popular luxury linen brands in the U.S., with over $200 million in revenue. This episode was researched and produced by Katherine Sypher, with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
