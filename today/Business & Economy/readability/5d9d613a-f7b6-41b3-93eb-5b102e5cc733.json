The shares were sold at a price of $67 each, amounting to a total transaction value of $1,005,000. This sale was executed under a pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which Campbell adopted on June 21, 2024.

In other recent news, Janux Therapeutics has been the subject of numerous analyst upgrades following encouraging clinical data from its '007 candidate. Jones Trading raised Janux Therapeutics target to $105, while Stifel increased its price target to $115.00, maintaining a Buy rating. William Blair reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its peak sales estimate for the '007 candidate to $3.0 billion. Leerink Partners and H.C. Wainwright also raised their price targets to $91 and $70 respectively. The '007 candidate's clinical performance indicates a clear path forward in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with the potential to generate multiple billions in revenue. These recent developments suggest that '007 could become the preferred non-androgen therapy for mCRPC. The ongoing Phase Ia dose escalation study of '007 is proceeding alongside the initiation of the Phase Ib expansion, which will include second and third-line treatment settings. The company is expected to provide further updates on '007, as well as on '008, in 2025. The analysts' optimism is based on the candidate's strong clinical performance and the potential of '007 to meet a significant unmet medical need in the oncology market.
