  "description": "Bonnie Harvey and Michael Houlihan started Barefoot Wine with $300,000 in debt and almost no knowledge of wine. What they did understand was how to sell it—with a carefree name and label that evoked the beach, and a consistent flavor and low price point that attracted shoppers who normally rejected wine as being too snooty. But winning over that audience took extreme patience, and years of pavement-pounding by Michael. In 2005—twenty years after launch—Barefoot had become ubiquitous, and was acquired by E \u0026 J Gallo, one of the biggest wine brands in the world.  This episode was produced by J.C. Howard, with music by Ramtin ArabloueiEdited by Neva Grant, with research help from Olivia Rockeman.You can follow HIBT on Twitter \u0026 Instagram, and email us at hibt@id.wondery.com.See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
