  "text": "Buying a stock is easy, but buying the right stock without a time-tested strategy is incredibly hard. So what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist? Heico (HEI), Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Tradeweb Markets (TW), GE Aerospace (GE) and Brown \u0026 Brown (BRO) are prime candidates. The market confounded expectations for difficulties and turned in an outstanding performance in 2023 and 2024. Donald Trump's election victory initially boosted stocks, but gains have faded as traders weigh the pros and cons of his plans, such as levying tariffs, as we move deeper into 2025. The Federal Reserve is also seeing fewer interest rate cuts ahead amid ongoing labor market strength and stubbornly high inflation. ↑ X NOW PLAYING Market Still Vulnerable As Rally Attempt Continues; Take-Two, Life Time, Okta In Focus Best Stocks To Buy: The Crucial Ingredients Remember, there are thousands of stocks trading on the NYSE and Nasdaq. But you want to find the very best stocks right now to generate massive gains. The IBD Methodology offers clear guidelines on what you should be looking for. Invest in stocks with recent quarterly and annual earnings growth of at least 25%. Look for companies that have new, game-changing products and services. Also consider not-yet-profitable companies, often recent IPOs, that are generating tremendous revenue growth. Using such an approach can help give you an edge over the benchmark S\u0026P 500. Outdoing this industry benchmark is key to generating exceptional returns over the long term. In addition, keep an eye on supply and demand for the stock itself, focus on leading stocks in top industry groups, and aim for stocks with strong institutional support. Once you have found a stock that fits the criteria, it is then time to turn to stock charts to plot a good entry point. You should wait for a stock to form a base and then buy it once it reaches a buy point, ideally in heavy volume. In many cases, a stock reaches a proper buy point when it breaks above the original high on the left side of the base. More information on what a base is, and how charts can be used to win big on the stock market, can be found here. Don't Forget The Stock Market Direction When Buying Stocks A key part of investing is to keep track of the market. Most stocks, even the very best, follow the market direction. Invest when the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend and move to cash when the stock market goes into a correction. The stock market turned in stunning gains in 2023 and 2024. The major indexes surged to record highs in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential victory, but tariff worries and a more cautious outlook from the Fed on interest rates are now weighing on stocks. The stock market is well off recent highs and remains under considerable pressure. The S\u0026P 500 has fallen below its 50-day moving average and 200-day line while the Nasdaq composite has undercut its 200-day moving average, a bearish look indeed. Recent negative action means investors should be on their guard. Buying even high-quality issues with good growth prospects is risky. Taking smaller pilot positions is an option, though building a robust watchlist may be the wisest approach for now. The selections below are among the best stocks to buy or watch now. The IBD 50 is also a rich hunting ground. In addition, it is now especially crucial to stay on top of sell signals. Any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price should be jettisoned. Also beware of sharp breaks below the 50-day or 10-week moving average. Things can change quickly when it comes to the stock market. Make sure to keep a close eye on the market trend page here.
