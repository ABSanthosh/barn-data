That was proved successful as the short put options expired worthless on Friday. Today, it's possible to make a similar one-month 3.0% yield shorting OTM puts.

UBER closed at $90.59 on Friday, and I had recommended shorting the $80.00 strike price puts expiring July 18 (\"How to Make a 2.0% Yield with UBER Over the Next Month\"). I showed that UBER was worth at least $95.59. This article will update that price target. UBER - last 6 months - Barchart - July 18, 2025 The short put play strike was 4.7% below the trading price at the time. The premium received was $1.66; hence, the 2.0% yield (i.e., $ 1.66/$80.00 = 0.02075). Today, it's possible to make almost a 3% yield at a strike price with a similar distance below the trading price. More on that below. First, let's look at why UBER looks cheap here. FCF-Based Target. My previous price target was based on UBER Technologies' free cash flow (FCF) margins. For example, in Q1, it made $2.25 billion FCF on $11.533 billion in revenue, or a 19.5% FCF margin. That was higher than the Q4 FCF margin of 14.27%, 18.85% in Q3 2024, and 16.08% in Q2. Stock Analysis shows that over the trailing 12 months (TTM), it generated $7.786 billion FCF on $45.38 billion in revenue, or an FCF margin was 17.16%. That was higher than the prior quarter's TTM FCF margin of 15.68%. So, on balance, it seems reasonable to assume that going forward, UBER could make at least an 18.5% FCF margin. Using analysts' next 12-month (NTM) revenue forecasts, UBER could make at least $10 billion in FCF: 0.185 x $54.36 billion NTM revenue = $10.06 billion NTM FCF Using a 4.5% FCF yield metric (i.e., 22.2x FCF) (its TTM FCF yield is 4.1%), here is how that values UBER stock: $10.06b / 0.045 = $223.6 billion market value That is +18% over Friday's market cap of $189.439 billion. In other words, UBER stock is worth +18.0% more at about $107 per share: 1.18 x $90.59 = $106.90 per share P/E Based Target. Historically, UBER stock has traded at 35.4x forward earnings, according to Morningstar's last 3 years' data (i.e., 55.5x 2023, 18.5x 2024, 32.3x current). In addition, analysts now project 2025 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.86 this year and $3.29 in 2026, or $3.08 over the next 12 months (NTM). Therefore, we can estimate its value:",
