  "text": "The Indian stock market has declined over 14% from its 2024 highs, with small and midcaps hit hardest. Investors like Anshul Saigal see this correction as a buying opportunity, drawing inspiration from Warren Buffett’s philosophy of investing amid fear.Despite the turmoil, seasoned investors like Anshul Saigal, Founder of Saigal Capital in an interview with ETNow, see this as a golden opportunity rather than a cause for concern.Saigal draws inspiration from Warren Buffett, who often emphasizes that “you pay a very heavy price for a cheery consensus.” Buffett’s philosophy suggests that when markets are euphoric, valuations are high, and opportunities are scarce. On the other hand, when uncertainty prevails, prices fall, creating value opportunities for discerning investors.Using an everyday analogy, Saigal compares investing to shopping. \"If you walk into a store looking for a shirt, you’d be happy to see a discount. But when stock prices fall, investors panic instead of celebrating.\" This paradox highlights the emotional bias that often leads retail investors to buy at the peak and sell at the bottom—the exact opposite of what Buffett recommends.Six months ago, with markets at record highs, Saigal struggled to find attractive investment opportunities. However, after the recent market correction, small and midcaps are now trading at just a 10% premium to their historical valuations, making them far more appealing. This aligns with Buffett’s approach of buying great businesses at fair prices rather than chasing momentum-driven rallies.\"Valuations for the Nifty index are already below its 10-year average for one-year forward earnings. In the case of mid-caps and small-caps, they are now trading at just a 10% premium to their historical valuations,\" Shridatta Bhandwaldar, Head Equities at Canara Robeco Mutual Fund, said.\"Typically, periods of fear and disappointment in the market present opportunities to acquire quality assets at reasonable valuations. We believe we are nearing this zone, and we suggest looking at the market with an 18 to 24-month perspective,\" added Bhandwaldar.For investors willing to adopt a long-term, value-driven mindset, market downturns should be seen as opportunities, not threats. As Buffett famously puts it, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Following this principle could help investors build wealth over time, rather than reacting emotionally to market volatility.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.
