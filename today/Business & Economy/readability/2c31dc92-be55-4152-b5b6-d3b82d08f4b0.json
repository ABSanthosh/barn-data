The key is sticking to a consistent plan and making regular contributions to a retirement account, allowing the power of compounding to work its magic over time. Nevertheless, there's an undeniable allure in searching for potential multibagger stocks. Something is captivating about companies with disruptive innovations, whose stocks could be on the cusp of rapid growth and capable of delivering life-changing returns to shareholders. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RXRX) is a clinical-stage biotech that may have that level of potential. The company harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) for drug discovery, promising to revolutionize medicine. Let's explore whether buying the stock could eventually help you become a millionaire. Recursion has rapidly established itself as a leader in the field of AI-enabled biotechnology. The company's BioHive-2 supercomputer, powered by Nvidia AI chips, is one of the world's most powerful accelerated computing systems. Through advanced machine learning techniques, BioHive-2 analyzes vast amounts of biological data to identify drug targets, including proteins and genes involved in disease. Recursion's operating system (OS) evaluates millions of compounds to identify potential drug candidates, while also predicting drug molecule properties and optimal patient populations to enhance drug design. These efforts allow accelerated research on treatments across a wide range of conditions, while reducing costs compared to traditional methods. A major development for Recursion this year was its merger with Exscientia, another biotech company focused on AI-based drug discovery. Exscientia's expertise in advanced methods of chemical design complements Recursion's biology-driven approach. This combination has created a vertically integrated platform, resulting in a fundamentally stronger company. Image source: Getty Images. The good news is that Recursion's technology has already yielded promising results, with a robust pipeline of drug candidates that now incorporates Exscientia's legacy programs. One of the most promising prospects is REC-994, which could become the first oral therapy for treating symptomatic cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), a brain hemorrhaging condition that currently lacks any approved treatments. REC-617 has also shown encouraging results, with a recent phase 1 interim study demonstrating positive patient responses and good tolerability in treating advanced solid tumors. The company believes this drug has \"best in class\" potential, one of several reasons that make Recursion an intriguing opportunity for investors.",
