After the US leader gave last-minute reprieves to Canada and Mexico, his 10% tariffs on China took effect on Tuesday. Beijing swiftly announced additional tariffs on roughly 80 products to take effect on Feb. 10, but traders are hoping upcoming talks will ease tensions.“There is a reasonable likelihood that the ultimate impact from these tariffs may be less than expected,” said Todd Ahlsten at Parnassus Investments. “These tariffs may also represent the first round of an ultimate negotiation, which could reduce their ultimate impact.”In Asia, Chinese traders are on tenterhooks ahead of Wednesday’s market reopen as the tariff drama shakes up the investment landscape. Volatility is set to stay high as investors brace for an escalation while also hedging against the odds of a sudden breakthrough. The offshore yuan recovered after a knee-jerk slide on Tuesday. Chinese stocks in Hong Kong have displayed resilience, while a gauge of US-listed Chinese companies rose 2.7%.“The uncertainty that was bothering the market about tariffs is now gone and we have clarity,” said Kenny Ng, a strategist at China Everbright Securities International. “This actually brings a clearer outlook for the market. I expect Chinese stocks to see a relatively strong open.”Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan is likely to keep raising its benchmark rate to a level exceeding the current market consensus, according to a former executive director at the central bank. The yen advanced to around 154 per greenback on Tuesday.In commodities, oil edged lower as concerns that the trade war would hurt global growth outweighed the announcement of reinforced sanctions on Iran.
