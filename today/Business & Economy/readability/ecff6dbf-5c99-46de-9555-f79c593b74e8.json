A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Technology Innovators focus on pioneering businesses worldwide that serve as key drivers or beneficiaries of significant long-term changes driven by technology. The fund returned -10.4% (net) in the first quarter compared to a 9.4% return for the benchmark, MSCI ACWI Info Tech and Communication Services Index. The choice of securities in the software sector was the primary factor negatively impacting relative performance. You can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to know more about its best picks for 2025. In its first-quarter 2025 investor letter, Sands Capital Technology Innovators Fund highlighted stocks such as Sea Limited (NYSE:SE). Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) engages in the digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial service businesses. The one-month return of Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) was 23.27%, and its shares gained 142.75% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On May 27, 2025, Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) stock closed at $165.24 per share with a market capitalization of $97.83 billion. Sands Capital Technology Innovators Fund stated the following regarding Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its Q1 2025 investor letter: \"Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is an internet business in Southeast Asia that operates leading platforms for video games, ecommerce, and digital financial services. The business reported its fifth consecutive beat-and-raise quarter, with Shopee (ecommerce) growing gross merchandise volume 24 percent year-over-year while delivering positive EBITDA margin. 2025 guidance points to inflections across all three business units—ecommerce, digital financial services, and gaming—each expected to generate approximately $1 billion in EBITDA. We raised our long-term estimates, including Shopee margin and valuation assumptions, and now expect combined EBITDA to triple by 2029. Improved investor communication has, in our view, helped dampen volatility around earnings announcements while attracting long-term institutional investors. Looking ahead, we believe the company is more in control of its destiny and entering a phase of meaningful earnings acceleration, and we have higher confidence in our long-term earnings estimates.\" Is Sea Limited (SE) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds? A person livestreaming their gameplay on a mobile device with integrated payment options. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 84 hedge fund portfolios held Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) at the end of the first quarter compared to 86 in the previous quarter. Sea Limited's (NYSE:SE) total revenue increased 30% year-on-year to $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
