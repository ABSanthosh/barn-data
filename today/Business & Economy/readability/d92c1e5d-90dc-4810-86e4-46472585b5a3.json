But the augmented reality and virtual reality features that these devices enable can have an impact beyond video games. Pioneering companies are using these immersive tools to train employees and to engage with consumers in digital and retail settings. It’s growing increasingly important for senior leaders to explore the possible use cases and to understand the potential benefits and ongoing challenges that accompany these technologies. Tech at Work is a four-part special series from HBR IdeaCast. Join senior tech editors Juan Martinez and Tom Stackpole for research, stories, and advice to make technology work for you and your team. In this episode, researcher Srinivas Reddy and AR/VR entrepreneur and educator Dinesh Punni discuss how augmented reality can affect consumers’ brand awareness and purchasing behavior. The experts share business results from in-market research, identify challenges for the technology as it evolves, and explain how to launch a spatial computing experiment at your organization. Reddy is a visiting professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and professor emeritus of marketing at Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University. Punni is the CEO and founder of a Berlin, Germany-based company, immersive insiders, that trains AR/VR developers and designers. This is the final episode of the Tech at Work series.
