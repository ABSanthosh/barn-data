In his address to the US Congress, President Donald Trump said that reciprocal tariffs will take effect from April 2 on countries like India, South Korea, the EU, China and others. IANSThe NSE Nifty gained 1.15%, or 254 points, to finish at 22,337. The BSE Sensex rose 1.01%, or 740 points, to close at 73,730.Mumbai: India's equity indices rose over 1% on Wednesday, snapping their 10-day losing streak, as traders cut some of their bearish bets in an oversold market after early indications that the US may soften its stance on trade tariffs. The NSE Nifty gained 1.15%, or 254 points, to finish at 22,337. The BSE Sensex rose 1.01%, or 740 points, to close at 73,730.AgenciesThe 25% tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico took effect Tuesday along with fresh levies on Chinese imports. In his address to the US Congress, President Donald Trump said that reciprocal tariffs will take effect from April 2 on countries like India, South Korea, the EU, China and others. China and Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on the US, and Mexico promised retaliation as well. In response, Wall Street indices dropped 1-2% Tuesday. The US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's comment that Trump could scale back some of the tariffs alleviated nervous sentiment in Asia. \"After Trump announced a slew of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the US Commerce Secretary has suggested that a possible compromise on tariffs is expected which implies that there could be lower tariffs than proposed,\" said Pankaj Pandey, head of retail research at ICICI Securities. \"A technical bounce was imminent as the markets were extremely oversold, but it is early to say if the anxiety over tariffs is over since the US and China are imposing tariffs on each other, and the fallout from this trade war can have adverse consequences on overall global growth and inflation.\" Elsewhere in Asia, China advanced 0.53% while Hong Kong and Indonesia gained around 2.5% each. Taiwan moved 1.22% higher and South Korea rose 1.15%.At home, the Nifty Metals Index surged the most - gaining 4.04% while the Media Index gained 3%. The realty, oil \u0026 gas, information technology (IT) and auto indices climbed over 2% each. Bank Nifty rose 0.51% while PSU Bank index soared 3%.The Volatility Index, or VIX — the market’s fear gauge — fell 1.15% to 13.67 on Wednesday, suggesting traders see lower risks in the near-term. “The relative strength index set up was pointing towards an oversold set up post the recent corrections which has led to the pullback move today,” said Ruchit Jain,Vice President- Head Technical Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “The dollar index cooled off which is also supportive for emerging market economies.” Jain said that, since October, the market has been on a downward trend on account of the strength in the US dollar. A pause in this rally sparked some relief, he said. The US dollar index fell 0.6% to 104.9, a three-month low while the rupee recorded the highest single day gain since Feb 11 as it closed at 86.95 on Wednesday. The broader markets led the upsides, with the Nifty Mid-cap 150 index and the Small-cap 250 index jumping 2.4% and 2.7% respectively. Out of the 4101 shares traded on the BSE, 3220 advanced, while 806 declined. “The broader market has witnessed greater wrath of the sell off in the past couple of months and a short covering in the segment triggered an upmove in these stocks as there was a buildup of significant short positions in the segment,” said Jain. Pandey said that the broader market had declined more than the benchmark and bounced back more than the benchmark in a similar manner. In the past one month, the midcap and small-cap indices plunged 8.78% and 11.26% respectively while benchmark indices fell 5.74% each in the same period. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth a net Rs 2,895.04 crore on Wednesday. Their domestic counterparts bought shares worth Rs 3,370.60 crore. “While today’s move was largely a bounce due to oversold levels, Nifty is expected to move towards its 20-day exponential moving average of 22,700 levels- as further pullback moves similar to today are likely,” said Jain. “Once this level is crossed there could be further upside.”Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
