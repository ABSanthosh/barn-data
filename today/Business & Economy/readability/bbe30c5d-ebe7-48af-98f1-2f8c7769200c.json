  "text": "By Nandita Bose and Ismail Shakil WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump's late-night firing of inspectors general at multiple government agencies was criticized as illegal on Saturday by Democrats and others and drew concern from at least one fellow Republican. In what critics called a late-night purge, Trump fired 17 independent watchdogs on Friday, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a move that clears the way to replace independent watchdogs with loyalists. U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, a longtime Democratic antagonist of Trump, said the action was a clear violation of the law. \"Trump wants no accountability for malfeasance in office,\" Schiff said in a post on platform X. \"He is refilling the swamp.\" The inspectors general at agencies including the departments of State, Defense and Transportation were notified by emails from the White House personnel director that they had been terminated immediately, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The dismissals, handed out less than a week after Trump took office for his second term, appeared to violate federal law, the independent Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency said in a letter to the White House on Friday. The law requires a president to give Congress \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case specific reasons\" for the dismissals 30 days in advance, the council said in the letter to Sergio Gor, White House personnel director. Gor's Friday email to the fired inspectors cited \"changing priorities\" as a reason for the firings, according to the letter, reported by Politico. \"At this point, we do not believe the actions taken are legally sufficient to dismiss Presidentially Appointed, Senate Confirmed Inspectors General,\" said Council Chair Hannibal Ware, suggesting Gor consult with the White House counsel. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Michael Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, said the firings were \"plainly illegal.\" An inspector general is an independent position that conducts audits and investigations into allegations of waste, fraud and abuse of power. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a longtime supporter of inspectors general, said he wanted to know why Trump fired the watchdogs. \"There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so. I'd like further explanation from President Trump,\" Grassley said in a statement, adding that a detailed 30-day notice of removal was not provided to Congress. Fellow Republican Senator John Barrasso said he believes Trump will make wise decisions on the inspectors general. \"Some of them deserve to be fired,\" he told Fox News. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the firings \"a chilling purge\" and a preview of a \"lawless approach\" by the Trump administration. Agencies are pressing ahead with orders from Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, to reshape the federal bureaucracy by scrapping diversity programs, rescinding job offers and sidelining more than 150 national security and foreign policy officials. Friday's dismissals spared the Department of Justice inspector general, Michael Horowitz, according to the New York Times (NYSE:). The Washington Post, which was first to report the dismissals, said most were appointees from Trump's 2017-2021 first term. A source familiar with the issue who spoke on condition of anonymity said among the inspectors general whom Trump has fired is John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. He was terminated on Friday evening even though his operation is due to close in September, said the source. Many politically appointed leaders of agencies and departments come and go with each administration, but an inspector general can serve under multiple presidents. During his first term, Trump fired five inspectors general in a two-month period in 2020. This included the State Department inspector general, who had played a role in the president's impeachment proceedings. Last year, Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, fired the inspector general of the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board, after an investigation found the official had created a hostile work environment. In 2022, Congress strengthened protections for inspectors general, making it harder to replace them with hand-picked officials and requiring additional explanations from a president for their removal.",
