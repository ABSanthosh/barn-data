[02:02] What kind of business and what kind of challenges are they facing that you think makes an ideal fit for a fractional strategic marketing hire? [03:34] If somebody hires a CMO, do they feel like they’re also hiring an implement mentor, or are they strictly separate functions? [04:57] Are there ever some turf wars, even though you’re brought in to help them orchestrate better? [06:25] Besides the cost component, what other things might you suggest about the fractional CMO model being a good idea for businesses? [09:52] Are you finding much more recognition of the concept and the term, particularly for midsize business owners? [11:04] What hard lessons have you learned as a Fractional CMO?
