Amazon will host this season’s sole Friday night game, a perfect respite for people who just can’t handle holiday shopping for another minute. (Ironic, isn’t it?) And this year’s match will likely get some attention. The Raiders? Well, this hasn’t been their year. But any game with the Chiefs draws a crowd—and an especially diverse fan base. Here’s how to watch this Black Friday faceoff.   Which NFL teams are playing on Black Friday? Haters are gonna hate, but that’s unlikely to slow either team down. Friday, Nov. 29 Las Vegas Raiders vs Kansas City Chiefs, 3:00 p.m. ET on Amazon Can I watch NFL games for free on broadcast television? Not on Black Friday.
