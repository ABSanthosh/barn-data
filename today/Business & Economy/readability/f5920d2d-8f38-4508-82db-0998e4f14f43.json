It's a matter of life and death now,\" he added.  Indian tax authorities have asked the company to pay taxes dating back to 12 years, reigniting concerns of lengthy investigations and litigation that could sour the plans of foreign firms to invest in the fastest-growing major economy. Also Read Indian authorities alleged Skoda Auto Volkswagen India imported almost entire cars in an unassembled condition - which attracts a 30-35 per cent tax - but evaded the levies by mis-classifying them as \"individual parts\" coming in separate shipments, paying just a 5-15 per cent levy.  The unit went to court last month, arguing the tax demand will hamper its business plans and is detrimental to the foreign investment climate.  Volkswagen is a tiny player in India's car market, the world's third biggest, where its Audi brand lags competitors in the luxury segment like Mercedes-Benz, and BMW .  The court will continue hearing the case on Thursday.     (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
