The company announced on Thursday a definitive agreement to purchase the sneaker chain for $24 per share, or $2.4 billion, a sizable premium compared to Foot Locker's closing price of $12.87 on Wednesday. \"With macro trends like the growing convergence of sport and culture ... we believe the long-term industry tailwinds remain strong and that this expanded platform is well positioned for long-term growth,\" CEO Lauren Hobart told investors on a call. While some say this could bring in new customers, strengthen Dick's partnership with major brands like Nike (NKE), and give the company an international presence, others on Wall Street aren't as wide-eyed. \"The proposed transaction would mean acquiring a structurally challenged, mall-based retailer with 2,410 small-format stores worldwide ... a heavy dependence on one brand [Nike] ... and a weak operating margin of 2.5% in 2024 that would be dilutive to Dick's 11.0% in 2024,\" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note clients. Foot Locker posted a same-store sales decline of 2.6% in preliminary first quarter results, versus Dick's 4.5% growth. It has struggled with sales growth in recent years and has been partially banking its turnaround on a renewed relationship with Nike. Roughly 60% of Foot Locker purchases are from Nike. Trying to revive Foot Locker could become a distraction for Dick's Sporting Goods. Sam Poser of Williams Trading told Yahoo Finance if Dick's management takes \"30% of their time to focus on getting Foot Locker up to snuff. That's 30% of the time that they're not spending on the mothership ... which then theoretically would hurt Dick's business.\" Foot Locker's stock surged over 80% on Thursday, while Dick's Sporting Goods sank 15% as investors stewed over the financial risks. \"The industry is dealing with ongoing shifts toward direct-to-consumer distribution,\" Felman added, \"and Foot Locker has been experiencing soft demand since 2018, except for the Covid year in 2021 ... Dick's is already positioned to perform strongly with its current form and strategic initiatives.\" Retailers have been struggling in 2025 with sinking consumer sentiments and Trump's tariff war with key manufacturing countries like China and Vietnam. Foot Locker's stock was down more than 40% year to date prior to the announcement. Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet",
