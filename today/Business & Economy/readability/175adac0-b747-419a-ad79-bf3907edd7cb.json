  "description": "Are you the sort of person who works really hard, hits your deadlines, runs successful projects, wins over clients... but never seems to get noticed for all that diligence, much less promoted? Especially if you’re on the quieter and more understated side, working in an organization where the loud and showy get the most recognition, this can be frustrating. But there are ways to get noticed while also staying true to yourself, says Jessica Chen. She's a former TV news reporter and the founder of Soulcast Media, a communications consultancy, and she shares lessons about more effective communication and self-promotion. Chen wrote the book Smart, Not Loud: How to Get Noticed at Work for All the Right Reasons.",
