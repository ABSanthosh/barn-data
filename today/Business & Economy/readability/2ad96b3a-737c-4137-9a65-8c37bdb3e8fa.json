The expected benefits of Aneel fuel include the utilisation of thorium as a fuel in existing PHWR reactors, significant reduction in nuclear waste, enhancing India’s energy security using domestically-available thorium, and improved safety and proliferation resistance, the company said. It added that Aneel fuel offers cost savings by delivering greater energy output within existing safety margins and lowering the operating costs of current reactors. NTPC and CCTE intend to collaborate for exploring development and deployment of Aneel fuel in India, NTPC said in a statement.More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
