  "text": "In This Article: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the AI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely.  On July 16, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan raised the price target on the stock to $260.00 (from $240.00) while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. The firm increased its FY26E EBIT estimates by 9% and reiterated its Overweight / Top pick rating. Earnings Preview: “Amazon is likely to report 2Q25E results with revenues near the midpoint, but EBIT should come in ahead of prior guidance. US non-store retail sales were up +7% y/y in 2Q, a slight acceleration vs. 1Q – indicating favorable trends for AMZN’s NA retail growth. Meanwhile, AWS growth should come near +17% y/y in 2Q25E. The key focus will be on 3Q25E outlook. We expect revenue guide to bracket $175B and EBIT (at high-end) near $19B. While there are lingering uncertainties on trade, AMZN CEO recently noted that prices on the platform have remained relatively stable – which bodes well for 3Q25E EBIT guide. Additionally, we think AMZN has plenty of room to improve efficiency across various layers of its logistics network. AMZN shares have lagged the broader Mag-7 (ex-TSLA) group YTD, and sentiment appears mixed into the print. We like the risk/reward at current levels. Cantor Fitzgerald Stays Bullish on Amazon (AMZN), Lifts Target to $260 on Retail and AWS Growth We have increased our FY26E EBIT estimates by 9% and reiterate our Overweight / Top pick rating. Our revised PT of $260 is based on 30x FY26E EBIT (vs. $240 previously).” Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
