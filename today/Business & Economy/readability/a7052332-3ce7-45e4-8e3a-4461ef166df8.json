  "text": "Elon Musk is no stranger to headlines, but his latest offer of free Starlink internet to Hurricane Helene victims has left many raising questions. While SpaceX initially announced it would waive the $120 monthly subscription fee for the first month in affected areas, there's a significant caveat – victims still need to buy Starlink hardware, which costs between $300 and $400, including taxes and shipping. This added cost feels like a slap for people already dealing with the hurricane’s devastation. Don't Miss: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? I’m 62 Years Old And Have $1.2 Million Saved. Is This Enough to Retire Stress-Free? The reaction on the ground has been a mix of gratitude and frustration. Reports from The Register highlighted the experience of a North Carolina resident, Kinney Baughman, who described the offer as a \"bait and switch.\" Beyond the cost, there's the issue of timing. Even if someone can scrape together the money for the hardware, delivery can take two to three weeks. By then, regular internet may already be back up and running, leaving many wondering if the purchase was necessary. After all, spending $400 on equipment that arrives after you've resolved your connectivity issues feels like pouring salt on the wound. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. Then there's the power problem. Many areas hit hardest by the hurricane are still without electricity, rendering a satellite dish useless until power is restored. It's not just the money – the logistics of it all seem off. Critics quickly point out that Elon Musk, whose fortune is estimated at $260 billion according to Bloomberg, could have offered a more immediate, practical solution. Instead, as some have argued, this offer looks suspiciously like a marketing move disguised as charity. See Also: How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy. And the controversy doesn't stop there. Musk has recently faced criticism for political donations that have raised eyebrows. Reports show that he's contributed tens of millions of dollars to far-right causes, including America First Legal, a group associated with former Trump advisor Stephen Miller. Still, for some, the Starlink service is a game-changer. Satellite internet could be a lifeline in remote areas where infrastructure recovery is slow. It's easy to see the appeal – connecting with emergency services, contacting family or getting reliable updates could be worth the upfront cost, even if it stings a little.",
