  "text": "In This Article: Hinge Health (HNGE), a digital health platform for physical therapy, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange at $32 per share Thursday and rising 20% shortly after trading to $39. The company announced it would go public in March, marking the second time it would attempt to do so. It was valued at nearly $6.2 billion in 2022 when it first announced plans. The IPO comes amid uncertainty about the health of the overall stock market and after a years-long dry spell for healthcare IPOs. Hinge Health CEO Daniel Perez told Yahoo Finance that a dozen digital health CEOs called him prior to Thursday to wish him well, say congratulations, \"and don't screw it up.\" \"We are not as worried (about) where the stock price ends today,\" Perez added. \"Our vision is to use technology to automate the delivery of care. And that's going to take 10, 20, 30-plus years to continue to realize that vision.\" The industry peaked in the pandemic years, specifically in 2021, as demand for remote-based care options rose. That year, more than a dozen companies went public directly or through special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC). Since 2021, it has been quiet as many of the public companies lost their value, since remote services became less relevant. But Hinge is testing the waters, and investors are watching closely for signs of a revival of the industry. Hinge aimed for a $3 billion valuation on Thursday, offering 13.7 million shares on the market. Its initial public offering (IPO) is on the higher end of the range it provided, between $28 to $32 per share, to raise about $500 million. When asked if he regretted not going public when his valuation was double the Thursday target, Perez said, \"absolutely not.\" The company has in the interim been able to build a stronger foundation and become cash positive. \"We had a great valuation then, but since that moment we have quintupled our revenue, we've doubled our gross profit...we swung from losing $100 million a year back then, to being free cash flow positive for four straight quarters. Very happy to go public at this point,\" Perez said. NYSE - Delayed Quote USD (HNGE) At close: May 23 at 4:00:02 PM EDT Hinge launched a decade ago in its current form, transforming from its predecessor, UK-based Marblar Limited, which was a digital technology platform for scientists. Now it is a remote physical therapy platform, with an FDA-approved wearable to pair with services. It has been growing with the support of investors, including Tiger Global and Coatue Management. The company now boasts almost half of Fortune 500 companies as clients — including Target (TGT), GM (GM), and Hyatt (H) — offering their employees zero-cost access to the platform. This, the company said in its S-1 filing, can save companies about $2,387 per member per year on average, compared to the cost of absences and costly surgeries or other interventions.",
