  "text": "Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon speaks at the Computex forum in Taipei, Taiwan, June 3, 2024.Ann Wang | ReutersQualcomm reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations for earnings and revenue, and the company guided to a strong December quarter.The shares rose 10% in extended trading at one point before falling to a gain of about 4%. Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus expectations for the quarter ending Sept. 29:Earnings per share: $2.69, adjusted $2.56 expectedRevenue: $10.24 billion versus $9.90 billion expectedQualcomm said it expects revenue in the current quarter of between $10.5 billion and $11.3 billion, with the midpoint of that range beating LSEG consensus expectations of $10.59 billion.The company reported $2.92 billion in net income, or $2.59 per share, a sharp jump from last year's $1.49 billion, or $1.23 per share. Qualcomm reported $33.19 billion in total revenue in its fiscal 2024, a 9% increase from 2023.Qualcomm's fortunes have historically been tied to the smartphone industry, where the company provides a range of chips to handset makers, including system-on-a-chip processors, modems, and antennas. The company makes the chip at the heart of most high-end Android devices, and many lower-end phones as well. Qualcomm also sells modems and related chips to Apple for its iPhones, and last year said its contract for 5G chips ran through 2026.Qualcomm reported a 12% increase in handset chip sales to $6.1 billion, in line with FactSet estimates. Qualcomm introduced its high-end chip for 2025, called Snapdragon 8 Elite, in October.\"In handsets we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues,\" said Qualcomm CFO Akash Palkhiwala on a call with analysts. Under CEO Cristiano Amon, the company has diversified away from being a smartphone supplier and has introduced and invested heavily in producing chips for PCs, cars, and industrial machines.\"We will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI,\" Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on the earnings call with analysts. Qualcomm has also made efforts to brand itself as a leader in AI, having developed smartphone chips with specialized parts for machine learning since 2017. But unlike Nvidia, the company doesn't produce the kind of graphics processors for data centers that are used for big AI programs like OpenAI's ChatGPT.The automotive business grew 86% on an annual basis to $899 million in sales. Qualcomm says it has billions of dollars in business with automakers currently in its development pipeline, and highlighted it was the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Qualcomm said that it expected automotive sales in the current quarter to rise 50% on an annual basis. The company's \"internet of things\" business includes both chips for industrial purposes as well as the chips Meta uses in its Quest handsets and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. It also includes the new business selling chips for laptops running Microsoft Windows. The division reported $1.68 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from a year earlier.Qualcomm's chip business, including its handset, automotive, and other chips, which together is reported as QCT, saw sales rise 18% during the quarter to $7.37 billion in total. The company's profitable technology licensing business, QTL, reported $1.52 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the same period last year.Qualcomm said its board had approved $15 billion in additional buybacks. During the fourth quarter, it repurchased $1.3 billion worth of shares and paid out $947 million in dividends.WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon",
