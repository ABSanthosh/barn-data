Vienna Embraces Heat Pumps to Ditch Russian Gas Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Bank of America Corp. and Wrightson ICAP LLC are among firms that say the Treasury could hold less money in its account at the Fed as its cash balance — a buffer of funds to ensure the US can always pay its bills — dwindles. This would allow the government to sell less short-term debt and potentially save the taxpayers money now that the debt ceiling has been reinstated and the cash pile is shrinking. The balance is expected to keep falling until the debt limit is lifted or suspended again. The breakdown in the composition of the Treasury’s debt load between bills and coupon-bearing securities — which has remained steady for the past several quarters — was a focal point during President Donald Trump’s election campaign, with many prominent voices criticizing former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for issuing too many T-bills. “The new team at Treasury is likely to reconsider the large precautionary cash reserve policies of recent years,” Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall said in an interview Friday. “I don’t think the US would be running any serious operational risks if they did bring their cash balance down to past norms, and such an action could also delay Treasury from having to make any adjustment to coupon-bearing debt auction sizes if they did want to scale back their bill issuance.” Scott Bessent, now awaiting confirmation to head the department, was among those who argued that the decision to rely on short-dated debt to fund the deficit juiced the economy by sending long-term rates lower — a charge the Yellen Treasury rejected. The possibility of a Bessent-led Treasury signaling the intention to reduce the target for its cash balance could come as early as next month when US debt managers meet for their quarterly debt refunding, according Bank of America strategists Mark Cabana and Katie Craig. The cash balance in the Treasury General Account held at the Fed stood at $665 billion as of Jan. 22, according to Treasury data published Thursday. That’s down from an April peak at $962 billion and below last year’s average of about $748 billion, the data show.",
