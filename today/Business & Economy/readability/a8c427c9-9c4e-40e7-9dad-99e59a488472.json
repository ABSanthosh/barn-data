Since then, it’s become a daily staple and one of the few supplements I travel with. I’ve always been highly skeptical of most probiotics due to the lack of science and the fact that many do not survive digestion. But after incorporating two capsules of Seed’s DS-01 into my morning routine, I have noticed improved digestion, skin tone, and overall health.  Why is it so effective? For one, it’s a 2-in-1 probiotic and prebiotic formulated with 24 clinically and scientifically studied strains that have systemic benefits in and beyond the gut. And now, you can get 25% off your first month of DS-01 with code 25TIM. This episode is brought to you by Helix Sleep! Helix was selected as the best overall mattress of 2024 by Forbes, Fortune, and Wired magazines and many others.

Just take their quiz—only two minutes to complete—that matches your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress for you. They have a 10-year warranty, and you get to try it out for a hundred nights, risk-free. They’ll even pick it up from you if you don’t love it. And now, Helix is offering 20% off all mattress orders at HelixSleep.com/Tim. This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront!

BRUCE GREYSON QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “If you study things that we pretty much understand already, you can make little inroads here and there about fine points. If you really want to make some impact, you need to study things we don’t understand at all.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “I started out as a materialist skeptic. After 50 years, I’m still skeptical, but I’m no longer a materialist. I think that’s a dead end when it comes to explaining near-death experiences and other phenomena like this.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “I’m not a philosopher. I’m an empiricist. And when people say to me, as many do, ‘If you have this non-physical mind, how does it interact with a physical brain?’ And I have no idea. On the other hand, if you take a materialistic perspective and say, ‘How does the brain, the chemical and electrical changes in the brain, create an abstract thought?,’ we have no idea about that either.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “Whether you’re an empiricist, a materialist, or not, we can’t explain how thoughts arise and how they get processed to us. What we do know is that all our experiences are filtered to us through the brain.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “I was taught in college and medical school that the mind is what the brain does and all our thoughts and feelings and perceptions are all created by the brain. And I cannot believe that anymore. I’ve seen people whose brains were either offline or severely impaired telling me they had the most elaborate experience they’ve ever had. So I’m inclined to think that the mind is something else and the brain filters it.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “About five percent of the general population—or one to every 20 people—has had a near-death experience. Secondly, they are not associated in any way with mental illness. People who are perfectly normal have these NDEs in abnormal situations that can happen to anybody.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “The more I learned about [NDEs], the harder they seemed to understand. So I’ve gotten more comfortable with not knowing all the answers.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “Right now, people are listening to us and there’s electrical activity in parts of their brain that process hearing. It always happens when they’re hearing us. This part of the brain always lights up. That doesn’t mean that electrical activity is causing our voices; it’s just a reflection of it. So when you find these physiological concomitants of a near-death experience, you’re finding perhaps the mechanism for it, but not the cause of it.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “Most people who study near-death experiences, whether they’re spiritualists or materialists or neuropsychologist or philosophers, they agree on the phenomena, they don’t agree on the interpretation of it, of what’s causing it and what its ultimate meaning is.”— Dr. Bruce Greyson “Many near-death experiencers have tried drugs afterwards to try to replicate the experience, and they universally tell me it is not the same thing. One person told me, ‘When I was on psilocybin, I saw Heaven. When I was in my near-death experience, I was in Heaven.'”— Dr. Bruce Greyson The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.

I’m an empiricist. And when people say to me, as many do, ‘If you have this non-physical mind, how does it interact with a physical brain?’ And I have no idea. On the other hand, if you take a materialistic perspective and say, ‘How does the brain, the chemical and electrical changes in the brain, create an abstract thought?,’ we have no idea about that either.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e— Dr. Bruce Greyson\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Whether you’re an empiricist, a materialist, or not, we can’t explain how thoughts arise and how they get processed to us.

And I cannot believe that anymore. I’ve seen people whose brains were either offline or severely impaired telling me they had the most elaborate experience they’ve ever had. So I’m inclined to think that the mind is something else and the brain filters it.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e— Dr. Bruce Greyson\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“About five percent of the general population—or one to every 20 people—has had a near-death experience.

It always happens when they’re hearing us. This part of the brain always lights up. That doesn’t mean that electrical activity is causing our voices; it’s just a reflection of it. So when you find these physiological concomitants of a near-death experience, you’re finding perhaps the mechanism for it, but not the cause of it.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e— Dr. Bruce Greyson\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Most people who study near-death experiences, whether they’re spiritualists or materialists or neuropsychologist or philosophers, they agree on the phenomena, they don’t agree on the interpretation of it, of what’s causing it and what its ultimate meaning is.”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e— Dr. Bruce Greyson\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e“Many near-death experiencers have tried drugs afterwards to try to replicate the experience, and they universally tell me it is not the same thing.
