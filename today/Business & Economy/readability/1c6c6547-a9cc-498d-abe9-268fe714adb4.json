Persistent Systems, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Infosys advanced over 1% each. Out of the 10 stocks in the IT Index, 8 advanced while 2 declined on Tuesday.Agencies\"The buying interest in IT is likely to be a technical bet given the slight improvement in growth, the current valuations are relatively attractive compared to sectors witnessing deteriorating growth,\" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.Mumbai: The Nifty IT Index hit an all-time high on Tuesday after brokerage HSBC said that it expects growth to rise to 6-7% in FY26 - from 3-4% in the past two years - led by a recovery in the US market.The IT index gained 0.8% and closed at record levels while the benchmark Nifty closed marginally lower. LTI Mindtree and Mphasis gained 3% and 2.4% respectively. Persistent Systems, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Infosys advanced over 1% each. Out of the 10 stocks in the IT Index, 8 advanced while 2 declined on Tuesday.\"The IT Index hitting an all-time high indicates that rerating is likely, and investor interest is coming back to the sector as its valuations offer comfort with a higher return on equity,\" said Anita Gandhi, Institutional Head, Arihant Capital Markets.Gandhi said that amid uncertainty due to a slowdown in demand and lower-than-estimated GDP, some investors are taking safer bets on IT stocks as they are dependent on the robust US economy.Analysts at HSBC said that 'improving growth should attract investor interest away from some other sectors, where the demand outlook is deteriorating but valuations are high.' The brokerage said that it is less constructive on mid-tier companies as valuations remain rich amid decelerating growth.The brokerage upgraded Infosys and LTI Mindtree to 'Buy' and Wipro to 'hold' while downgrading TCS and Tech Mahindra to 'Hold' and 'Reduce' respectively. The brokerage upgraded Mphasis to 'buy' while downgrading Coforge to 'Hold'. Infosys, LTI Mindtree, HCL, and MphasiS are its preferred picks.\"The buying interest in IT is likely to be a technical bet given the slight improvement in growth, the current valuations are relatively attractive compared to sectors witnessing deteriorating growth,\" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
