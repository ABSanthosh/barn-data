The pricing of these bonds is much higher than the 7% targeted by Adani Green in the issue that was pulled out ultimately on October 15. Bankers said the more expensive pricing reflects the rise in the benchmark US treasury yield since that date.On October 15, Adani Green called off its $1.2 billion bond issue after investors demanded higher yield from the company, citing geopolitical uncertainties, ET had reported in its October 16 edition.Mumbai: Adani Green Energy, India's largest private sector renewable power company, on Wednesday raised $600 million through a 20-year bond, sources close to the development told ET. This issue comes a month after the group postponed a $1.2-billion bond offering as some investors differed over pricing of the instruments. ET reported on Monday the company would be raising $600 million through a bond issuance.The company priced the bond at 7.45% and the proceeds of the issue will be used to refinance existing loan facilities of the company. The pricing of these bonds is much higher than the 7% targeted by Adani Green in the issue that was pulled out ultimately on October 15. Bankers said the more expensive pricing reflects the rise in the benchmark US treasury yield since that date.The 10-year US treasury yield has risen to around 4.42% from around 4% on October 15, which has been reflected in the Adani bonds.\"The total order book after the opening of the US market was more than $2.1 billion, which allowed the company to price this bond at 7.45%, tighter than the initial guidance of 7.75%. The learning from last time was that it is better to do smaller size issues than look for a large one. So unlike in October, when the company wanted to raise more than $1 billion, this time the company was always looking to raise $600 million,\" said a banking industry source.AgenciesUS-based private investment company Wellington Management Co, the world's largest asset manager Blackrock Inc, Pacific Life Insurance, PIMCO, AIA Group and Lombard Asset Finance of the UK were also among the other investors, people familiar with the issue said.The bond issuance covers three Rajasthan-based green energy subsidiaries - Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer One Limited, Adani Hybrid Energy Jaisalmer Two Limited, and Adani Solar Energy Jaisalmer One Private Limited.Adani Green officials did not comment. DBS Bank, MUFG Securities, State Bank of India , Emirates NBD, First Abu Dhabi, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Securities and SMBC Nikko Securities are the bankers to the issue.On October 15, Adani Green called off its $1.2 billion bond issue after investors demanded higher yield from the company, citing geopolitical uncertainties, ET had reported in its October 16 edition. The company was comfortable with a fixed coupon yield of 7% but investors sought a 10 to 20 basis points premium, which the company declined to give and chose to call off the issue.
