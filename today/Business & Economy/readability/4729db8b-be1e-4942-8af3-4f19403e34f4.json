  "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, July 19, 2024.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Thursday strongly suggested that Federal Reserve board members would have special protection against being fired by a president in a ruling that, for now, allows President Donald Trump to fire two members of other federal agencies' boards.The Supreme Court in its ruling said, \"We disagree\" with arguments by Gwynne Wilcox of the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from Merit Systems Protection Board that their challenges to their terminations \"necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors or other members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\"\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the majority ruling said.The three liberal members of the court dissented from the decision by six conservative justices, which keeps Wilcox and Harris off their boards as their lawsuit challenging their terminations is pending.While Thursday's decision does not explicitly bar Trump — or any other president — from firing a Federal Reserve board member, it suggests that any effort by a president to do so would face strong resistance from the Supreme Court as currently constituted.A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., had enjoined Trump from removing both women from their respective boards. An appeals court later upheld that order.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocratic Rep.

United States has stood as precedent, giving bipartisan administrative federal bodies \"a measure of independces from presidential control.\"Kagan called out the majority for its exemption for the Federal Reserve.\"The majority closes today's order by stating, out of the blue, that it has no bearing on 'the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections' for members of the Federal Reserve Board or Open Market Committee,\" Kagan wrote.\"I am glad to hear it, and do not doubt the majority's intention to avoid imperiling the Fed,\" she wrote. \"But then, today's order poses a puzzle. For the Federal Reserve's independence rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on — which is to say it rests largely on Humphrey's.\"\"So the majority has to offer a different story: The Federal Reserve, it submits, is a \"uniquely structured\" entity with a 'distinct historical tradition' —and it cites for that proposition footnote 8 of this Court's opinion in Seila Law,\" Kagan wrote. But — sorry—footnote 8 provides no support,\" she added. \"Its only relevant sentence rejects an argument made in the dissenting opinion 'even assuming [that] financial institutions like theSecond Bank and Federal Reserve can claim a special historical status.' \"\"And so an assumption made to humor a dissent gets turned into some kind of holding,\" Kagan wrote. \"Because one way of making new law on the emergency docket (the deprecation of Humphrey's) turns out to require yet another (the creation of a bespoke Federal Reserve exception). If the idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler—and more judicial—approach would have been to deny the President's application for a stay on the continued authority of Humphreys.\"",
