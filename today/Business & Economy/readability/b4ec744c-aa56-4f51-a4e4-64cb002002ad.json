In This Article: Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (NYSEMKT: DIV) and SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEMKT: SPYD) both have a similar goal of buying high-yield stocks. However, they go about the effort in a slightly different way. Is SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF's 4.1% yield a better bet than Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF's 5.4% yield? SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF is incredibly simple to understand. It starts by looking at only the dividend-paying stocks within the S\u0026P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which is a curated list of generally large companies meant to represent the broader U.S. economy. The dividend payers are lined up by dividend yield, from highest to lowest. The 80 highest-yielding stocks get put into the ETF using an equal-weighting methodology, so that each stock has the same impact on overall performance. Aside from the equal-weighting bit, this is a pretty straightforward approach. Image source: Getty Images. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF is a lot more complicated. It starts its screening by looking at beta, a measure of volatility relative to the broader market. A beta above 1 suggests the stock is more volatile than the market, while a beta below 1 suggests it is less volatile. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF only selects from stocks with betas equal to or less than 0.85. The next pass is to eliminate stocks with dividend yields below 1% or above 20%. After that, the remaining stocks are checked to ensure that they have paid dividends for at least the last two years, and that the current dividend is at least equal to 50% of the previous year's dividend. This last one is interesting because it allows for companies that have cut their dividends to stay in the mix. From this final list, the 50 stocks with the highest dividend yields are selected. Like SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF, an equal-weighting methodology is applied. Image source: Getty Images. Picking stocks using only a high yield as the determining factor is a risky approach to investing. The list of highest-yielding stocks will inherently include companies that are facing material problems and are, thus, out of favor on Wall Street for a good reason. So, both SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF and Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF have taken steps to help reduce risk. SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 High Dividend ETF is relying on the selection criteria of the S\u0026P 500 index. The 500 or so stocks in the index are selected by a committee because they are large and economically important. That will, inherently, weed out less desirable companies over time.",
