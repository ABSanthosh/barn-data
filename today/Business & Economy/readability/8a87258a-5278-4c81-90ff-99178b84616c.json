It also expressed concerns about Google's proposal for a purely indicative date rather than specific dates for consumers looking to book flights.  \"Characteristics such as dates are an integral part of the general search process of consumers looking for air travel and the switch to a purely indicative date will downgrade their experience significantly,\" the group.  Google has said it may return to an old format of 10 blue links in search results that it used years ago if its rivals - such as airlines and price comparison sites - cannot agree on its proposals to comply with the DMA and not promote its own products.   (Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
