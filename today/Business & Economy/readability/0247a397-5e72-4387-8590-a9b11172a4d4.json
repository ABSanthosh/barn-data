Amazon is also a big user internally. For example, the company's programmers have begun directing AWS' Q developer service to write or update source code.Sivasubramanian said Amazon has \"saved 4,500 developer years using Amazon Q Developer's code transformation capability to upgrade Java applications.\"In November, Microsoft announced an Azure AI Agent Service, and two months later Microsoft-backed OpenAI started allowing paying users try its agent software called Operator. In December, Google said it would provide limited access to its Agentspace tool for a select set of customers.Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market, with nearly $29 billion in AWS revenue in the fourth quarter, well ahead of Microsoft and Google.Amazon has started promoting a next-generation version of its Alexa voice assistant that will be able to use AI models from AWS and from Anthropic, which is backed by Amazon. Anthropic is handling the most advanced elements of the new Alexa+, CNBC reported last week, though an Amazon spokesperson called the information \"false.\"Several existing teams will move to the new organization, which will include vice presidents Asa Kalavade, Dilip Kumar and Deepak Singh, Sivasubramanian wrote in a Tuesday memo to his colleagues.\"Our focus will be on developing AI agents that are not just powerful and efficient, but also trustworthy and responsible,\" he wrote.WATCH: Clara Shih, head of business AI at Meta, on the 'agentic' future of the economy",
