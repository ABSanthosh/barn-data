Winning can be measured in different ways. But in the stock market, winning is only measured by numbers, and even with nine consecutive gains, the S\u0026P 500 SPX is still down 3% on the year. My second wife says her 2 kids should inherit our estate, but I also have 2 kids. Is that fair? ‘I am scared to death that I’ll run out of money’: My wife and I are in our 50s and have $4.4 million. Can we retire early? My friend’s partner is pregnant, but she’s married to another man. Is he financially responsible? Warren Buffett offered this timely investment advice after a tumultuous April for equities My eldest son refused to share his father’s $500K inheritance with his siblings. Should I cut him off? Compare that to the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF EFA, which tracks the leading companies in Europe, Australia and the Far East and has rallied 14% in 2025. So it seems notable that Mike Wilson, chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley, says he likes U.S. over international equities from here. He thinks investors are talking about the wrong issue. “From our conversations, many investors are focused on U.S. vs. international equity market performance from a structural standpoint—i.e., is the U.S. exceptionalism investment narrative changing? Our focus for now is more on the cyclical than the structural,” he says. Wilson is of the view that it’s relatively late in the economic cycle, with a slowing macro backdrop, a Fed that’s on hold and “sticky” back-end rates. - “In particular, it’s a time when quality growth attributes tend to be rewarded as the cyclical impulse slows. U.S. large cap indices stand out positively in this regard with more significant quality growth weights and lower volatility of earnings growth,” he said. A weaker dollar should also benefit U.S. companies — to international rivals’ detriment. Wilson also identified other trades his team likes: Wilson said the next and more important test for the S\u0026P 500 since this rally began a month ago will come at the convergence of the 200-day and 100-day moving averages, in the 5,750 to 5,800 range. He said two of the four items on its checklist for a durable rally have been met — more optimism around a China trade deal and a stabilization in earnings revisions — but a more dovish Fed and a 10-year yield below 4% will be needed to take the next leg higher. The risks to the downside would be if the labor market deteriorated, but the evidence not just from the payrolls but also corporate earnings calls is that companies are not broadly reducing headcount. “Nonetheless, this data is critical to monitor, and the risk may be more to small business labor forces as these companies tend to have less cost structure flexibility and are more vulnerable to a slowing economic backdrop,” says Wilson.",
