Neuroscientist Mithu Storoni has looked at how and when our brains are the most creative and truly productive at knowledge work. As automation and AI take more rote takes off our plates, she shares how we can train our brains to be more effective at doing work that really matters. She explains how our brains tackle different kinds of work, how we can better schedule our days to align with those states of mind, and what this all means for managers and organizations.
