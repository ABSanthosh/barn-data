  "text": "Mumbai: Shares of IndusInd Bank posted their biggest single-day fall on Tuesday, wiping out over a quarter of its market value, after the lender's disclosure of accounting discrepancies involving internal derivatives trades spooked investors. The unprecedented revelation triggered a spate of analyst downgrades as uncertainty over its impact on the lender's credibility added to existing woes over stress in its microfinance books and the central bank's decision to curtail the renewal of its CEO's tenure to one year, rather than the three years the board had sought. Shares of IndusInd fell 27% to close at ₹655 on Tuesday. The sell-off erased ₹19,000 crore of the bank's market capitalisation to ₹51,102 crore.The private bank on Monday said its net worth could take a 2.35% hit to the tune of roughly ₹1,600 crore as of December 31 on account of underestimation of foreign exchange hedging costs. Analysts said these were internal foreign exchange derivatives based on the bank's forex borrowings and deposits.\"While the monetary impact is relatively small in proportion to the bank's overall balance sheet, the bigger concern is the credibility risk,\" said Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research, Kotak Securities.Agencies “Investor trust is crucial for a financial institution, and it may take several quarters to rebuild confidence.” Brokerage Jefferies said the transactions reflect “weak internal controls”. Other brokerages — Nuvama, Emkay Global and PL Capital — downgraded their ratings on the lender. “We believe IIB’s credibility and earnings shall be impacted,” said Nuvama’s analysts led by Mahrukh Adajania in a client note. “The timeline is discomforting--the CFO resigned just before the Q3 earnings, the CEO recently got a one-year extension instead of three and now a derivatives-induced dislocation.” The brokerage downgraded the stock to “reduce” and cut its target price to Rs 750. IndusInd shares had dropped nearly 4% on Monday after the Reserve Bank of India extended its chief executive Sumant Kathpalia’s tenure by one year as against three proposed by the board.CEO Kathpalia said on an analyst call Monday that RBI was aware of the discrepancies related to the derivative traded. “I don’t know the rationale behind them giving me a one-year extension,” he had said. “But I think it is uncomfortable with my leadership skills in running the bank, and we have to respect that.” Analysts said the slide in the stock price in the past year reflected lower investor confidence. The stock is down over 58% in the past year as against a 1.1% gain in the Bank Nifty “IndusInd Bank has faced similar challenges in the past and is currently valued at public sector bank multiples, largely due to these recurring issues,” said Apurva Sheth, head of research at Samco Securities. In the third quarter, the bank experienced higher slippages in the microfinance sector, Chouhan said. “While the actual financial impact of the derivatives issue is limited, the erosion of investor trust could weigh on the stock in the near term. Recovery will depend on the management’s ability to address governance concerns, improve asset quality, and sustain deposit growth.” Sheth said that while there may be a short-term rebound in the share price, he recommends that investors remain cautious and stay away from investing in this stock until there is further clarity from the management.",
