Jim Lo Scalzo | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla shares have dropped 7% from Friday's closing price of $323.63 to the $300.71 close on Tuesday ahead of the company's second-quarter deliveries report.Wall Street analysts are expecting Tesla to report deliveries of around 387,000 — a 13% decline compared to deliveries of nearly 444,000 a year ago, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet. Prediction market Kalshi told CNBC on Tuesday that its traders forecast deliveries of around 364,000.Shares in the electric vehicle maker had been rising after Tesla started a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in late June and CEO Elon Musk boasted of its first \"driverless delivery\" of a car to a customer there.The stock price took a turn after Musk on Saturday reignited a feud with President Donald Trump over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the massive spending bill that the commander-in-chief endorsed. The bill is now heading for a final vote in the House.That legislation would benefit higher-income households in the U.S. while slashing spending on programs such as Medicaid and food assistance.Musk did not object to cuts to those specific programs. However, Musk on X said the bill would worsen the U.S. deficit and raise the debt ceiling. The bill includes tax cuts that would add around $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.The Tesla CEO has also criticized aspects of the bill that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars in support for renewable energy development in the U.S. and phase out tax credits for electric vehicles.Such changes could hurt Tesla as they are expected to lower EV sales by roughly 100,000 vehicles per year by 2035, according to think tank Energy Innovation.The bill is also expected to reduce renewable energy development by more than 350 cumulative gigawatts in that same time period, according to Energy Innovation. That could pressure Tesla's Energy division, which sells solar and battery energy storage systems to utilities and other clean energy project developers.Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that Musk was, \"upset that he's losing his EV mandate,\" but that the tech CEO could \"lose a lot more than that.\" Trump was alluding to the subsidies, incentives and contracts that Musk's many businesses have relied on.SpaceX has received over $22 billion from work with the federal government since 2008, according to FedScout, which does federal spending and government contract research. That includes contracts from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and Space Force, among others.Tesla has reported $11.8 billion in sales of \"automotive regulatory credits,\" or environmental credits, since 2015, according to an evaluation of the EV maker's financial filings by Geoff Orazem, CEO of FedScout.These incentives are largely derived from federal and state regulations in the U.S. that require automakers to sell some number of low-emission vehicles or buy credits from companies like Tesla, which often have an excess.Regulatory credit sales go straight to Tesla's bottom line. Credit revenue amounted to approximately 60% of Tesla's net income in the second quarter of 2024.WATCH: Threats to SpaceX \u0026 Tesla as Musk, Trump feud heats up",
