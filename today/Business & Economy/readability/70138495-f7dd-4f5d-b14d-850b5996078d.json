Since leaving his post as Microsoft CEO in 2000, Bill Gates has become one of the world's most visible philanthropists. He does most of his charitable giving through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which manages an estimated $45 billion portfolio. A $45 billion portfolio is massive by any stretch of the imagination and you might naturally expect the Gates Foundation to be active traders. However, the Gates Foundation's most notable purchases were 1,000,000 shares in two transportation sector stocks. Both purchases indicate the Gates Foundation may be anticipating a strong economy in 2025. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! Federal Express (FedEx) is perhaps the most recognizable name in global overnight shipping. That might be what makes the company famous, but it's far from the only shipping sector where FedEx has a large presence. According to Transport Topics, FedEx also operates America's biggest less-than-truckload (LTL) service. This sector covers business-to-business and business-to-consumer shipping for small goods and is especially lucrative when the economy is buzzing. With that in mind, the Gates Foundation's purchase of 1,000,000 shares reveals a belief that the economy will be stronger in 2025 and that FedEx shares may be undervalued. Although FedEx shares are up about 17% for the year, they took a steep tumble in September. The falloff was largely due to a disappointing Q3 2024 earnings report that saw FedEx lower its expectations for 2025. See Also: Inspired by Uber and Airbnb – Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets – with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share! FedEx shares have recovered to some extent since that slide and now trade at $302.68, roughly $10 shy of its 2024 high of $312.54. The consensus of the most recent FedEx analyst ratings at Benzinga shows Citigroup and Barclays sets an average price target of $332.33. That could set the Gates Foundation up to make a good profit while earning a 1.82% dividend on its 1,000,000 shares.",
