  "text": "Indian equities ended the week in the red despite a Friday rebound, with the Nifty and Sensex logging a second straight weekly decline as global markets reeled from a fresh round of tariff blows unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Investors are scrambling for direction amid rising trade tensions, spiking bond yields, and wild cross-asset swings. Amid the chaos, the investing philosophy of legendary fund manager Peter Lynch—who famously ran Fidelity’s Magellan Fund to record-setting returns—is gaining fresh relevance, centered on four questions meant to help investors stay focused and avoid expensive mistakes.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsLynch's 1989 classic, One Up on Wall Street, laid out a deceptively simple approach to investing that emphasized clarity, patience, and common sense—qualities in short supply when markets turn manic. Lynch didn’t believe in timing the market. He believed in knowing what you own, and why. That philosophy feels tailor-made for today’s volatile landscape.What do you own—and why do you own it?Lynch believed most investors couldn’t answer this question with any clarity. This week’s volatility was a case study in what happens when conviction gives way to knee-jerk reaction. With hedge funds offloading Treasuries to meet margin calls, and safe-haven trades behaving unpredictably, portfolios need scrutiny.Do your holdings align with your risk tolerance and investment horizon? Are you diversified in substance, not just surface? Lynch warned that owning stocks because “they went up” or because “everyone’s buying tech” was a recipe for regret. The better approach, he wrote, was to think like a business owner—know what each company does, how it makes money, and why it will survive turmoil. That level of clarity can keep portfolios anchored when markets aren’t.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsWhy do you own stocks in the first place?This week offered plenty of reasons not to. Gold hit new highs. Bonds cratered. Trade tensions escalated. But Lynch’s long view is that stocks represent ownership in real businesses—and over time, businesses grow. Short-term panic, he wrote, is often the enemy of long-term success.Investors tend to flee equities during uncertainty, but Lynch argued that was often when the best opportunities emerged. As he put it: “Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in the corrections themselves.”What has changed?This question is Lynch’s way of separating signal from noise. Tariff hikes and recession fears are real, and the policy chaos of the past two weeks has rattled markets. But for long-term investors, the key is distinguishing what’s transitory from what’s transformative.Lynch urged investors to avoid overreacting unless the fundamentals had changed. Has a company’s core business model been disrupted? Are customers disappearing? Is debt becoming unmanageable? If not, he suggested, it may be worth staying the course—even if the stock price is tumbling.If you didn’t already own it, would you buy it now?This is Lynch’s reality check—the emotional reset button. It forces investors to drop baggage, stop anchoring to past highs or losses, and ask: Does this still make sense today?Consider a once-beloved stock now trading at a 30% discount. If the company’s outlook remains intact, the lower price could be a gift. But if you wouldn’t buy it today, Lynch said you shouldn’t hold it either. The past can’t be changed—but you control the next move.In One Up on Wall Street, Lynch writes that “the key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.” In a week defined by market whiplash and policy drama, that might be the only line investors need to remember.Tired of too many ads?
