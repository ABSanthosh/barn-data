Since big trades by large investors usually move stock prices, those with insider information build positions prior to the execution of the large investor's order betting that they would make profits once the purchase or sale happens.IANSThe traders of this fund consulted Salgaocar before placing orders in Indian markets, said Sebi.The issue of front-running has come under the spotlight once again after Sebi uncovered a front-running by stock market operator Ketan Parekh along with other entities. Ruchita Sonawane takes a closer look at what is front-running and how it happens.What is Front-Running?Front-running is an illegal practice of purchasing a stock based on unpublished information of a large transaction that could move prices. Since big trades by large investors usually move stock prices, those with insider information build positions prior to the execution of the large investor's order betting that they would make profits once the purchase or sale happens.How does it work?In most trades executed by institutional investors like foreign funds, mutual funds or hedge funds, insiders and brokers have an idea of the size of the deal and the price at which it will be executed. For example, an institutional client initiates an order to buy a significant number of shares of a company and informs the broker about the proposed trade. Someone at the broking firm aware of this information can then buy the shares of this company, before executing the client's order. Now, when the client's trade is executed, the company's shares gain and the person at the brokerage makes a profit by selling shares held by him/her at a higher price.How did Ketan Parekh execute the front-running SCHEME?Ketan Parekh and his associates including Singapore-based Rohit Salgaocar allegedly did trades ahead of an unnamed US-based fund. There were 20 other individuals and entities named in the Sebi order. Salgaocar was a consultant to the US fund in question. The traders of this fund consulted Salgaocar before placing orders in Indian markets, said Sebi.He passed on the information to Parekh, who through a network of brokers executed trades before the fund’s orders. The regulator has also sought to impound Rs 65.77 crore of the total unlawful gains earned from the alleged violations. Parekh was previously banned from the stock market for 14 years in 2003 for his role in the 2001 stock manipulation scam. WHY IS FRONT-RUNNING ILLEGAL?This is because it creates an unfair advantage for a set of people, manipulates prices and undermines trust in financial markets. “Once you are a fiduciary (broker, investment advisor, lawyer etc), you have a duty to put the interest of the client ahead of you, that’s the origin of front-running,” said Sandeep Parekh, founder of Finsec Law Advisors. HOW IS FRONT-RUNNING DIFFERENT FROM INSIDER TRADING? Insider trading is different from front-running primarily due to the parties involved and the relationship between them. Insider trading is the trading of shares by parties such as company executives, promoters or employees, based on their access to material non-public information about the company. “Putting profit ahead of your client, say as a broker, would be considered front-running as it involves taking advantage of your client in a fiduciary capacity,” said Parekh. “The two appear similar but are different offences.” Both malpractices are prohibited by Sebi. Parekh said that the deciding factor is a breach of fiduciary duty to distinguish the two. “In insider trading, the fiduciary duty is no longer required and is a much broader offence.” HOW DOES SEBI TAKE ACTION IN FRONT-RUNNING CASES? Once an entity is accused of frontrunning by the regulator, there are two courses of action. They can either fight it out or go through a settlement process called ‘consent mechanism.’ “The party accused of front-running can file a consent application saying that without admitting or denying, you want to put an end to the litigation and you are willing to pay X amount and Sebi has to then take a decision, which is called consent mechanism,” said Parekh. “The other option is to fight it out.” In the past, most accused have opted to settle with Sebi to avoid a prolonged legal battle.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2024 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
