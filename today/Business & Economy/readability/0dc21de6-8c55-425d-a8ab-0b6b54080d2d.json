  "description": "barre3 co-founder and CEO Sadie Lincoln joins Guy on the Advice line, where they answer questions from three early-stage founders. Plus, Sadie breaks down how she introduced her novel fitness concept to new customers. First we meet Dustin in Texas, who’s working on a brand identity for his ketchup-mustard combo condiment. Then Andrew in Missouri, who wants to convey the value of his newly-created yard game. And Randi in Alabama, who’s wondering if she should step back from being the sole face of her soon-to-be community gathering space. Thank you to the founders of Ketchustard, Pizzy Products and Ruffner Treehouse Village for being a part of our show. If you’d like to be featured on a future Advice Line episode, leave us a one-minute message that tells us about your business and a specific question you’d like answered. Send a voice memo to hibt@id.wondery.com or call 1-800-433-1298.And be sure to listen to barre3’s founding story as told by Sadie on the show in 2017. This episode was produced by Carla Esteves with music by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by John Isabella. Our audio engineer was Neal Rauch. You can follow HIBT on X \u0026 Instagram and sign up for Guy’s free newsletter at guyraz.com. See Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
