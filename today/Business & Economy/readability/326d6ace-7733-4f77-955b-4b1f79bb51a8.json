The offering will comprise a fresh issue of ₹2,626 crore and an offer for sale of around ₹350 crore by existing investors including Tiger Global Management, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund III (NIIF), 3State Ventures Internet Fund III, and IITM.This will be the first major IPO since Quality Power Equipments raised ₹859 crore on February 18.Axis Capital, HSBC Securities, JM Financial and Nomura are the book-running lead managers for the issue.Ather has reportedly trimmed its valuation to about $1.4 billion from a previously estimated $2 billion, reflecting continued tepid sentiment in the secondary market.
