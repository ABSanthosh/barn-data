  "text": "Jon Batiste (@jonbatiste) is a five-time Grammy Award-winning and Academy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and composer. His eighth studio album, Beethoven Blues, is set for a November 15th release. This project marks the first installment in his solo piano series, showcasing Batiste’s interpretations of Beethoven’s iconic works, reimagined. Beethoven Blues follows Batiste’s studio album World Music Radio, which received five Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. Batiste is featured in Matthew Heineman’s Netflix documentary, American Symphony. The film follows Batiste’s journey, starting in early 2022, as he receives 11 Grammy nominations for his studio album We Are. Amid this success, he faces the challenge of composing a symphony for Carnegie Hall while supporting his wife, bestselling author and Emmy Award-winning journalist Suleika Jaouad, who learns her cancer has returned.  As a composer, Batiste scored Jason Reitman’s Saturday Night, now in theaters. The film depicts the chaotic 90 minutes before Saturday Night Live’s first broadcast in 1975, underscored by Batiste’s blending of jazz, classical, and contemporary elements. He composed and produced the music live on set, capturing the intensity of the show’s debut. Batiste appears in the film as Billy Preston, the show’s first musical guest. Additionally, Batiste composed and performed music for the Disney/Pixar film Soul, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Score alongside Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Please enjoy!

Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep, and heat is my personal nemesis.

MORE JON BATISTE QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “Take your time to find the prize. There’s no rush. Pace yourself.”— Jon Batiste “Mistakes are amazing. Mistakes are brilliant. It’s a gift to go about your day and for something, either a mistake or something that you didn’t plan, an interruption, some seeming calamity happening that allows for you to not only respond but to create.”— Jon Batiste “When I was in college, my band and I would go in the subway and we would play for people. We wouldn’t ask for money. We wouldn’t busk. We would just play concerts for people who weren’t expecting a concert to just get to the point where we were fearless about presenting art.”— Jon Batiste “You have to understand what is it that’s yearning to be expressed within you. Even if you’re dreadfully afraid of it, you can have something within that seems so far away from the reality of your current state that it couldn’t possibly be for you in your mind. And every fiber of your being is telling you, ‘This isn’t what I should be pursuing. This isn’t who I am.’ That’s the one right there.”— Jon Batiste “I love to create these pockets of suspense, these pockets of pressurized creativity or pressurized experience that lead me to discovery, that [push] me forward. And I think about things that are not music, like cinema or — there are so many things that are not connected to the actual craft that I draw from much, much, much more than actually thinking about the inspiration of music and the fruit of the craft itself.”— Jon Batiste “There’s something about life. There’s a truth. There’s something about going through the fire that is so required and something about suffering that is so essential. This idea that we are meant to run from pain or run from difficult things and find the most leisurely and completely frictionless existence possible is such a lie.”— Jon Batiste “[Musical improvisation] feels like you are traveling. You’re moving, and your hand is telling you, ‘This is what I want to play.’ And as you play it, you’re seeing all the colors, and you’re hearing the sound. It starts to tell you, ‘Now I want to go here.’ And then sometimes it’s telling you things that you don’t know.”— Jon Batiste “Blues is an allegory for the human condition in sound. It’s a musical allegory that exists within the context of a cultural movement.”— Jon Batiste “If you don’t live it and it’s not a part of you, it’s not going to come out of the instrument. What we play is life. What we create is life.”— Jon Batiste “I don’t actually believe that failure exists. It’s not that it’s necessarily for your own good, but failure doesn’t exist. There’s opportunity for you to take something from the experience.”— Jon Batiste “On stage you have to present yourself in a way that is amplifying aspects of what’s inside. And ultimately, you have a decision to make as a performer to decide how far between who you actually are and who you’ve created to project on the stage.”— Jon Batiste “There’s a constellation of inspiration that crosses so many spectrums of society, and I can’t access it if I play by these rules.”— Jon Batiste “When I don’t have inspiration or I have a block, I do nothing. I live. And it’s absolutely because of the deeper inspiration that I’m blessed to feel. I feel it’s been cultivated. I’m connected to it, and I know it’s real, and it doesn’t have to greet me every day. I know it’s there.”— Jon Batiste PEOPLE MENTIOEND Anton EgoJimi HendrixJason ReitmanBilly PrestonTrent ReznorAtticus RossKurt VonnegutAndrew ZimmernMolly FerrissMichael JacksonMC HammerJemel McWilliamsTony RobbinsSuleika JaouadAlfred HitchcockJanna LevinTravis BatisteJamal BatisteTroy “Trombone Shorty” Andrews Jon’s FamilyAnthony de MelloJamie FoxxLudwig van Beethoven The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.
