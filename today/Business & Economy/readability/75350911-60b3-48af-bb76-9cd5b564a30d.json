Paytm was allocated a 10-acre plot in Sector 159 of Noida for the development of the complex in 2018 by the Noida Authority. \"We wish to inform you that the company has now taken a fresh step by proceeding to develop the project independently.

In January 2024, Paytm's board had approved execution of a joint development agreement (JDA) between the company and ACE Builders and Promoters to develop the complex. Under the arrangement, ACE was to raise requisite capital and funds for the development of the IT/ITES complex. \"In continuation of our earlier disclosure dated January 19, 2024, we also wish to inform that the proposed Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with M/s ACE Builders and Promoters Private Limited could not be proceeded with in line with NOIDA rules and byelaws,\" the filing said.  ALSO READ: Paytm swings into black, makes ₹122.5 crore net profit in Q1 FY26(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
