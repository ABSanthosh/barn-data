In its first-quarter earnings report for 2025, AT\u0026T revealed that it generated a net income of $4.7 billion during the quarter, which is 19% higher than what it earned during the same quarter in 2024. üíµüí∞Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter üí∞üíµ AT\u0026T also added 324,000 new postpaid phone customers and 261,000 new Fiber internet customers during the first few months of the year.

This move frustrated customers, with some even threatening to switch phone providers. AT\u0026T customers may have to pay more for some devices.Image source: Mark Makela/Getty Images While AT\u0026T is facing increased profits, the phone carrier is sounding the alarm on the potential impact of a growing threat. On April 2, President Donald Trump raised eyebrows across the nation when he announced a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all countries importing goods to the U.S., with roughly 60 countries seeing higher tariff rates. Tariffs are taxes companies pay to import goods from overseas, and the extra cost is often passed down to consumers through price hikes. However, on April 9, he switched gears and enforced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on all countries (except China), dropping them to a universal rate of 10%. He also unexpectedly hiked tariffs on China to 145%. Related: Verizon suffers major loss as customers switch gears During an earnings call on April 23, AT\u0026T CEO John Stankey said that tariffs can have a negative impact on a number of devices the company sells. ‚ÄúThe announced tariffs could potentially increase the cost of smartphones and other devices, as well as the cost of network and technical equipment,‚Äù said Stankey. ‚ÄúThe magnitude of any increase will depend on a variety of factors, including how much of the tariffs our vendors pass on, and the impact that the tariffs have on consumer and business demand.‚Äù He also warned that AT\u0026T may have to hike prices for its devices due to Trump‚Äôs tariffs.
