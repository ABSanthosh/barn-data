The FBI is offering up to $50,000 for information leading to Boelter's arrest.Boelter is listed as the director of security patrols at Praetorian Guard Security Services, a Minnesota-based private security firm, according to the company's website.Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in Minnesota, said the suspect had \"some overlap\" with Hoffman, but the nature of the relationship was unknown and it is not clear if \"they actually knew each other.\"Evans said that authorities \"still don't know if additional people are involved.\"Authorities said the suspect impersonated a police officer at the victims' homes, which are located in the suburbs of Minneapolis.Hortman, a member of the Minnesota House since 2005, served as speaker until earlier this year.\"Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,\" Gov.
