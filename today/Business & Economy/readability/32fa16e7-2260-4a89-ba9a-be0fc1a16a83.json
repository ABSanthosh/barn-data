His approval rating — which hovers between 39% and 45% in the three surveys— is the lowest for any newly elected president at the 100-day mark in more than seven decades, per CNN.A Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 39% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the presidency; a CNN/SSRS poll found that 41% of Americans approve; and a NBC News Stay Tuned Poll found that 45% of U.S. adults approve.The latest approval ratings are a stark change from when Trump returned to the White House in January and saw an uptick in his favorability ratings.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump's approval ratings fall as he nears 100 days in office, polls showRubio says week ahead is 'critical' in Russia-Ukraine war negotiationsTrump floats tougher Russia sanctions, meets Zelenskyy for first time since Oval Office blowupYale alums warn Treasury Secretary Bessent against enabling descent 'into fascism'Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty in federal court to UnitedHealthcare CEO murderUK's Reeves talks trade with U.S,'s Bessent after stressing EU tiesTrump is also losing confidence among voters in his ability to handle the economy, an issue that he made a centerpiece of his 2024 bid for the White House and is consistently a top issue for voters.
