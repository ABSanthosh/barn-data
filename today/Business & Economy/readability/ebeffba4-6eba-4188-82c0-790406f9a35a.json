  "text": "Palantir Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) shares have been on a tear ever since the company was added to the S\u0026P 500 Index. The stock inflection has followed an inflection in the company’s fundamentals, and on Tuesday the data analytics company’s CTO Shyam Sankar acknowledged that the company is facing a surge in demand. Offering Business Value: “This is a unique moment for Palantir,” said Sankar in an interview with CNBC. The commercial business is seeing tailwinds, the rate of the adoption of artificial intelligence is increasing, and enterprise automation is where the value is and the toolchain, he said, adding that “It’s a 10-year overnight success.” Don’t Miss: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 — you can become part of the next big real estate boom today. This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today. The foundational investments Palantir made in an ontology are the prerequisites for quickly putting these workflows into production, from a “charismatic prototype to actual business value,” the executive said. He cited one of Palantir’s clients, a very large U.S. insurance company, as a testimony. The Alex Karp-led company automated all of the insurance underwriting, reducing the time required to do the process from two days to three hours. It is not just time saved, which is the first-order benefit, but a customer can reap the second-order benefit of differentiating from competition, he said, adding that this is a fundamental dislocation of the market. Trending: ‘Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones – invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share Taking On Biggies: On Palantir’s advantages over bigger rivals such as Microsoft, IBM and Alphabet all of which offer services to improve the productivity of clients, Sankar said all the value is going to companies that have built a tool chain that allows you to get to production quickly. “We've spent the better part of a decade building exactly that,” he said. “You want to solve the whole problem; you have to be able to solve the whole problem and provide the regulators the transparency, the assurance.....they need to say ‘yes this model can be in production, this workflow can be AI-enabled,” he added. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.",
