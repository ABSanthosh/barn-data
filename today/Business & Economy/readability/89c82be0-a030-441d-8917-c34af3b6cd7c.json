The subsidiary body would also handle technology transfers.  In 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) adopted a historic resolution to tackle plastic pollution on a global scale.  This led to the creation of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) tasked with developing a legally binding international agreement on plastic pollution by 2024.  Since 2022, the INC has held four sessions in Uruguay, France, Canada, and Kenya. The current session in Busan, which runs from November 25 to December 1, is expected to finalise the agreement.Also Read",
