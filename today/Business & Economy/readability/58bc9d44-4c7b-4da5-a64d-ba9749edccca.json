  "text": "Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs have made their daily trades for Monday, December 2nd, 2024, with significant stock transactions catching the attention of investors. ARK's trading activity showcased a mix of both buying and selling across various sectors, reflecting the dynamic approach the investment firm is known for. The most notable transaction of the day was ARK's sale of 10,022 shares of Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:), amounting to a substantial $4,780,093. This move comes as ARK continues to adjust its holdings in the tech sector, with Spotify's stock being reduced from its portfolios. On the acquisition side, ARK made a major purchase of 156,138 shares of Pinterest Inc (NYSE:NYSE:), valued at $4,734,104, indicating a bullish stance on the social media company. This addition to ARK's holdings in Pinterest follows a trend of accumulation, as ARK had previously bought shares of the company in recent days. Another significant buy was the addition of 15,339 shares of Ibotta Inc (NASDAQ:IBTA), with a dollar value of $1,121,894. This purchase aligns with ARK's strategy of investing in innovative companies with growth potential. In the realm of healthcare and genomics, ARK sold 215,086 shares of Butterfly Network Inc (NYSE:BFLY) for $707,632 and 123,050 shares of Senti Biosciences Inc (NASDAQ:SNTI) for $265,788. Both transactions indicate a pivot in ARK's investment strategy within the sector. The ARKX (NYSE:) ETF, which focuses on space exploration and innovation, saw a purchase of 4,012 shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:) totaling $550,346, and 5,030 shares of Teradyne Inc (NASDAQ:) at a value of $553,300. These trades reflect ARK's ongoing interest in companies contributing to technological advancements. Other trades included the sale of 100,676 shares of AvidXchange Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AVDX) for $1,151,733 and the purchase of 99,784 shares of Absci Corp (NASDAQ:ABSI) amounting to $304,341. Additionally, ARK sold 7,930 shares of Garmin Ltd (NASDAQ:NYSE:) for an impressive $1,685,918, marking one of the largest sales by dollar value. Smaller trades involved the purchase of 18,781 shares of Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:) for $558,171 and 28,232 shares of Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:) of California Inc (NASDAQ:PACB) valued at $53,923. ARK also sold a minor stake of 400 shares in Markforged Holding Corp (NYSE:MKFG) for $1,596. Investors watching ARK's trading patterns will note the continued interest in companies like Pacific Biosciences and Pinterest, as ARK has consistently increased its positions in these stocks over the past week, while reducing exposure to companies like Butterfly Network and Spotify. These trades provide a glimpse into ARK's investment strategy, which remains focused on identifying and capitalizing on disruptive innovation across various industries. As always, investors are keen to follow Cathie Wood's ARK ETFs for insights into the future of technology and innovation-driven investments.
