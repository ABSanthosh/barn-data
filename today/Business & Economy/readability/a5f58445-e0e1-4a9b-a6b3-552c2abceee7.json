My wife and daughter are here today, and receiving this award in front of them means the world to me,” he said.   Additionally, newly-retired Indian goalkeeper PR Sreejesh (men's category) and China’s Ye Jiao (women's category) were named the FIH Goalkeepers of the Year. “This award completely belongs to my team—the defence who ensured most attacks never reached me, and the midfielders and forwards who covered up my mistakes by scoring more goals than I conceded,” Sreejesh said. The winners were selected through a voting process involving an expert panel, national hockey associations (represented by their national teams' captains and coaches), fans, and media. Two-time Olympic bronze medallist Harmanpreet received over 63 per cent of all votes cast in his category.
