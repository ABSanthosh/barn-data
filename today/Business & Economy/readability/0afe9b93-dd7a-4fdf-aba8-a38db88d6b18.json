  "text": "HOUSTON — The officials leading President Donald Trump's energy agenda made clear to oil, gas and mining executives this week that they have an ally in Washington who intends to make it as easy as possible for them to drill in federal lands and waters.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told executives gathered for the world's largest energy conference that the Trump administration does not view climate change as an existential threat. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said rising global temperatures are simply a byproduct of developing the country's national resources to support economic growth and national security.Burgum leads Trump's recently established National Energy Dominance Council and Wright serves as his deputy on the interagency body tasked with boosting production. Burgum was effusive in his praise of the oil and gas industry during remarks delivered at CERAWeek by S\u0026P Global conference.\"I'm going to share two words that I do not think that you have heard from a federal official in the Biden administration during the last four years. And those two words are thank you,\" said Burgum, who previously served as governor of North Dakota, a state that produces 1.2 million barrels of oil per day.Burgum leaned on his experience as software company executive to lay out his view of the interior department's role. The department under his leadership views the companies developing resources on federal lands as \"customers\" who are contributing revenue to the nation's \"balance sheet,\" Burgum said.\"If someone was sending me revenue, they weren't the enemy. They were the customer,\" Burgum said. The administration loves anyone who wants to harvest timber, mine for critical minerals, graze cattle, or produce oil and gas on federals, the interior secretary said.Royalties sent from lease agreements on federal land will help the U.S. pay down its national debt and balance the budget, Burgum said. \"You're the customer,\" the interior secretary told the executives.The value of nation's abundant natural resources far outweighs its $36 trillion in debt, Burgum said. If financial markets understood the value of America's natural resources, the 10-year long-term interest rate would come down, Burgum claimed.\"The interest rates right now are one of the biggest expenses we have as a country,\" Burgum said. \"So one of the things that we have to do is unleash America's balance sheet, and President Trump is helping us do that,\" he said.Burgum slammed the Biden administration's focus on climate change as an \"ideology.\" He said the Trump administration views Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and China winning the artificial intelligence race as the two existential threats facing the U.S. rather than global warming. Wright said Biden had a \"myopic\" and \"quasi religious\" belief in reducing emissions that hurt consumers.Burgum and Wright dismissed policies that support a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, arguing that wind and solar won't be able to meet rising energy demand in the coming years from artificial intelligence and re-industrialization.\"There is simply no physical way that wind, solar and batteries could replace the myriad uses of natural gas. I haven't even mentioned oil or coal yet,\" Wright said at the conference. Wright previously served as CEO of oilfield services company Liberty Energy and a board member at nuclear startup Oklo.Oil execs see allies in WashingtonOil executives are enthusiastic about the change of administrations in Washington, returning the praise they received from Trump's energy team during the week.ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said Wright and Burgum \"understand the business,\" describing them as the best energy team the U.S. has seen in decades. TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said he was \"impressed by the quality of our counterparts.\" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said the industry is \"seeing some reality come back to the conversation.\"\"For years, my message has been, we need a balanced conversation about affordability, reliability and the environment, and focusing only on climate leads us to ignore the first two,\" Wright said.The executives all referred to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, following Trump's executive order to rename the body of water. The president issued an order on his first day to repeal Biden's ban on offshore drilling in 625 million acres of U.S. coastal waters.BP CEO Murray Auchincloss briefly slipped before correcting himself when discussing how generative AI is helping with exploration: \"We started doing this in the Gulf of Mexico, uh America, and we spread that to other nations as well.\"But Trump's calls to \"drill, baby, drill\" are running up against market reality. The CEOs of Chevron and Conoco said U.S. oil production will likely plateau in the coming years after hitting new records under the Biden administration.\"Chasing growth for growth's sake has not proven to be particularly successful for our industry,\" Wirth said. \"At some point, you've grown enough that you should start to move towards a plateau, and you should generate more free cash flow, rather than just more barrels.\"Lance sees U.S. oil production plateauing later this decade and then slowly declining.\"Maybe it's time to go back to exploring the Gulf of America,\" Pouyanné said. \"The new administration is opening the Gulf. It has been slowed down after the Macondo drama,\" he said, referring the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest in the history of marine drilling operations.U.S. oil producers are scheduled to meet with Trump next week, industry lobby group American Petroleum Institute said in statement.",
