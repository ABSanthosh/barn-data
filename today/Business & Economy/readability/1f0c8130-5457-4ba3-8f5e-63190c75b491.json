  "text": "The Duct Tape Marketing Podcast with Michael Hoeppner In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I interviewed Michael Chad Hoeppner, a political communications expert known for his work with Andrew Yang during the 2020 presidential election. As an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, Hoeppner has conducted deep dive research on the speaking habits of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Joe Biden, Gretchen Whitmer, and others. Hoeppner is the CEO and president of GK Training, a firm dedicated to giving individuals, companies, and organizations the communication skills necessary to reach their highest goals in work and life. He has worked with some of the world’s most influential companies and their leaders. Hoeppner is also the author of “Don’t Say Um: How to Communicate Effectively to Live a Better Life.” Our conversation spans the art of effective communication, uncovering actionable public speaking tips and simple exercises to transform average speakers into confident, expert communicators. Whether you want to eliminate filler words, speak with intentionality, or learn how to engage an audience effortlessly, Hoeppner’s insights offer practical tools for anyone looking to become a better speaker and communicator. Key Takeaways: Effective communication starts with intentionality Hoeppner emphasizes shifting focus from yourself to your audience. Understanding that speaking is about serving others, not showcasing yourself, can immediately elevate your communication skills. Filler words aren’t the enemy—lack of clarity is Instead of obsessing over eliminating “ums” and “ahs,” focus on increasing linguistic precision. Choose your words intentionally to ensure your message resonates. Public speaking is an extension of everyday conversation Hoeppner reframes public speaking as simply communicating in front of an audience. By breaking the false divide between casual and formal speaking, you can bring authenticity and confidence to any setting. Use practical exercises to master intentional communication Techniques like the Lego Drill or finger-walking exercises can help you slow down, organize your thoughts, and speak with clarity and impact. Tolerating silence is a game-changer Pauses give your brain time to think, your voice time to breathe, and your audience time to process. Learning to embrace silence can be a transformative skill for better communication. Chapters: [00:00] Who is Michael Chad Hoeppner?
