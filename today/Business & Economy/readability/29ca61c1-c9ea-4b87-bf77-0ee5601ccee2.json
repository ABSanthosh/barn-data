  "text": "In This Article: We recently published a list of 10 Stock Predictions That Jim Cramer Got Right Again. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. A viewer asked about AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), which had just posted strong results. Cramer enthusiastically supported the stock in that older episode, praising its breakout performance. He said: “AppLovin had a great quarter… and people are app-lov-ing it. And I’m not going to fight you on it — it was great. And I don’t like enterprise software!” Cramer supported AppLovin even though he dislikes enterprise software — a great call, with the stock up +381.87%.

But they have free cash flow. . .” Overall, APP ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
