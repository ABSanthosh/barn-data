  "description": "Brad Baxter sidelined a promising career in the car industry to build a better cat litter box – an undertaking that embarrassed his kids and eventually prompted his wife to ask \"what’s the endgame here?” That endgame turned out to be Litter-Robot, an automated self-cleaning litter-remover that helped propel Brad’s company, Whisker, to roughly $300 million in sales this year.This episode was produced by Sam Paulson with music composed by Ramtin Arablouei. It was edited by Neva Grant with research by Carla Esteves.
