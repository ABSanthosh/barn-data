  "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's impeachment on Saturday, suspending him from his official duties, capped 11 days of political crisis that roiled his country, sparked by his surprise decision to impose martial law. Here are key events from martial law to impeachment: -Dec. 3: Shortly before 10:30 p.m. (1330 GMT), Yoon declares on national television he is imposing martial law to root out \"anti-state forces\" and overcome political deadlock. An hour later the military issues a decree banning activity by political parties and lawmakers, and troops and police descend on the opposition-controlled parliament. Staffers use barricades and fire extinguishers to ward off special operations soldiers who arrive by helicopter and break windows as they enter parliament. Lawmakers hop fences to avoid the security cordons and crowds of protesters gather. -Dec. 4: Defying the military's order, 190 lawmakers in the early hours unanimously vote to reject Yoon's declaration and troops begin to leave. About three and a half hours later, Yoon gives another televised speech, announcing he is lifting martial law. The decree was in effect for about six hours. Opposition parties submit motion to impeach Yoon. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell says Yoon \"badly misjudged\" his decision to declare martial law, which was \"deeply problematic\" and \"illegitimate.\" -Dec. 5: Yoon's People Power Party, although divided, decides to oppose his impeachment. Yoon accepts the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun. Police investigate Yoon, Kim and the interior minister on accusations of treason and related crimes over the declaration of martial law after opposition parties and activists filed complaints. -Dec. 6: PPP leader Han Dong-hoon says Yoon must be removed from power for trying to impose martial law. Some party members urge Yoon to resign. -Dec. 7: Yoon addresses the nation to apologise, saying he will put his fate in the hands of the PPP but not saying he will resign. A vote to impeach Yoon fails as the PPP boycotts, depriving parliament of a quorum. -Dec. 8: Prosecutors name Yoon as the subject of a criminal investigation over the martial law attempt. Ex-Defence Minister Kim is arrested. -Dec. 9: The justice ministry bars Yoon from leaving South Korea. -Dec. 10: Kwak Jong-geun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, tells a parliamentary committee that Yoon gave an order to \"drag out\" lawmakers from parliament after declaring martial law. Yoon's office says it has \"no official position\" on who is running the country amid questions over PPP discussions for a caretaker government. Ex-Defence Minister Kim attempts suicide. -Dec. 11: Police try to search Yoon's office but are blocked from entering the building. -Dec. 12: Yoon says in another televised speech he will \"fight to the end\", alleging North Korea had hacked South Korea's election commission and expressing doubt over his party's landslide election defeat in April. The National Election Commission denies the claim. Seven PPP members declare their intention to support impeachment, one short of the number needed for the motion to pass. -Dec. 13: Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung calls on PPP members to \"join and vote yes for impeachment\". -Dec. 14: Parliament impeaches Yoon with the support of 204 of the 300 lawmakers in the one-chamber parliament. At least 12 PPP members vote to impeach. Yoon's presidential powers are suspended, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo becomes acting president. The Constitutional Court receives parliament's impeachment declaration. It will have six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate him.",
