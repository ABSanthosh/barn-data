  "text": "His birthday parties in downtown Manhattan; purchases of Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough paintings as well as the palatial Conholt Park estate make as much headlines as his billion dollar take home packet last year or his reading of global geopolitics impacting risk capital, but for Stephen A Schwarzman CEO of Blackstone Group, being a psychology major and learning ballet as an undergraduate student could arguably equip a person with the agility needed to negotiate today’s volatile world. The world’s largest alternative asset manager with $1 trillion of assets under management says the uncertainty is opening up growth opportunities to deploy capital in areas as diverse as private credit, artificial intelligence and data centres. On a trip to India to mark Blackstone’s 20th year in the country, Schwarzman (78) took time out to discuss Donald Trump, tech-arms race, the importance of electricity in the age of AI, India growth plans and what he loses sleep over in an interview Edited excerpts. You have a portfolio of over 250 companies. How does one deploy capital in such a volatile world and how does one hedge existing bets? Two hundred and fifty is just equity investments. We have lent to over 2,000 companies. In almost every case where we commit capital, whether it's debt or equity, we test the company's ability to handle its obligations in an adverse environment. It's not just how things work today but we go back historically or we see how bad bad can be and then set up an investment at a discount so that we can easily survive the worst set of outcomes. For us, when something unfortunate happens, we are set up to ensure our monies are protected. That has served us very well. We always have to anticipate the downside so when you have a time where there's volatility or something can go wrong, you know you can ride through that. It might affect our returns ultimately, but the first rule is to preserve capital.Twenty years in India is a big milestone for Blackstone-you've had a great run here. What would you say your dream is for Blackstone India for the next 20 years? My dream...  It would not take us another 20 years to get to this size where we are now ($50 billion of India AUM).  It would involve the continued growth of two of our existing areas - real estate and private equity. But we'd be adding at least three new areas or verticals shortly. They are infrastructure ($60 billion of global AUM currently) and credit ($450 billion AUM), both of which could be very sizable businesses. Finally, it would be distribution of our products to the wealth clients in India. All the three could become very substantial.How soon are you planning to roll this out in India?I cannot put a specific date, but we are actively considering these alternatives. So, you asked me for my fantasy or dream? It's at least double the number of verticals that we are in right now and grow those as quickly as we think is financially responsible. So, we could be significantly larger than what we are now. So instead of two things growing, we can have five things growing simultaneously. You are back after a gap of five years. How bullish are you on India at the moment? I am quite bullish. It's one of the few places in the world where the population keeps going up-most places it's shrinking. You also have a young population. As they grow older, they would need a whole variety of goods and services that are much more than what a mature population would need. Plus, people are smart here and that's a real asset. More importantly they are comfortable with technology, which is the biggest growth area in the world. India has a stable government, a functioning democracy.  The current government is trying to make improvements in regulation and debottlenecking the economy.  As long as people here recognise that the approach is the right approach and keep it going, then there's no rational reason to expect that the country won't continue to do very well.  The question is how soon can you have people who have a low income get higher income. When that starts happening, that's a huge flywheel for growth.There is unprecedented geoeconomic fragmentation, or risk of it. Will this lower global growth rates? Globalisation has created prosperity in the last few decades. It's in retreat around the world, especially as trade wars intensify. Do you see this impeding growth? Whenever you go through some dramatic changes like this where there's friction that's put into the system that wasn't there before, then the odds are that, to some degree, it should affect global economic growth.You're not unduly concerned? That's putting a value judgment on it. It depends on the position you are in. There are still things you can invest in that will be extremely successful even in the scenario that you just mentioned. For example, there is a huge demand for data centres in the US. It is estimated that $1 trillion of investments are needed in the US alone and another $1 trillion outside. This is despite the relationship between the two countries that you mentioned (the US and China). Global growth may get slower than what it would have been but even then, there will be growth in these pockets which can do very well. The exact degree of slowness cannot be measured at the moment as it’s just directional. But still there are interesting things where you can invest which won’t suffer.Will reciprocal tariffs hurt the US economy? It will make input costs go up for US corporates and will also have broader implications for the world and global markets? It's stimulating inbound investments into the US on a large scale. It is starting to happen. Non-US companies are bringing their business to the US. That's a very important offset because in the last 20-25 years, the US manufacturing base has substantially diminished and transferred to lower-cost areas or geographies. If you can imagine a scenario where there's lots of investments, construction and operations in the US that aren't there today, I think that is what the US plan is. That's also why there's a desire to have lower corporate tax rates. And if you put that together, a foreign company could get a lower tax rate and no tariffs if they manufacture in the US. They could also use it as a platform for exports. Depending upon such influx of new capital and manufacturing expertise, there is potentially quite a positive impact on the US economy. And I think that is part of the overall plan.You are one of the OGs when it comes to AI. But beyond AI and data centres, what are some of the biggest shifts you are trying to capitalise upon?One area which is deeply linked to the growth of both AI and data centres is the issue of electricity.  In the US, over the last 10-to-15 years, electricity has only grown two-tenths of 1%. We keep a buffer reserve of like 15% of unused electricity, just for safety. As per projections, with the boom in AI and data centres, the growth rate of electricity is meant to go up to approximately 4% a year. This is a stunning change. One of the most interesting areas for investment in the developed world is anything to do with electricity. And that goes from owning utilities or parts of them or owning the suppliers to the electricity grids.  Those companies or suppliers have been used to no growth. So, they've been very inexpensive. Who wants to buy something that never grows after all? But now they're all going into a rapid growth mode and this is a massive paradigm shift. This is irrespective of the kind of electricity- renewables or natural gas. However, you can't build renewables fast enough and they're not 100% reliable, unless you're in the Middle East where there is ample sunlight and wind.  So, you have to have another way of generating electricity. The best fuel for that is natural gas. That changes a lot of things. The energy complex is so large that the demand is going to be enormous. LNG export is just one of the fallouts from that. This is really just a huge and unexpected change in the global economy.Talking about electricity, how viable are small and modular nuclear reactors that Bill Gates and others are championing?There are some interesting ideas, but nobody has any idea what will happen. It would be a wonderful solution, if it works. In the short term of the next five years, I don't know if anyone has the sense that the nuclear options would be effective. And then you have to build these things. I think it's going to take a while to figure it out and then manufacture and get tested and so forth.Since you also spoke about data centres and AI as well as energy, are you focussing more on the hardware side of things or taking bets on the software side as well?At the moment, we are mostly in the picks and shovels. With hard assets, we don't have to bet on which AI application will be the right one. Currently, there's an enormous amount of money poured into that first question. As a firm, Blackstone is quite conservative. We live by the principle of: don't lose money. When you make a commitment, make a big one but never at the risk of your capital. Some firms have done well taking really big bets and losing capital on a very large percentage of what they do but having some spectacular wins. I guess it's a matter of taste. That's not what we do. It's too early for us. What makes Stephen Schwarzman lose sleep? Is it Trump, trade wars, tariffs, technology arms race? The biggest risk today is dramatic changes in capital flows. If countries start retaliating by not permitting free flow of capital or investments, then that is an unpredictable risk. The kind you just talked about can lead to a different order of things, but I am not as much worried about that as I am on capital flows. Free flow of capital will ensure you can pretty much figure all the other things out. But if we end up with a world where that stops and every country just becomes an island, then that imperils the global system.",
