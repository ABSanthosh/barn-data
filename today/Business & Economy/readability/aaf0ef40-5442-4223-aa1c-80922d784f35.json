Speaking on the \"Afford Anything\" podcast, she explained why even this seemingly hefty amount might leave you struggling in retirement – especially if life throws a few curveballs your way. Don't Miss: The number of ‘401(k)' Millionaires is up 43% from last year — Here are three ways to join the club. Many are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula. CD Popularity Soars: Over 50 Million Americans Embrace Safe Savings with 5–10% Annual Growth Orman was asked whether $3 million, paired with a conservative 3% withdrawal rate, could fund a secure early retirement. Her response? A flat-out no. She didn't even hesitate to poke holes in the idea, calling $3 million \"far from enough\" for the unexpected costs life can throw at you. The host, Paula Pant, asked Orman, \"What would be a safe amount at which a person can say, ‘All right, at this point, given the size of my portfolio, I’m comfortable enough that if I did get hit by a bus, I would be fine.'?\" Orman answered, \"It would have to be in the millions.\" Pant, wanting a clearer answer, pressed further: \"How many million?\" That's when Orman started doing the math – it wasn't pretty. \"It depends where you live, what your expenses are,\" Orman said. \"Do you own your home outright? So, what are your expenses? But just think about it logically.\" And then she did exactly that: broke it down, line by line. Trending: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart \u0026 Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share \"Let's say you need help. Remember, I took care of my mother and it cost me, like I said, $30,000 a month. $30,000 a month,\" Orman emphasized. \"So, you're talking about, very possibly, for full-time help and everything – because good luck getting insurance and things to pay for it now – you're talking about maybe $300,000, $400,000 a year.\" If that wasn't sobering enough, she added: \"Now you have other expenses – food and everything. Let's just say you need another $100,000 a year to live. So now you're at $350,000 a year after taxes.\" Trending: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you. To generate $350,000 annually after taxes without touching your principal, Orman said you'd need a portfolio yielding at least 5%. That means a whopping $10 million in assets, if not more.",
