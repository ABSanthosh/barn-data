  "text": "Kevin O’Leary, often called Mr. Wonderful by many, is well-known for giving honest and frank advice, particularly regarding relationships and money. During a recent appearance on The View with his Shark Tank colleagues Mark Cuban and Daniel Lubetzky, O’Leary made it clear that women must aggressively take charge of their financial independence. In other words, they should never give up control of their financial future to a man. Don't Miss: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? Many are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. He pointed out that 50% of marriages fail – often due to financial issues – and emphasized that losing control of your finances risks losing your independence. \"If you get divorced from your husband, you're a nobody in the system,\" O’Leary said. He stressed that women need to maintain their credit scores and financial identities. Women can end up financially vulnerable without a credit card or a solid credit score. His solution? Each partner should have their credit cards plus a shared card for communal expenses. He also underlined the importance of having an individual investing account to ensure that every woman has her own financial safety net. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. According to O’Leary, the right partner supports your financial independence, not one who takes it away. He advises women to limit how much control anyone, including their spouse, has over their money. He wants women to prioritize their financial identity and ensure their assets are in their name. \"Never let a man control your financial destiny,\" O’Leary urged. His advice may sound harsh to some, but it's rooted in a pragmatic view of what happens when financial independence is compromised. O’Leary believes that maintaining your own financial identity is key to personal freedom.",
