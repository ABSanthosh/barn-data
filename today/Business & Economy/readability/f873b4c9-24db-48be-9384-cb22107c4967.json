Kennedy following the passage of the Foreign Assistance Act. It administers foreign aid and conducts a variety of other field missions around the world. Foreign aid in recent years has comprised about 1% of the federal budget and less than 0.33% of GDP, according to a Brookings Institution report from September.But USAID has nevertheless become a major target of Trump and Elon Musk, who have accused the agency of being an unaccountable magnet for fraud and corruption.\"THE CORRUPTION IS AT LEVELS RARELY SEEN BEFORE. CLOSE IT DOWN!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday morning.Musk, who is leading a sweeping effort to slash the size of government through the White House's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has taken credit for dismantling USAID.\"We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,\" Musk wrote on his social media platform X.",
