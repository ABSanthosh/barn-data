This directive aims to address the steep premium hikes observed in certain health insurance products for those aged 60 and above.AgenciesMumbai: In a major relief for senior citizens struggling with rising healthcare costs, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) has stepped in to curb steep health insurance premium hikes. Insurers can no longer raise premiums for policyholders aged 60 and above by more than 10% per year without prior approval, which will ensure accessibility of health insurance to those who are the most vulnerable to medical inflation.The regulator has restricted all health and general insurers who offer indemnity-based health insurance from hiking health insurance premiums charged to senior citizens by more than 10% in one year, according to a circular dated January 30, 2025, Some policyholders had raised concerns over rates doubling within a year.\"As part of the ongoing monitoring of insurance products offered in the Indian insurance market, it is observed that there has been a steep increase in premium rates under some of the health insurance products offered to senior citizens (aged 60 years and above),\" Irdai said. \"In this context, the most vulnerable age group is the senior citizens having limited sources of income, and this group is impacted the most when there is a steep increase in health insurance premium. This matter has been engaging the attention of Irdai and is a regulatory concern.\"Premium rates in the health insurance segment are driven by soaring hospital bills and medical inflation. Insurers set their rates based on the anticipated claim payouts, along with the expenses of acquiring and servicing policies. The claims outgo is dependent largely on the amounts charged by the hospitals for various treatments and surgeries, dictating the financial burden on the insurers and the policyholders.While insurers blame rising cost of hospitalisation for premium hikes, the regulator has asked them to move towards standardised pricing agreements with hospitals, similar to government-backed schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), where treatment costs are negotiated centrally. This will result in lower claim payouts and prevent steep premium hikes, the regulator said.Over the last year, the regulator has taken several measures to make health insurance accessible to senior citizens including mandating insurance companies to offer plans and riders catering to all age groups, including those above 65 years.It also reduced the waiting period for pre-existing conditions from four years to three. Also, insurers are now required to present a Customer Information Sheet (CIS) with every policy document, explaining key details like sum insured, coverage, exclusions, and waiting periods in simple terms.The regulator has assured that it will continue monitoring the health insurance market to ensure fair pricing and accessibility for senior citizens.( Originally published on Jan 30, 2025 )Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
