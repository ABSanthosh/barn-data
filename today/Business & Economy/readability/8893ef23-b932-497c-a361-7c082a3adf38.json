But investors need to remember that dividend payouts aren't a guarantee, regardless of a company's track record of distributions. Investors need to consider a company's future growth prospects as part of their analysis on whether to invest for the long haul, even for dividend stocks. Three stocks that made drastic changes to their dividend payments this year that surprised some investors are Estée Lauder (NYSE: EL), Medical Properties Trust (NYSE: MPW), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Here's why those cuts took place, and why the cuts may not have been all that surprising.

It also slashed its dividend nearly in half. The cut comes as the struggling company also has a new CEO taking over, Stéphane de La Faverie, to help right the ship. A quick look at the stock's payout ratio highlights just why a cut to the dividend may not have been all that surprising. EL Payout Ratio data by YCharts Worsening economic conditions, particularly in China, are weighing on its operations, with Estée Lauder incurring a net loss for the past two quarters. Until that situation improves, it'll be difficult to determine if the company can justify paying any dividend at all to its shareholders. For now, the dividend remains intact and yields 2%, but investors shouldn't assume that another cut won't happen in the future. One company that has cut its dividend multiple times within a short period is real estate investment trust (REIT) Medical Properties Trust. The REIT focuses on properties tied to the healthcare industry, and just like with any other sector, its business is going to depend on the strength of its tenants. Unfortunately, Medical Properties' portfolio has included multiple struggling tenants, including Steward Health, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. While Medical Properties has transitioned away from Steward Health recently, there are still question marks that remain about its operations and how strong the business will be in the future. The REIT has been selling off assets, and with a smaller portfolio, it may not be able to keep paying even a reduced dividend. Its current quarterly payout of $0.08 is less than one-third of the $0.29 that it was paying shareholders a year and a half ago.",
