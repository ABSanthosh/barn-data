  "text": "Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. In This Article: We recently published a list of Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top 13 Growth Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) stands against other billionaire Ken Fisher’s top growth stock picks. “Who am I to tell you anything, much less anything that counts? Or that there are only three questions that count and I know what they are? Why should you bother reading any of this? Why listen to me at all?” This is the opening paragraph in one of Kenneth Lawrence Fisher’s books, “The Only Three Questions That Count: Investing by Knowing What Others Don’t.” Fisher has over ten books to his name, but that is not why investors pay attention to what he has to say whenever he says it. Known to many as Ken Fisher, the 74-year-old is ranked at position 212 in the latest Forbes Billionaires list (as of March 11, 2025). This is thanks to the $11.2 billion of wealth he has amassed through Fisher Investments, a firm that has more than $270 billion in assets under management. Fisher has a lot to say about the market, and he is an active commentator on current events. As you’d expect, he had something to say about Trump’s tariffs. On Tuesday, March 11, 2025, President Trump doubled down on tariff talks, threatening to double the planned tariff on Canada-imported aluminum and steel to 50%. He said the levies would be effected in 24 hours and that if Canada doesn’t play ball, he “would set tariffs on cars from Canada so high that they would permanently shut down the Canadian car industry,” the New York Times reported.

On raising tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, the president argued that the move is a response to Ontario bumping up prices on the electricity exported to the United States. He has also mentioned concerns about fentanyl trafficking, high levies on dairy imports, and that the tariffs are the current administration’s “broader strategy to use economic leverage to address national security concerns and promote domestic manufacturing.” Fisher agrees with President Trump but only as far as the tariffs are negotiating tools. In a recent video posted on YouTube, he explains that tariffs are rarely fully enforced and argues that the actual impact of tariffs is often much smaller than people fear. The levies might be set at, say, 10-15%, but the real cost impact on goods is usually around 1.5%. He also emphasizes that markets often overreact to tariff announcements, causing unnecessary fear and volatility.",
