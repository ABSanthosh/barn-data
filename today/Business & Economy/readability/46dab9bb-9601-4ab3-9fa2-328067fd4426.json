  "description": "Tara Bosch wasn’t always considered a likely contender for success. At 21 years old, she dropped out of college the summer before her junior year and moved in to her grandmother’s basement. But, with a gummy bear mold from Amazon and a sugar-free candy recipe she tinkered to perfection, Tara got to work on a wild vision: she would create a global company called SmartSweets that would revolutionize the candy aisle and become a top seller of low-sugar candies. In 2020, Tara achieved her goal and sold SmartSweets for $360 million — a mere five years after creating the brand.  This episode was produced by Carla Esteves with music by Ramtin Arablouei.
