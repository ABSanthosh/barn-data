In this episode, we explore how both businesses and individuals can transform their strategic approach for greater success. In his latest book, This is Strategy: Make Better Plans, and a little anecdote about a chef, an electric car, and 30 years of veganism, he defines strategy as a philosophy of becoming and explains how understanding systems, the art of choosing customers, and competition can lead to long-term success. Seth Godin challenges conventional strategy ideas, emphasizing empathy and awareness of the systems influencing customers and competitors.

  "text": "The Duct Tape Marketing Podcast with Seth Godin In this episode of the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast, I had the pleasure of interviewing Marketing Hall of Famer and frequent guest, Seth Godin. A renowned expert in marketing, entrepreneurship, and strategic philosophy, Seth shares his invaluable insights once again on our show. With over 30 years of experience and multiple bestselling books to his name, Seth and I dive into my favorite topic—STRATEGY. In this episode, we explore how both businesses and individuals can transform their strategic approach for greater success. In his latest book, This is Strategy: Make Better Plans, and a little anecdote about a chef, an electric car, and 30 years of veganism, he defines strategy as a philosophy of becoming and explains how understanding systems, the art of choosing customers, and competition can lead to long-term success. Seth Godin challenges conventional strategy ideas, emphasizing empathy and awareness of the systems influencing customers and competitors. His thoughts on building sustainable, intentional strategies are a must-have for agencies, entrepreneurs and business leaders looking to stop running around in circles and make a meaningful impact. Key Takeaways: Strategy Is a Philosophy of Becoming: Godin explains that strategy isn’t just about following a step-by-step plan. It’s a forward-thinking philosophy that requires systems awareness and making intentional decisions that align with the change you aim to create. Empathy is Key to Effective Strategy: Godin stresses the importance of empathy, not just kindness, in strategic decision-making. Understanding your customers’ needs and the systems they operate within helps businesses connect more effectively and create long-lasting relationships. Choose Your Customers and Competitors: Godin highlights a critical but often overlooked aspect of strategy: businesses can choose their customers and competitors. By doing so, they can avoid commoditization and focus on serving those who genuinely value their unique offerings. These insights from Godin highlight the power of a holistic, empathetic approach to strategy. He provides actionable guidance for entrepreneurs looking to outshine the competition and build lasting value. Questions I asked Seth Godin: [02:18] How do you define strategy? [04:38] How should we think about strategy beyond just competition? [06:19] Should individuals also consider their own personal strategies? [10:57] Why is choosing your customers a more enjoyable way to do business? [12:53] Can you explain the idea of choosing your competition? [17:10] How did you curate your list of 40 questions to develop a strategy? [19:17] Why is it so hard for people to see strategy when they’re in the thick of it? [20:50] Does having a clear strategy help define what not to do? [22:00] Is there usually some short-term pain before the long-term gain of adopting a clear strategy? [23:45] How much does luck play into successful strategies? [25:14] Can you give a quick overview of your current work?
