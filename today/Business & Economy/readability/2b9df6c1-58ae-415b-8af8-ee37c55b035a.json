  "text": "File: The Amazon distribution center in Garner, N.C. opened in August 2020. Across four floors, the warehouse covers 2 million square feet.Scott Sharpe | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesAmazon workers at a facility near Raleigh, North Carolina, overwhelmingly voted against unionizing on Saturday.Of the 3,276 ballots cast, there were 2,447 votes opposing the union and 829 in favor, according to the National Labor Relations Board. There were 77 challenged ballots, a gap that's too narrow to change the outcome of the election. The results still need to be certified by the NLRB. The election at the facility, named RDU1 and located in the suburb of Garner, came after organizers with the upstart Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment (CAUSE) campaigned at the warehouse for the past three years. The facility employs roughly 4,700 workers.CAUSE said in a statement that the election results were a \"result of Amazon's willingness to break the law.\"\"Amazon's relentless and illegal efforts to intimidate us prove that this company is afraid of workers coming together to claim our power,\" the group said. \"Amazon may think it is above the law, but we will not accept a system that allows billionaires and corporations to play by a different set of rules.\"Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards denied that the company broke the law or interfered with the election.\"We're glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Hards said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to make this a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.\"Amazon, the nation's second-largest private employer, has long sought to keep unions out of its ranks. The strategy succeeded in the U.S. until 2022, when workers at a Staten Island warehouse voted to join the Amazon Labor Union. Last month, workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia voted to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union.Amazon responded to the Garner union drive with a barrage of anti-union messages in the warehouse, on a website, and sent through its AtoZ app to employees. A leader of the warehouse urged employees to \"vote no,\" saying a union \"can get in the way of how we work together.\" The company described CAUSE as an \"outside party\" that's \"claiming to be a union.\"Amazon has previously said its employees can choose whether or not to join a union, and that it speaks \"openly, candidly and respectfully about these topics\" so that they can \"make an informed decision.\"CAUSE was founded in 2022 by RDU1 employees Mary Hill and Rev. Ryan Brown to voice concerns about the company's response to the Covid pandemic, which they viewed as inadequate. The group sought to organize RDU1 to boost wages and secure longer breaks.Read more CNBC tech newsAppLovin skyrockets 33% after earnings beat, strong guidance as analysts raise price targetReddit shares slump 7% on daily active user missGoogle joins $350 million funding round for humanoid robotics company ApptronikCrypto scams likely hit a new record in 2024, driven by 'pig butchering' and AI, says ChainalysisMusk will withdraw OpenAI bid if ChatGPT maker stays nonprofit, lawyers sayStarting pay at RDU1 is $18.50 an hour.

But that hasn't translated into higher membership rates.
