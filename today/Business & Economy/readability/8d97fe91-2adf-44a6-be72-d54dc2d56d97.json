  "text": "The 2025 Fortune Brainstorm AI London conference took place May 6–7, 2025, in London, United Kingdom. You can read coverage of all Fortune Brainstorm AI events here. First, artificial intelligence started to perceive. Then it began to learn. Now it understands—images, words, sounds, and more. The next generation of AI will reason, plan, and act—all while managing a complete overhaul of computing as we know it. Are we prepared to fully embrace this new capability—to deploy it, scale it, regulate it, and live, work, and play with it? Fortune Brainstorm AI returned to London to convene the smartest people we know—technologists, entrepreneurs, Fortune Global 500 executives, investors, policymakers, and the brilliant minds in between—to explore and interrogate the most pressing questions about AI at another pivotal moment.We discussed the rise of the agent and how it could unlock productivity gains. We examined the business community’s continued move from planning for AI to acting on it—and how policy and regulatory changes are influencing that action. We investigated the latest advancements—how AI might orchestrate, organize, plan, or act—and share how organizations are deploying and scaling AI beyond mere experiments. And we discussed the extraordinary demand on resources that AI commands and how industry can harness it to make AI’s gains sustainable and responsible. As AI gains a deeper understanding of our world, it is becoming clear that there is no business on the planet that AI won’t touch. The program, presented in association with Accenture, featured intimate one-on-one conversations, live demos, and engaging panel discussions. More information about the conference, including the agenda and list of speakers, is available here. .Introducing the 2025 Fortune 500, the definitive ranking of the biggest companies in America. Explore this year's list.",
