Analysts recommend stocks like Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, Lupin, ITC, Marico, Radio Khaitan, KPR Mills, Kfin Tech, and Care Ratings for long positions.JATIN GEDIA TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is the Nifty headed this week? Nifty is trading around the 200-day exponential moving average (23,691), which is likely to provide some relief after a 4.7% correction last week. Positive global cues should act as a supporting factor. In the very short term, the fall appears overstretched as the relative strength index on the hourly time frame has an oversold reading thus increasing the probability of a counter-trend pullback. The pullback rally is likely towards 24,000–24,170 which coincides with the gap area formed on Dec 19, and the highest concentration of call open interest is also placed at 24,000 strike. India VIX is above 15, and a cool-off shall aid the counter trend pullback to sustain. What should investors do? Consider accumulating stocks with high dividend yield, for instance, Coal India and Indian Oil. We expect pharma, FMCG, and IT stocks to do well. Aurobindo Pharma, Dr Reddy’s, and Lupin from the pharma space are looking positive. ITC, Marico, and Radio Khaitan from the FMCG pack are looking bullish. Buy Dr Reddy at Rs 1,343 with a stop loss of Rs 1,320 for a target of Rs 1,421. Buy ICICI General Insurance at Rs 1,902 with a stop loss of Rs 1,860 for a target of Rs 1,965.SAMEET CHAVAN HEAD RESEARCH - TECHNICAL \u0026 DERIVATIVES, ANGEL ONEWhere is the Nifty headed this week? We see prices precisely placed at a crucial multi-month upward-sloping trend line. This is crucial because this trend-line has proved its mettle in providing a cushion to all signifi cant declines from October 2023. But, since this time we have closed below the pivotal zone of 200-DMA with some intent, the next potential support could be seen around the recent swing low around 23,200-23,100, while a decisive breach is likely to open further downside towards 22,800 in the near period. The formation of a strong bearish candle on the weekly chart certainly showcases a turnaround move, with bounces to be seen as opportunities to exit longs. The zone of 23,800–24,000 is likely to be seen as an intermediate hurdle. What should investors do? It is advised to approach markets with proper risk management and refrain from taking complacent bets for the time being. We recommend buying Care Ratings on a decline at around Rs 1,300–1,270 for a target of Rs 1,540. Traders can participate by following strict stop loss at Rs 1,140. Short Axis Bank around Rs 1,085 –1,100 for a target of Rs 1,025 with stop loss at Rs 1,128. Short UltraTech Cement on a bounce up to Rs 11,500- 11,600 for a target of Rs 11,100. A strict stop loss needs to be placed at Rs 11,825.PRITESH MEHTA EXECUTIVE VP – RESEARCH, YES SECURITIESWhere is Nifty headed? With the greenback threatening to break on the upside alongside weakness in the MSCI Emerging Markets index and deterioration of our customised breadth, the index is expected to challenge the low seen in November 2024. Immediate support is seen near the threedigit Gann number of 233(00). Changes in the above-mentioned trends/structure are likely to cap any reversal rallies off lows. What should investors do? Though Bank Nifty is trading fi rmly above the midpoint of the current three-digit Gann channel (48,500) which coincides with multiple lows in the second-half of 2024, the ratio of Bank vs Nifty failed to surpass June 2024 and reversed the previous week. Moreover, our intermarket analysis implies underperformance of equities vs gold \u0026 Nifty GS composite index. In such a setup, recovery tends to be shallow. Our customised textiles and capital markets indices are showing relative strength. We expect an upside of 8-10% in KPR Mills, and Kfi n Tech; and strength is likely to persist in select IT stocks like Wipro and HCL Tech.",
