This measure aims to ensure transparency and curtail any potential usurious practices amid growing household indebtedness.ReutersMumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) to reveal the total rate charged to customers on each loan product. These lenders would also have to get these maximum rates approved by their respective board of directors.Thus, a finance company will have to disclose the composite ceiling rates - comprising interest rate, processing fee, insurance and other charges if any - on various categories of loans such as mortgage, vehicle, property, gold, education etc.Amid a spectre of household indebtedness, the move is plausibly aimed at curbing any usurious streak among NBFCs which have fuelled retail loans in recent years. \"In a free interest rate regime, RBI cannot impose any caps, and it is not doing it. Technically, RBI has no role to play on lending rates that banks and NBFCs decide. But, there is a subtle pressure: once an NBFC spells out in black and white the highest charge on each type of loan, it would not be in a position to breach it,\" a senior industry official told ET.Besides, once rates are ratified by the board, a company would require the directors to re-approve a hike in total charges.Regulatory officials, sources said, held meetings with a number of NBFCs, following which minutes of the meetings were shared with them.However, in order to retain some flexibility on the final loan pricing, most NBFCs would submit to RBI a matrix of rates depending on various parameters - borrowers' credit score. Loan to value ratio, borrowers' loan repayment ability, loan tenure, market and liquidity conditions. RBI did not comment on the matter.\"RBI probably suspects that some of the NBFCs are keeping the borrowers in the dark on the final rates. The regulator could construe this as a violation of its 'fair practices code',\" said another person.According to the code, which has been in vogue for years, the Board of each NBFC shall adopt an interest rate model taking into account relevant factors such as cost of funds, margin and risk premium and determine the rate of interest to be charged for loans and advances. Moreover, the code requires that the rate of interest and the approach for gradations of risk and rationale for charging different rates of interest to different categories of borrowers shall be disclosed to the borrower or customer in the application form and communicated explicitly in the sanction letter.While household indebtedness is relatively low in India compared with other emerging economies, the central bank had highlighted that it has been on the rise over the past three years. According to a September '24 report by credit rating agency CARE, household financial liabilities had touched 5.8% of GDP in FY23, the highest level in the past 16 years, and significantly higher than the pre-pandemic average of 3.4%. Although the rise in household leverage due to investment in housing may not be an immediate cause for concern, it is essential to monitor the growth of unsecured lending driven by NBFCs and fintech firms, said CARE.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
