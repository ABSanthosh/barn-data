Our team immediately began coordination with safety officials to implement pre-planned contingency responses.\"The Elon Musk-led aersopace and defense contractor also said it plans to \"review the data from today's flight test to better understand\" the root cause of the mishap.Starship took off from the company's spaceport near Brownsville, Texas, at 6:30 p.m. ET for its eighth test flight.In January, dozens of flights were diverted after SpaceX's Starship rocket broke up, and the FAA warned of \"space vehicle debris\" falling. The regulator said that in the earlier incident, it received \"reports of public property damage on Turks and Caicos\" islands in the Caribbean.SpaceX was working on a mishap investigation into what caused the earlier incident but was allowed by the FAA to proceed with another test flight before completing it.This is breaking news.
