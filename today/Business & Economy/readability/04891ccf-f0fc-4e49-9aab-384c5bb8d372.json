MORE CHRIS HUTCHINS QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “I’ve always been thinking in the back of my head, ‘How do I do the thing that everyone else with all this money and all these resources does? How do I get to do that, even though I don’t have the resources?’ So that’s been my MO for life: I don’t want to sacrifice, but I also don’t want to go into debt or just spend money I don’t have.”— Chris Hutchins “Sometimes it just feels good to take a free trip. Who cares if it’s a good deal? You went on a trip you weren’t going to take otherwise.”— Chris Hutchins “Everyone listening should not be getting less than two points or two percent on any transaction, because you’re just giving money away.”— Chris Hutchins “There’s something fun about knowing you kind of ‘got one’ over the system.”— Chris Hutchins “I’m not going to let an AI book my travel, but I might let it do some exploration.”— Chris Hutchins “If you think too much about money, you just lose sight of the fact that money is a tool to help you achieve things. And if you don’t have any, it’s a really important tool, but as you have more, sometimes it just becomes a thing that you focus on way too much. And if you can learn to be happy with whatever you have, you might not need to chase. And that chasing is so toxic.”— Chris Hutchins The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.
