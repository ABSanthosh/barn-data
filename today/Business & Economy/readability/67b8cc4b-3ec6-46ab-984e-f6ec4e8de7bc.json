However, HCL Tech's profitability declined due to project delays. TCS improved its operating margin through cost control. HCL Tech revised its FY26 revenue guidance upward, signaling optimism. New order bookings decreased temporarily due to procedural delays. Employee attrition at HCL Tech fell, while TCS reported an increase.AgenciesThe TCV of new deals fell by 39% sequentially to $1,812 million on account of delays incurred in case of 2 projects. It expects to close them soon, which should boost the second quarter TCV.ET Intelligence Group: HCL Technologies (HCL Tech) reported better revenue performance than Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for the June quarter but its profitability suffered due to a delay in project ramp-up. TCS, on the other hand, expanded operating margin through cost control. However, an upward revision in the revenue guidance for FY26 implies that HCL expects a more stable business environment in the coming quarters. The decline in the new order bookings during the June quarter seems to be short term given procedural delays while closing two deals.HCL's revenue rose by 1.3% sequentially to $3,545 million in June quarter, beating the analysts' average expectation of 0.8% growth. This failed to boost the EBIT margin, which contracted by 161 bps to 16.3% as a result of a client bankruptcy and unanticipated delay in project ramp-up. Due to this fall in the first quarter, the company has reduced the margin guidance for FY26 to 17-18% from 18-19% while tightening revenue growth guidance to 3-5% from 2-5% in constant currency terms. To support the margin in long term, HCL has undertaken a restructuring initiative across geographies. Like TCS, HCL Tech also showed a greater traction in the projects with total contract value (TCV) under $50 million, reflecting that clients continued to observe caution while undertaking large multi-year projects amid global economic uncertainties. The software exporter reported weakness in demand from service verticals including manufacturing, retail and consumer packaged goods, and life sciences while showing resilience in financial, technology and telecom verticals. Live EventsAgenciesThe TCV of new deals fell by 39% sequentially to $1,812 million on account of delays incurred in case of 2 projects. It expects to close them soon, which should boost the second quarter TCV. Employee attrition rate fell by 20 bps sequentially to 12.8% unlike for TCS, which reported a 50 bps in attrition at 13.8%. While headcount fell marginally by 269 sequentially to 223,151 during the quarter, it focussed on adding more freshers with skills in the field of data, AI and cyber security. Fresh hires nearly doubled to 1,984 on year in the June quarter. Barring short-term challenges on the margin front, the company's medium term prospects look intact given the strong order pipeline and its agility in adapting to the changing client requirements.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
