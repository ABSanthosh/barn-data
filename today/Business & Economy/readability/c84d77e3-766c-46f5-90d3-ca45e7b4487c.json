  "text": "Cathie Wood's ARK ETF published their daily trades for Tuesday, November 19th, 2024, revealing a series of significant transactions in the stock market. At the top of the list, ARK's ARKK ETF sold a substantial number of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:) shares, totaling 44,520 with a dollar value of $15,080,704. This move is particularly noteworthy as it represents the largest trade by dollar value for the day. On the acquisition front, ARK made a considerable investment in Tempus AI Inc (TEM), purchasing a total of 92,441 shares across its ARKK and ARKG ETFs, amounting to a dollar value of $4,997,360. This trade signals a strong interest in the artificial intelligence company, and it is the largest buy for the day by dollar value. In another significant buy, ARK's ETFs added 223,476 shares of Intellia Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:) to their holdings, with a dollar value of $3,166,654. This transaction is part of a continuing trend, as ARK has been actively accumulating shares of the biotechnology company. ARK's ETFs also increased their position in CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) by purchasing 42,245 shares, valued at $1,998,188, and in Twist Bioscience Corp (NASDAQ:) with 69,680 shares valued at $2,886,842. These trades reflect ARK's ongoing confidence in the genomic revolution and its potential for growth. On the selling side, apart from the notable Tesla trade, ARK's ETFs offloaded 119,497 shares of Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ:RKLB) with a total dollar value of $2,305,097, which stands out as the second-largest trade by dollar value for the day. This follows a pattern of selling Rocket Lab USA Inc shares, as observed in recent trade data. Other sales included 37,6997 shares of Standard Biotools Inc (NASDAQ:LAB) for $565,495, 31,143 shares of Nurix Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:NRIX) for $678,605, and 69,553 shares of Unity Software Inc (NYSE:NYSE:) for $1,251,258. These disposals indicate a strategic realignment of ARK's ETF portfolios. Smaller trades involved both buying and selling across various sectors, including air mobility with Blade Air Mobility Inc (NASDAQ:), communications with Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:), and other biotech firms like Pacific Biosciences (NASDAQ:) of California Inc (NASDAQ:PACB). Investors keeping tabs on ARK's movements will note the ETF's dynamic approach to managing its portfolio, with a clear focus on innovative and disruptive companies poised for potential growth. As always, ARK's trades provide a glimpse into Cathie Wood's investment strategy and the ETF's adaptation to market trends.
