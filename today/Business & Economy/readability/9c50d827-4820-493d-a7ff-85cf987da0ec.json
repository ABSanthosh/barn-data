  "text": "Bloomberg / Getty Images Palantir CEO Alex Karp is interviewed during FoundryCon on March 7, 2024 Palantir Technologies shares are up more than 50% so far this year, hitting multiple record highs in recent weeks and again on Thursday. Analysts say the company has benefited from significant demand from retail investors, trailing only Nvidia and Tesla as retail favorites. Palantir recently issued a stronger-than-expected 2025 earnings forecast, driven by demand for its AI analytics. Shares of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) again hit a record closing price Thursday and are up more than 50% so far in 2025, growth that analysts attribute in part to the stock’s popularity with retail investors. The artificial intelligence analytics software company has seen \"record retail demand,\" including $339.72 million in the weeklong period ending Tuesday, Vanda Research said Wednesday. Palantir stock has soared to new highs this month after the company projected greater-than-expected revenue for 2025 and announced the integration of Grok, the chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI, into its AI platform. Notably, Palantir trails only semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA) and Musk’s electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), in terms of demand from retail investors. Nvidia and Tesla recorded net retail investor purchases of $579.14 million and $562.20 million, respectively, from February 5 to 11, according to Vanda. Palantir shares rose marginally Thursday to a new record close of $117.91, and have skyrocketed 390% over the past 12 months. Read the original article on Investopedia",
