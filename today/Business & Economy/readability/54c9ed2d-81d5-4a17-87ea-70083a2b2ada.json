Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsThe recent slowdown in foreign institutional selling also improved sentiment, resulting in further liquidation of bearish bets, though analysts said they must see more evidence to conclude if the newfound strength is here to stay. The NSE Nifty rose 314.65 points, or 1.3%, to close at 24,221.9. The BSE Sensex rose 992.74 points, or 1.25%, to end at 80,109.85. Both indices have rebounded nearly 4% in the previous two trading sessions, with the Sensex closing above 80,000 for the first time in 11 sessions.Five of 11 Adani stocks closed down on Monday, with Adani Green Energy, cited in the US Department of Justice indictment, falling 9.2%, hitting its 52-week intraday low.

Flagship Adani Enterprises, up 1.67% on Monday, was among six group stocks that gained 1-3%. Analysts said the Nifty must close decisively above a crucial resistance zone of 24,400-24,500 for the rally to continue. \"Overcoming this hurdle remains a daunting task and only a decisive breach of these levels could pave the way for an extended up move,\" said Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at brokerage Angel One.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) pumped ₹9,947.55 crore into shares on Monday, after net buying to the tune of ₹1,073 crore on Friday, largely on account of the rejig in MSCI indices. The global index provider's rebalancing of its standard indices took effect on Monday, triggering over $2 billion in global passive fund flows into various Indian stocks, such as HDFC Bank, BSE and JSW Energy, among others.Foreigners have been buyers in only five trading sessions since September 27, as they dumped shares worth over a record ₹1 lakh crore in October and ₹11,169 crore so far in November, causing the sharpest dip in the market for 2024.The sell-off has, however, resulted in the markets being oversold. The combination of an oversold market and BJP's strong performance in Maharashtra after its disappointing show in the Lok Sabha elections aided the market recovery.\"Markets have risen as they have factored in policy continuity after the recent state election results,\" said George Thomas, fund manager, equity, at Quantum Asset Management. \"We also think there was a softness in second-quarter earnings as the festival season had shifted by a few days. The next quarter results could give a clearer sign on demand in India and it may not be as worse as perceived by the street.\"Public sector units, oil and gas, and industrials were the top gainers in the surge on Monday. ONGC jumped 5.5%, L\u0026T rose 4.3% and State Bank of India gained 3.6%.Some technical indicators suggest the worst might be over. \"With the gap-up opening (on Monday), Nifty has crossed its 20 DEMA (day exponential moving average), currently placed at 24,050 for the first time since October 3, which adds to the bullishness,\" said Sudeep Shah, head of technical and derivatives research at SBI Cap Securities. He said 24,020-24,050 would act as an important support zone.Nifty's India Volatility Index or VIX-the market's fear gauge-fell 4.93% to 15.3, suggesting traders are less worried about near-term risks in the market.
