Vivo and Huawei, meanwhile, saw strong growth.TSMC, a key Apple supplier, on Thursday reported a smartphone sales forecast for the first quarter that suggested a nearly 6% sequential drop. TSMC, which makes the chips at the heart of Apple's devices, attributed the drop to seasonality. TSMC said AI chips comprised over half of its revenue in the fourth quarter, displacing smartphones, which had been its largest business.Notable Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on Monday wrote that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 6% on an annual basis in the first half of 2025, with most of the decline happening in the second quarter. Kuo wrote that he believes Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that is not yet available in China, isn't boosting iPhone demand.\"There is no evidence of Apple Intelligence's ability to benefit hardware replacement cycles or service business,\" Kuo wrote.Apple reports its December quarter results on Jan. 30.WATCH: Apple correction due to fundamentals, iPhone 17 upgrades expected, says Morgan Stanley's Woodring",
