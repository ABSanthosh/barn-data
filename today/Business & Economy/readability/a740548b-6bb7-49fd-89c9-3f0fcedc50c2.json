  "text": "Dr. Keith Baar is a professor at the University of California, Davis, in the Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology.During his PhD studies, his research revealed that mechanical strain on muscle fibers activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of muscular hypertrophy. Subsequently, he studied the molecular dynamics of skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance training under the guidance of Dr. John Holloszy, a legend in the field of exercise physiology, considered the father of modern exercise biochemistry. Building on all of this experience, he conducted research into tendon health and the potential for engineering ligaments, which could have implications for treatment and recovery from injuries. Dr. Baar now runs the Functional Molecular Biology Lab at UC Davis. His lab’s work ranges from studying molecular changes in our cells to conducting studies to effect real-world improvements in people’s health, longevity, and quality of life. Please enjoy!

Want to hear another episode that explores the possibilities of rapamycin? Have a listen to the conversation I had with Peter Attia, David M. Sabatini, and Navdeep S. Chandel at the source of this miraculous compound: Easter Island. Here, we discuss how one of the most important discoveries of medical science was almost lost, why metabolism (along with longevity) research is key to treating a long list of diseases, intermittent dosing of rapamycin, parenting advice from scientists on confidence and conflict, the necessary failures of good science, good fonts versus bad fonts, “non-potato” relationships, and much more.

KEITH BAAR QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “The number one cost to the US medical system is actually musculoskeletal sprains, strains, and tears—the back and the neck as well as the rest of the body. It’s more than diabetes and heart disease combined.”— Dr. Keith Baar “If passive flexibility was really important for decreasing tendon injury, then the women’s gymnasts who have the most passive flexibility wouldn’t be the NCAA sport with the highest rate of Achilles tendon rupture.”— Dr. Keith Baar “Injury related to flexibility is a U-shaped curve. So our injuries are really high when we’re very inflexible. When we get into that sweet spot where we have good mobility, we can do the full range of motion, actually the injury rate is very low. If we become hyper-mobile, we actually have that injury rate go up as well.”— Dr. Keith Baar “We don’t use a ketogenic diet if we want to go fast, but if we’re training for life, we see that it increases longevity, that the ketones themselves are really good for brain function.”— Dr. Keith Baar “The first recorded immobilizer for an ankle or a leg is from Egyptian hieroglyphs where they showed pictures 4,500 years ago. If I took you and you said you had cancer, you would not want a treatment that was developed 4,500 years ago. You would hope that something new has been developed in the last 4,500 years. That is where we are for our orthopedic situations.”— Dr. Keith Baar “The reality is that there are especially certain athletes like climbers where they’re doing all kinds of heavy lifts, they’re doing all kinds of heavy work, they’re doing all kinds of really dynamic moves. And what happens, what breaks down, is they break down in their finger tendons and they break down in the little pulleys within the tendons.”— Dr. Keith Baar PEOPLE MENTIONED Vincent Van Gogh Emil Abrahamsson David Sabatini Navdeep Chandel Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson Kozaburo Hayashi Håkan Alfredson Michael Kjær Monika Lucia Bayer Rod Whiteley Natalie Gilmore Timo Nyyssönen Venus Williams Luc van Loon Stuart Phillips Jon Ramsey Valter Longo Ron Maughan The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.
