  "text": "Technical charts and options data point to a weak market this week, with Nifty expected to trade between 22,800 and 23,800. Despite this, select stocks are displaying strong momentum and could sustain their upward trend, according to analysts. Stocks like SBI Life, HDFC Life, SRF, Navin Fluorine, Biocon, Marico, Bharti Airtel, HAL, Deepak Fertilizers, Tata Motors, TCS, and Bajaj FinServ present favorable risk-reward setups on the charts, said analysts.Tired of too many ads? Remove Ads Agencies ROHAN SHAHTECHNICAL ANALYST, ASIT C MEHTA INVESTMENTWhere is Nifty headed? We expect the weakness in Nifty to persist, due to the lack of leadership from heavyweight sectors such as Bank Nifty and IT, alongside the prevailing weak market sentiment. The recent price action indicates a breakdown below the critical support zone of 23,300, which aligns with the 50-week moving average and the 38.2% retracement level of the prior rally from the October 2023 low. Market breadth remains subdued with only 37% of stocks trading above their 200-day moving averages, signalling further weakness. Given these developments, we expect the index to continue its downward trajectory towards the 22,500-22,000 range, with intermediate resistance levels at 23,700–24,000. What should investors do? Traders are advised to maintain a sell-on-rise strategy and adopt a stock-specifi c approach amid the prevailing market weakness. However, select stocks continue to show strong traction and will likely sustain their upward momentum in the coming sessions. We remain optimistic about life insurance stocks such as SBI Life and HDFC Life, which have displayed resilience. Speciality chemical stocks like SRF and Navin Fluorine have shown promising action recently. Stocks like Biocon, Marico, and Bharti Airtel also exhibit strength on the charts, offering favourable risk-reward setups.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsJATIN GEDIA TECHNICAL ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is the Nifty headed? Nifty has been in a counter-trend rally after a sharp decline during the penultimate week. Last week it formed a doji candlestick pattern, suggesting a pause in the ongoing decline. Nifty is likely to witness a countertrend rally towards 23,500 with a potential to extend towards 23,800 levels. On the downside, the crucial support is at the psychological level of 23,000. A breach below can lead to a decline towards 22,670, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from 16,828 (Mar 2023 low) to 26,277 (Sept 2024 high). The probability of a countertrend rally is high this week. What should investors do? There has been a sharp decline in the broader market and frontline stocks. The bluechip stocks are looking attractive after the recent correction. While pharma and healthcare have witnessed relative outperformance during the recent decline, we expect some short-covering rallies during the week in the broader market. Buy Berger Paint with a stop loss of Rs 450 for a target price of Rs 495. Buy Godrej Consumer with a stop loss of Rs 1,165 for a target of Rs 1,255.",
