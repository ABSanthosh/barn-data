  "text": "Wipro, India’s fourth-largest IT services player, said it is realigning its global business lines to match clients’ evolving business needs and bank more on emerging technology opportunities such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud, and digital transformation. As part of the rejig, which comes into effect from April 1, Wipro will have four global business lines (GBLs) — technology services, business process services, consulting, and engineering. “This evolution of our business lines will enable us to further sharpen our focus on client needs with consulting-led and AI-powered solutions,” said chief executive and managing director Srini Pallia. “This realignment will allow us to serve our clients better, enabling us to deliver tailored, high-impact transformation,” Pallia said. The technology services line is a merger of its previous cloud capabilities (Wipro FullStride Cloud) and data, application platform, digital operations, and cybersecurity (Wipro Enterprise Futuring). This will be led by Nagendra Bandaru.Also Read Bandaru previously led the enterprise futuring line. The company’s cloud head, Joe Debecker — who joined under former CEO Thierry Delaporte — has resigned. “He has decided to pursue opportunities outside of Wipro,” the company said. Business process services will be led by Jasjit Singh Kang, who will focus on digital operations and business process transformation. Kang is currently the senior vice-president and business head of digital operations and platforms. Amit Kumar will head the company’s consulting business, which will provide strategic advisory and transformation services. Meanwhile, Capco, one of Wipro’s most audacious acquisitions, will continue to be led by Anne-Marie Rowland. Srikumar Rao will be the head of the engineering business. This vertical will continue to focus on engineering and R\u0026D services. This is the first realignment by the new CEO, while the earlier rejig was done in 2020 under the watch of the then CEO Thierry Delaporte. The business was further tweaked in 2023. Phil Fersht, chief executive of HfS Research believes that the current uncertain global business environment and geopolitics is driving business leaders to focus on investing in their data sovereignty, evaluate how AI can lower their exposure to bloated and fractured global processes, and completely rebuild their growth models.  “It makes perfect sense to merge cloud and AI as their strategies are increasingly intertwined.  Business process services has a very different set of needs in terms of talent, pricing, client retention, and sales, so bringing this out can help Wipro’s leadership with its development and visibility,\" he told Business Standard on Wipro’s rejig. Wipro's move indicates yet another attempt to reposition itself in the IT services sector and catch up with its rivals who have marched ahead of the company in the last decade. Chief executives such as Abidali Neemuchwala and Delaporte have repeatedly tried to turn around the company founded by IT czar Azim Premji, but have failed to do so with growth being in low single digits even when the industry's growth was in the higher trajectory. At a time when the industry is under stress, Wipro's attempt is another shot to better align itself to the needs of the customers who are looking for AI and GenAI offerings to bring in more efficiency in their operations For the fourth quarter of FY25 the company has guided for a revenue growth rate of -1 per cent to +1 per cent.",
