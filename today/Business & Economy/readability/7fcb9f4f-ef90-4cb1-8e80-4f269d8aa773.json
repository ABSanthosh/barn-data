This follows a stock market recovery. Over ₹50,000 crore in shares have been sold this month. Deals involve companies like ITC, Bharti Airtel and IndiGo. Experts believe this trend will continue. Positive market sentiment and easing global concerns are driving the sales. Several companies are planning to raise funds soon.AgenciesWhile policy announcements from the US remain unpredictable, the momentum in open-market transactions looks likely to continue, he said.Mumbai: The stock market rebound in the past few months has prompted dominant shareholders and promoters of companies to trim their stakes.So far this month, they have sold shares worth over ₹50,000 crore through bulk and block deals on the bourses after a lull, continuing from where they left off before October, when the stock market was in the midst of a bull run.According to exchange data, prominent shareholders and promoters divested stakes in ITC, Bharti Airtel, InterGlobe Aviation (IndiGo), PNB Housing and One 97 Communications (Paytm) this month, along with Kfin Technologies, KPR Mill and PG Electroplast. The divestments ranged from ₹1,133 crore to ₹12,941 crore since May 1.\"A significant amount of domestic liquidity had been waiting on the sidelines for market stability,\" said Ajay Saraf, ED and head of investment banking at ICICI Securities. \"With foreign funds turning positive on India's secondary market and key overhangs like geopolitical tensions and tariff concerns easing, the deal market has roared back to life.\"Agencies Momentum may ContinueLive Events This momentum is expected to continue as long as the current positive sentiment holds and no major crisis disrupts the environment, said Saraf.Among the largest deals, British American Tobacco sold 2.5% of its stake in ITC, worth ₹12,941 crore while Singtel affiliate Pastel Ltd sold Bharti Airtel shares worth ₹12,880 crore.

Ant Financial, the fintech subsidiary of Alibaba Group, sold shares of One 97 Communications worth ₹2,104 crore through open-market transactions.Kfin Technologies promoter General Atlantic Singapore Fund Pte sold shares worth ₹1,790 crore.\"The resurgence in Indian equity capital market deals is being driven by a confluence of positive factors - stabilising geopolitical tensions, easing trade uncertainties, encouraging full-year corporate earnings, improving high-frequency macro indicators, renewed FII interest, and sustained retail inflows into domestic mutual funds,\" said Ranvir Davda, co-head of investment banking at HSBC India. \"We believe that IPOs, blocks, and follow-on activity in the second half of calendar year 2025 will be significantly higher compared to the first half, with multiple companies having already received Sebi approval and several other listed companies having announced plans for fund-raising.\"The selling in the secondary market was not limited to large caps and extended to small and midcap companies such as PG Electroplast and KPR Mill, in which promoters reduced stakes by selling shares worth ₹1,132 crore and ₹1,232 crore, respectively. So far in May, the Nifty 50 has gained 2.05% while the Nifty Midcap 150 has risen 6.5% and the Smallcap 250 has advanced 9.2%.\"FY24 saw an all-time high in promoter exits, which was also on the back of a bullish market,\" said Pranav Haldea, MD, Prime Database Group. \"While promoter buying is always a good sign, reasons for exit can vary and range from cashing out due to good valuation, setting up other businesses, debt reduction and personal reasons.\"While policy announcements from the US remain unpredictable, the momentum in open-market transactions looks likely to continue, he said.Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
