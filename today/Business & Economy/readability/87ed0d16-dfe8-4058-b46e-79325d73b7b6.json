Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsThe decision came as a surprise to market participants, as it is rare for firms accused of violations to deposit such a large sum to comply with an ex-parte, interim order. \"Jane Street's action in depositing this amount could be with the intention to establish its bona fides,\" said a senior Supreme Court lawyer, who declined to be named.Sebi is examining the firm's request to lift the trading ban on it. The regulator will issue directions to intermediaries, including stock exchanges and depositories, to lift restrictions of the interim order, said people aware of developments, adding that Jane Street deposited the money on Friday. This was verified by the regulator on Monday.Agencies Derivatives Market Hit Three days after the curbs were imposed, Jane Street had told its staff that Sebi's order reflects a \"misunderstanding of standard hedging practices and the interrelationships between derivative and underlying markets.\"Tired of too many ads?

Sebi had barred Jane Street from trading in Indian markets after its order alleged index manipulation, involving bank shares and Bank Nifty index futures and options.The high-frequency trader was told it would be allowed to restart trading if it deposited Rs 4,844 crore, which the regulator had estimated to be \"unlawful gains\" from the allegedly manipulated trades.Legal OptionsLawyers said that even though Jane Street complied with Sebi's interim order, the firm would still provide a formal reply to the regulator, rebutting the allegations. Jane Street also has the option to challenge Sebi's findings at the Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT).Sebi confirmed that despite Jane Street's action, the firm reserves its legal and equitable rights and remedies.\"Based on a reading of the Sebi order, the trading ban would be lifted on the deposit of the amount mentioned. However, trades would be subjected to accentuated scrutiny by the exchanges and also subject to the no-fraud rule,\" said Sandeep Parekh, managing partner at law firm Finsec Law Advisors. \"On an operational basis, Sebi may have to instruct the exchanges and depositories to lift the previous ban, but that would simply be the plumbing of the order.\"The derivatives market has been impacted by Jane Street's absence.
