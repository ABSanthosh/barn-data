Their opposition caused hours of delays, but four of them relented overnight and the motion passed around 3:30 a.m. ET.Both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Trump himself heaped pressure on the naysayers to clear the way, a White House official told NBC News. The president has spent months urging congressional Republicans to send him the bill by the Fourth of July.The legislation just barely passed out of the Senate on Tuesday, squeaking through on a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break the tie. Republicans hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate.U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) speaks to reporters as he walks off the House floor after speaking for 8 hours and 45 minutes as the House debates the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act at the U.S. Capitol on July 3, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesDemocrats in both chambers uniformly oppose the bill, which they warn will disproportionately benefit the wealthy while throwing millions of low-income Americans off their health insurance. Jeffries, the House minority leader from New York, hammered Republicans on those cuts at great length before the vote, when he turned his customary \"magic minute\" speech into an hourslong polemic.\"Republicans are trying to take a chainsaw to Social Security, a chainsaw to Medicare, a chainsaw to Medicaid, a chainsaw to the healthcare of the American people, a chainsaw to nutritional assistance for hungry children, a chainsaw to farm country and a chainsaw to vulnerable Americans,\" he said on the House floor.Jeffries spoke for eight hours and 44 minutes, breaking the record for the longest floor speech in House history. The previous record was set in 2021 by then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy in opposition to President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill.Following his remarks, Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol, \"We're in a more is more environment. And House Democrats are going to continue to do everything that we can to stand up on behalf of the American people.\"\"And beyond that, I'll just let my words speak for themselves,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse Republicans race to pass Trump's megabill amid GOP divisionsHouse Republicans don't have the votes yet to pass Trump's megabillMurkowski cast crucial vote for Trump's megabill after getting key carveoutsHouse Republicans subpoena Brown University, Penn in Ivy League antitrust probeTrump's megabill squeaks through Senate, but House can still reject changesMusk shreds Trump bill as 'DEBT SLAVERY,' vows to unseat Republicans who back itTrump rips AT\u0026T service weeks after Trump Mobile licensing deal announcedTrump administration: Harvard violated civil rights of Jewish studentsWhite House says Canada 'caved' to Trump over digital services taxRepublicans argue that the bill's changes to Medicaid will cut waste, fraud and abuse from the program, while defending new work requirements for eligibility.
