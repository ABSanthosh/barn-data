  "text": "Strong bullish patterns by technical indicators and potential unwinding of short positions could drive the Nifty toward 25,200 this week, fuelling a broader market rally, according to technical analysts. Key stocks like Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, TCS, Coforge, Titan, Dixon, HPCL, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, and SBI have also shown bullish chart patterns.NAGARAJ SHETTI SENIOR TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, HDFC SECURITIESWhere is the Nifty heading this week? After showing gradual weakness amidst range movement in last fi ve sessions, Nifty witnessed an excellent upmove from the intraday lows on Friday and closed the day higher. A long bull candle was formed on daily chart with a long lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates formation of a huge bullish engulfi ng pattern, that has engulfed the smaller range movements of the previous fi ve sessions on the upside. The swing low of Friday seems to have confi rmed the formation of a new higher bottom of the bullish chart pattern. Friday’s market action has not only shown a false downside breakout of recent range movement but also placed on the verge of witnessing a decisive upside breakout. What should an investor do? The market action of Friday is signalling a strong comeback of bulls after a choppy phase, and we expect more upside in the near term. One may look to create longs in Nifty towards upside targets of around 25,200 this week. Immediate support is at 24,650, which could be a stop for a long. Stocks with positive bias include Kotak Bank, ICICI Bank, TCS, Coforge, Titan, Dixon, HPCL, IOC, ITC, HUL, Bharti Airtel and Indian Hotels. AgenciesSACCHITANAND UTTEKAR VP- RESEARCH (TECHNICAL \u0026 DERIVATIVES), TRADEBULLS SECURITIESWhere is the Nifty headed this week? Nifty is set to advance toward 25,640, the projected target of an inverse head \u0026 shoulders pattern on daily chart. Last week’s RSI crossover above 50 on weekly scale highlights improving momentum, despite recent volatility. The index recorded another consecutive weekly close above the key option cluster at 24,500, reinforcing its bullish undertone. A bullish crossover between the 5-week EMA and 20-week EMA further signals the onset of directional momentum. With short positions likely to unwind, Nifty could confi dently swing toward 25,125 this week, fuelling the broader rally. What should investors do? Traders should maintain leveraged long positions as long as 24,260 holds on a closing basis, with opportunities to add further longs upon a decisive breakout above 25,120. Investors are advised to accumulate during consolidation phases or corrections, with a revised weekly stop loss set at 23,600. Robust volumes and supportive technical indicators suggest Nifty’s upward momentum is well supported, offering opportunities for both traders and investors. The rally is expected to be fuelled by large-cap stocks like Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and SBI, alongside existing leaders such as Infosys, ICICI Bank, TCS, and HDFC Bank.ARPAN SHAH SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, MONARCH NETWORTH CAPITALWhere is the Nifty headed this week? Benchmark index traded volatile in the previous week and closed with a bullish candlestick formation on Friday. The index may witness a short covering rally if it closes above 24,850 level. It has resistance at 25,200 level and support at 24,500. The bank index is likely to perform in line with benchmark index and witness short covering rally. It is likely to touch its previous all-time high once it closes above 53,800 level. What should investors do? ICICI Bank has given a fresh breakout, and it is heading towards Rs 1,420 level in the coming days. Reliance has underperformed vis a vis Nifty in last few weeks. However, it has made higher bottom formation and traders can look to accumulate it at current level. Stock is heading for Rs 1,320-1,380 levels in the coming days. Nifty Metal index is trading in a range, and it is heading for 10,200 levels in coming weeks. JSW Steel, Vedanta and JSW Energy are the top picks from the sector. Nifty FMCG has also made double-bottom formation on daily chart and we may witness short-term pullback in the sector. Radico and ITC are the top picks from the sector. Among mid- and small-caps, investors can look to accumulate GMR Airport, Swiggy, Prestig",
