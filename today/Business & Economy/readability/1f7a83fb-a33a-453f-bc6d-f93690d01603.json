  "text": "The chief executive of one of America's largest health insurance companies was shot and killed Wednesday morning in Manhattan in what police described as a \"brazen, targeted attack.\" Brian Thompson, 50, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot outside the midtown hotel where its parent company, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), was set to hold its investor conference Wednesday morning. \"At this time, every indication is that this was a pre-meditated, pre-planned, targeted attack,\" NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a press conference Wednesday. The suspected shooter was lying in wait for several minutes and approached Thompson from behind as the executive was entering the conference hotel, firing several rounds, Tisch said. Thompson was shot at least twice, in the back and in the leg. He was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai West hospital. \"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague,\" UnitedHealth said in a statement Wednesday. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him.\" The company said it is working closely with the NYPD. UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. via UnitedHealth Group. (Reuters) · Reuters / Reuters A search is still underway for the shooter. The NYPD has called on the public for help with the case and is offering a $10,000 reward for information on the killing. According to witnesses, the suspect, described by detectives as a light-skinned male, was standing by before he began firing. He fled on foot and then rode away on an e-bike. He was last seen in Central Park. The shooting took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. ET. Police collected three live rounds and three discharged shell casings at the scene. While they do not have a motive, investigators said they believe Thompson was specifically targeted. \"There had been some threats,\" Thompson's wife, Paulette Thompson, told NBC News Wednesday. \"Basically, I don’t know, a lack of coverage? I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\" Security measures for corporate executives are common at most large companies but can vary in their scope and scale. In its 2024 proxy statement, UnitedHealth disclosed that Andrew Witty, its CEO, \"is required for personal security reasons to use corporate aircraft for all business travel and is encouraged to use corporate aircraft for all personal travel.\" The company did not disclose additional costs or security measures required by other executives or board members. As a division head, Thompson had a lower public profile than UnitedHealth's CEO, even as he managed a business that provided health insurance to nearly 50 million Americans.",
