  "description": "Bill Shufelt founded Athletic Brewing Company to re-invent non-alcoholic beer, but quickly learned that brewers didn’t want to make it, stores didn’t want to sell it, and potential customers didn’t want to buy it. The NA beer that already existed was outdated and foul-tasting, but Bill was convinced that if he could make a good-tasting brew, it would appeal to a growing cohort of people who wanted to enjoy beer without getting buzzed. For a while, Bill’s wife was the only person who supported him, but he eventually found an innovative brewer, and a winning strategy of sampling the beer at athletic events. Today, the company is valued at $800 million and Bill believes they’re just getting started.This episode was produced by J.C.
