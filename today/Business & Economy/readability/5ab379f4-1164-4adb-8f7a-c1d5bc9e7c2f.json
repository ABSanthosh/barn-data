Instead of focusing on the future, many are consumed by what Chris Ceder, a senior retirement strategist with Goldman Sachs Asset Management, refers to as the \"financial vortex\" — the relentless day-to-day money issues that overshadow long-term planning. “With competing priorities, it's very difficult to save as much as we ultimately want to save,” Ceder said in a recent Decoding Retirement podcast (see video above or listen below). As a result, a significant number of Americans believe they will need to delay retirement. Although the adverse effects of the “financial vortex” are on the decline (see chart below), the competing demands on people's finances, from monthly expenses and financial hardships to the rising costs of caregiving, make it challenging to prioritize saving for the future. Working longer, however, is not always the best backup plan, according to Ceder. Over the past several years, the Goldman Sachs Retirement Survey and Insights Report, which served as the basis for the conversation with Ceder, showed that 50% of people end up retiring earlier than they had planned. \"People think that they're going to be able to work longer to shore up their finances, but the reality is if you have to retire earlier, that has a really significant impact on your ultimate retirement savings,\" he said. Those saving for retirement can do more to avoid that break-glass action plan of having to work longer. Developing a personalized retirement plan is the best solution, according to Goldman Sachs' survey results. \"When we looked at this, it was really the magnitude of all the different ways that the planning aspect helped,” Ceder said. “We actually asked people a fairly basic question: Do you have a personalized plan that tells you how much you need to save for retirement and how to save and invest to reach that goal?\" The results were clear, he said. “Those who answered 'yes' consistently reported greater confidence in managing their savings, less stress, and an improved ability to balance competing priorities — all of which allowed them to reach retirement without delays. This highlights the significant benefits of having a personalized retirement plan.” Read more: Retirement planning: A step-by-step guide Some workers don’t have access to the planning resources and tools that can help them get on the right track.
