  "description": "We're back -- now in special series form! That's right, the show you love and let stand in your podcast feeds returns for an all new run of growth stories. So here's how it works: New episodes launch on our cousin podcast The Hustle Daily Show. About a week later, you can catch the second wave over here on our original feed. Subscribe to The Hustle Daily Show to get new episodes when they drop (and your fair shake of business news each morning while you're at it). Our first episode back takes a dive into the mechanical wave pool of the future. Aventuur is planning to develop surf resorts in 11 cities across North America. But for their hefty price tag, success will take more than a perfect wave on demand. Hosted \u0026 produced by Matthew Brown // Previously released on The Hustle Daily Show // You're the best.",
