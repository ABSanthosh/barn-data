  "text": "In This Article: For more than a century, the stock market has been the premier wealth-builder for investors. While real estate, Treasury bonds, and various commodities, such as gold, silver, and oil, have all risen in nominal value, none have come particularly close to rivaling the annualized return of stocks over the very long run. But there's a price of admission that comes with this top-tier wealth creator: volatility. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Over the last two months, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) and broad-based S\u0026P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) have fallen into correction territory with double-digit percentage declines. Meanwhile, the innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) officially dipped into a bear market, as of the closing bell on April 8. While some corrections in the broader market are orderly (e.g., the near-bear market for the S\u0026P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2018), others take the elevator-down approach. The previous three weeks of trading activity saw the Dow, S\u0026P 500, and Nasdaq Composite log some of their largest single-session point and percentage gains and declines in their respective histories. Image source: Getty Images. This outsized volatility has the benchmark S\u0026P 500 on track to do something that's occurred only four times since 1940. The best thing about this rare and sometimes scary event is that it sends a very clear message to investors of what comes next for stocks. Before unearthing the ultra-rare event the S\u0026P 500 has an opportunity to duplicate in 2025, it pays to understand the catalysts fueling this historic bout of volatility on Wall Street. It effectively boils down to three sources of fear and uncertainty for investors. First, there's President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements on April 2nd. Trump implemented a sweeping global tariff of 10%, as well as set higher reciprocal tariff rates on a few dozen countries that have historically run unfavorable trade imbalances with the U.S. Even though President Trump placed a 90-day pause on these higher reciprocal tariffs for all countries but China, there's a real risk of trade relations with China and our allies worsening in the immediate future. This could adversely impact demand for U.S. goods beyond our borders. The president and his administration haven't done a particularly good job of differentiating between output and input tariffs, either. The former is a duty placed on a finished product, whereas the latter is an added tax on something used to manufacture a finished product in the U.S. Input tariffs threaten to increase the prevailing rate of inflation and might make American-made goods less price-competitive with those being imported.",
