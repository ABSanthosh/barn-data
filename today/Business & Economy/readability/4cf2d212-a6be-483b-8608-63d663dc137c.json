  "text": "In This Article: Apple shares could be reaching a turning point, with big implications for tech, says Fundstrat’s Mark Newton. - josh edelson/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Following two straight record-busting sessions for the S\u0026P 500 SPX and Nasdaq COMP, the new quarter and second half is kicking off with some losses. Granted it’s an event-filled, holiday-shortened week with Trump’s tax and spending bill also currently battling its way through Senate, so some investor fatigue is understandable. S\u0026P 500 just saw its first ‘golden cross’ in more than 2 years. Here’s what comes next. My wife and I have $7,000 a month in pensions and Social Security, plus $140,000 cash. Can we afford to retire? ‘Finance makes me break out in hives’: I inherited $240K from my parents. Do I pay off my $258K mortgage and give up my job? I’m a stay-at-home mom. Do I take a part-time job to spend more time with my kids — or get a job for six figures? A sputtering jobs market is now a top risk for stocks and bonds in the second half of 2025 Still, even if markets are facing a possible lull around Friday’s Independence Day holiday, in July’s favor is a historically bullish seasonal trend seen in past post-election years, says Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat. The stock market could just keep pushing higher until consolidation — sideways action — kicks in for August, Newton tells clients in a new note. That’s as he spies signs the rally is just starting to broaden, with minor technical breakouts by the Dow industrials DJIA and Invesco S\u0026P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP. In our call of the day, Newton has a bigger point to make, flagging Apple AAPL as a crucial stock to watch in the coming weeks and player in tech outperformance. That follows Monday’s action in which Apple busted out of a period of consolidation that had lasted about a month, he said. Down 18% this year, Apple has underperformed its major technology rivals, with only Tesla TSLA worse off — down 21%. The iPhone maker’s stock has taken a beating in the first half of this year as investors have fretted over tariff fallout and lack of AI progress. Albeit in a rising market, Apple shares rose over 2% on Monday. Newton credited that to a report the company is considering using outside artificial intelligence and shifting away from its in-house tech to power a new Siri version, marking a “significant reversal” in strategy. He noted that the stock closed at multiday highs and its best closing level since mid-May of just over $205 per share after roughly a “month of lifeless trading.” While that’s just one session, it matters as the tech sector sets up for a “challenge of all-time highs versus the S\u0026P 500 in equal-weighted terms.”",
