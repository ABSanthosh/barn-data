The decline in net profit was attributed to a 13.6 per cent Y-o-Y rise in total expenses, which stood at Rs 1,741.52 crore, up from Rs 1,531.76 crore. The company also cited impairments on investments in an associate firm and assets in a subsidiary, according to its regulatory filing.

The increase in revenue was driven by strong performances in both the hospital and diagnostics businesses. Also Read The hospital business posted a 14.2 per cent Y-o-Y revenue increase in Q4 FY25, supported by growth in average revenue per occupied bed (ARPOB) and improved occupancy. ARPOB rose 8.4 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 2.51 crore, while occupancy levels reached 69 per cent, compared to 66 per cent in Q4 FY24.
