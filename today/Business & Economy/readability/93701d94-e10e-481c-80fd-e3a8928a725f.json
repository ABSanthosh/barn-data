When deciding whether to lease or buy a car, you should look beyond monthly payments and interest rates to make a decision. One major factor that often gets overlooked is how each option impacts your taxes. Depending on your situation, leasing a car versus buying one could offer distinct tax advantages, particularly for those who use their vehicle for business purposes. In other cases, buying may be the wiser strategy. Accurate record-keeping and understanding IRS rules are central to maximizing tax benefits. ​A financial advisor can also help you determine whether leasing or buying a car is more tax-efficient for your finances. ​Tax benefits primarily apply to vehicles used for business purposes, though personal use could also offer limited tax advantages. ​ Self-employed individuals or business owners may deduct certain expenses, such as mileage or actual costs, when the vehicle is used for business-related travel. However, commuting from home to a primary workplace is generally not deductible. You will need to keep clear documentation and comply with IRS rules to maximize these benefits. One of the main tax benefits of owning a car can be the ability to deduct depreciation. The IRS allows business owners and self-employed individuals to write off a portion of their car's value over time through depreciation deductions. Deductions based on depreciation can significantly reduce taxable income, though the exact amount depends on the vehicle's classification and how much it is used for work-related activities. The Section 179 deduction and bonus depreciation provisions can further enhance savings for those who qualify. If you finance a car for business use, the interest paid on your auto loan may be deductible as a business expense. This is a key advantage of ownership that is not available when leasing. However, to qualify for this deduction, the vehicle must be used for business purposes. Personal-use vehicles do not qualify. You may be required to document any claim for a deduction for business use, so it's important to maintain accurate records distinguishing business mileage from personal trips. Rather than claiming depreciation and loan interest, some car owners choose to deduct vehicle expenses using the standard mileage rate set by the IRS. This method allows business owners and self-employed individuals to claim a per-mile deduction for qualifying business travel, which can be particularly beneficial for those who frequently drive for work. For 2025, the IRS has set the standard mileage deduction at 70 cents per mile for business use.",
