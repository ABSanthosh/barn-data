Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp For the second quarter of FY25 (ended September 30), TCS recorded a net headcount addition of 5,726, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth. In the first quarter of FY25, the firm added 5,452 associates, taking the total headcount at the end of the first half of FY25 to 612,724. This addition comes after the company, like its peers, saw its headcount go down. For FY24, TCS headcount was down by 13,249, the first time in the last 19 years. Milind Lakkad, chief human resources officer, said TCS welcomed 11,000 associates in the first half of the year and was on track for trainee onboarding as planned. More From This Section “We continue our focus on acquiring quality talent. This year, we have more than doubled our hiring of higher cadre trainees.” Lakkad said the company would continue to hire from campuses even in the third quarter of FY25. However, lateral hiring will depend on market conditions. TCS’s hiring growth coincides with that of its larger competitor, Accenture, which also announced headcount addition.  The New York Stock Exchange-listed consulting and IT services firm said it would continue to hire in the India market. In Q4 alone, the company added over 24,000 people to its overall headcount. The Naukri JobSpeak Index, which tracks white-collar hiring activity, reached 2,727 points in September 2024, marking a 6 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth. This positive trend was largely driven by a resurgent IT sector, which demonstrated an impressive 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth in hiring activity, the company said.  Non-traditional IT hubs showed significant growth, potentially indicating a geographical diversification trend.
