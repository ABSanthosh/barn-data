  "text": "In a stroke of unbelievable fortune, Jeanne, a Sandusky, Ohio resident, won $15 million in the state’s 50th Anniversary scratch-off game this past June. Describe when Jeanne told the Ohio Lottery Commission that she had “dropped to the floor” after realizing her win. At the store, the clerk and Jeanne had cried together, leaving bystanders wondering what on earth had just happened. Don't Miss: How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy. Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. Many are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula. While $15 million might seem like a life-altering sum, Jeanne's final payout will be much less due to taxes, leaving her with around $4.5 million. It's a classic example of a lottery winner facing a significant reduction in winnings after taxes – an issue many winners don't see coming. Jeanne had the option of receiving $600,000 annually over 25 years (which totals the advertised $15 million) or a lump sum of around $7.5 million. She chose the lump sum. According to Moneywise, Jeanne will be left with around $4.5 million after paying federal and state taxes, a far cry from the headline-making prize. Trending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends So, why is there such a huge difference between the $15 million jackpot and her final earnings? The IRS requires lottery agencies to withhold 24% of any prize over $5,000. For Jeanne, that meant $1.8 million was withheld for federal taxes from her $7.5 million lump sum. But the story doesn't end there. Since lottery winnings are taxed as ordinary income, Jeanne's windfall pushes her into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%. This means her total federal tax liability rises to approximately $2.73 million, Moneywise reported. See Also: IRS Finalizes 10-Year Rule For Retirement Withdrawals, Making Things ‘Even More Insanely Complicated’ State taxes also take a bite out of Jeanne's winnings. Ohio taxes lottery income at 3.5%, which means Jeanne will owe around $262,000 to the Buckeye State. Jeanne's total tax burden is nearly $3 million, leaving her with just $4.5 million. It’s not bad for a $50 scratch-off, but far from the $15 million advertised. Given these eye-watering deductions, one might wonder if Jeanne should have opted for the annuity. Would she have taken home more money in the long run?",
