The BSE Sensex moved 0.8%, or 624.82 points, lower at 81,551.63.\"The market was jittery amid global nervousness due to lack of clarity on Donald Trump's tariffs, and trade agreements. With the F\u0026O expiry coming up, investors remained cautious,\" said Siddartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.A lack of positive triggers at the tail end of the earnings season on the domestic front also caused the gauges to lose momentum, said Khemka.
