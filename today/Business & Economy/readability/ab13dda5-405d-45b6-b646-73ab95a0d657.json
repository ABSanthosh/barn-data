Most people are curious about how they compare to others in terms of savings, but few can fathom hitting such a high target. So, how many people have $4 million saved?

This billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10. The $4 Million Reality According to data based on estimates from the Federal Reserve, having a net worth of $4 million places you in the top 3% of American households. That's an elite group, for sure. Leigh Baldwin \u0026 Co. Advisory Services reports about 4,473,836 U.S. households have amassed $4 million or more in wealth. This figure represents roughly 3.44% of all households in the country. While this is a slim percentage, a recent survey from New York Life found that today's workers believe they would need an average of $4.3 million to retire comfortably. The idea of having millions tucked away for your golden years might sound ideal, but the reality for most people is quite different. See Also: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? – How does it compare to the average? Where Do Americans Stand? Let's get real: most Americans are nowhere near that kind of savings. Having $1 million in tax-advantaged retirement accounts could put you in the top 3.2% of retirement savers, but most people find themselves far behind this mark. According to the Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances, Americans’ average retirement savings is $334,000, while the median – a more accurate picture – is just $86,900. Although people may feel they need millions to retire, they aren't actually saving millions. Trending: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. The question of how much you need to retire comfortably pops up for savers again and again. In a Forbes article, Michelle Richter-Gordon, co-founder of Annuity Research and Consulting in New York City, explained, \"People don't know how much they need at all. They also don't know when they will retire.\"",
