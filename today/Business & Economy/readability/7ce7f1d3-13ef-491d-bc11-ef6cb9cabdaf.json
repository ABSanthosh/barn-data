  "description": "As prime minister of New Zealand from 2017 to 2023, Jacinda Ardern managed one challenge after another: from natural disasters to a terrorist attack to the Covid-19 pandemic. To navigate that complexity, she had to learn how to gather experts and gain consensus on decisions even when information was scant or changing, to transparently communicate her plan of action, and to convey both calm and compassion, all while avoiding burnout.  Ardern offers advice to business leaders grappling with geopolitical and economic uncertainty and disruption. She's the author of the book A Different Kind of Power.",
