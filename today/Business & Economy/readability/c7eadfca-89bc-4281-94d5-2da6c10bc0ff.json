  "text": "New data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics out Wednesday showed that a key inflation metric eased for the first time since July. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed 0.2% over the prior month, a deceleration from November's 0.3% monthly gain. On an annual basis, prices rose 3.2%. Prior to December's print, core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% annual gain for the past four months. It was the first time since July that year-over-year core CPI saw a deceleration in price growth. The print is the latest economic data that the Federal Reserve will consider before its next interest rate decision later this month. Stocks rallied in the wake of the report, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling 12 basis points to trade below 4.7%.

Headline consumer prices rose as forecast last month. The CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from November's 2.7% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, ahead of the 0.3% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Seasonal factors like higher fuel costs and continued stickiness in food inflation kept the headline figures elevated.

Used car prices also saw another strong uptick for the third consecutive month, rising 1.2% in December after a 2% monthly gain in November. Although inflation has been slowing, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis. \"It hasn't been steady on inflation,\" Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and former Federal Reserve economist, told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief program. \"It's been quite uneven, but it is good to see some progress in the right direction. And I think that that's the big piece of this. We've been in a very 'wait and see' on the inflation front. And that's very much where the Fed is lined up.\"",
