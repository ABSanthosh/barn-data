  "text": "New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - December 31, 2024) - WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of ASP Isotopes Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPI) between October 30, 2024 and November 26, 2024, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important February 3, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased ASP Isotopes securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the ASP Isotopes class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=32062 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than February 3, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action (WA:) Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) ASP Isotopes overstated the potential effectiveness of its enrichment technology; (2) ASP Isotopes overstated the development potential of its high assay low-enriched uranium facility; (3) ASP Isotopes overstated ASP Isotopes' nuclear fuels operating segment results; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about ASP Isotopes' business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the ASP Isotopes class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=32062 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
