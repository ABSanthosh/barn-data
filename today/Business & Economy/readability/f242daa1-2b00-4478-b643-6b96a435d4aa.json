The long delay prompted some of the passengers to vent their anger on social media. No food or even water was served and there was no representative from the airline willing to listen to their grievances, some passengers claimed. The alternative aircraft will depart for Istanbul at 11 pm, the airline said in a statement. \"We regret that our flight 6E17, originally scheduled to operate from Mumbai to Istanbul, faced a delay due to technical issues. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to rectify the issue and dispatch it to the destination, we eventually had to cancel the flight,\" IndiGo said in a statement. \"Mumbai to Istanbul journey suspended after 10 hours waiting by passengers. Information that there are around 100 passengers in this journey and the number of students is large. Kids are crying at the airport, no resolution from authorities,\" said a passenger in his post on X, also tagging Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol. \"There are 500 passengers who have been scammed by continuous delays and eventual cancellation. All passengers have not been served any food or water. There is no representative from indigo willing to listen to grievances,\" said another passenger in his post. IndiGo, however, said its teams were \"working hard\" to provide support to the affected customers, keeping them informed and arranging accommodation, meal vouchers and full refunds.(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)More From This SectionDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.
