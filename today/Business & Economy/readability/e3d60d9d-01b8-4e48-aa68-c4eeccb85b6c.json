  "text": "The Global South has often been a victim of \"double standards\" and nations that make major contributions to the world economy are deprived of a seat at the decision-making table, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the Brics Summit on Sunday while calling for urgent reform of the key global bodies. In his address at a session on reform of global governance, Modi specifically pressed for reforming the UN Security Council, the World Trade Organisation and leading financial bodies saying they must reflect the current realities of the globe. \"In the age of AI, where technology evolves every week, it's unacceptable for global institutions to go 80 years without reform. You can't run 21st-century software on 20th-century typewriters!,\" he said. Without the Global South, these institutions are like a mobile phone with a SIM card but no network, Modi said. The top leaders of Brics held deliberations on a range of pressing challenges facing the globe on the first day of the grouping's two-day annual summit in this seaside Brazilian city.Also Read Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin skipped the summit. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Egypt's Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi also didn't attend the gathering. The Brics has emerged as an influential grouping as it brings together 11 major emerging economies of the world, representing around 49.5 per cent of the global population, around 40 per cent of the global GDP and around 26 per cent of the global trade. In his remarks, Modi spoke extensively on the Global South and said it has often faced \"double standards\" -- be it development, distribution of resources or security related matters. \"The Global South often received nothing more than token gestures on topics like climate finance, sustainable development, and technology access,\" Modi said. The prime minister said two-thirds of humanity still lack proper representation in global institutions built in the 20th century. \"Many countries that play a key role in today's global economy are yet to be given a seat at the decision-making table. This is not just about representation, it's also about credibility and effectiveness.\"  The prime minister said the global institutions are unable to function properly or meet the challenges of the 21st century. \"Whether it's ongoing conflicts across the world, the pandemic, economic crises, or emerging challenges in cyber or space, these institutions have failed to offer solutions,\" he said. The annual Brics Summit began with a family photo of the leaders followed by an address by Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva. Modi said the world today needs a new multipolar and inclusive order and this has to begin with comprehensive reforms in global institutions. \"These reforms should not be merely symbolic, but their real impact should also be visible. There must be changes in governance structures, voting rights, and leadership positions,\" he said. The prime minister asserted that the challenges faced by countries in the Global South must be given priority in policymaking. Modi said the expansion of Brics is proof of the fact that it is an organisation that has the capacity to change itself according to the times. \"Now, we must demonstrate the same determination to reform institutions like the UN Security Council, the WTO, and multilateral development banks,\" he said. The prime minister also noted that India has always considered it a duty to rise above self interest and work towards the interest of humanity. \"We're fully committed to work along with the Brics countries on all matters, and provide our constructive contributions,\" he said. In his address, Lula said the world is witnessing the unparalleled collapse of multilateralism and that the meeting is taking place in the most adverse global scenario. \"We are fully committed to make constructive contributions on all subjects, along with the Brics countries,\" Modi added.",
