Experts highlight challenges such as its transition to an open market, regulatory hurdles, and lack of full blockchain integration. Unlike established altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano, Pi Coin's market value remains untested, raising concerns about liquidity and usability.Agencies Pi Coin’s investment potential remains uncertain as it faces key challenges in transitioning to an open market and gaining real-world adoption.Pi Coin has sparked considerable interest due to its innovative mobile mining model and strong community support. However, as 2025 draws near, its investment potential remains uncertain when compared to established altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano. Experts point out several challenges Pi Coin faces, such as its transition to an open market, regulatory hurdles, and the need for real-world adoption.Pi Coin’s Market UncertaintyUnlike Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano, which boast established ecosystems and institutional backing, Pi Coin has yet to undergo open-market trading. Thangapandi Durai, CEO of Koinpark, highlights, “One of the key challenges for Pi Coin is its transition from a closed network to an open market. While Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano have proven trading volumes and institutional support, Pi Coin's true market value is still untested.”Sathvik Viswanathan, Co-founder and CEO of Unocoin, further highlights that Pi Coin’s lack of full blockchain integration and absence from exchange listings raises concerns about liquidity and usability. He states, “Until Pi transitions to a fully decentralized and tradable state, its investment viability remains uncertain.”How Pi Coin Compares to Solana, Dogecoin, and CardanoPi Coin’s community-driven mining approach makes it accessible, but experts argue that accessibility alone doesn’t guarantee success. In contrast, other established altcoins offer proven utility:Crypto TrackerSolana is renowned for its high-speed transactions and thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Dogecoin benefits from strong community-driven adoption and potential institutional interest.Cardano focuses on scalability and smart contract development through a research-driven approach.Anish Jain, CEO and Founder of W Chain, says, “Pi Coin remains an untested rival. Solana excels in scalability, Cardano in peer-reviewed innovation, and Dogecoin in cultural momentum. Although Pi is original, its value proposition lacks the track record of these assets.”Regulatory and Market RisksPi Coin’s future is also dependent on regulatory developments and its ability to transition into a fully functional blockchain. Jain cautions, “One of the primary hazards is regulatory scrutiny, particularly if its mining or distribution methods raise compliance issues.”Viswanathan echoes this concern, pointing out that governments are tightening crypto regulations globally, which could affect Pi Coin’s adoption. “Assets lacking clear compliance frameworks may face restrictions. Investors must exercise caution, weighing potential rewards against risks.”Should You Invest in Pi Coin?Pi Coin presents an interesting opportunity, but its success in 2025 will depend on key milestones, such as launching its mainnet and establishing real-world use cases. While experts agree that Pi Coin holds potential, it remains speculative compared to Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano, which have already built robust ecosystems.As Jain concludes, “Pi’s promise should be balanced with its unproven nature. When dealing with high-risk, high-reward assets like Pi Coin, diversification and thorough research remain essential.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, views, and opinions expressed by experts are their own and do not reflect the views of The Economic Times)Read More News on(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.
