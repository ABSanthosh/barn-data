The service will compete directly with Elon Musk's Starlink, which currently dominates the market and has 8,000 satellites in orbit.The first Kuiper mission kicks off what will need to become a steady cadence of launches in order for Amazon to meet a deadline set by the Federal Communications Commission. The agency expects the company to have half of its total constellation, or 1,618 satellites, up in the air by July 2026.Amazon has booked more than 80 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. In addition to ULA, its launch partners include Musk's SpaceX (parent company of Starlink), European company Arianespace and Jeff Bezos' space exploration startup Blue Origin.Amazon is spending as much as $10 billion to build the Kuiper network. It hopes to begin commercial service for consumers, enterprises and government later this year.In his shareholder letter earlier this month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Kuiper will require upfront investment at first, but eventually the company expects it to be \"a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\" ROIC stands for return on invested capital.Investors will be listening for any commentary around further capex spend on Kuiper when Amazon reports first-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.WATCH: Amazon launches Project Kuiper prototypes",
