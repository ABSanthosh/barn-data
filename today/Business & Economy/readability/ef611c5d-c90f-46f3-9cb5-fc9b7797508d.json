RICH BARTON QUOTES FROM THE INTERVIEW “Great organizations encourage innovation, encourage big-idea people to take big swings and do not punish them when it doesn’t work out according to plan.”— Rich Barton “Power to the people, baby. You build magic stuff for masses of consumers that they want to talk about with their friends, unprompted on the sidelines of the soccer game or what have you.”— Rich Barton “[Almost] all of my mistakes as a leader have been leaving the pitcher on the mound too long hoping that the arm would get better.”— Rich Barton “If you’re not happy with the performance of this person, I guarantee you the person isn’t happy either. Therefore, you can increase love in the world by releasing that person to find where that person belongs.”— Rich Barton “I’ve developed a pretty good playbook around what I would call provocation marketing. When you have a really provocative feature that you know people are going to feel emotional about one way or the other and they’re going to talk about it, you’re on to something.”— Rich Barton The Tim Ferriss Show is one of the most popular podcasts in the world with more than one billion downloads.
