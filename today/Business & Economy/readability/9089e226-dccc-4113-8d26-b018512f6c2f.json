  "text": "Financial expert Dave Ramsey does not sugarcoat things – he's very direct about America’s clutter problem. For instance, he recently pointed out that many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, weighed down not just by their financial obligations but by piles of unnecessary possessions filling their garages, attics and storage units “floor to ceiling.” Ramsey claims that one of the main reasons so many people are “broke” is their fixation with purchasing and storing goods. Don't Miss: Many are using this retirement income calculator to check if they’re on pace — here’s a breakdown on how on what’s behind this formula. According to Vanguard’s Advisor’s Alpha Study, working with a financial advisor can result in approximately 3% higher net returns annually, here are the benefits of partnering with a financial advisor and how to find the right one near you in minutes. The argument is straightforward: excessive consumerism is hurting people's financial well-being. Instead of investing in experiences, savings or assets that grow in value, countless Americans are pouring their money into things they don't use. Ramsey describes clutter as wasted money and missed opportunities – both for financial growth and a simpler, more stress-free life. As one of his followers on X said, “I'm proud to say we park our cars in our garage and the attic is empty.” Self-storage facilities have become a booming industry as more people find themselves needing extra space to store excess belongings they can’t fit into their homes. According to Consumer Affairs, the average monthly cost ranges from $90 to $290. While they solve the immediate issue of overflow, they also result in long-term financial burdens. See Also: Studies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do — to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor. If you haven't used an item in over a year, it may be time to sell it. As Ramsey says, “One or two good garage sales and some online sales could clear out the clutter AND get you out of debt.” Selling off unwanted goods can generate money to pay off debt, lower storage expenses and encourage more deliberate spending.",
