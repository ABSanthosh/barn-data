And the high court is likely to have the final say on whether Trump has the power to dismiss the special counsel.CNBC has requested comment from Dellinger and his attorneys.Dellinger, who had a five-year term, was appointed as special counsel in March 2024 by then-President Joe Biden, and later confirmed by the Senate.Trump fired Dellinger by email last month as part of a wide-ranging effort to reduce the number of federal workers.Dellinger's office is responsible for protecting federal employees who act as whistleblowers about illegal or unethical conduct.Dellinger sued the Trump administration in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., over his termination.He argued his dismissal was illegal because of a federal law that says special counsels can only be removed by the president \"for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance of office.\"District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on Feb. 10 issued an order barring Dellinger's removal as the case continued. The Trump administration then appealed to the Court of Appeals, which in a 2-1 ruling declined to overturn Berman's order.The Department of Justice then asked the Supreme Court to rule that Trump had the power to fire Dellinger. But the Supreme Court declined to do so, for now, letting the case wind its way through lower federal courts.Berman then ruled on Saturday that Trump's firing was unlawful.\"The Special Counsel's job is to look into and expose unethical or unlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who disclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering reprisals,\" Jackson wrote in her ruling.\"It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if the Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal,\" Jackson wrote.The DOJ immediately asked the Court of Appeals in an emergency motion to stay Jackson's ruling pending the outcome of its appeal of that decision.In its order Wednesday, the three judges on the appeals court panel said the Trump administration had \"satisfied the stringent requirements for a stay pending appeal.\"\"This order gives effect to the removal of appellee [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\" the order noted.In the weeks since Trump first tried to fire Dellinger, the special counsel had opposed the president's efforts to fire probationary employees across several federal agencies.",
