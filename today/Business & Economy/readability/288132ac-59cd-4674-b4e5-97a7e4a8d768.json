  "text": "Bitcoin's price could get a boost from multiple catalysts in the near term, as it hopes to break past the $110,000 mark. Government debt, as well as money supply, continues to expand at an alarming rate, which bodes well for the price of Bitcoin. Investors interested in Bitcoin must take the time to understand what makes it unique, most notably its fixed supply. 10 stocks we like better than Bitcoin › High Yield Savings Offers Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) rise over the past decade has been amazing to watch. After multiple drawdowns of more than 50% throughout its existence, the digital asset has repeatedly come roaring back to reach fresh highs. And now, it has become a legitimate financial asset, both on Wall Street and in Washington, drastically reducing the likelihood that it becomes irrelevant. Investors who are late to the party might be wondering whether this leading cryptocurrency, whose price has risen 1,030% in the past five years, still has meaningful upside as we look to the future. Should you buy Bitcoin while its price is currently below $110,000 (as of June 22)? Image source: Getty Images. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has been trading primarily within the $100,000 to $110,000 range. After the price soared in the previous month or so (from early April to early May), Bitcoin now appears to be waiting for a breakout to the upside. There are some potential catalysts to keep in mind. The first is the possibility that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. This signals looser and more accommodative monetary policy that incentivizes investors to take on more risk in an effort to earn a better return. Another catalyst is the ongoing bull run that Bitcoin typically experiences in the 12 to 18 months following a halving. The last event happened in April 2024, so we could still see Bitcoin hit a new record high before the end of this year. And of course, macro and geopolitical forces are in focus. Any trade resolution could provide a boost to risk assets such as Bitcoin. What's more, easing tensions in the Middle East could help improve investor confidence. While it's easy for investors to think about short-term price movements, long-term investors understand that it's best to maintain a focus on the next five years and beyond. What matters when considering buying Bitcoin while it's below $110,000 is whether you are bullish on the digital asset far into the future. In my opinion, all signs point to Bitcoin trending in the right direction as a more widely owned financial asset. One key variable to consider is the current monetary system. In particular, the U.S.'s rising debt burden could indirectly propel Bitcoin's price going forward.",
