Say that, as a married couple, you have $1.4 million in your IRAs and, at age 66, expect about $4,100 per month in Social Security. Based on some typical rules of thumb, you might be able to plan on about $108,000 per year of retirement income, but how much you actually need and will be able to take will depend on your specific circumstances. Here’s how to think about it, including a breakdown of the numbers. And if you want someone to double check your own retirement calculations, consider matching with a financial advisor for free. Frequent commenter to this section Kevin Caldwell, Principal with the wealth management firm Golden Road Advisors, refers to retirement planning as an approach in “buckets.” As you prepare for retirement, it’s good to think about your budget in terms of specific parts of life. One way to organize this is: Needs Lifestyle Aspiration Estate Your needs bucket is the money that, at a bare minimum, you need to survive. What is the income that must come in the door each month in order to keep the food warm and the bills paid? Your lifestyle bucket is the money that, realistically, you want in order to live the life you enjoy. This is not money for big, new things. Rather, it’s the money to keep going out to your favorite restaurants and taking your regular trips. Your aspiration bucket is the money that, ideally, lets you add to or expand your lifestyle. This is the money for a new boat, that round-the-world-trip, or retiring at 60. It’s for those big swings. Finally, your estate bucket is the money for anything you intend to leave behind. Whether there are people who will need you, or just something you care about, this is how you plan for it. Thinking about retirement this way can make budgeting more clear. An experienced fiduciary financial advisor can help you build a plan that covers all the bases. If your retirement income won’t meet the needs bucket, then you simply can’t afford to retire, not yet. You will lose the house. If it meets only the needs bucket, then you can technically afford to retire, but you should wait if at all possible. If your retirement income meets your lifestyle bucket, then you should generally be fine. You can probably retire comfortably, provided you’ve got proper risk management in place, including long-term care insurance. The same is true if your retirement income meets the aspirational bucket, in which case good for you.",
