Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.Salesforce said it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales of between $9.90 billion and $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.The company said it expects earnings per share of between $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of $2.65.Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance, expecting a range of $37.8 billion to $38 billion for its fiscal 2025. That's up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the midpoint for Salesforce's fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations of $37.86 billion.\"We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. \"Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.\"In a call with analysts, Benioff boasted about Salesforce's latest artificial intelligence push, including the company's AI-powered chatbots dubbed Agentforce, which investors are closely monitoring for growth. Salesforce's Agentforce product is an example of so-called AI agent technology. Several companies have said they believe that these advanced chatbots represent the next logical step from ChatGPT and other related tools powered by large language models.\"We're delivering these incredible Agentforce capabilities as well,\" Benioff said. \"This is a bold leap in the future of work, where AI agents let humans unite to transform all of our customer interactions.\"Benioff also revealed that he ruptured his achilles tendon on a recent birthday scuba-diving trip to Fakarava, an atoll in French Polynesia. Benioff expressed disappointment that the hospital that treated him couldn't schedule his follow-up appointments using AI agents.\"That is the message to our customers, which is how are you going to give some of your people a break, let them get back to their strategic work, let them focus on what really matters,\" Benioff said.The company in August announced that Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move \"in the right direction\" in regard to improving its profit margin.Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce \"can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.\"Watch: Salesforce has been short-term overbought, says Bespoke's Paul Hickey",
