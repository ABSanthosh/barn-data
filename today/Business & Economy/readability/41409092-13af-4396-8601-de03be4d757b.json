Kathy Hochul called Lander's arrest \"total bulls---\" in a post on X.\"When elected officials are being detained without cause, we have to ask: what the hell is happening to our country?\" Hochul wrote. \"This federal overreach cannot go unchecked.\"Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, wrote on X earlier Tuesday: \"While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE.\"Video of the incident posted online showed Lander outside a courtroom being approached by officers, including some wearing masks.Lander repeatedly asked the officers to show him a judicial warrant before he was handcuffed, according to the video posted by Barnette.The Department of Homeland Security said Lander was arrested for \"assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\"Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they were \"continuing to investigate the actions involving\" Lander. As of 5 p.m. ET, Lander had not been charged with a crime.Lander, a candidate in next week's Democratic primary for New York City mayor, was in court observing immigration case proceedings, which he has done at least two other times, Barnette said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump signals escalation in Israel-Iran conflict as he leaves G7 summit earlyAlleged Minnesota gunman to face first-degree murder chargesTrump Organization announces mobile plan, $499 smartphoneAs G7 leaders meet, allies ask: Is Trump with us or against us?Israel claims 'full aerial superiority' over Tehran's skies as strikes wage onG-7 leaders gather in Canada for summit overshadowed by crisis and tariffsEurope is trying to woo Southeast Asia — but it won't win it over the U.S. or ChinaSuspect Vance Boelter apprehended in Minnesota lawmakers shooting caseThe incident comes days after police handcuffed Sen.
