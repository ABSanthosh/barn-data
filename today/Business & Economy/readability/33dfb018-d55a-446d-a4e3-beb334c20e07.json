In 2024, overseas investors pulled ₹58,280 crore out of the shares in the sector.\"The intensity of foreign selling has come down in BFSI with overseas investors not being negative on the sector, due to ample liquidity infusion by RBI which could improve deposits,\" said Pankaj Pandey, head of retail research at ICICI Direct.Pandey said interest rate cuts could also benefit the sector. The flows into financial services in the second part of March were the strongest biweekly inflow in 15 months. Agencies\"Indian financial stocks were trading at compelling valuations, drawing the attention of value-hunting global investors,\" said Divam Sharma - co-founder and fund manager at Green Portfolio PMS. Live Events\"Add to that rising bets on interest rate cuts, and you've got the perfect setup for a rally in rate-sensitive names like banks and NBFCs.\"With Trump tariffs, US policy shifts, and global volatility back in the mix, the sustainability of these inflows will depend on how India balances its domestic momentum against external shocks, he said.Foreign Investors infused funds worth ₹3,413 crore and ₹2,138 crore in telecommunications and healthcare sectors in the second half of the month, after selling shares in these sectors in the first half.\"The metrics have improved for the telecommunications sector post the tariff hike last year and another hike is expected in the next 12 to 18 months,\" said Pandey.Pandey said while the outlook on hospitals is good, the exportoriented healthcare stocks could see foreign selling due to the uncertainty of tariffs on the pharma sector.
