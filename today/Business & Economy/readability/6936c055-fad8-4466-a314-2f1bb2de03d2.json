At the Tesla robotaxi event, Elon Musk showed off the Cybercab and Robovan and once again sees self driving \"next year.\" But there was no sighting or mention of an \"affordable EV\" expected in early 2025. Tesla stock fell in Robinhood trading overnight. The robotaxi could have huge implications for Tesla (TSLA) ↑ X NOW PLAYING Indexes Dip, Small Caps Lag After Inflation Data: DVA, ALNY, UTHR In Focus The stock market fell slightly Thursday amid talk of a Fed rate-cut \"pause.\" Nvidia (NVDA) resumed its strong run, with several tech plays making bullish moves. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) kicks off bank earnings Friday morning. Dow Jones Futures Today Dow Jones futures were even with fair value. S\u0026P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.06%. Crude oil futures fell slightly. Overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session. Join IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live Tesla Robotaxi Event The Tesla robotaxi event livestream began at 10 p.m. ET, with the actual presentation starting at 10:53 p.m. Elon Musk rode the two-seat Cybercab with butterfly doors. Musk expects the cost to buy a Cybercab will be below $30,000 for a robotaxi. He expects \"fully autonomous unsupervised FSD in California and Texas next year — that's with the Model 3 and Model Y.\" Musk expects production of the cybercab probably in 2026 — \"before 2027.\" \"I tend to be a little optimistic with time frames,\" Musk admitted. Musk has said for years that Tesla would achieve self-driving \"this year\" or \"next year.\" Musk didn't offer details about business models, such as a ride-hailing service. There has been some speculation that Tesla would launch a ride-hailing service with human drivers. Musk also didn't offer new evidence that Tesla FSD was making progress toward actual self-driving. He also showed off a large Robovan, but with no timing on when that will go into production. Tesla did not show or even mention an \"affordable\" vehicle. It's supposed to enter production by mid-2025, but there have been no images of that, let alone a prototype. Tesla is pushing hard to boost sales and FSD take rates in Q4. On Thursday, Tesla will again let owners transfer FSD to a new Model 3, Y, S or X through Dec. 31. That comes on the heels of 0% financing for Model 3 and Y buys that include buying FSD. Tesla Stock Tumbles The Tesla robotaxi event started well after after-hours trading wrapped. But TSLA stock is trading on the Robinhood app. Tesla stock, up 3% or more at one point during the robotaxi presentation, reversed lower as that ended. Shares are down 3%. Take all of that with a grain of salt. Be ready for big Tesla stock swings Friday as analysts and investors digest the robotaxi unveilings. Shares fell nearly 1% to 238.77 in Thursday's session after dropping to 232.34 intraday. The EV giant has a 264.86 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSurge. The 250 area offers an early entry. Market perceptions of a Tesla robotaxi could have an impact on ride-hailing giants Uber Technologies (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT). Stock Market Rally CPI inflation came in hot and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic raised the possibility of a November rate-cut \"pause.\" But the major stock indexes barely dipped. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% in Thursday's stock market trading. The S\u0026P 500 index slipped 0.2% after hitting a record high Wednesday. The Nasdaq lost a fraction. The small-cap Russell 2000 declined 0.55%, but rebounded off its 50-day. Many leading stocks made bullish moves, including AI play Samsara (IOT) and cybersecurity stocks Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT). Meanwhile, some techs are racing up from the bottom, including AI IPO Astera Labs (ALAB), Cloudflare (NET) and Datadog (DDOG). ADMA Biologics (ADMA) dived 16%, knifing through its 50-day line. The big 2024 winner announced that its auditor is resigning. Insurers, including Brown \u0026 Brown (BRO), reversed lower Thursday. They've had some swings this week due to Hurricane Milton. U.S. crude oil prices popped 3.6% to $75.85 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed three basis points to 4.09%, continuing a big run. Nvidia stock is on IBD Leaderboard and SwingTrader. Samsara stock, Fortinet and Nvidia are on the IBD 50. Samsara was Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day. ETFs Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 1.3%, hit by ADMA stock. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) climbed 0.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dipped 0.2%, even with Nvidia stock the dominant holding. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) retreated 1%. Tesla stock remains a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Cathie Wood also owns a lot of Nvidia. Tesla Robotaxi Event: Live Coverage Nvidia AI Chips Sold Out Nvidia stock rose 1.6% to 134.81, still in buy range from various entries, including the Aug. 26 high of 131.26. Since testing its 50-day line on Oct. 1, NVDA stock has jumped 15.2%. Nvidia executives told Morgan Stanley analysts that production of Blackwell artificial intelligence processors is in full swing, with the next-generation AI chips sold out for the next 12 months. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Thursday unveiled its upcoming Blackwell rival, with Instinct MI325X production starting by year-end. CEO Lisa Su predicted a $500 billion market for AI accelerators by 2028. AMD stock, which has lagged Nvidia and many other AI chip names, fell 4% Thursday. What To Do Now The stock market rally continues to act well. You can keep making incremental buys. If you already have heavy exposure, you might offset new buys by trimming or exiting relative laggards. But if you've built up your portfolio and those stocks are working, let those positions work for the most part. Keep updating your watchlists, reviewing your holdings and staying engaged.
