Experts believe that rate-sensitive sectors—such as private banks, real estate, automobiles, metals, and select index heavyweights—could lead the market gains this week. Investors are advised to adopt a ‘buy on dips’ approach.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsJATIN GEDIA TECHNICAL RESEARCH ANALYST, MIRAE ASSET SHAREKHANWhere is Nifty Headed This Week? Nifty is on the verge of a breakout after a threeweek consolidation in the 24,460 – 25,100 range. The consolidation has taken the form of a Symmetrical Triangle pattern, which indicates a trend continuation pattern. The underlying trend for the Nifty is bullish, and the next leg of the up-move is likely to take the Index towards 25,307. The rally has the potential to stretch towards 25,655 levels, which is the pattern breakout target. The support base shifts upwards towards 24,670 – 24,600. Trading Strategies for the WeekTraders should continue to hold their bullish bets with a trailing stop loss at 24,800 (20-DMA). We expect Auto, Private Banks, Metals, Infra, and Pharma sectors to outperform in the coming sessions. Stock-specific bullish setups are evident in Hero MotoCorp, M\u0026M, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Hindalco, JSW Steel, Titan, Trent, Tata Power, Power Finance Corp, Cipla, and Dr. Reddy’s. On the other hand, stocks in the Defence, Railway, Fertiliser, and Capital Markets space may take a backseat going forward.Tired of too many ads? Remove AdsSAMEET CHAVAN HEAD RESEARCH - TECHNICAL AND DERIVATIVES, ANGEL ONEWhere is Nifty Headed This Week? All eyes are on Nifty, which has been struggling around the 25,100–25,200 zone. The coming week is likely to see some positive moves in the benchmark index, potentially clearing the path toward a new all-time high. As for immediate levels, 25,300– 25,500 should be seen as the potential upside zone for the week. On the downside, 24,800 followed by 24,500 are expected to act as strong support levels for the index. Trading Strategies for the Week We recommend adopting a ‘Buy on Dips’ strategy at this moment. Additionally, it is important to concentrate on thematic movers. As far as stock ideas are concerned, we like Oberoi Realty from the realty basket. The stock prices have convincingly traversed through the 200-DSMA after a long time with huge volumes. We recommend buying on a decline towards Rs 1,895–1,880 for a target of Rs 1,801 with stop loss at Rs 2,045.Trent, although it’s yet to give any impressive price action, we can sense a potential breakout in this stock. Prices have closed above recent swing high, and with RSI pointing upwards, we recommend buying for a target of Rs 6,200. A strict stop loss can be placed at Rs 5,480.DHUPESH DHAMEJA DERIVATIVE ANALYST, SAMCOWhere is Nifty Headed This Week? Nifty made a long-awaited breakout above its critical resistance zone, and is reigniting bullish sentiment. On the derivatives front, aggressive put writing at near-the-money strikes and repositioning of call writers to higher levels reflect growing confidence among bulls. The Put-Call Ratio has risen to 0.97, indicating unwinding of bearish positions and strengthening of positive sentiment. The 25,000 strike now serves as a firm support base, while 25,500 emerges as a key resistance. A decisive move above 25,100 could trigger fresh momentum, potentially driving the index toward the 25,300– 25,350 zone.Trading Strategies for the WeekTired of too many ads?
