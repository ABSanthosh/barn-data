  "text": "Advanced voice controls may be the future of many different industries, from home electronics and in-car systems to call centers and healthcare. Leading technology developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) clearly has a bright future ahead of it. At the same time, SoundHound AI has been a meme stock recently. The stock price is inflated by a small group of enthusiastic investors, organized in social media channels and hoping to unlock profits from a huge short squeeze. As much as I love SoundHound AI's long-term business prospects, the stock is incredibly overvalued right now, and I won't be a buyer until that situation is corrected. Game-changing business news could do the trick, as could a sharp price correction. Until further notice, I'd take this stock seriously again at mid-single-digit prices, down from $15.60 per share on Jan. 21. So you certainly shouldn't forget about SoundHound AI, but please put this stock on your back burner for a while. If you're looking for an undervalued growth stock that should deliver big gains from a more appealing starting price, you should consider this pair of top-notch tech stocks. Let's start with a SoundHound AI partner. Toast (NYSE: TOST) provides cloud-based software that helps restaurant managers run their business. This integrated system replaces a patchwork of separate solutions, where every part of the Toast platform is available to the other functions. For example, soaring sales of hot chocolate with marshmallows plus low cocoa mix inventories can result in timely ingredient orders, successful marketing ideas, and the right staff schedule to support this unexpected surge. Toast's platform takes the guesswork out of complex situations. Sure, you could do the same job with more traditional tools. But you'd end up with one service provider for payroll and scheduling, another managing credit card payments, a third to run your marketing programs, and a paper notebook for tracking inventories. Toast does it all, whether you're running a single location or a nationwide chain. Toast isn't everywhere quite yet. The company runs a tightly focused expansion campaign, focusing its resources on specific target markets until it has built a helpful buzz of positive word-of-mouth momentum. If you build a great service, happy customers will come, and then the growth momentum will keep going when Toast moves its focus to the next metro area. Also, the company appeals to small and medium-sized businesses by offering credit card readers, order-taking tablets, and other hardware at cost. A low price of installation helps clients with modest management budgets try this new system out.",
