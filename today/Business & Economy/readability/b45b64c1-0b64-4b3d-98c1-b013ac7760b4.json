The paper and packaging board maker's consolidated net profit tumbled 73 per cent year-on-year to Rs 65.39 crore ($7.6 million) for the quarter ended Dec 31. Indian paper makers have grappled with cheaper imports and elevated prices of wood - a key raw material - over the past few quarters. Additionally, these companies have been forced to sell their products at lower prices as demand remains subdued following a post-pandemic surge. JK Paper's net revenue from operations fell 4.4 per cent to Rs 1,632 crore during the quarter while total expenses rose 5 per cent, led by an 18 per cent jump in raw material costs. Peer West Coast Paper Mills' quarterly profit more than halved, hurt by higher costs and cheaper imports.
