  "text": "The debate over highly skilled immigrant workers is heating up. A contentious exchange over immigration that began during Christmas between conservative activist Laura Loomer and Elon Musk has spilled over from X, now with a prominent Democrat weighing in. The focus, though, has turned away from undocumented workers, a central theme in Donald Trump's presidential campaign last year, to those here legally on H-1B visas. Critics of the immigration program worry that these workers are displacing Americans by providing cheaper labor, especially in the tech industry, which is the largest sponsor of these visas. Supporters say there are simply not enough US workers to fill the demand needed in these growing industries and the program's rules prevent wage suppression. \"This program should not and was not intended to substitute the American talent. It was designed to supplement it and, by and large, it has been working,\" Jeanne Batalova, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told Yahoo Finance. But she noted that some companies have used the program in a way that's \"not within the spirit of the law,\" which is part of what is fueling the current debate. Here's what to know.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Created in 1990 by the Immigration Act, the H-1B is a temporary, nonimmigrant visa program that allows companies to request permission to hire very skilled foreign workers with at least a bachelor's degree or equivalent. (Fashion models \"of distinguished merit and ability\" also fall under this visa category but without the education requirements, according to the US Department of Labor.) If granted the visa, a foreign worker can initially stay in the US under the H-1B for three years, with a possible extension to six years. But some workers stay on H-1B visas for longer than that if they have an approved petition for a green card. \"We limit the number of people from any given country that can get a green card in a given year, so you can stay in H-1B status while you're waiting to make the country's quota,\" Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, said. Since the H-1B status was created, Congress has limited the number of new H-1B visas available each year. Currently, the annual cap is 65,000 new H-1B visas and an additional 20,000 for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or higher from a US university. That hasn't changed since 2006. The biggest industry by far using H1-B visas is what's categorized as professional, scientific, and technical services, which made up almost half of all approved initial visas in fiscal year 2024. Following that were educational services at 11.9% of all approvals, manufacturing at 9.3%, and healthcare and social assistance at 6.5%.",
