Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Gold (GC=F) futures opened at $3,409 per ounce Wednesday, up 0.7% from Tuesday's close of $3,386.60. The price of gold has opened above $3,400 three times this month but has stopped short of beating its all-time high of $3,485.60, set in April. Economic and geopolitical factors favor ongoing gold demand. Conflict in the Middle East, plus President Donald Trump's changing tariff demands, create uncertain outlooks for oil prices, inflation, and the overall health of the U.S. economy. While stock prices are still up for the year, investors may react to the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections, to be released Wednesday. Any sign the Fed expects rates to remain high this year could trigger lower stock prices. Gold demand, and thus gold prices, typically rise when investors are pessimistic about stocks. The opening price of gold futures on Wednesday is up 0.7% from Tuesday's close of $3,386.60 per ounce. Wednesday's opening price marks a gain of 2.4% over the past week, compared to the opening price of $3,328 on June 11. In the past month, the gold futures price has risen 5.6% compared to the opening price of $3,227.70 on May 16. In the past year, gold is up 47.5% from the opening price of $2,311.80 on June 18, 2024. 24/7 gold price tracking: Don't forget you can monitor the current price of gold on Yahoo Finance 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

You can create your own screeners with over 150 different screening criteria. As we’ve been saying all week, investing in gold is a four-step process, and today, we’ll explore step 3, choosing a form. Once you define your target gold allocation, you must choose a form of gold to hold. Your three options are: Physical gold Gold mining stocks Gold ETFs Physical gold pros and cons Physical gold includes jewelry, gold bars, and gold coins. The advantages of physical gold include: Readily accessible for use. If you keep your physical gold at home, it is easily available for you to use as a medium of exchange in an economic emergency. No added volatility or ongoing fees. Gold mining stocks tend to rise and fall with gold prices, and business-related factors enhance their volatility. Gold ETFs charge administrative fees in the form of expense ratios. Learn more: Take a deeper dive into the gold sector The disadvantages of physical gold include: Risk of theft or loss. Physical gold must be properly secured. Whether you store it in your home or with a depository, gold can be stolen. Lower liquidity. Physical gold is less liquid than stocks or ETFs. If you are not using the gold as a medium of exchange, you may need to locate a dealer and pay a markup on the sale. Gold mining stocks pros and cons Owning shares in gold mining stocks provides indirect gold exposure. The advantages of mining stocks over physical gold include: Greater liquidity. Large-cap gold mining stocks like Barrick Gold Corporation (GOLD) and Franco-Nevada Corporation (FNV) generally enjoy a narrow bid-ask spread, which is a sign of liquidity. The bid-ask spread is the difference between what buyers will pay and what sellers will accept. Easy to store. Stocks live in your brokerage account and do not consume physical space. In normal times, this is an advantage. In an economic catastrophe, this could be a disadvantage if brokers or the stock market are temporarily shut down. Learn more: The top performing companies in the gold industry The disadvantages of owning gold mining stocks include: Greater volatility. Since 2000, gold mining stocks have risen and fallen faster than gold spot prices. And in recent years, gold mining stocks have trended down even as gold has gained value. No utility as a medium of exchange. Gold mining stocks can appreciate, but they have no direct utility as a medium of exchange. Gold ETFs pros and cons Gold ETFs are funds that invest in gold mining stocks or physical gold. Their advantages include: Easy to store. Like gold mining stocks, ETF shares are essentially digital assets with no storage requirements. Greater liquidity. Shares of the most popular gold ETFs, like SPDR Gold Shares ($GLD), are heavily traded which implies good liquidity. Tied directly to gold prices. ETFs backed by physical gold can be less volatile than gold mining stocks or gold mining ETFs. The disadvantages of gold ETFs include: Fund fees. Funds charge fees, which dilute returns over time. For context, the expense ratio of SPDR Gold Shares is 0.40%. This translates to $4 in fees annually for every $1,000 invested. No utility as a medium of exchange. As with gold mining stocks, you probably cannot use ETF shares to trade for food in an economic emergency. How to invest in gold in 4 steps What to know before buying gold, silver, or platinum from Costco How to start investing: A 6-step guide Create a stock investing strategy in 3 steps Trump's tariffs: What they mean for the economy and your wallet Whether you’re tracking the price of gold since last month or last year, the price-of-gold chart below shows the precious metal’s steady upward climb in value. Historically, gold has shown extended up cycles and down cycles. The precious metal was in a growth phase from 2009 to 2011. It then trended down, failing to set a new high for nine years. In those lackluster years for gold, your position will negatively impact your overall investment returns. If that feels problematic, a lower allocation percentage is more appropriate. On the other hand, you may be willing to accept gold's underperforming years so you can benefit more in the good years. In this case, you can target a higher percentage. The precious metal has been in the news lately, and many analysts are bullish on gold. In May, Goldman Sachs Research predicted gold would reach $3,700 a troy ounce by year-end 2025. That would equate to a 40% increase for the year, based on gold’s January 2 opening price of $2,633. Rising demand from central banks, along with uncertainty related to changing U.S. tariff policy, are the factors driving the increase.
