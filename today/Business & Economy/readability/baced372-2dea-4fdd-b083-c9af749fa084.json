The cross-border conflict has intensified since the summer, with Israel carrying out airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in late September, then proceeding with a ground invasion Oct. 1.Hostilities had continued Tuesday amid the diplomatic overtures, with Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee announcing in a social media post, translated by Google, that Israel was \"extensively\" attacking Hezbollah targets in Beirut.

Israel and Hamas honored a roughly weeklong truce in November 2023.",
