  "text": "In This Article: Quantum computers may be necessary for future breakthroughs in artificial intelligence technology. Rigetti Computing and D-Wave Quantum are at the forefront of developing commercial quantum systems. Despite a pricey valuation, one of these industry leaders benefits from a stronger growth outlook, making it a better quantum AI stock. 10 stocks we like better than D-Wave Quantum › Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the global economy, driving automation, productivity, and creativity. Quantum computers may hold the key to unlocking the next generation of AI technology to tackle highly complex challenges and analyze massive datasets far beyond the reach of classical computers. Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) are two emerging leaders in the field, well-positioned to capitalize on a significant market opportunity. Shares of both companies have soared, and there are plenty of reasons to believe the rally can keep going. Let's explore which one of these quantum computing AI stocks is the better choice for your portfolio right now. Image source: Getty Images. Quantum computers harness qubits, the fundamental units of information, which exploit quantum physics principles, like superposition and entanglement, to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This enables quantum computers to process calculations in parallel, far surpassing the capabilities of traditional binary-based computers. While the technology is still being refined due to the enduring trade-off between qubit power and system stability, Rigetti Computing's superconducting gate-based technology is delivering an expanding number of real-world use cases. The company's 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system, launched in first-quarter 2025, marks an industry milestone that could transform machine learning, optimization, simulations, cryptography, and AI. Optimism has powered Rigetti's stock to a spectacular 937% return over the past year as of this writing. An advantage to Rigetti's approach is its modular design, with the flexibility to combine multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) to scale performance. Compared to D-Wave Quantum, which specializes in a separate quantum annealing approach to leverage qubits, Rigetti's gate-based superconducting architecture may be more versatile and future-proof, particularly for AI applications. Despite recurring financial losses and limited sales with first-quarter revenue of just $1.5 million for the period ended March 31, the Ankaa-3 system is expected to capture a wave of demand going forward. Wall Street estimates project Rigetti's revenue to accelerate from $8.8 million in 2025 to $23 million in 2026. Industry forecasts estimate that the quantum computing market could grow to $90 billion to $170 billion by 2040, highlighting a significant growth runway for Rigetti.",
