Canara Bank, Federal Bank and Bank of Baroda rose 2-4%.ANI\"Tier two level banks, particularly PSU banks, could outperform in the near term.Mumbai: Traders loaded up shares of banks and property developers on Wednesday in a tepid market in anticipation of a cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio - the percentage of a bank's total deposits required to maintain in cash with the RBI - in the central bank's three-day Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on Friday. Analysts favour banks over real estate companies because of cheaper valuations.The Nifty Realty Index and Bank Nifty surged 2.1% and 1.1%, respectively; while the benchmark Nifty ended marginally higher on Wednesday. The Nifty PSU Bank index gained 2.3% and the Nifty Private Bank index inched 0.86% higher. Canara Bank, Federal Bank and Bank of Baroda rose 2-4%.While the central bank is unlikely to cut the Repo rate in the rate-setting meeting, market participants are betting on a cut in CRR in the wake of the lower-than-estimated GDP growth reading of 5.4% in the second quarter, reviving concerns of a slowdown, said analysts.\"The first step in that direction is anticipated to be a cut in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) this time,\" said Pankaj Pandey, head of research, ICICI Securities. A reduction of CRR will free up capital with banks, which could be used to lend.Agencies\"This is likely to benefit rate sensitive sectors like realty, banks and infrastructure,\" said Pandey. \"The risk-reward ratio is attractive for banks, and one should be selective in the realty space given these stocks have already witnessed good price performance in the recent past.\"So far this year, Nifty Realty index has rallied 36.9% against an up-move of 12.5% in benchmark Nifty. Bank Nifty has gained 10.30% in the same period.Analysts said that banks are trading closer to their historical valuations, while realty stocks are trading at a premium.\"Most banks are trading at multi-year low valuations, and the risk reward ratio is favourable for investors in these stocks,\" said Krishna Appala, senior research analyst at Capitalmind. \"While realty is fully valued, the growth rate of 25% to 30% is driving investor interest in the realty sector.\"The rise in outstanding positions in Bank Nifty futures along with an advance in the index on Wednesday suggest build up of bullish bets, said Jay Vora, senior market analyst, indiacharts.com.In last one month, Nifty Realty and Bank Nifty indices gained 10% and 4%, respectively, while benchmark Nifty moved 2% higher.\"The upswing in banking stocks is expected to continue as financials and valuations offer comfort,\" said Appala. \"Realty stocks could inch higher as long as the growth sustains and justifies the premium valuations.\"Appala said that investors can have a 'Buy on Dips' approach in realty sector with a preference for larger players that offer better growth visibility.\"Banks could see a muted price performance in the next few quarters as uncertainty looms over trend reversal in foreign institutional selling,\" said Pandey. \"Tier two level banks, particularly PSU banks, could outperform in the near term.
