Investors are on high alert for key details on AI monetization. Meta will report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell. Investors will be watching for key details on AI monetization. They'll also be looking for any commentary around the sudden rise of DeepSeek, whose AI models roiled the tech industry this week, wiping out more than $1 trillion of market value. Meta's earnings-release time is shortly after 4 p.m. ET, and its conference call with analysts will start around 5 p.m. Meta's stock was up 15% year-to-date through Tuesday's close, outpacing the S\u0026P 500's 3% gain. CFRA Research: Increased focus on AI Meta has said it plans more than $60 billion in capital expenditures this year.Meta Meta likely announced its plan for $60 billion of capex this year to emphasize its focus on artificial intelligence, CFRA Research said. \"We think it makes sense for META to get the news out of the way before earnings on Jan. 29 and note the increased focus on AI will likely translate to higher revenue potential over time,\" Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA, wrote. The firm reiterated its \"Buy\" rating on the stock. Jefferies: Meta is a 'Top AI pick' Meta appears to have strong growth momentum, Jefferies said in a note. Analysts estimated that Meta's revenue will come in around $46.5 billion over the fourth quarter, while first-quarter revenue guidance will be around $41.8 billion. \"Overall, we continue to be encouraged by META's ability to sustain DD rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency and ramping of incremental monetization formats (e.g. WhatsApp \u0026 Llama).\" The firm reiterated its \"Buy\" rating on the stock and issued a price target of $715, implying 5% upside from current levels. Truist Securities: 'Key beneficiary of TikTok's mishaps' Some of Meta's platforms, like Threads, could benefit from any disruption to TikTok in the US, according to Truist.Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images Meta will likely be a key beneficiary of TikTok's challenges in the US, Truist Securities said in a note. According to Sensor Tower, a social media analytics site, Threads saw a significant uptick in user time over the fourth quarter, likely due to the risk of TikTok being shut down, Truist said. \"We view META as a key beneficiary of TikTok's mishaps and as one of our 2025 favorites,\" Youssef Squali, a managing director at the firm, wrote in a note. Truist reiterated its \"Buy\" rating on the stock and price target of $700, implying 3% upside from current levels.",
