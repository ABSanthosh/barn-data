Sun's India business grew higher than the Indian Pharma market growth. The company launched 14 new products during the quarter.AgenciesThe Sun Pharma stock has gained 70% in the past one year - significantly outperforming the benchmark index as well as the sectoral pharma index.ET Intelligence Group: Sun Pharma, India's biggest drugmaker, did not disappoint its investors in the September quarter. Revenues grew 10.5% and net profit rose 28%.The ebitda margin improved 310 bps to 29.6% - in line with the raw material cost dropping 3.3% over the year ago level.Little wonder then that the Sun Pharma stock closed 2.2% higher following the results announcement.The India business, accounting for a third of the company's total revenues, grew at 11%. This is a volume-led growth aided by new product launches. Sun's India business grew higher than the Indian Pharma market growth. The company launched 14 new products during the quarter.AgenciesCompany's US business - constituting a third of the total revenues - has grown 22% driven by the promising growth being charted by its specialty business. The underlying performance of Sun's specialty portfolio remains strong, and the company is aggressive in growing this business. For instance, Sun Pharma recently entered into an agreement with Philogen for commercializing late-stage candidate Fibromun, upon approval. The company is going to leverage its strong cash position to strengthen its pipeline with products that are close to market.While the emerging markets revenues grew 4.6%, the rest of the world sales dipped over 2% due to price cuts in the Japanese markets.Sun Pharma spent ₹792 crore towards R\u0026D during the quarter - 38% of this was towards specialty drug portfolio. The R\u0026D spend for the quarter stood at 6% of the sales - lower than the company's historical spending in the recent years. However, it is an exception as for the full year FY25, the company has guided the R\u0026D spend to be in the range of 7-8% of sales.The Sun Pharma stock has gained 70% in the past one year - significantly outperforming the benchmark index as well as the sectoral pharma index.The company's strong September quarter performance comes on back of its market leadership in the domestic market as well as gains made by its global specialty business - a calculated bet that turned out right.As Sun Pharma is transforming from being a generic drug major to specialty drug major, investors need to brace themselves for the company incurring higher expenses towards ramping up its specialty business as well as towards R\u0026D. Right now, Sun's efforts to build its specialty business is the most exciting aspect to watch out for.
