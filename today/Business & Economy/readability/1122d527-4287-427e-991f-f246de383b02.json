SEALSQ currently intends to utilize the net proceeds from the Offering to fund the deployment of its next-generation post-quantum semiconductor technology and ASIC capabilities in the United States, to support working capital and for general corporate purposes. The Offering is expected to close on or about December 16, 2024 (the Closing Date), subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-283358) previously filed with and subsequently declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 27, 2024. A prospectus supplement relating to the securities to be issued in the Offering will be filed by the Company with the SEC.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. About SEALSQ: SEALSQ focuses on selling integrated solutions based on Semiconductors, PKI and Provisioning services, while developing Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products. Our solutions can be used in a variety of applications, from Multi-Factor Authentication tokens, Smart Energy, Smart Home Appliances, Medical (TASE:) and Healthcare and IT Network Infrastructure, to Automotive, Industrial Automation and Control Systems. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) refers to cryptographic methods that are secure against an attack by a quantum computer. As quantum computers become more powerful, they may be able to break many of the cryptographic methods that are currently used to protect sensitive information, such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
