A decisive breakout could push Nifty toward 24,000, while a drop below 23,280 may trigger panic.iStockBudget day volatility kept markets on edge. Analysts suggest buying near 23,300 support while watching for a potential breakout above 23,600 toward 24,000.After showing a sustainable upmove in the last four sessions, Nifty 50 witnessed high volatility during a special trading session on Saturday, on Budget day, and closed the day lower by 26 points. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadows. Technically, this pattern indicates a high wave type candle pattern which denotes high volatility in the market. The 200-day EMA has acted as a strong hurdle for the market at 23620 levels and that resulted in selling pressure from the highs.On the weekly chart, a long bull candle, that has engulfed the previous two weeks' candle formation, was formed. This bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart signals a possible formation of a near-term bottom reversal in the Nifty at the low of 22,786 levels. The underlying trend of Nifty remains positive and the market is facing stiff resistance around 23,500-23,600 levels. A decisive move above this hurdle could open further upside towards 24,000 levels in the near term. Immediate support is placed at 23,300 levels, said Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC Securities.In the open interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side was observed at 23,500 and 23,600 strike prices, while on the put side, the highest OI was at 23,300 strike price followed by 23,500.What should traders do? Here’s what analysts said:Jatin Gedia, Mirae Asset SharekhanOn the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has been rising steadily since the last five sessions. Despite all the volatility the Nifty has held on to the crucial support zone 23,300 – 23,250. The Hourly momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal and can lead to some consolidation before resuming upmove and hence dips towards 23,300 – 23,250 should be considered as a buying opportunity. On the upside, the immediate hurdle is placed at 23,620 (200EMA) and above that it can rise towards the psychological level of 24,000.Rupak De, LKP SecuritiesThe Nifty has witnessed a roller-coaster ride during the Budget session. On the daily chart, a small-bodied candle has formed, indicating indecision. Nifty has support at 23,280, and as long as it remains above this level, the trend might stay positive. On the higher end, the index could move towards 23,700–24,000 in the short term. However, a fall below 23,280 might trigger panic in the market.Satish Chandra Aluri, Lemonn Markets DeskBenchmark indices closed marginally lower in a volatile trade as lower capex spends outweighed the tax relief for middle class in highly anticipated budget. Markets gave up the morning gains as budget speech progressed while staging a sharp rebound around tax relief announcements before resuming the fall and eventually closing marginally lower. Technically, Nifty 50 needs to clear the resistance around 23,650 for renewed upside towards 24,000 while on the downside, 23,300 can act as immediate support.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
