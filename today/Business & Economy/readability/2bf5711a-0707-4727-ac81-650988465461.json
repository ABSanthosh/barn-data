Musk will attend the speech as a special guest, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. Both political parties have traditionally used their guest lists for this annual speech to highlight their policy priorities and draw attention to specific issues.Democrats' guests on Tuesday will include a number of military veterans and others who were fired in the ongoing reduction of federal jobs that is being overseen by Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.Democrats also have invited people who could be affected by Republican cuts to Medicaid or other government programs.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump could scale back Canada, Mexico tariffs Wednesday, Lutnick saysTrump tariffs showcase extraordinary presidential power — and its limitationsEU chief proposes plan to hike defense spending by mobilizing around $840 billionTrump pauses all U.S. military aid to Ukraine after angry clash with ZelenskyyThe last time Trump addressed a joint session of Congress was Feb. 4, 2020, when he delivered the final State of the Union address of his first term in office.
