    "description": "Snake Plotzkin Reviews THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF CHRISTOPHER LEE Read the full article on AICN Snake Plotzkin, reporting from Fantastic Fest 2024, where I got to see the biographical documentary, The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee. Iâm a big fan of Hammer horror, and I will watch literally any Hammer film with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing in it. One of my favorite Hammer films is Rasputin the Mad Monk, which, if you havenât seen it, is one of Leeâs best performances. The gigantically tall Lee stalks around St. Peterburg as the mad monk, hypnotizing women, seducing them, and then yelling at them to get out of his room and leave their money on the bed. Itâs amazing.Â  If The Life and Deaths of Christopher LeeÂ had been made up completely of anecdotes about Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing on the Hammer films, I would honestly have been very satisfied with it. But the movie unexpectedly goes much further, revealing not just another side of the actor, but multiple facets. For instance, did you know that Christopher Lee fought Nazis? That he may have been the inspiration for James Bond (which was written by his cousin)? That he released two heavy metal albums? Well, this movie goes where no marionette-narrated biopic has gone before, using a mix of interviews, animation, and puppetry to bring Christopher Lee to life (the man himself passed away in 2015). Yes, I said puppetry. The movie is narrated by a marionette of Christopher Lee â who, in an uncanny imitation of Leeâs sonorous voice (played by Peter Szymon Serafinowicz, an English actor Finish the article on AICN",

Barbarella here.Â Strange Harvest: The Occult Murder in the Inland EmpireÂ is a long title for a great narrative utilizing the true-crime documentary format. The format proves so effective at tricking my brain into thinking Iâm watching actual footage of crime scenes and caught-on-tape moments that I had to occasionally remind myself to relax, itâs only a movie.Â  It made its world premiere at Fantastic Fest 2024 on September 22, 2024 at 11:50 p.m. CT, andÂ I had the delightful opportunity to sit down with genre director Stuart Ortiz, and actors Peter Zisso and Terri Apple in Austin last week. Check it out! Barbara:Â I'm one of these people that I can watch the most gruesome stuff in movies, and it doesn't bother me, heads getting drilled and stuff. Peter:Â Bless You.Â  Barbara:Â But it really upsets me to see people getting hurt, even these skateboarding videos and such, and this movie messed with my brain because I knew itâs fictional, but my brain got tricked into thinking it was real at times because the way it was done. I'm very impressed with the effectiveness of that.Â  Stuart:Â Thank you.Â Â  Barbara:Â Why do this in a true crime format? What were you going for?Â  Stuart:Â I just think it's a really interesting way to tell a story, and in particular to tell a horror story because it just allows you to have this vantage point that you don't normally have with horror, to investigate certain details or aspects of a horror story that you wouldn't focus on necessarily in a more conventional story.

    "description": "Kevin Smith Talks to McEric about THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Kevin Smithâs THE 4:30 MOVIE is coming home today, available on digital through all major retailers. The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. Itâs a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.Â  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the filmâs digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how heâs remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interviewâs start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.Â  Â  Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin! Â  Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric!

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isnât so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.Â  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.Â  Â  What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what theyâll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs thatâll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

    "description": "Barbarella Talks AI With SUBSERVIENCE Director S.K. Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi filmÂ Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele MorroneÂ Â (his nameâs Italian so the âchâ is pronounced like a âkâ), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so letâs talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think itâs not the AI itself but whoeverâs behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because letâs face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguireâs screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe donât say certain things to a Sim thatâs constantly evolving and learning; thatâs all Iâm saying. If it werenât for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.Â  Â  I appreciate that the conflict inÂ SubservienceÂ primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isnât the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) canât keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know thatâs not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema. Flash forward to today and he owns that theater, rebranded as the Smodcastle, where he showcases new releases, repertory classics, film festivals, and even special screenings of âMovies With Kev,â where he screens a classic and participates in a Q\u0026A following the screening. Â  Finally the formative experiences of young Kev are getting their own film treatment, with Kevin Smithâs newest release, THE 4:30 MOVIE, premiering tomorrow in cinemas around the country. The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

A new Western,Â Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the directorâs chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area. Â Â  Iâve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones inÂ Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that Iâm fairly certain werenât intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him thatâs just funny. However, heâs not the only one who offers something more than just delivering whatâs written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges. Â  I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes.

Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this yearâs Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.Â  Its logline says of the film: âA group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.â The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome. Â  Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldnât help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffithâs final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchumâs Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.Â  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection: Â  âWith his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scottâs expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy.

In fact, I had quite a fever when I screenedÂ Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I donât know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I donât think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.Â  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing aboutÂ Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. âYeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.â Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories?

I was married for seven years, and the very first night I went out after the divorce â which was quite a long time after the divorce â I met my second husband, so I haven't really done much dating.

The psychological thrillerÂ The Image of YouÂ examines duality in the form of twins, Zoe and Anna, who although they look identical, couldnât be further apart. When sweet and naÃ¯ve Anna meets a man and falls in love quickly, her bad-girl twin Zoe aims to test the strength of the relationship and the caliber of man who has captured her sisterâs heart. The movie will be in select theaters and on Digital Friday, May 10.Â  I had an opportunity to speak with director Jeff Fisher about directing dual roles. Check it out! Â  I want to start with kind of a crazy icebreaker question, but what is the weirdest or craziest experience you've had dating, that you're willing to share? âOh, my God. The weirdest or craziest experience I've had dating. This is not going to paint me in a very good light.Â I will tell you, my last long-term relationship, we met at a bar. I don't know if this was dating. We made out in the back of the bar for three and a half hours, on our first meeting, so it was an egregious public display of affection, and just shameless. I guess that would be my weirdest, but it was great. It didn't show a lot of couth, but there we go. I'll go with that.â Couth is overrated.

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earthâs oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences. Â  I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey,Â Breathe,Â and working with its cast. Check it out! I feel a little sleep-deprived today. Do you find that as a director, you're more sleep-deprived than the average person? âDefinitely. When you're working on set, or you're doing pre-production, or you're in post, definitely. But this is what I love to do for my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\" How did you get into directing? I know you worked with Spike Lee, but what interested you about it?Â  âDirecting? I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Coney Island. When I was a kid, I was watching DVDs with director's commentary and special features, behind the scenes.

Did you know that thereâs a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70âs, early 80âs as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target.Â  Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama. Â  While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel itâs unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMANâs runtime provides. That said, Ãrik Bruneauâs performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movieâs impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle.Â  I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean.

    "description": "SLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation with McEric about thriller starring Russell Crowe and Karen Gillan Read the full article on AICN Opening today in theaters only is the new mind-bending thriller from writer/director Adam Cooper SLEEPING DOGS, starring Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Tommy Flanagan, and MÃ¡rton CsÃ³kÃ¡s. The synopsis reads âAn ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.â Â  Check out the trailer: Â  Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, youâd totally be forgiven. Maybe youâre like me and youâve seen enough movies to know that the âchilling truthsâ are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, Ã  la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion. Â  Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident. When a man he put away is facing execution, Roy takes it upon himself to re-investigate a decade-old murder despite often failing to recall his own name.

The official Catalan name of this fest is Festival Internacional de Cinema FantÃ stic de Catalunya, which just translates to Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival of Catalonia.

One day, the woman finds and rescues a baby girl, bringing irrevocable change to the lives of the couple, and to those whose paths the child will cross.

In Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, intrepid filmmaker Cullen Hoback dives into the origins of Bitcoin and the identity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. The captivating new doc film offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation, with Hoback immersing himself with key players, uncovering never-before-seen clues, and humorously unraveling Bitcoin's meteoric rise. It's executive produced by Adam McKay (director of The Big Short), Todd Schulman, Cullen Hoback, and Taylor Jones. And it'll be streaming on Max later this month.

    "description": "\"They're Earth's new apex predators âÂ but one day we're gonna beat them.\" Vertical has debtued the full official trailer for a thrilling sci-fi horror movie called Elevation, a post-apocalyptic creature feature which was filmed in Colorado last year at some empty ski resort. It's directed by George Nolfi (of The Adjustment Bureau, The Banker) and has a November release date - opening nationwide in theaters everywhere (teaser trailer here). Set in the post-apocalyptic Rocky Mountains, a single father and two women venture from the safety of their homes to face monstrous creatures to save the life of a young boy. This action sci-fi monster movie stars Anthony Mackie, Morena Baccarin, and Maddie Hasson. This trailer reveals that the title is related to these alien(?) monsters not being able to go above the elevation of 8,000ft (or 2,438m) hence why hanging out up in the Colorado mountains is a good idea. This looks like it should be entertaining, but I'm most curious to find out what these giant monsters are / where they came from. Anyone want to watch? Here's the official ...",

It just premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival in their \"Series\" section, and debuts streaming in Denmark (more countries later) in October. In a not-too-distant future, Denmark faces total evacuation due to rising water levels (climate change is definitely going to ruin everything whether we like it or not). As the nation of ~6 million people prepares to leave their homes, high school student Laura must choose between her divorced parents and the boy she's fallen in love with. It's a clever flip on the refugee crisis the world is experiencing already - what if wealthy, white people in Denmark had to flee their homes and move to other countries. What would happen? The full ensemble cast includes Amaryllis August, Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Paprika Steen, David Dencik, Helene Reingaard Neumann, Magnus Millang, Esben Smed, Thomas Bo Larsen, Asta ...",

Hulu has revealed an official trailer for a horror movie called Carved, one of their next Huluween offerings this October during the annual horror season. This one was also originally a short film for the Huluween Film Fest, which has been developed and turned into a full-length feature. Hulu is also debuting Mr. Crocket this month as part of their offerings. In Carved, a group of survivors finds themselves trapped inside a historical reenactment village on Halloween, where they must unite to battle a sentient, vengeful pumpkin. Scary! The film stars Peyton Elizabeth Lee, Corey Fogelmanis, Wyatt Lindner, Carla Jimenez, DJ Qualls, Marc-Sully Saint-Fleur, Sasha Mason, Jonah Lees, Matty Cardarople, Elvis Nolasco, and Jackson Kelly. The practical FX of the pumpkin look pretty gnarly, but the rest of this looks awful. All of the characters are so cheesy and idiotic, none of this looks that fun unfortunately.
