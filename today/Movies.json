    "description": "Kevin Smith Talks to McEric about THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Kevin Smith’s THE 4:30 MOVIE is coming home today, available on digital through all major retailers. The film tells the story of young Brian David, an avatar of Kevin Smith, and his adventures at the local Atlantic Cinema where he watches films with his friends Burny and Belly in 1986. It’s a departure from the View Askewniverse that Smith started thirty years ago, which admittedly stretched to its possible breaking point as the characters within encountered rebel angels, demons, Hollywood, jewel thieves, terrorists, and a monkey. THE 4:30 MOVIE offers a much more grounded story of a simpler time when the cinema and video store ruled the weekend, and the lives on the silver screen either mirrored our own or showed us worlds we could only imagine.  I had the opportunity to chat with Kevin Smith yesterday in support of the film’s digital release and it went exactly as I thought it would: we were given six minutes, I asked one question, and he talked for eight. What I got in that response, though, was a good deal of wisdom about what the filmmaker attempts when he puts his memories to screen for our amusement, how he’s remained relevant, and where his ideas originate. Prior to the interview’s start, my cat Bennie decided she needed to be part of it all, as well, and leapt onto the seat behind me.    Eric McClanahan - Hi Kevin!   Kevin Smith - Hello, Eric! How are you?   EM - I’m well, thank you!   KS - Look at that cat! Finish the article on AICN",

This time the terror is set against the backdrop of Christmas, with Art (David Howard Thornton) returning to hunt down Sienna (Lauren Lavera) after she cut his head off in the last installment. The film picks up right at the end of Part 2 before allowing Art to take a five year siesta while Sienna spends time in facilities piecing her psyche back together. Young Jonathan Shaw (Elliott Fullam) isn’t so young anymore, attending college near his Aunt and Uncle, Jessica and Mark (Margaret Anne Florence and Alex Ross), with whom Sienna stays after being checked out of the latest facility.  The film opens with Art dispatching a family while dressed in a Santa Claus suit, letting the audience know right away that no one is safe. The entire film plays out as a supercut of gory kills and dark humor, with occasional moments of genuine world-building that allows the supporting cast to really stretch their acting muscles. Plotwise, the film seems to be more focused on showcasing creative kills than telling a cohesive story, and the end seems somewhat rushed, as though the filmmakers had almost forgotten that they had to end the thing.    What a TERRIFIER fan is looking for, however, is exactly what they’ll find in 3: inventive kills, stomach-turning sound design, laughs that’ll make you question your own morality, and surprises.

    "description": "Barbarella Talks AI With SUBSERVIENCE Director S.K. Dale Read the full article on AICN Hi friends, Barbarella here. Sci-fi film Subservience, starring Megan Fox, Michele Morrone  (his name’s Italian so the “ch” is pronounced like a “k”), Madeline Zima, and Matilda Firth, just came out on Demand and Digital, so let’s talk about AI. Do you think artificial intelligence will bring about major medical advancements, or do you envision more of a Terminator situation evolving? I tend to think it’s not the AI itself but whoever’s behind it that should be on whom we focus our concern. When it comes to cinema, filmmakers always hold technology responsible, because let’s face it, that makes for a more entertaining movie. I would argue Will Honley and April Maguire’s screenplay puts at least some of the onus on the humans. Maybe don’t say certain things to a Sim that’s constantly evolving and learning; that’s all I’m saying. If it weren’t for one comment made to Alice (Megan Fox), the attractive Sim acquired to help out around the house, perhaps a lot of mayhem could have been avoided.    I appreciate that the conflict in Subservience primarily occurs within the family unit, as this makes it more believable to me. Favoring older technologies, Nick (Michele Morrone) isn’t the biggest fan of artificial intelligence, but when he and his sick wife (Madeline Zima) can’t keep up with managing the household and children, he caves and gets Alice, the best new Sim on the market, to help out, and you know that’s not going to work out quite how everyone expects, well, at least how everyone Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "McEric chats with the cast of Kevin Smith's THE 4:30 MOVIE Read the full article on AICN Writer/Director Kevin Smith began his View Askewniverse in 1994 with his breakout hit CLERKS. The film tells the story of a couple of slackers working dead-end jobs in New Jersey in the 1990s and the conversations and misadventures they dabble in along the way. The film paved the way for countless stories, and so far nine films by Smith have rounded out its canon, along with several animated adventures and more in the pages of comic books. Before Dante and Randall ever sat around the Quik Stop and chatted about JAWS, STAR WARS, or even NAVY SEALS, young Kevin Smith was a New Jersey native soaking up inspiration on the silver screen at his local movie theater, the Atlantic Highlands Cinema.

The film, not set within the View Askewniverse, tells the story of a young man named Brian David, a not-even-thinly-veiled stand-in for Kevin Smith, played by Austin Zajur, who one day in the late spring of 1986 asks his crush Melody Barnegat (Siena Agudong) to meet him at the movies.

It feels a little wrong that I have a ton of pep today while I’m covering a movie about the very serious topic of suicide, but here we are. Continue makes a personal and powerful statement from writer, director, and star Nadine Crocker, who survived her own suicide attempt in her twenties. In Theaters, On Demand and Digital September 6, 2024, Continue escorts viewers through Dean’s struggles as she experience life after a suicide attempt. Beautifully shot, the film also includes an unexpected love story, albeit, I’m not sure I believe that two people would be that flirtatious while discussing their past traumas, but just because I wouldn’t flirt while sharing horrific things from the past doesn’t mean it’s not possible that some people might. Anyway, before I veer too far off-topic, the movie stars an actor of whom I’ve been a fan since first seeing him about fifteen years ago in an independent film at Fantastic Fest called Deadgirl, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to chat with that actor, Shiloh Fernandez, about the film.  Right out of the gate, I share my love of Deadgirl and Shiloh’s performance in it.

A new Western, Place of Bones, rides into theaters and on digital Friday, August 23, 2024. Unlike the Westerns of yesteryear, this one is female-led, with Audrey Cummings in the director’s chair and Heather Graham shining in the lead role as a mother who, along with her daughter (Brielle Robillard), must fight for survival when a gang of outlaws, led by Tom Hopper, arrives in the area.    I’ve been a Tom Hopper fan ever since he won me over with his enticing portrayal of Billy Bones in Black Sails. He earns additional adoration from me through the way he injects subtle humor as villain Bear John in this film. I find myself laughing at moments that I’m fairly certain weren’t intended to be funny, yet he fires wit like a true sharp-shooter with a faint exasperation about him that’s just funny. However, he’s not the only one who offers something more than just delivering what’s written on the page. Corin Nemec, Brielle Robillard, and Heather Graham also add an extra something that gives insight into their characters and adds a bit of snark to the exchanges.   I had the opportunity to speak with Audrey Cummings, and I sometimes like to break the ice with a question about Muppet-casting on remakes. While she placed Kermit, Miss Piggy and Fozzy Bear in the lead roles of Calhoun (Corin Nemec), Pandora (Heather Graham), and Hester (Brielle Robillard), I took a completely different approach, thinking it would be fun to have Statler and Finish the article on AICN",

Read the full article on AICN There was every manner of film at this year’s Tribeca Festival, and I managed to take in thirteen features, four shorts, and an episodic premiere by the time the whole thing wrapped this past June. One of the highlights was the opportunity to interview two of the lead talents behind the new slasher ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD: director Marcus Dunstan and star Jade Pettyjohn. We met at the Roxy Hotel bar and restaurant, a favorite meetup spot of mine, on a Saturday morning. I was, admittedly, running late, but they were so patient and gracious with me and I always appreciate that from stars and filmmakers, whose lives are probably ten times as cluttered as mine.  Its logline says of the film: “A group of college friends rents an airbnb for the biggest music festival of the year. However, their weekend of partying soon takes a deadly turn as a masked killer murders them one by one according to their sins.” The film, though familiar in synopsis, finds a way to inject new life into a tired formula. The design of the killer is unique, the kills are creative, the victims are fighters rather than training dummies, for the most part, and the twist(s) are welcome.   Marcus Dunstan is perpetually smiling, speaking in a small voice from a large, gentle face. Jade Pettyjohn is excitable, clearly enjoying being at the festival and also talking about this joyous diversion in her filmography. We couldn’t help but jump right in.

Read the full article on AICN In some exciting news circulating the internet, it would seem that the ex-head of film at Netflix Scott Stuber is reviving the once legendary United Artists label through new partners Amazon MGM Studios. Founded in 1919 by the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickforth, D.W.Griffith and famed actor and filmmaker Douglas Fairbanks, United Artists began as a studio that would allow artists to control their own careers and artistic vision instead of being controlled by Hollywood moneymen. After decades of success, Metro Goldwyn Mayer bought the company over in 1981 for an unheard-of 350 million dollars and continued to release movies under the brand MGM/UA through the rest of the 80s, 90s and 2000s. United Artists are responsible for releasing some of the most classic movies of all time including The Mark of Zorro (1920), D.W.Griffith’s final film The Struggle (1931), The Great Dictator (1941), Alexander the Great (1956), Robert Mitchum’s Thunder Road (1958), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Dr. No (1963), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), Rocky (1976), Annie Hall (1977), Raging Bull (1980) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985) to name but a few.  Jennifer Salke (Head of Amazon MGM Studios) had this to say about the resurrection:   “With his proven track record of delivering global hits and an eye towards theatrical fare, Scott’s expertise and vision align perfectly with our film strategy. We are so proud to welcome him on the relaunch of the legendary UA brand, as we work to leverage existing and new IP into big, broad films Finish the article on AICN",

I’ve had quite a couple months, and I wish I could say that I was gallivanting around the globe, but not this time. I’ve been sick a good chunk of it. In fact, I had quite a fever when I screened Murder Company, written by Jesse Mittelstadt and directed by Shane Dax Taylor. I don’t know that it would be fair to the filmmakers to review the film, given that I was feeling so awful while watching it that I don’t think my thoughts would necessarily be a true reflection of how the movie was. I will make a few observations, though.  First of all, Kelsey Grammer was my favorite thing about Murder Company, which is currently On Digital and On Demand, and I wanted him to have far more screen time. I love a serious Kelsey Grammer, and he's incredibly serious in this. Second, while there was far less graphic violence and gore than I would have expected from a war movie made in this day and age, the filmmakers seemed to compensate for that with the amount of people flying around, proving yet again that stunt men are insane. “Yeah, you can hurl me into that tree. Sure.” Finally, could we please stop having people engage in casual conversations while walking through enemy-occupied territories?

The Sword \u0026 Sorcery world of Conan distilled through the eyes and wings of beasts and marketed to a younger audience, it surprised me to learn that the films came out in the same year and were envisioned in relative ignorance of one another.

The psychological thriller The Image of You examines duality in the form of twins, Zoe and Anna, who although they look identical, couldn’t be further apart. When sweet and naïve Anna meets a man and falls in love quickly, her bad-girl twin Zoe aims to test the strength of the relationship and the caliber of man who has captured her sister’s heart. The movie will be in select theaters and on Digital Friday, May 10.  I had an opportunity to speak with director Jeff Fisher about directing dual roles. Check it out!   I want to start with kind of a crazy icebreaker question, but what is the weirdest or craziest experience you've had dating, that you're willing to share? “Oh, my God. The weirdest or craziest experience I've had dating. This is not going to paint me in a very good light. I will tell you, my last long-term relationship, we met at a bar. I don't know if this was dating. We made out in the back of the bar for three and a half hours, on our first meeting, so it was an egregious public display of affection, and just shameless. I guess that would be my weirdest, but it was great. It didn't show a lot of couth, but there we go. I'll go with that.” Couth is overrated. How did you get involved in The Image of You?  “The production company helped with distribution on my first feature back in 2008. They had sent me the script, and I thought Finish the article on AICN",

In this post-apocalyptic era, the earth’s oxygen level has reached a not-fit-for-life amount, yet one family has survived thanks to the engineering genius and survivalistic skills of Darius (Common). He, his wife, Maya (Jennifer Hudson), and their daughter, Zora (Quvenzhané Wallis) live in a DIY-tech dwelling amidst the ruins. When Darius ventures out and remains gone longer than expected, Zora, who has learned much from her dad, attempts to reach out, bringing unwanted consequences.   I caught up with director Stefon Bristol to chat a bit about his personal journey, Breathe, and working with its cast. Check it out! I feel a little sleep-deprived today. Do you find that as a director, you're more sleep-deprived than the average person? “Definitely. When you're working on set, or you're doing pre-production, or you're in post, definitely. But this is what I love to do for my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\" How did you get into directing? I know you worked with Spike Lee, but what interested you about it?  “Directing? I grew up in Brooklyn. I grew up in Coney Island. When I was a kid, I was watching DVDs with director's commentary and special features, behind the scenes.

    "description": "Barbarella Chats with Raymond St-Jean about DUSK FOR A HITMAN Read the full article on AICN Hi, my friends. Barbarella here. Did you know that there’s a new drama about a hitman coming to Digital and On Demand tomorrow, April 19? French language film DUSK FOR A HITMAN may be based on a true story, but it includes its share of fiction. Written by Martin Gerard and Raymond St-Jean, who also directed, the film transports viewers back to the late 70’s, early 80’s as the most feared hitman in Montreal finds himself a target.  Make no mistake. This is not a John Wick action-packed assault on your senses. No, DUSK FOR A HITMAN plants itself firmly in the realm of drama.   While I like the film, portions of the story feel quite familiar to me because I recently finished the Max series TOKYO VICE, which includes a similar narrative around a gangster and his brother who wants to be in the life. I feel it’s unfair to compare the two, because they handle the subject differently, and the series has the time to really flesh out the characters and situations over several episodes. The added time granted allows a deeper connection to the characters than DUSK FOR A HITMAN’s runtime provides. That said, Érik Bruneau’s performance as a conflicted man truly enhances the movie’s impact. The film also beautifully captures the vibe of the era and removes the glamour from the gangster lifestyle.  I had the opportunity to speak with director and co-writer Raymond St-Jean. Check it out, mes amis!    This movie is based on an actual person, and Finish the article on AICN",

    "description": "SLEEPING DOGS co-writer/director Adam Cooper in Conversation with McEric about thriller starring Russell Crowe and Karen Gillan Read the full article on AICN Opening today in theaters only is the new mind-bending thriller from writer/director Adam Cooper SLEEPING DOGS, starring Russell Crowe, Karen Gillan, Tommy Flanagan, and Márton Csókás. The synopsis reads “An ex-homicide detective (Russell Crowe) with memory loss is forced to solve a brutal murder he can't recall. But as evidence uncovers secrets tied to his forgotten past, he is led to a chilling truth - sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.”   Check out the trailer:   Now if the synopsis and the trailer make the film seem predictable to you, you’d totally be forgiven. Maybe you’re like me and you’ve seen enough movies to know that the “chilling truths” are almost always exactly what you think they are. What SLEEPING DOGS offers, however, is a clever deconstruction of a brilliant mind, double-turned-triple-crosses, a femme fatale to truly die for, and stellar performances from everyone in attendance. There are practically zero sour notes in the film, and it is fun to watch with a friend and pause as you give your predictions, à la a spirited game of CLUE, to see who comes closest to the final conclusion.   Russell Crowe is wonderful in the role of Roy Freeman, a former detective who is living a labeled life as he struggles with dementia brought about by a damning automobile accident. When a man he put away is facing execution, Roy takes it upon himself to re-investigate a decade-old murder despite often failing to recall his own name.

Read the full article on AICN The funny books have changed over the years, and some might say for the worse. When I was a youngster, my interests were the big houses: Marvel and DC. Even then, though, I knew of a third contender. A dark horse in the race: Dark Horse Comics. This was the imprint that had the foresight to have the Alien fight the Predator, or Robocop take on the Terminator, or publish some of Frank Miller’s more avant takes on history or noir, birthing the classics SIN CITY and 300. Admittedly, I was never cool enough to actually read Dark Horse comics - if I checked out a title it was probably a Star Wars comic. I still stuck to Wolverine, Spider-Man, and the occasional Ghost Rider.   As I grew up and left the shadow of my parents, my tastes evolved to the more refined pastures of Batman adventures. I know; please hold your applause. I soon started collecting graphic novels of the Dark Knight’s adventures, then a girlfriend turned me on to Jhonen Vasquez and shortly after a coworker suggested Watchmen. Well heck, now I was a full-fledged comic-reading nerd, with the fine adult tastes of a mature portfolio.   One day I was in Portland, Oregon on tour with a rock band and I got to talking with the singer of one of the other bands on the bill. The topic turned to literature, and we shared some of our favorite authors: I suggested Jose Saramago, and they suggested Donald Ray Pollock. When Finish the article on AICN",

Of course, it wouldn’t be SXSW without movies, and DEAD MAIL transports viewers back to the days before cellphones and social media. A bound man manages to slip a message into a remote post office box before a figure closes in on him. The message lands in a midwestern post office on the desk of skilled “dead letter” investigator Jasper (Tomas Boykin) where he must determine if it’s a hoax or a genuine plea for help.  Feeling much like something shot in the late 70’s, DEAD MAIL blends retro vibes with timeless emotions like loneliness, ambition, fear, curiosity, and desperation. It stars Sterling Macer, Jr., John Fleck, Susan Priver, Micki Jackson, and Tomas Boykin, who gives such an exceptional performance as the fascinating Jasper, I want to see an entire film of Jasper’s backstory.  DEAD MAIL screens again this week on Wednesday, March 13 at South Lamar as part of the Visions programming.

    "description": "\"For the next two hours, your ass is mine!\" Wow. 🐒 Paramount has revealed the first look teaser trailer for Better Man, telling the story of British popstar Robbie Williams. It's a brand new original musical from the director of The Greatest Showman, Michael Gracey. This premiered at the 2024 Telluride Film Festival and it opens in theaters later this year. \"Discover an extraordinary journey that can't be told in an ordinary way.\" Williams is visualized as a photo-realistic monkey in the film instead of himself - there's a featurette video beneath the trailer explaining why. Better Man is based on the mostly true story of the meteoric rise, dramatic fall, and resurgence of British pop superstar Robbie Williams, who claims to be one of the greatest entertainers of all time. It also stars Jonno Davies, Steve Pemberton, Damon Herriman, Raechelle Banno, Alison Steadman, Kate Mulvaney, Frazer Hadfield, Tom Budge, and Anthony Hayes. Uh this looks bonkers! Apparently critics do think it's good? Does it look any good? What do you make of this? Here's the teaser trailer for Michael Gracey's ...",

    "description": "\"All that matters is we are each other's best hope!\" Streaming service Stan based in Australia has revealed the full official trailer for a new series called Nautilus, arriving to watch in October (though only in the UK \u0026 Australia to start). This series is a re-invention of the classic tale of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea from Jules Vern, by modernizing the concept. Nautilus tells Jules Verne's epic story from Captain Nemo's point of view: an Indian Prince robbed of his birthright and family, a prisoner of the East India Mercantile Company and a man bent on revenge against the forces that have taken everything from him. Shazad Latif stars in this series as Captain Nemo, acting as an origin story for the Captain – an Indian prince-turned-crusading scientist. Yes, his submarine is in it, taking him on his adventures and into battles with giant sea creatures - including an eel and squid. The cast includes Georgia Flood, Thierry Frémont, Pacharo Mzembe, Arlo Green, Tyrone Ngatai, Ling Cooper Tang, \u0026 Andrew Shaw. Ohh this looks awesome! Give it a ...",

    "description": "\"You couldn't transcend without me! We need each other.\" Dark Sky Films has debuted the main trailer for an indie comedy called Let's Start A Cult, the first narrative feature from an indie director named Ben Kitnick. This has such an awkward and edgy premise that it kind of makes sense that not many would give this a look. After missing out on a long-awaited mass suicide, an obnoxious cult member (Stavros Halkias) teams up with his former leader (Wes Haney) to rebuild their group, gathering a gang of awkward outcasts determined to fulfill their transcendent destiny. It's obviously making fun of cults and how dumb they really are, but maybe that is a bit too off-putting or strange for some to deal with? Starring comedian / podcaster Stavros Halkias, plus Wes Haney, Sarafina Vecchio, and Leslie Zang. And appearances by Ethan Suplee, CM Punk, and comedy duo Rajat Suresh \u0026 Jeremy Levick.

Apple TV has debuted the official trailer for another mysterious new thriller series titled Before, starring Bill Crystal in the lead role as a psychiatrist. \"A troubled boy and his tortured psychiatrist. You've never seen Billy Crystal in a role like this.\" It will be streaming on Apple TV+ later this October. Before is a 10-episode atmospheric, character-driven psychological thriller about Eli, a child psychiatrist who, after recently losing his wife, Lynn, encounters a troubled young boy who seems to have a haunting connection to Eli's past. What does he know? What is the connection? You'll have to watch this to find out. In addition to Billy Crystal, the main series cast includes Judith Light, Rosie Perez, Jacobi Jupe, Maria Dizzia, and Ava Lalezarzadeh. Damn the kid in this looks super creepy!

Beginning with his early days as a jazz pianist, the film celebrates Williams’ countless contributions to the moving image arts, music for the concert stage as well as his indelible impact on popular culture, including scoring the Indiana Jones \u0026 Star Wars movies and countless other classics. From Lucasfilm Ltd, Amblin Documentaries, and Imagine Documentaries, the film will premiere at AFI Fest later this month. Director Laurent Bouzereau states: \"His scores made me fall in love with music, and made me realize at a very young age, the power that a score had on cinematic storytelling.

HBO has unveiled the official trailer for the comedy series The Franchise, arriving for streaming on Max later this week. The ridiculously funny comedy series shines a light on the secret chaos inside the world of superhero moviemaking, asking: how exactly does the cinematic sausage get made? With endless fights on set, of course! A team trapped inside the dysfunctional hell of creating franchise superhero movies, at the end of the day the question is: is this Hollywood's new dawn or cinema's last stand? Is this a dream factory or a chemical plant? This sounds hilarious and this looks way, way better than Judd Apatow's The Bubble. The series stars Himesh Patel as Daniel, Aya Cash as Anita, Jessica Hynes as Steph, Billy Magnussen as Adam, Lolly Adefope as Dag, Darren Goldstein as Pat, \u0026 Isaac Powell as Bryson.

Level 33 Entertainment has revealed an official trailer for All You Need is Blood, a zombie comedy made by two indie filmmakers making their feature directorial debut - Bucky Le Boeuf \u0026 Cooper Roberts. It's a fun meta zombie comedy about a filmmaker who wants to make a zombie movie. Bucky is a 16-year-old teenager with a phobia of blood who dreams of becoming a movie director. When a strange meteorite crashes down in his backyard and turns his father into a brain-eating zombie, Bucky jumps at the chance. Accompanied by his mute best friend, a sarcastic production runner and an actress with diva-like mannerisms, he will go on to make history's first-ever horror movie with a real zombie. This comedy stars Logan Riley Bruner, Mena Suvari, Eddie Griffin, Emma Chasse, and Neel Sethi.

A24 has revealed the sizzling official trailer for the erotic thriller film titled Babygirl, which originally premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last month (and won Best Actress). Babygirl is the latest feature from Dutch filmmaker Halina Reijn, following up her horror comedy Bodies Bodies Bodies recently. Written and directed by Reijn, Babygirl stars Nicole Kidman as a powerful CEO at a major corporation based in New York City. She begins an erotic affair with a hunky new intern who strolls through her company's doors one day. The two explore an intimate sub-dom relationship as they both come to understand their own sexuality. Babygirl also stars Harris Dickinson, Antonio Banderas, Sophie Wilde, Esther McGregor. This is a fantastic trailer and a clever marketing campaign (since it opens on Christmas Day) but I'm not the biggest fan of the film overall. It's very good but not a total knock out (here's my review). A smart modern film about our kinks and repressing sexual desires. Here's the first official trailer (+ ...",
