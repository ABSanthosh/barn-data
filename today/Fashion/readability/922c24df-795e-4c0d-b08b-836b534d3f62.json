Not only do they protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, but they also have the unique ability to make you look ridiculously cool – should you invest in the right pair, of course. Which is where I come in. I’ve made it my mission to round up the best sunglasses brands for men, ranging from the uber-luxurious to budget-friendly. And sure, chances are you’ll have heard of a few, but you’ll also discover some new names that you might not be so familiar with. Plus plenty of unique styles to suit all face shapes. Keep reading as I share a selection of spectacular shade specialists (try saying that in a hurry) that’ll transform your eyewear collection and ensure that you always remain safe (and stylish) in the sun. Key Takeaways With Wham’s rendition of “Club Tropicana” playing quietly in the background and my mind wandering to warmer times and beachside bars, I set out to create a collection of the top sunglasses brands for men. What started as numerous names scribbled on my Moleskine notebook gradually grew to over 30 contenders known for creating some of the finest sunnies around. With the help of hundreds of customer reviews and years of shade-wearing experience, I eventually narrowed down the list to the 10 best sunglasses brands for men. Here you’ll find a plethora of options, including pairs from Ray-Ban and The Resort Co. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs sammsalter / Instagram Best Overall: Ray-Ban Why it’s great: Ray-Ban hardly requires an introduction. The brand has been synonymous with creating quality sunglasses for almost a century, and has been the eyewear of choice for some of the world’s most recognized men—from Tom Cruise to Bob Dylan and James Dean. They are world-leaders in the category of the best sunglasses brands for men. What makes Ray-Bans so special, apart from the excellent UV protection, is their everlasting appeal. Looking just as good today as they did all those years ago. Who is this brand for? Ray-Ban’s shades are timeless, durable, and protective – not forgetting versatile. They offer a wide range of styles that cater to all budgets, occasions, and face shapes. This makes them an excellent all-rounder that’s suitable for anyone looking for the kind of sunglasses that transcend trends and work with just about any outfit. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I’m not going to be the first guy to sing Ray-Ban’s praises and certainly not the last—their brilliance is no secret. If it’s individuality you’re after, you’re going to struggle to find a pair that many others aren’t already rocking. Best Polarized: Maui Jim Why it’s great: Not familiar with Maui Jim? Its sunglasses boast PolarizedPlus2 technology, making sure that you have maximum protection against harmful UV rays while enhancing your visual experience. Depending on which frame you choose, you’ll also benefit from lenses that don’t smash, scratch, or smudge. Who is this brand for? You’ll prioritize superior optical clarity, advanced lens technology, and eye protection, particularly in super bright and sunny environments. One of the best sunglasses brands for men, Maui Jim originally designed their shades for outdoor enthusiasts, and they remain a must-have for guys who engage in activities such as beach outings, water sports, golfing, and hiking. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although many will appreciate the polarized technology, some users might find that the specific color-enhancing tint may take a bit of adjustment, especially if they are more accustomed to neutral or standard lenses. Best Classic: Carrera Why it’s great: Let’s face it, you don’t get much cooler than Paul Newman. The man knew how to dress. So, if Carrera sunglasses were good enough for him, need I say anymore? Famous for their motorsport-inspired aviators, the brand has been churning out stylish sunnies since the ‘50s. Not just nice to look at, they’re comfortable, safe, and super versatile. Who is this brand for? Though you don’t have to be into F1 to wear Carrera sunglasses, fans of motorsport will definitely be drawn to the brand’s racing-inspired designs. You’ll also love them if you’re searching for a designer name that doesn’t put you into your overdraft. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Larger aviator-style sunglasses are the brand’s speciality—it’s what they do best. If you’re looking for alternative designs, you will find them; there’s just not so many. Best Sports: Oakley Why it’s great: There was a time when the only guys you’d find in Oakley sunglasses were cyclists, baseball players, and your balding dad. Nowadays, the brand’s performance-minded shades are just as popular within the fashion scene as they are with sportsmen. Whether you’re hitting the slopes, pounding the pavement, or hanging out at your favorite coffee house, they’re one of the best sunglass brands around, the perfect blend of form and function. Who is this brand for? Oakley is still very much a brand for active lifestyles, particularly those engaged in sports and outdoor activities. However, its diverse range of styles will also appeal to individuals seeking fashionable and sporty eyewear for everyday use. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re not wearing Oakley shades for sports or exploring the great outdoors, then some of their designs may feel a bit too specialized. Especially if your style is more classic than contemporary. Best Budget: Meller Why it’s great: A young Spanish brand with sustainability firmly in their DNA, Meller provides seriously cool shades at surprisingly cheap prices. Each pair is made with eco-conscious practices, and materials, in mind, while offering a whole host of uber-impressive features including 100% UV protection, polarized lenses, and anti-scratch coating. Who is this brand for? If you want fashion-forward shades without breaking the bank, Meller tops my list of the best sunglasses brands for men. They have an impressive catalog of more than 80 styles, ensuring that there’s something to suit every size head, big or small. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although several designs could be considered classic, most of Meller’s sunglasses are quite contemporary. Some of which might be a little too ‘edgy’ for the refined gentleman. Best Everyday: The Resort Co Why it’s great: The Resort Co is all about being eco-conscious while helping you create the ultimate vacation wardrobe. Among its collection of shorts, tops, and footwear, there’s also plenty of top-tier shades. Not just for your summer trips, they’re the type you’ll want to wear on the daily, whether you’re hiding a hangover or catching some rays. What I love most about them is their range of options, made from quality acetate, with various different lens colors to suit all complexions. Who is this brand for? From smokey lenses to transparent frames, The Resort Co has plenty of variety, making them an excellent choice for men of all sartorial preferences. You’ll also find a decent selection of lens shapes and sizes, so there’s options for all face shapes. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This is one of the best sunglasses brands for men. However, they don’t offer polarized lenses, which is a bit of shame. And actually quite surprising. Best Stylish: Oliver Peoples Why it’s great: What started as a small boutique on Hollywood Boulevard during the late ‘80s is now one of the leaders in handcrafted shades. From retro styles to modern showstoppers, Oliver Peoples’ designs are heavily inspired by fashion, film, art, and music. Technically and visually brilliant, each frame is tumbled, polished, and hand-adjusted to ensure the utmost quality. Who is this brand for? Unique, high-end, and impactful, Oliver Peoples is the kind of brand that’ll do wonders for your street cred. They have a variety of sunglasses to cater to all face shapes, but you’ll need to be willing to part with considerable cash to secure a pair. Flaws but not deal-breakers: You should be made aware of the premium price point, making Oliver Peoples sunglasses a significant investment. In fact, the brand’s commitment to luxury eyewear might limit the availability of more budget-friendly options for some. Best Luxury: Cutler \u0026 Gross Why it’s great: Cutler \u0026 Gross was established by opticians Graham Cutler and Tony Gross in 1969. The men met by chance in optometry school and took the brand from a humble bespoke service in London’s Knightsbridge to the go-to name for the likes of rock stars, royalty, and artists. Today, they continue to perfectly balance taste and technicality to offer a selection of striking shades for the fashion-conscious fella. Who is this brand for? You’ll like premium names that back it up with a quality product. And it’ll definitely help if you’re working with a generous budget. If you’re after the kind of sunnies that keep you safe, as well as the center of attention, Cutler \u0026 Gross is a brand that needs to be firmly on your radar. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Their shades don’t come cheap. However, if you’re a newcomer, you can sign up to the brand’s newsletter and get 10% off your first pair. Best On Amazon: Persol Why it’s great: An eyewear icon, Persol is undoubtedly one of the best sunglass brands. Established in 1917, its designs have nestled on the noses of some truly monumental names, from Steve McQueen to Lewis Hamilton. And for good reason. Instantly recognizable and totally badass, their timeless charm will take you from the French Riviera to backyard barbecues in the Bronx. Who is this brand for? You’ll need to be willing to spend a little cash, but Persol’s sunglasses are universally appealing. They’re not too showy or high-fashion, meaning they’re a wise investment piece that’ll never fall out of favor. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I wouldn’t call Persol mainstream, but their shades are certainly a popular choice amongst city folk and gentlemen that live by the sea. So don’t be surprised if you’re not the only one wearing a pair. Best Contemporary: Retrosuperfuture Why it’s great: The clue’s in the name. Retrosuperfuture borrows design elements from the past and brings them to the now. Its runway-ready frames are quirky, contemporary, and cool, recognized for their mix of eclectic aesthetics and seriously impressive quality. They also have the all-important 100% UVB/UVA protection. Who is this brand for? Whether you’re the kind of guy who likes to follow fashion trends or simply wants to stand out from the crowd, Retrosuperfuture is undoubtedly one of the top sunglasses brands for men. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Not everyone is going to be a fan of the brand’s avant-garde options, but they do offer a selection of slightly more subtle frames, too. chrstianarcher / Instagram Buying Considerations For The Best Sunglasses Brands For Men Shape The best sunglass brands offer a variety of styles. This is especially important when it comes to choosing the right sized lenses—not all of them will suit your face shape. For example, individuals with a square face, characterized by a strong jawline and angular features, may find aviator or round-shaped lenses complement their natural contours. On the other hand, those with a round face shape or big head often opt for rectangular or square frames to create a more balanced and structured appearance. Protection Eye health is paramount, so you should consider only brands that offer the right protection from dangerous UV rays. Generally speaking, most reputable names can be relied on, but it’s always best to double-check. Versatility Opt for brands that offer sunglasses that are versatile and suitable for various occasions.
