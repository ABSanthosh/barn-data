  "text": "My career as a beauty editor often places me in unique settings with talented individuals who inspire me to reevaluate how I approach self-care. While it's true that I spend the bulk of my work days experimenting with beauty products before dedicating the rest of my time to researching, reviewing, and sharing my results with readers, I always find myself coming back to the moments where industry experts that came up with new and innovative treatments only accessible on an IFKYK basis could break them down for me.When I have the opportunity to ask as many questions as I'm allowed about a new product, treatment, or method, I commonly have my phone at the ready to take notes and additional questions already brewing in my brain before the last have been answered. However, through the unique interactions with experts that inspire silencing these loud thoughts, I have the opportunity to tap into the quieter ones. During my first couple of months of living and working in NYC, I had the pleasure of meeting one of these special individuals: Jillian Wright, a master aesthetician and educator with over 20 years of experience.Wright invited me to visit her skincare suite in the Bloom Beauty Lounge to receive The Alchemy of Touch, a duo treatment using the talents of herself and longtime friend, fellow master aesthetician and reiki/bio energy healing specialist Samantha Roberts. Wright's official website describes the session as, \"a true immersion in touch and energetic alignment,\" before providing additional insight into the two-aesthetician treatment. It begins with a facial customized to each persons skincare needs and concludes with reflexology and frequency balancing.Below, I'm sharing my biggest takeaways from the experience, plus everything I've learned about it since then directly from Wright and Roberts. Spoiler Alert: It's niche, luxurious, and packed with all the good stuff your body and mind needs to thrive in the midsts of our busy lifestyles.While the easiest way to describe The Alchemy of Touch is as a treatment, I agree with Wright and Roberts that it would be more accurate for anyone to think about this as an extremely niche experience. Every single part of it focuses on grounding and aligning the body with energy. Touch plays a notable role in the experience, allowing the strong partnership and silent communication between Wright and Roberts to take center stage. I had the opportunity to catch up with both of them a few weeks later, and finally had the chance to learn more about what went into its development, and what these master aestheticians are up to while you're blissed out.According to Wright, the idea for The Alchemy of Touch experience is the result of years of friendship with Roberts, and is made possible by their shared synergetic energy and unshakable trust. The idea to introduce a collaborative treatment was proposed by Wright to Roberts after the latter become a licensed masseuse for a service that would combine the benefits of a custom facial with that of reflexology, chakra balancing, and energy work. \"We had enough confidence to know that the experience was going to be amazing, and it was! With everything that's happening in the world and our decreased attention spans with technology, we wanted to bring a rare and unique experience that reflects our relationship and our level of expertise,\" Wright says.Rather leaning into cutting edge technology, Wright tapped into their unique gifts and the desire to do something special together that allowed them to share it with their clients during a combined, thoughtful session. \"When do you ever have the opportunity to have two master aestheticians working on you at the same time? It's a very special experience,\" she says. The close collaboration sparked the interest of Roberts (who also has a serene space down the hall from Wright in Bloom Beauty Lounge). \"I hadn't seen anything like it before,\" Roberts explains. \"There was nothing like it being offered on skincare menus, and I could do it with Jillian.\"When the generous invitation to experience The Alchemy of Touch landed in my inbox, the first thing I wondered was if I would be overstimulated by two experts working on me from head-to-toe. Little did I know that from the moment I stepped into the room where everything would go down moments later, I knew I would leave a lot lighter than I came.The Customized Facial and ReflexologyUpon first inspection, Wright's cozy studio space resembled that of many others I had gotten to experience over the course of my beauty career. That was, until, she pulled back the white sheets and padding of her elevated treatment bed to reveal a chakra-balancing mat infused with PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy) and photon light therapy amplified by forty pounds of sparkling certified crystals. Wright discovered the mat at a conference, and decided to add it to her treatment bed complimentary to provide warmth and a full-body detox. \"It also has PEMF which regulates your frequency with the earth's frequency, so it's like a digital detox,\" explains Wright.Wright uses an all-inclusive facial model, meaning she charges by time and not add-ons. This means that if she brings technology into her space, she incorporates it any way she can within the time someone books with her. However, the benefits of the facial and everything that follows afterwords starts before a client walks through the door. Ahead of your arrival, Roberts selects two crystals that she things will most benefit you. After you climb into the treatment bed, they're placed on your chest (mine were the quartz crystal to promote clarity and healing, and pyrite to bring down my high anxiety levels). While Wright was giving me the facial of a lifetime, Roberts' attention was on treating my feet to grounding and relaxing reflexology methods.One thing to note about this part of the treatment can be extended for as long as you'd like to address your particular skincare concerns. Wright effortlessly blends more \"traditional\" facial methods with advanced skin modalities such as LED, facial cupping, micro current, cryotherapy, or ultrasonic infusion to restore and balance skin. \"There's so many different modalities and a lot we can do over the time someone request... why not have what you need?\" Roberts adds.Chakra Balancing and Energy WorkNext, Roberts takes over the treatment and dives into a chakra balancing session and energy work. Moving from the end of the treatment bed to the top, she delicately places her hands at the back of the client's neck, closes her eyes, and embarks on a journey of energy work and vibrational healing. \"I really try to tap into the energy when I put my hands on you and before you come because of the stones and oils I'm going to pick for you,\" she says. \"Everything on the feet is more for relaxation and to feel for any blockages in the lower channel (spleen, bladder, gallbladder, liver, and kidney).\"Once your energy has been brought down, she moves to the top of your head and neck, she scans for any blockages and inflammation of the body. Roberts can also identify previously broken bones and digestive issues. If Wright knows the client ahead of the treatment, she doesn't share information with Roberts. Roberts may not even know your name ahead of meeting you on the treatment bed. \"I'll tap into the energy before our service. I don't need to know anything about you! When you're tapping into the energy, none of that matters,\" she explains. The same process goes for when Roberts is selecting your aromatherapy for the treatment.My reiki scan revealed four major things about my body's overall wellness, resulting in Wright offering simple solutions:I have left over inflammation in my right knee from my years spent as a classical ballet dancerI eat too many cold foods that can lead to digestive issues... it's worth investing in a juicer for fresh celery juicy to helpI have high anxiety levels and can benefit from using ashwaghanda and GABA to help keep them levelMy third eye is almost open, and needs a little more coaxing to reveal itselfThe FinaleWhile Roberts is helping identify everything from old injuries to digestive issues, Wright massages your hands and arms. The treatment didn't end here... Roberts also has the gift of being a medium. Halfway through my full-body scan, I was asked if I felt open to speaking to a spirit known to me. It was revealed to be my paternal grandfather, a man who had passed away when I was fifteen years old. Most of what I had learned about him came from heartwarming conversations with my father, grandfather, and aunt. As much as I liked getting to know him through my family, I missed having the opportunity to get to know him in adulthood, so having the connecting with him in the afterlife made me feel deeply loved.It should be noted, however, that this can be done only when Roberts is provided the energy and channels to do so from her client and, therefore, depends on the session. However, everything about my treatment from the initial facial from Wright to heartwarming communication with my grandfather via Roberts made this experience one of the most meaningful experiences I've had. It left me with refreshed skin, a full heart, and an appreciation for the art that this powerful duo has mastered: a renewal of the soul and body through touch.The Alchemy of Touch is a service that's only bookable via text, phone call, or email. Both Wright and Roberts can also be booked on their own at the Bloom Beauty Lounge.Shop Their Skincare and Wellness Favorites Dehaz Skincare Wild Orchids Intensive Oil Serum Omad Bio Cellulose Restore \u0026 Repair Serum Mask CCollection Reflexology Tools",

The treatment didn\u0026#39;t end here... Roberts also has the gift of being a medium. Halfway through my full-body scan, I was asked if I felt open to speaking to a spirit known to me. It was revealed to be my paternal grandfather, a man who had passed away when I was fifteen years old. Most of what I had learned about him came from heartwarming conversations with my father, grandfather, and aunt. As much as I liked getting to know him through my family, I missed having the opportunity to get to know him in adulthood, so having the connecting with him in the afterlife made me feel deeply loved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted, however, that this can be done only when Roberts is provided the energy and channels to do so from her client and, therefore, depends on the session. However, everything about my treatment from the initial facial from Wright to heartwarming communication with my grandfather via Roberts made this experience one of the most meaningful experiences I\u0026#39;ve had. It left me with refreshed skin, a full heart, and an appreciation for the art that this powerful duo has mastered: a renewal of the soul and body through touch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Alchemy of Touch is a service that\u0026#39;s only bookable via text, phone call, or email.
