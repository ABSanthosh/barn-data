We’re always more than happy to keep tabs on the best new Free People products to shop. While new releases can be overwhelming, we’re here to bring you the best-of-the-best options worth your attention and money.And now that summer is officially here, it’s a great time to take a deep dive into your closet to see what you need to re-stock. Do you need a new flowy dress? Maybe a new activewear set? What about a denim jacket for festival season? Free People has fresh styles that fit the bill.You’ll find many products coming from Free People’s fan-favorite collections like FP Movement, We The Free, and Free-est to suit any vibe you’re going for this summer. So without further ado, from clothing to accessories, here are the 15 best things to buy at Free People from its new arrivals section.Singin' In The Rain Packable JacketWhether you’re a weekend hiker or a daily dog walker, this lightweight, packable jacket is your new best friend. It’s designed to be rolled up in a bag when not in need but is sturdy enough to keep you warm and dry when the April showers surprise you.FP Movement Singin' In The Rain Packable Jacket, $, available at Free PeopleHot Shot Crossover SetThis is not technically a newbie, but Free People’s cult-fave athleisure set is back in new shades. Our fave? This vibrant green just screams springtime.FP Movement Hot Shot Crossover Set, $, available at Free PeopleLet's Bounce PantsThese lounge pants tick all the right boxes. They’re made in a lightweight, super comfy and breathable material, and they have a super flattering, cropped bell bottom fit. You’re bound to reach for these more than your old, tired leggings.FP Movement Let's Bounce Pants, $, available at Free PeopleClass Optional ToteSpring is the season of new beginnings and, according to the pagan calendar, is the true start of the new year — which is why you may be feeling inspired to sign up for a new workout class now, rather than in January (aka the midst of winter). And so, what better way to get yourself ready than with a brand-spanking new gym bag? This balletcore pink number doesn’t just look good, it’s also super practical, coming with multiple exterior and interior pockets, a shoe compartment to keep your sweaty gym sneakers separate, and a buckled strap to hold your yoga mat.FP Movement Class Optional Tote, $, available at Free PeopleRetro Heatwave Gingham One-PieceWhat better way to get ready for picnic season than donning head-to-toe gingham? Break up the print with colorful sneakers or ballet flats, and your fave denim jacket or oversized knit.Free People Retro Heatwave Gingham One-Piece, $, available at Free PeopleBlaze Pull-On BootsIf, like us, you’re perpetually refreshing Depop and eBay for a pair of vintage Frye boots, get excited. Free People has finally created its own '70s-style campus boots that are a dead ringer. Wear with your prettiest mini dress for a cool soft-meets-tough fit and to face spring showers in style.FP Collection Blaze Pull-On Boots, $, available at Free PeopleOasis Midi DressEveryone needs that one throw-it-on-and-go dress — the kind that fits like a dream, is a complete outfit-in-one, and works for all kinds of occasions. That’s what the Oasis Midi is; it’s not surprising that it’s one of Free People’s bestsellers. Now, it’s back for spring in an array of seasonal shades, like this crisp white, a soft periwinkle blue, warm dusty pink, and sage green.free-est Oasis Midi Dress, $, available at Free PeopleDrea Sweater SetSpring may bring sunnier days, but the nights are still chilly. This 100% cotton set is the perfect in-between option for sleep and lounging; it’s a breathable, lightweight knit so you won’t overheat in bed, and the easy, oversized fit is comfy yet still refined.free-est Drea Sweater Set, $, available at Free PeopleWe The Free Montana ShortsICYMI, jorts are back and a bigger trend than ever this season. If you’re a bit nervous about dipping your toe into the proverbial denim pool, Free People’s offering is a great place to start. They have a slightly relaxed, slouchy fit but aren’t too oversized to look sloppy; and they’re available in so many different shades and washes (nine to be exact), that it’s easy to find your perfect fit. Whether that’s a faded, vintage blue, icy white, khaki, or classic true-navy. We The Free Montana Shorts, $, available at Free PeopleWin Win BraThis FP Movement sports bra ticks off all the right boxes. As someone who owns several pairs in various colors, I find it super soft and comfortable, but also as it is compressive, it feels secure on my body and appropriate for an array of physical activities (from a high-impact workout like basketball to a casual weekend hike).FP Movement Win Win Bra, $, available at Free PeopleFree People X Clarks WallabeesICYMI, Clark’s Wallabees are enjoying a very fashionable renaissance. Last October, the fashion search engine Lyst ranked the shoe as one of its hottest products and described it as a “key shoe style” among Gen Z shoppers. If you missed out last fall, now is your chance to jump on the bandwagon — Free People and Clarks have collaborated on a brand new style, complete with an abstract leopard-meets-floral print and a stacked heel for added height.Free People X Clarks Wallabees, $, available at Free PeopleQuinn PantsWhether you’re throwing yours on to run last-minute errands, for a comfy WFH day, or over a bikini during vacation, everyone needs a great pair of light, billowy pants for the spring (and on into summer).free-est Quinn Pants, $, available at Free PeopleThe Sonny Tee \u0026 Darcy Surf ShortIf you’re looking for a little more coverage from your swimwear, look no further than Free People’s new swim collection, which includes tee-and-short combinations, surf suits, one pieces, and tankinis, alongside all your classic bikinis — all in bright and bold summery shades.free-est The Sonny Tee, $, available at Free Peoplefree-est Darcy Surf Short, $, available at Free PeopleWe The Free Deep Trance Dropped Boyfriend JeansSay hello to your new perfect boyfriend jeans, with just the right amount of slouch and ease.We The Free Deep Trance Dropped Boyfriend Jeans, $, available at Free PeopleStrada SetWe love matching sets like this to take all the guesswork out of dressing.
