Okay, now that the pleasantries are out of the way, a quick note before we swan dive into the best men’s clothing brands: We’re not going to agree on all of them. In fact, it would be a little weird if we did, right? It’s a highly subjective topic. One that depends on your body type, personal style, budget, lifestyle, and countless other factors. Maybe you have your go-tos, maybe you don’t. Either way, you’re here for a reason—to embark on an epic sartorial quest wherein we’ll explore 10 fantastic fashion labels across a range of categories. Some are vacation-ready. Some are budget-friendly. Some focus strictly on the basics. The throughline? Across the board, you’re working with brands that focus on quality construction, handsome designs, and a broad range of styles. Key Takeaways  Regardless of your unique style and the types of clothes you feel most comfortable in, the best men’s clothing brands must adhere to a few unwritten rules. They need to be made to last, they need to be comfortable and fit well, and they need to be stylish. Checking all of those boxes and then some is my top overall pick, Alabama-based haberdasher Billy Reid. And when it comes to wallet-friendly classics to stock up on, Bonobos is another solid pick. Our Top Picks Best Men’s Clothing Brand For Basics: CDLP Best Eco-Friendly Men’s Clothing Brand: Outerknown In This ArticleOur PicksWhat to look forFinal VerdictFAQs billy_reid / Instagram 1. Best Overall Clothing Brand for Men: Billy Reid Florence, Alabama-based Billy Reid is one of those brands that just gets it. Since 1998, Reid has been designing timeless pieces with modern updates under his eponymous label and is far and away one of the best men’s clothing brands around. From suits to chinos to outerwear, every detail has been meticulously fawned over to create some of the most handsome and durable garments out there. You could easily get lost in all the rakish options at your disposal, but an iconic example of Billy Reid’s casually elevated vibe can be found in the Shoals Denim Shirt. A classic from top to bottom, it’s a made-to-last staple that you can dress up or down throughout the year. 2. Best For Travel: Tropicfeel There you were, traveling through the Amazon Basin with nothing but a guide and a dream. Or sea kayaking in Antarctica. Or taking a party cruise on a salty, windswept evening. What am I on about? I’ll tell you what I’m on about. Niche activities call for niche gear, and Tropicfeel gets that. The Barcelona travel-apparel brand’s stylish, sustainable, highly functional journey began when it created a casual yet technical shoe that went on to become the most funded shoe in Kickstarter history. From that massive initial interest stemmed an impressive lineup of travel gear ranging from travel bags and backpacks to pants, t-shirts, and deceivingly bulletproof layers like the NS40 Layer. 3. Best For Vacation: The Resort Co There’s something shamelessly glorious about a luxury fashion brand based entirely around resort and vacation life. Leisuring and leisuring well is something that Stockholm-based The Resort Co takes very seriously. With access to evening-ready pieces like a pima cotton knitted polo and a devil-may-care short-sleeve terry cloth button-up, you may be tempted to trade in every t-shirt you’ve ever owned. But the head-turning displays of sartorial confidence don’t end with tops. Tailored swim shorts, terry lounge pants, suede espadrilles, and stylish sunglasses abound. Now get out there and make the leisure gods proud. 4. Best Clothing Brand For Basics: CDLP Luxury essentials. Now, at first blush you might think that sounds like an oxymoron. And… well, yeah. Totally is. But in the deft hands of CDLP—the first basics-focused Swedish brand of the rest of your life—it all starts to make a bit more sense. From undershirts and t-shirts made with luxuriously soft fabrics to silky-soft boxer briefs, no stitch is left un-obsessed-over. Some other standout basics include bamboo socks, lyocell poplin pajama shirts, woven boxer shorts, and performance leggings for those crisp fall runs. And when you’re done stocking up on underthings, mosey on over to CDLP’s poolwear section and have your way with anything from an expert-level peak-lapel pool jacket to loudly colored pool shirts complete with matching shorts. 5. Best Luxury: Tom Ford Sure, every celebrity you’ve ever heard of has worn a Tom Ford suit on one red carpet or another. And sure, the luxury fashion house has launched some splashy ad campaigns that have caught your eye. All good and fine. But what makes Tom Ford one of the best men’s designer clothing brands is less pomp and more circumstance. Like the circumstance that leads you to popping on a pink silk-and-cotton polo. Or the one that requires a cashmere herringbone jacket and micro jacquard tie. What I’m getting at is that you shouldn’t sleep on the brand’s everyday gems that are equal parts handsome, made to last, and frame-flattering. 6. Best Budget: Bonobos Not to be mistaken for cheaply made items, Bonobos’ budget-friendly clothes have no business being as sturdy or handsome as they are. No molds are being broken, no niche is being created, and no sartorial feathers are being ruffled. Instead, what they’re presenting you with is a staggering range of gear that looks great, feels great, and won’t disintegrate after two months of wear. The Stretch Everyday Shirt is a good place to start if you’re looking to get a feel for the brand. It’s a cozy cotton button-down available in 35 colors, four fits, and three lengths. It’s not custom but it’s pretty damn close. Otherwise, you’re privy to shorts, suits, golf gear, coats, pants, swimwear, and pretty much every other wearable thing you can think of. 7. Best On Amazon: Flint And Tinder Flint and Tinder is the in-house clothing brand of style, gear, and lifestyle retailer Huckberry. Just north of rugged and south of elegant, Flint and Tinder garments are about as solid and head-turning as it gets. Everyday classics like t-shirts, the 365 Pant, and the Italian Jean are juxtaposed by interesting pieces like western button-downs and camp shirts with birds and bobcats printed on them. You already have a bobcat shirt? Cool. How about one with bears and rams on it instead? Either way, this is the brand you turn to when the goal is filling your closet with all-season staples and building things out from there. Jeans. Shorts. Basics. Waxed barn jackets and dressed-up cotton blazers. It’s all here and there’s been no skimping on quality construction in the process. 8. Best Everyday: Buck Mason If you’re sensing a theme of timeless classics updated for the modern man, you might just be onto something. Next up is Venice-born Buck Mason and its impressive lineup of universally wearable polos, henleys, jackets, shorts, and anything else that could possibly round out an entire wardrobe in the most understatedly stylish way possible. Buck Mason stitches together its California-, Texas-, and Georgia-grown cotton at its mill in Mohnton, Pennsylvania. Overseeing and touching every step of the process results in comfortable, durable clothes fit for every man, every day. Dressed-up options like wedding-friendly jackets and business-casual button-downs aside, Buck Mason’s basics like the Pima Classic Tee also deserve their time in the sun. 9. Best For Big Guys: lululemon You already know lululemon for its workout gear, athleisure basics, and lifestyle accessories. You know that if you’re leveling up your active-lifestyle wardrobe game, the ubiquitous brand has you covered with technical shirts, socks, shorts, joggers, bags, you name it. But what may surprise you is that lululemon has an incredibly large selection of big, tall, and plus-size clothing. The brand has long-since expanded beyond its yoga- and workout-only product line, growing to include everyday pieces like business-casual clothes, golf gear, swim trunks, and a perennial favorite—the Fundamental Oversized T-Shirt Pocket. No wrong turns here, just a vast collection of versatile gear that’ll serve you well from the gym to the nightcap. 10. Best Eco-Friendly Brand: Outerknown Pro surfer Kelly Slater founded apparel and lifestyle brand Outerknown in 2014 with a focus on manufacturing casual, functional, fantastic-looking clothes sourced from sustainable fabrics and manufactured using ethical practices. So when you pick up an impossibly cozy Chroma Blanket Shirt or a Saltwater Slub Polo, you can do so knowing that the planet was carefully considered before making you look better than anyone else at the pool bar, sidewalk cafe, or beach bonfire. In addition to its standard head-to-toe garments, Outerknown recently launched a limited-edition kids line and also offers accessories like hats, sunglasses, and bags. What To Look For In The Best Men’s Clothing Brands Types Of Clothes If you’re a discerning yet casual guy who likes to stick to the basics, luxury men’s clothing brands may not be your thing. Conversely, hypebeasts probably aren’t going to go out of their way to shop brands that focus on classic American styles. Almost all of the best men’s clothing brands have a specific aesthetic. Make sure your styles align before spinning your wheels trying to find the right look. Materials \u0026 Durability A label can’t be considered one of the best men’s clothing brands without using quality materials and employing manufacturing processes that prioritize durability. Thoughtfully sourced fabrics sewn together with integrity are hallmarks of quality that you should be paying attention to when shopping around. Style and aesthetics matter, but not if you’re replacing your clothes every few months. Price Only you know how much you can justify paying for your clothes. Typically, the price you pay is directly correlated to how long the clothes will last and how comfortable the materials will be. There’s nothing wrong with stocking up on cheaper clothes that you love, but know that you don’t necessarily need to skimp on quality either. You’ve got plenty of excellent, long-lasting options available at reasonable prices. tropicfeel / Instagram Final Verdict  Quality construction, a comfortable fit, and stylish options are the pillars of good men’s clothing brands. And while you’re spoiled for choice, my top pick is Billy Reid thanks to its timelessly elevated take on the classic wardrobe. FAQ There are a handful of usual suspects when it comes to the most expensive men’s clothing brands. Depending on the line and season, Louis Vuitton is often the most expensive. Other brands regularly keeping Louis Vuitton company are Gucci and Prada. Kelly Larson is a writer and editor with over 12 years of professional experience.
