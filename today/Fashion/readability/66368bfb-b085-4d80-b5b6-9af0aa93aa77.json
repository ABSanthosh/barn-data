That gives LVMH a seat on the Italian fashion brand’s board.Moncler told the Guardian it did not comment on “unsubstantiated rumours”.Shares in Burberry rose as high as 872p in early trading on Monday, up more than 7% on Friday’s close of 812p. The stock closed up 6% at 861p, valuing it at £3.1bn.A number of analysts identified Burberry as a potential takeover target earlier this year after the company’s share price fell by 40% over a 12-month period. This meant it dropped out of the FTSE 100 index for the first time in 15 years.The drop in the share price and two profit warnings this year led to the abrupt exit of Jonathan Akeroyd in July after nearly three years as chief executive.Its profit warning in July followed a double-digit decline in sales across its core markets in what the company described as a “disappointing” first quarter. The company also scrapped its dividend.Store sales in the Americas and Asia Pacific fell by 23%, while sales in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa dropped by 16%.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe company has also been particularly hit by an economic downturn in China, where consumers have become more selective about their high-end purchases. In May, Burberry reported that sales in China had decreased by 19% in the final quarter of last year.Burberry is one of several luxury brands that have struggled in recent years as consumer spending tightens.
