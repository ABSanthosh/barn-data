Fresh from the Miami Grand Prix, the Formula 1 star touched down in New York City with no signs of slowing down, bringing a master class in refined tailoring and cultural symbolism to the Met Gala red carpet. He arrived early in the evening alongside fellow co-chair Colman Domingo. Hamilton’s custom suit was a collaborative creation with London-based designer Graces Wales Bonner and styled by Eric McNeal. Rich in historical depth, the look featured exquisite detailing that elevated its visual impact. A cropped ivory jacket sat just above a pair of striped tuxedo trousers, from which a meticulously embroidered sash flowed. John Shearer//Getty ImagesSavion Washington//Getty ImagesOn Instagram, McNeal expressed gratitude to Wales Bonner and offered insight into the outfit’s layered meanings: “The color of ivory denotes purity and status; cowries pass from hand to hand, the regal sash turns shamanic,” he wrote. Beaded and shell embellishments throughout the look echoed ancestral decorations and ancient currencies. The outfit was completed with a custom beret by legendary milliner Stephen Jones and an Asscher-cut brooch by Briony Raymond. For Hamilton, style has long been a powerful tool—first for self-expression in the world of racing, and now as a force within the fashion industry. From the outset, he’s used his platform to spotlight young Black designers, making their inclusion a central part of his mission. In 2021, he made headlines by purchasing his own Met Gala table, inviting emerging Black creatives such as Edvin Thompson of Theophilio and Kenneth Nicholson—offering them a seat at a table where they might not have otherwise had access. In 2023, his look honored John Ystumllyn, the first recorded Black gardener in Wales, blending fashion with historical reverence. Now, with this year’s theme, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” Hamilton’s longstanding advocacy at the Met Gala feels fully realized.",
