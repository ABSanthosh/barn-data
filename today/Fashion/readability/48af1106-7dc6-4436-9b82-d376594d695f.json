  "description": "This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here and shop this gift guide on Pinterest here.Gone are the days when secondhand meant second-best. Climate-conscious shoppers are embracing circular fashion, luxury resale has become a favorite among trendsetters, and secondhand clothes and accessories have transformed into both acceptable and highly desirable gifts. This holiday season, more and more people are maximizing their gift budgets with pre-loved treasures.Thanks to thrift stores and resale platforms like Depop, The RealReal, and eBay, you can score designer handbags and shoes, quality winter accessories, and cult pieces from beloved brands — all for a fraction of the retail price. Gifting someone a secondhand item may take a little extra effort — like knowing their style preferences and clothing or shoe size (and making sure that the item is in gift-appropriate condition) — but it’s a meaningful way to show you care about both them and the environment. “There’s a real romance in gifting something that has lived a previous life,” vintage seller Erin Murphy tells Refinery29. “With secondhand gifts, you’re gifting the story of the piece with someone who means something to you.” Whether you’re shopping for the person who “doesn’t want anything” or one with a taste for luxury, here are 13 secondhand treasures every fashion-lover will adore this season.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. If you buy something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission.An Oblong HandbagY2K-inspired elongated handbags are trending right now, including East-West silhouettes and Fendi Baguettes. This holiday season, go the extra mile by sourcing a style from its original era. “A vintage leather bag is the perfect secondhand gift: It’s a wardrobe staple that keeps its quality,” Vivien Tang, owner of Vivien’s Vintage, tells Refinery29. Coach Dark Brown Shoulder Bag, $, available at DepopA Silk ScarfScour the internet (or IRL stores) for a silk scarf to complement your giftee’s wardrobe. Since one can be worn around the neck or wrist, as a headscarf or a bag accessory, it’s like multiple gifts in one. Find a unique design from past eras, like a cool digital print from the ‘90s or geometric designs from earlier in the century. Liberty London 100% Silk Vintage Square Neck Scarf, 17”, $, available at EtsyA Ring Watch This mid-century trend is officially back. Not quite a watch, nor just a ring, a ring watch makes a great gift for any trendsetter. While there are plenty of new iterations on the market (see here), pre-loved vintage styles will likely have more personality than newer iterations. Perform a quick polish and it’s ready to dazzle under the tree. (Tip: use the keyword “vintage” and search for eras between the ‘50s and ‘80s for the most authentic style.) Vintage Women's Gold Watch Ring, $, available at DepopA Unique BroochBrooches are also back in fashion (i.e., a vintage-seller’s dream) and are a chic addition to any outfit. Shop everything from ornate, antique styles with colorful gemstones (can you find their birthstone?) to minimalist pins that are perfect for stacking.Miriam Haskell Vintage Faux Pearl \u0026 Crystal Brooch, $, available at The RealRealA Retro TeeProve you’ve got their personality down pat with a vintage graphic tee you know they’ll love. Whether it’s a concert tee from their favorite musician or tour or a cult movie graphic, you’ll get points for rarity and personalization. It’s a foolproof pick: Even if it’s not their style, it can always be worn as a cozy, worn-in pajama top.Harry Styles Harry Styles Adore You T-Shirt, $, available at eBayA Vintage WatchA good-quality watch is the ultimate gift that lasts for decades. Shop secondhand for a significant discount and for the opportunity to snag a lusted-after vintage style, like an old-school Casio (to commemorate the watch’s 50th anniversary this year) or a Seiko classic. For a luxury option, see Cartier’s Tank watch, which continues to soar in popularity. Seiko Vintage Seìko Slim Tank, $, available at eBayRare, Limited-Edition SneakersThe secondhand market is a goldmine for sneakerheads. If you know they missed out on a designer collaboration or limited release that they’re still thinking about, they’ll be gobsmacked to unwrap The Ones That Got Away. Bear in mind, you may have to pay over retail price for a pair from a sold-out launch. Loewe x On Canvas Mesh Cloudventure Sneakers, $, available at FashionphileA Leather JacketSlouchy, oversized jackets are this season’s cool-girl outerwear must-have. Seek out a leather jacket, ranging from bombers to trench coats, to get the perfectly worn-in look that characterizes this trend (and only gets better with age).Vintage Leather Jacket, $, available at DepopA Preppy SweaterThe quality of secondhand sweaters often exceeds that of newer versions. A vintage, cashmere Ralph Lauren crewneck is a hot-ticket item this year (the brighter the better), with other sought-after collegiate-forward brands to consider including Benetton and Champion. Some fabrics to look for when buying sweaters secondhand are high-quality wools for warmth, thick cottons for durability, and natural fiber blends for breathability. Ralph Lauren Cashmere Sweater, $, available at Vestiaire CollectiveThe Perfect Winter Boots Gift them with a pair of cold-weather kicks like pre-loved Dr. Martens or, if your budget allows, Prada loafers. Come dreary January, they’ll actually look forward to dressing for winter and will think about you all season long. The best part: They likely won’t have to go through the painful process of breaking the Docs in.Dr Martens Leather Snow Boots, $, available at Vestiaire CollectiveDainty Vintage HeelsNothing says timeless elegance like a pair of vintage heels. For a gift that will never go out of style, look for ladylike silhouettes like slingbacks, kitten heels, or Mary Janes. Jimmy Choo Lace-Up Mules, $, available at eBayHandcrafted Jewelry There is no better gift than heirloom jewelry. For a designer option, look to vintage pieces from Elsa Peretti’s archive. Alternatively, you can source baubles made from repurposed materials, such as vintage coins, recycled metals, or antique charms. It is as personal as it gets.Colleen Toland Vintage Beaded Bracelet, $, available at EtsyAn Upcycled PieceSpeaking of repurposed materials, for a truly one-of-a-kind gift, consider an upcycled item, like a reworked top with a modern silhouette or a patchwork jacket made from vintage blankets. “With reworks, each garment is hand-sourced with love and re-engineered into its new design,” says Charley Keighley, who sells ruched button-downs and bubble skirts. Not only will you be keeping unwanted fabrics out of landfills but also supporting independent designers.Riodecorset Reworked Corset, $, available at EtsyCult Luxury Items: Chanel HeelsNothing says timeless elegance like a pair of Chanel heels. Seek out classic styles such as quilted pumps, cap-toe slingbacks, or vintage Mary Janes for a gift that will never go out of style. Chanel Patent Leather Mary Jane Shoes, $, available at PoshmarkClassic Vintage Finds: A Retro Graphic TeeA vintage graphic tee can be the ultimate personality gift. Look for rare concert tees, cult movie graphics, or slogans related to an inside joke.

For the trend-savvy recipient, look for trending styles like Y2K-inspired East-West bags or ‘60s frame handbags. Bonus points if it’s from its original era. Coach Vintage Hampton Bag, $, available at PoshmarkAccessories: A Cozy ScarfAn oversized scarf is a winter essential that’s far more fun to give (and receive) than to buy for yourself. Seek out chunky knits, bright colors, or bold prints (if that’s their thing), and prioritize quality fabrics like wool and cashmere. Popular secondhand options include brands like Acne Studios, Burberry, and Loewe.Acne Studios Fringe Wool Scarf, $, available at eBayClassic Vintage Finds: Limited-Edition SneakersThe secondhand market is a goldmine for sneakerheads. Many pre-loved sneakers are barely worn or like-new, so search for limited-edition releases or designer collaborations to find a one-of-a-kind pair.Adidas x Wales Bonner Patent Leather Trainers, $, available at Vestiaire CollectiveClassic Vintage Finds: A Chunky SweaterIntroduce them to a new winter staple with a pre-loved oversized cable-knit, a colorful cardigan, or even a festive holiday number.
