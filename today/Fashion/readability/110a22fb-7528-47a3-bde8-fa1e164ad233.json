Now, at 81, she’s reaping the rewards.“The time of staying in the shadows helped me to come out of the shadows,” Ms. Gaynor said.April 17, 2025Updated 6:09 a.m. ETSeated on a piano bench in her bright, contemporary home in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Gloria Gaynor was talking over plans for her next concert.For years, she said, she stood alone onstage, singing over prerecorded audio tracks. No more. At the upcoming show, Ms. Gaynor, 81, would be performing with a 10-piece ensemble that included a horn section and a trio of background singers — a level of professionalism she insists on in her contract.“Gloria Gaynor is a luxury item,” she said. “Either you can afford her or you can’t.”It has taken Ms. Gaynor a lifetime to deliver such a diva line. The singer who became the embodiment of standing up for yourself — thanks to her signature anthem, “I Will Survive” — said she struggled for years with low self-esteem. As a result, she ended up adrift.Since making the decision to take charge of her life and career, she has finally become a match for the self-assured vocalist heard on so many recordings, including her latest single, “Fida Known,” a song that harks back to disco’s golden years while sounding very much of the moment.“I feel like a butterfly coming out of a cocoon,” Ms. Gaynor said.Born Gloria Fowles, she was raised in a large family in Newark. She didn’t know her father, a nightclub singer. Her mother, whom everybody called Queenie May, was a big-hearted, blunt-speaking woman with a beautiful voice. At age twelve, Ms. Gaynor was molested by one of her mother’s boyfriends, she has said in interviews. She kept the abuse a secret for decades, including from the readers of her 1995 memoir, “Soul Survivor.”When Ms. Gaynor was a teenager, her mother recognized that she had real talent when she heard her singing the jazz standard “Lullaby of the Leaves.” Queenie May gave her daughter plenty of encouragement back when she was working a string of day jobs while singing in clubs at night, but she didn’t live to see her grand success. She died of lung cancer in 1970, when Ms. Gaynor was 27 and still struggling to make a name for herself.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
