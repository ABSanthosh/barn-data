  "description": "Winter is here, and it’s the perfect time to kick off your 2025 wardrobe with seasonally fit finds from reader-favorite Anthropologie. From warm jackets and cozy knits for outdoor days to cute tops for layering (and keeping in rotation come spring), the retailer’s latest arrivals have your cold-weather needs covered. Amongst the new drop, you’ll also find versatile loungewear — think sweatshirts that pair seamlessly with leggings, denim, trousers, and beyond, as well as joggers that wouldn’t look out of place underneath a winter coat — because even though bed rotting is so last season, coziness is forever.
