  "description": "When the majority of my high school friends selected bandage dresses for prom junior year, I was less than thrilled. I knew for sure I wouldn't be partaking, and that I'd be in something looser-fit, but I still felt an overwhelming sense of FOMO (as one does in high school). Watching everyone else jump on the bandage dress bandwagon was stressful, knowing I simply didn't have the confidence to wear something that so visibly traced every line of my body. Fast forward to college and I finally invested in a bandage skirt (pictured above), but this is the only photo I have to show for it as I remember feeling uneasy about my head-to-toe appearance. And maybe that's why, 20 years later, I was apprehensive to try a trend that used to keep me up at night. A familiar sense of fear creeped over me as I pulled the Hervé Léger Elise Dress ($690) over my head and procrastinated peering into the mirror. Would I like the shape of my thighs? Would I be able to make out my period bloat belly straight-on, before even turning to the side? All the same ridiculous questions popped into my head as I asked myself why I signed up to try the skintight silhouette that's enjoying a resurgence thanks to models like Kaia Gerber and Hailey Bieber. The design carries a certain energy that harks back to an early aughts party vibe, but feels versatile all the same. But then I looked at myself, and suddenly, my 33-year-old common sense and wisdom returned back to me. All my insecurities about wearing a tight dress (most of which society imparts on us) melted away - and not just because I actually liked the way I looked. While the idea of a bandage dress feels nostalgic, I felt very much like current-day me trying on a new aesthetic. Rather than being intimidated by the cut of the iconic mini, I was inspired to create a personal look that incorporated my favorite accessories du jour. This is, in part, because the Hervé Léger dress is comfortable (more on that in a bit) and because its construct and very intention has evolved. \"The original bandage dress was a study in form and discipline,\" creative director Michelle Ochs tells Popsugar. \"Hervé's vision was to sculpt the body like a piece of art - his use of paneled, knit strips drew from couture techniques and a fascination with shape and structure. It wasn't just about sex appeal; it was about strength, symmetry, and empowerment. Over the past four decades, the silhouette has evolved with changing attitudes about femininity and self-expression. We're no longer bound by the idea of perfection - it's about ease, versatility, and individuality.\" Now, having worn the dress for a dinner date with my fiancé at Williamsburg hot spot Sungold, Ochs's sentiment very much resonates with me. Rather than being worried about defining lines, I felt confident in emphasizing my shape because it's mine. That change in perspective certainly took some time, but here we are 20 years later - when bandage dresses are so back - and I'm finally ready to offer my review. Expert Featured in This Article Michelle Ochs is the creative director of Hervé Léger and founder of Et Ochs. About the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress The dress is cut from gradient bandage paneling that's softer and more fluid than past designs. With a halter neckline, it's made to contour the body in zones of compression and release, lifting and shaping without boning or lining. It's made from 91 percent eco-friendly recycled rayon, eight percent nylon, and one percent spandex. It's available in bright blue or black and sizes XXS to XL. You can split your purchase into four interest-free payments through Klarna. What I Like About the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress At first touch, I was surprised by the clear quality and weight of Hervé Léger's bandage dress material. It doesn't feel at all like my old bandage skirts from college, which were stiff and paper-thin. Ochs explains, \"While the DNA remains, today's bandage is softer, more fluid, and reinterpreted through mixed media, matte jersey, and architectural tailoring. It's no longer just a dress, it's an attitude.\" In that regard, I definitely felt like my personal style was challenged the moment I slipped into The Elise. The design carries a certain energy that harks back to an early aughts party vibe, but feels versatile all the same - like I could easily team it with my vintage Gucci sandals and Jacquemus Rond Carré Shoulder Bag ($119 a month at Vivrelle) and still feel like me. While it definitely formed to my curves, which made me a bit self-conscious as I feasted on bucatini, strip steak, and focaccia, it simultaneously lifted with support, keeping that \"snatched\" feeling present on my night out. \"It's a meticulous process that involves mapping the body almost like an architect maps a blueprint,\" Ochs says of the magical effect I'm describing. \"Most high-street versions replicate the look, but not the performance. Ours is engineered to move with you while still sculpting the silhouette in a clean, elevated way.\" What to Consider Before Buying the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the high price point of The Elise (and all Hervé Léger bandage dresses for that matter), but as described above, there's no denying the craftsmanship that distinguishes this bandage dress as higher caliber, so it's unsurprising that the retail price reflects this. That being said, I wish there was a wider size range and hope the brand has plans to expand in the future. According to Ochs, \"Inclusivity and wearability are absolutely central to our evolution. We embrace curves!\" So far, Hervé Léger has introduced additional length options, sleeves, styles, and fabrications, including lightweight rib knits and stretch suiting that \"offer more ease without sacrificing structure.\" Ochs tells PS, \"Comfort and confidence aren't mutually exclusive; it's about giving women options that allow them to define sensuality on their own terms.\" Where Is the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress Available? The Hervé Léger Elise dress is available on the brand's website, at Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's. To get the look at a more affordable price point, rent a similar Hervé Léger Cross Back Mini Dress at Rent the Runway, or try the Akira Serpenti Plunge Mini Dress ($60), Meilun Celebrity Bandage Bodycon Dress ($67) or Superdown Isidora Strapless Mini Dress ($88).

Ochs explains, \u0026#34;While the DNA remains, today\u0026#39;s bandage is softer, more fluid, and reinterpreted through mixed media, matte jersey, and architectural tailoring. It\u0026#39;s no longer just a dress, it\u0026#39;s an attitude.\u0026#34; In that regard, I definitely felt like my personal style was challenged the moment I slipped into The Elise. The design carries a certain energy that harks back to an early aughts party vibe, but feels versatile all the same — like I could easily team it with my vintage Gucci sandals and \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vivrelle.com%2Fproducts%2Frond-carre-shoulder-bag\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49448552__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacquemus Rond Carré Shoulder Bag\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e ($119 a month at Vivrelle) and still feel like me.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vivrelle.com%2Fproducts%2Frond-carre-shoulder-bag\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49448552__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\" aria-label=\"\" data-vars-action=\"product image\" data-vars-retailer=\"vivrelle\" data-vars-price=\"$119\" data-vars-href=\"https://www.vivrelle.com/products/rond-carre-shoulder-bag\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ASlwjzwjZmiK1cfU4FXPtXr7EtM=/fit-in/516x516/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/24/713/n/44344577/shopjrqo8C.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-size=\"desktop\" width=\"258\" height=\"258\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ASlwjzwjZmiK1cfU4FXPtXr7EtM=/fit-in/516x516/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/24/713/n/44344577/shopjrqo8C.webp\" media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)\" data-size=\"tablet\" width=\"258\" height=\"258\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/BDQrfsTsIcfgXSVcflZTqrQ9sNE=/fit-in/700x700/filters:format_auto():extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/24/713/n/44344577/shopjrqo8C.webp\" media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" data-size=\"mobile\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/nhXGQCujsO_aW5KLrE17sWgTwaw=/fit-in/350x350/filters:format_auto():quality(70):extract_cover():upscale():fill(ffffff)/2025/06/24/713/n/44344577/shopjrqo8C.webp\" alt=\"Main Image\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eWhile it definitely formed to my curves, which made me a \u003cem\u003ebit\u003c/em\u003e self-conscious as I feasted on bucatini, strip steak, and focaccia, it simultaneously lifted with support, keeping that \u0026#34;snatched\u0026#34; feeling present on my night out. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s a meticulous process that involves mapping the body almost like an architect maps a blueprint,\u0026#34; Ochs says of the magical effect I\u0026#39;m describing. \u0026#34;Most high-street versions replicate the look, but not the performance.
