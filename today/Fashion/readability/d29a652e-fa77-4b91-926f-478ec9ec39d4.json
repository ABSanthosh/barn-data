  "text": "Q1 of 2025 has quickly come to a close, and you know what that means: the quarterly Lyst index is here. The report is composed of brand rankings, product insights, and consumer behavior analysis, making it a data-filled bible for fashion fans everywhere. So far in 2025, amidst turbulent industry musical chairs, customers doubled down on affordable everyday items, like COS’s barrel leg pants and Alo hoodies, leaning less towards office sirens and more towards practical officewear. Meanwhile, luxury led the charge for accessories, including Bottega Veneta’s oversized Knot sunglasses and Concert pouch, and it was another unsurprisingly popular year for the Andiamo clutch. But sensible clothing doesn’t have to mean boring—Puma’s Speedcat ballet flats were representative of everyone’s sudden craving for low-profile footwear. Sneaker ballerinas are everywhere, and Louis Vuitton, which recently launched its own iteration, has officially cemented the trend. Estrop//Getty ImagesSubtle, but powerful basics flooded the runways, like this structured suit from the Bottega Veneta spring 2025. collection. At the end of 2024, Miu Miu and Prada topped the charts, with Miu Miu holding on to the number-one slot for three out of four reports. Saint Laurent also had a strong year, sending shock waves of ’80s synth down the runway that seemed to reinvigorate the menswear-as-womenswear aesthetic, which plays nicely into buttondowns and padded shouldered suits both in and outside of the office. This year the house—led by Anthony Vaccarello, who was recently honored at the Fashion Trust U.S. Awards—once again held steady, landing at number three. One of its most popular items so far was the vanity bag, a retro-yet-functional accessory. Consumers also searched for this silhouette across brands like Loro Piana, Gucci, Alaïa, and Coach. Antoine Flament//Getty ImagesStatement accessories and strong shoulders on the Saint Laurent fall 2025 runway.Interestingly enough, Loewe rose three spots to claim Q1’s number-one seat. The sudden influx in interest is in part due to preemptive nostalgia for Jonathan Anderson’s tenure, after his departure was announced in April, with shoppers jumping to collect his pieces before they’re gone. Since then, it has been officially confirmed that Anderson will head over to Dior Men, and Proenza Schouler co-founders Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez will take his place. In the most surprising news, COS made an 11-point jump in the rankings, knocking Bottega Veneta out of sixth place. With a 44 percent increase in demand, this is the first time a mass-fashion brand has breached the top ten in Lyst index history. Additionally, Uniqlo’s $3.90 socks are the least expensive product to ever be featured—a possible sign we’re still on the lookout for those “recession indicators.”",
