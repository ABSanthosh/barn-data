If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.Military field jackets have occupied a key place in the men’s fashion world ever since they were first introduced by the US Army during WWII. As a key part of the US Military uniform for decades, the field jacket adorned the shoulder of many men during their service and  these soldiers grew to love the jackets for their comfort and functionality. We’re going to go on a deep dive into the 7 best field jackets over the course of this article. This list features both classic field jackets, which are either vintage originals or replicas of military jackets that were actually worn by soldiers, and modern takes of the field jacket (in which conventional brands create designs inspired by actual field jackets). I’m sure you’ll be able to find a design that scratches that itch to wear the best men’s field jacket you can possibly find. Let’s jump right into it. Key Takeaways I did a ton of research to find the best field jackets for you. But it was really fun research that involved digging into the military history of the M41 and M65 field jackets, as well as taking a look at what modern designers are creating from those inspirations. After all that research, I’ve decided to recommend Levi’s Men’s Washed Cotton Military Jacket as the overall best men’s field jacket. It’s a modern field jacket that does just about the best job I’ve seen of honoring the history of the field jacket while applying modern design principles. And, as a result of its material quality and how well it’s put together, this is a field jacket that can last you for a long time. I’d also like to mention the Alpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket, which is an incredibly faithful reproduction of the original M65, as well as the warm and cozy MADEPANTS Men’s Fishtail Hooded Parka Jacket that you can wear no matter how bad the weather looks. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs alino_who / Instagram Best Overall: Levi’s Men’s Washed Cotton Military Jacket Why it’s great: Levi’s Men’s Washed Cotton Military Jacket is at the top of this list of the best field jackets for the simple reason that it combines the classic and modern approach to these types of jackets in the best possible way. It’s made from a really hardy-washed cotton that’s not going to fray or tear anytime soon. And finally, since it’s cut according to modern design principles, it’s going to look snug in exactly the right places. Who is this for? If you want an authentic-looking field jacket but aren’t too hung up on getting an original army make/design, then this very well might be the best field jacket for you. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This jacket’s length is pretty short, stopping right at the waist, so it’s not the best option for anyone who’s looking for a mid-thigh or lower jacket. Fit: Tight/Standard | Length: Waist | Material: 100% Cotton  | Sizes: XS–5XL | Colors: 20 | Care: Machine Wash  Best Budget: WenVen Men’s Lightweight Military Style Jacket Why it’s great: Next up, we have the  WenVen Men’s Lightweight Military Style Jacket. It’s a great budget option that has a few notable features that really add to its value. First off, it has an interior windbreaker shell that will keep you feeling great even if there’s a cold wind blowing. In addition, it’s got a great array of interior and exterior snap pockets, meaning that you’ll have lots of space to carry whatever you need. Who is this for? I think that this is the best option for someone who’s on a budget but wants a really cool and well-made military jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Even though its water resistance is one of the selling points of the WenVen Men’s Lightweight Military Style Jacket, the fact that it doesn’t have a hood does undermine it a little bit. Fit: Standard | Length: Waist | Material: 100% thick cotton, poly cotton lining | Sizes: M–3XL | Colors: 5 | Care: Machine Wash  Best Luxury: Alpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket Why it’s great: Many of the military jacket aficionados will have been waiting for this entry on the list, the Alpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket. Unless you get incredibly lucky and find a military-issue M-65 at a surplus store (which is more or less impossible these days), this jacket from Alpha Industries is as close as you can get. It’s basically a perfect replica. Who is this for? This is definitely the option for those who want an actual field jacket that’s exactly like what marines and rangers would have worn in the field. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Because Alpha has put so much effort into recreating the M-65 (and used such great materials when making each jacket), the price tag is incredibly high for a garment that’s mostly made from cotton. Fit: Oversized | Length: Upper-thigh | Material: 50% cotton, 50% nylon (shell); 65% cotton, 35% polyester (lining) | Sizes: XS–3XL | Colors: 3 | Care: Machine Wash  Best on Amazon: EKLENTSON Men’s Cotton Lightweight Military Jacket Why it’s great: This product is an excellent modern take on the field jacket, bringing its own unique style to the party. Most notably, the EKLENTSON Men’s Cotton Lightweight Military Jacket features a standing collar to go along with the plethora of pockets that military jackets usually have. Who is this for? If you’re really needing a military-style jacket on short notice, you can use your Prime account to get this one in no time at all. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The way the collar on this military jacket looks is pretty cool, but it’s not even close to the types of collars that true field jackets have. Fit: Standard | Length: Waist | Material: 3% Elastane 98% Cotton  | Sizes: 40 x 70 | Colors: 3 | Care: Hand Wash Cold   Best M65 Field Jacket: Brandit Individual Wear Men’s M-65 Field Jacket Why it’s great: I really like the way that the Brandit Individual Wear Men’s M-65 Field Jacket has preserved the look of the original M-65s while adding some functional touches. The removable lining makes this a great jacket for all four seasons, meaning that you can really get the most out of it. Who is this for? This is an authentic-looking version of the M-65, and it boasts a couple of sewn-in badges that look super cool. If that’s up your alley, you can’t go wrong with the jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: There is a strange way in which this military jacket might look a little too retro for some. I’d recommend that you compare it to the Alpha Industries M-65 Field Jacket to get an idea of what I’m talking about. Fit: Oversized | Length: Mid-thigh | Material: 100% cotton | Sizes: S–3XL | Colors: 6 | Care: Hand Wash Only  Best Waterproof: Propper Men’s M65 Field Coat Why it’s great: Although the Propper Men’s M65 Field Coat Jacket has M65 in its name, I’d describe it as more of a rain jacket that’s inspired by the M65 than any kind of direct replica. There’s both a packable hood and a removable liner, which means that you have a lot of flexibility with how to set this jacket up to ensure that you’re comfortable. I also have to give a shout-out to the fact that they’ve made the jacket available in both short and long lengths. Who is this for? If your main motivation for getting a field jacket is to have something to wear in the rain, then I think you might have found the best modern field jacket for your needs. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I’m not a huge fan of how the camo color looks, but the three other color options are all great. Fit: Standard | Length: Waist or Lower-thigh | Material: 50% Nylon, 50% Cotton Sateen | Sizes: S–3XL | Colors: 4 | Care: Machine Wash  Best for Cold Weather: MADEPANTS Men’s Fishtail Hooded Parka Jacket Why it’s great: With a hood and lower-thigh length, the MADEPANTS Men’s Fishtail Hooded Parka Jacket is definitely more than able to keep you sheltered from the elements and warm. It also has a really unique look, with the designers almost going overboard on the oversized look. And, as a result, it fits so loosely that if it’s really, really cold out, you can always wear a thick sweater underneath for extra warmth. Who is this for? Anyone who gets cold in the winter and wishes that they could drape themselves in a huge, warm jacket should take a close look at this product. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I do wish that there were a couple more pockets on this one since that’s pretty key to the field jacket look, in my opinion. Fit: Oversized | Length: Lower-thigh | Material: 100% Cotton | Sizes: S–2XL | Colors: 2 | Care: Machine Wash  indigosea_garmentfactory / Instagram What Makes The Best Field Jackets for Men? Weight The weight of a military jacket, whether you’re talking about the best M65 field jacket out there or a modern rendition, makes a huge difference for when and where you can wear it. In general, field jackets tend to be on the heavier side since they’re made from thick canvas or similar materials. This weight adds to the distinctive feel of wearing a military jacket as well as keeps you warm. However, you can certainly find many different weights in the product category, especially when it comes to modern military jackets. Pick the weight that you think you’ll be most comfortable wearing. Material Composition Field jackets are usually made from canvas, which is a woven fabric that’s incredibly thick and durable. Canvas is usually made from cotton, but you can also make a slightly lighter version of it using linen. However, some of the jackets on this list (such as the WenVen Men’s Lightweight Military Style Jacket) are at least partially made from canvas that’s woven from both cotton and synthetic materials. This can increase how water-resistant the canvas is. Whether or not you should opt for a pure cotton or a cotton-synthetic blend depends on whether you want to use your new military jacket as your go-to raincoat. Fit \u0026 Rise Lastly, you should decide whether you want your new field jacket to be on the baggier side or more form-fitting. Although almost all field jackets are meant to be worn looser, you also have the option to go both oversized and a little bit tighter. In order to find a jacket that fits you exactly as you’d want it to, I’d recommend that you consult the sizing guide of any brand you’re thinking about ordering from and do some measurements if necessary. That’s the only way to be sure that you’ll get the right fit while shopping online. Additionally, you’ll need to think about exactly where you want the bottom of your jacket to stop. Many field jackets extend to about halfway down the hip; others stop on the waistline. tomoyoshi_takada / Instagram How We Chose Whenever I’m writing an article about a type of clothing that has some history behind it, I always make sure to respect the classics and the past. That means I don’t always have quite as much choice as a list about a newer category. After all, I knew I had no choice but to feature the M65 Field Jacket on the list, no matter what. As a result, I’d say that I chose products for lists like this one about the best field jackets with the goal of giving our readers a general understanding of the key moments in a long history. In addition, the quality and pedigree of a brand matter a lot, too, which is why we also consider the following factors when choosing products for our lists here on FashionBeans: Brand Reputation: I don’t ever like to recommend brands unless I can get clear confirmation that a brand has a track record of producing excellent quality products, either through my own experience as a customer or by reading the reviews of other people. Traditionalism: When I was researching replica M-65 field jackets for this list, I put a lot of effort into ensuring that they accurately reproduce what the original military jackets used to look and feel like.   Price: Last but certainly not least, I took a lot of care to ensure that all the products I’ve recommended are actually a good deal rather than overpriced or (even worse) a rip-off. Why Trust Us? We have a lot of talented editors on the FashionBeans editorial board, and every one of us has at least a couple of areas in which he’s the go-to expert. That’s why we can produce articles on everything from the men’s fashion of the 1960s and ’70s to the best spring jackets and the best camel coats. Whatever it is you’re reading about—including the top field jackets for men—you can be sure that there’s someone knowledgeable and passionate about that specific topic who wrote it. Furthermore, we use a highly collaborative process to ensure that we get the best out of all the knowledge and experience that our team holds. This involves everyone putting together an individual shortlist of their favorite products in a given category, and then the final version of the list gets figured out at an all-hands-on-deck meeting. There are sometimes some arguments and conflicts, but we believe that this process yields great lists of products and excellent fashion advice. Final Verdict  Overall, the Levi’s Men’s Washed Cotton Military Jacket is the best men’s field jacket that’s out there, in my humble opinion at least. I think it does an awesome job of updating the classic field jacket in light of newer trends in menswear while also staying true to the history of the field jacket. It’s the best of the old and the new, and I’d bet on you agreeing after you try one on. I’d also bet that you’d love how you looked in it. FAQ Well, most people would say that the American Military made the best M65 Field Jackets, but they don’t make them anymore. In fact, that’s why genuine surplus M65 field jackets are so highly sought after and so hard to find. As far as replicas go, you’ll usually hear names like Alpha, Brandit, and Cockpit USA mentioned, but there’s not really any consensus about which is best. Both a field jacket and a chore jacket are functional items of clothing made for a specific purpose. However, the purposes were definitely very different: field jackets were designed to be worn during military operations, while chore jackets are meant to be worn during physically demanding labor. Furthermore, modern chore jackets are most often made out of blue or black denim. A modern field jacket is best defined as an update on one of the classic army field jackets (like the M41 or the M65) made by a clothing brand. Crucially, these jackets are produced to be worn as a fashion statement rather than in combat, making them very different in their look and feel than the original ones.",

In general, field jackets tend to be on the heavier side since they’re made from thick canvas or similar materials. This weight adds to the distinctive feel of wearing a military jacket as well as keeps you warm. However, you can certainly find many different weights in the product category, especially when it comes to modern military jackets. Pick the weight that you think you’ll be most comfortable wearing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial Composition\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e \u003cp\u003eField jackets are usually made from canvas, which is a woven fabric that’s incredibly thick and durable. Canvas is usually made from cotton, but you can also make a slightly lighter version of it using linen. However, some of the jackets on this list (such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XT49K4L?\u0026amp;linkCode=ll1\u0026amp;tag=fsb_1180284-20\u0026amp;linkId=6acd085ca590ff8c348decabbaeb571c\u0026amp;language=en_US\u0026amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eWenVen Men’s Lightweight Military Style Jacket\u003c/a\u003e) are at least partially made from canvas that’s woven from both cotton and synthetic materials.

Although almost all field jackets are meant to be worn looser, you also have the option to go both oversized and a little bit tighter. In order to find a jacket that fits you exactly as you’d want it to, I’d recommend that you consult the sizing guide of any brand you’re thinking about ordering from and do some measurements if necessary. That’s the only way to be sure that you’ll get the right fit while shopping online.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAdditionally, you’ll need to think about exactly where you want the bottom of your jacket to stop.
