Second, the inescapable song of the summer, “Espresso,” by Sabrina Carpenter. And third, a “Saturday Night Live” sketch riffing on “Espresso” about a guy named Domingo. (Ariana Grande plays a maid of honor who reveals that the bride had an affair with a man named Domingo on her bachelorette trip.)What do all these things have in common? Great question. The answer is, quite possibly, the Jornsay-Silverberg sisters.In a recently released behind-the-scenes video, the “Saturday Night Live” writers Jimmy Fowlie and Ceara O’Sullivan discussed their inspiration for the beloved Domingo sketch.“There is a video of a girl at her sister’s wedding doing a speech and she does a ‘Hamilton’ rap,” Mr. Fowlie said. “If you’re that girl and you’re seeing this, I can’t even tell you how much joy the video’s brought me. I’m so glad you did it, because it inspired this.”On TikTok, Julia Jornsay-Silverberg, a 35-year-old social media marketer who lives in Buffalo, wondered if Mr. Fowlie might be talking about her wedding last August.During the reception, her older sister, Sarah Jornsay-Silverberg, 40, had given a toast that would be hard to forget. In what eventually became a widely-shared video of its own, she performed a parody of the song “Satisfied” from “Hamilton,” swapping out the lyrics about the founding father to lines about her younger sister and her husband and their lives.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
