  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley LyndesImage Source: Brian Babineau | NBAE via Getty Images If you've spent any time on TikTok lately, you've definitely seen it - Kendall Jenner rocking a $2 Hanes tank top at Game 4 of the Eastern Conference NBA Semifinals. Yep, you read that right: two dollars. Naturally, I had to know everything about this viral wardrobe moment. In classic Jenner style, she made the simple Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank ($10) look effortlessly chic. TikTok star Tinx first blew the lid off Jenner's budget-friendly secret by finding the exact tank and sharing with her followers. \"I was obsessed with this pic because Kendall's white tank is perfect,\" she said in her TikTok. \"I asked my shopaholic community, 'Where's it from?' They all said Hanes. I'm 99% sure it's a Hanes Boys Tank.\" A boys tank? Say what? I was shook. How could something so basic be so iconic? After some serious sleuthing, I tracked down the viral Hanes tank - a kids' size, no less - and I had to try it. Spoiler alert: Tinx was absolutely right. This tank is a must. It's the perfect sheer balance, comes in a five-pack, and costs next to nothing. So naturally, I'm wearing it everywhere. Seriously, it's about to become your new favorite wardrobe essential. @tinx #greenscreen ♬ original sound - Tinx What I Like About the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Aside from the unbeatable price, there's honestly a lot to love about this ribbed white tank. For starters, the cut does something my usual tanks just don't. That swooped neckline? It somehow makes the whole thing look effortlessly chic. Plus, it goes with anything. Sweatpants? Definitely. Denim shorts? Obviously. A skirt and some jewelry? Absolutely. Case in point: Jenner styled hers with leather pants, and it looks totally high fashion. Another thing - I'm not the neatest eater, and when I drop $20-$30 on a tank from somewhere like Zara, I basically count it as a one-wear risk (especially in white). But with this? I've got four more in the pack. Worst-case scenario, I just grab another set on Amazon. No stress. What to Consider Before Buying the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes First off, this is technically a boys' tank top. It comes pre-shrunk in a pack of five. I got mine in an XL, but probably could've gone with a large (that's what Tinx got, and hers fits perfectly). The fabric is thin, but the 50% cotton, 50% polyester blend has a good amount of stretch, so it'll give if you need it to. It also features a double-ply neckband and moisture-wicking technology to keep you cool on hot days. Now, if the boys' sizing feels a little too risky, Hanes makes a Women's Originals Knit Cotton Rib Tank Pack ($13), which I also own and can confirm I like just as much. They're not quite as sheer either. The takeaway? You don't need to spend $$ on ribbed white tank tops. Take a page from Jenner's book - even a kids' version can work. Who Is Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Best For? If you're into that effortless, model-off-duty vibe Jenner always nails, this tank is for you. It's a super simple piece, but it still feels cool - like you just threw it on and somehow look pulled together. It's great for anyone who wants to hop on a viral trend without dropping $$$. The fit has that slightly shrunken, vintage feel (because yes, it's technically a boys' tank), and the neckline gives it just the right amount of edge. It also layers really well - under an open button-down, with a blazer, whatever. Or you can just wear it with sweats and call it a day. No wrong answers here. Additional Details The Hanes Boys Tank comes in sizes XS–XL and is sold in a five-pack. Each ribbed tank is pre-shrunk, so it holds its shape wash after wash. It's designed with a tagless interior - aka, no itching. Made from lightweight fabric, it's perfect for hot summer days. Where Is the Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank Available? The Hanes Ecosmart Cotton Tank is available on the brand's website, Amazon, Walmart, Kohls, and more.
