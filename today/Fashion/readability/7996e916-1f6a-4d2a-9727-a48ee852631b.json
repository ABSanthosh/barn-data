But swooning heroines are not the only ones who love the look. So do autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un — and so, apparently, does President Trump, who has fantasized about a military parade since his first term, when he was publicly taken by the spectacle of the Bastille Day parade in Paris featuring soldiers in all their spit-shined glory marching down the Champs-Élysées.Well, on Saturday he will get his wish, just in time for his 79th birthday, which happens to coincide with the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army. Not to mention Flag Day.Top row: Vladimir Putin after the Victory Day parade in Red Square in 2019; Russian howitzers at the parade.

General, what’s going on over here? Looks like all a bunch of male models.”Of course, there are women at West Point, though they are a minority, and they will be in the parade.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
