If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as the outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and wow factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a sherpa coat or the sporty edge of a puffer, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. This season, the top coat is getting a modern twist with ladylike details and cape silhouettes, while classics like suede jackets and wool coats hold their ground (though not without fresh updates — we see you, scarf jackets). Trends like the utilitarian barn jacket and bombers are vying for the spotlight, too, feeling particularly on-point in less brutal climates. (Hello, LA winter.) As far as specific items go, fan favorites like the Aritzia slouch coat, the North Face puffer, and Lululemon puffer jacket prove that staying warm doesn’t mean compromising on style. For those craving luxe touches, a Zara fur coat, teddy-like UGG coat, and Barbour wax jacket offer elevated spins on seasonal staples. Whether you’re bundling up, keeping it tailored, or planning out party outfits, our picks ahead make braving the cold downright fun. DashDividers_1_500x100 Faux-Fur Coats Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. From Zara’s cropped silhouette to Ganni’s playful leopard print, these jackets balance boldness with cozy comfort. They’re perfect for pairing with denim or a party dress. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Jackets The puffer jacket is a winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool. From The North Face’s iconic 1996 Retro Nuptse to Lululemon’s sleek transformable design and Hollister’s faux-fur-lined option, these go with everything, from comfy travel pants to festive outfits (or sweats when you’re keeping it lounge-y). Fully lean into the vibe with coordinating puffer boots — bold, baby.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Sherpa Coats Sherpa coats bring a plush, textural twist to cold-weather layering. From statement designs like Oak + Fort’s checkered style to timeless teddy silhouettes like UGG’s Gertrude, they’re ideal for adding warmth and personality to your winter wardrobe. And if you’ve been eyeing the ever-popular Aritzia wool coats, a nubby sherpa version is the ultimate upgrade. DashDividers_1_500x100 Barn Jackets The barn jacket brings a workwear-inspired twist to winter wardrobes. From Barbour’s classic waxed version to Alex Mill’s modern red take, these balance pragmatism and style. We love them layered over chunky knits or paired with tailored separates for contrast. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ladylike Wool Coats Curved lines, sharp collars, and sleek details give classic wool coats a fresh spin this season. Look at Reformation’s bow-tied jacket or Madewell’s bold red design — they’re ladylike, minimal, and anything but boring (especially if you go bold by styling yours alongside the dress-over pants trend).  DashDividers_1_500x100 Leather Coats Leather coats are a closet mainstay for a reason: They do the most (in a good way). Plush-lined styles (like Abercrombie’s utility trucker) bring serious warmth for frigid days, while lightweight options (like Wray’s vegan leather blazer) are just the thing for milder temps. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cape Coats Cape coats are one of those runway trends that are actually wearable IRL. From Dôen’s plaid take to Banana Republic’s bright red number (hitting two trends at once), these styles deliver drama with a polished sensibility. DashDividers_1_500x100 Scarf Coats Scarf coats are multitaskers, keeping you warm without the fuss of extra layers. They’re a great outfit hack for dialing up any look — even jeans and sweatsuits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Jackets Suede jackets are stepping it up with fun, vibrant shades this winter, like Urban Outfitters’ cobalt blue style. A classic refreshed for those who like their layers with a little more personality. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bomber Jackets Bomber jackets are getting a sport-luxe makeover with padded and quilted designs (perfect for brisk chills), slouchy faux leather (bonus points for trendy colors like burgundy), and even reversible options (who doesn’t love a two-fer?). Style them over clingy knits with jeans and a statement belt for an “I tried, but not too hard” nonchalance. Like what you see?
