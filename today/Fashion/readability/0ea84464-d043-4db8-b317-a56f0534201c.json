If you’re faithful to the iconic preppy label but want to branch out, there are plenty of brands like Lacoste out there. In lieu of their 90th anniversary, it couldn’t be a better time to pay homage to the heritage brand while also checking out alternatives that may offer something slightly different at varying price points. The brand got put on the map in the late 1970s and ’80s, but its origins reach all the way back to the ’30s when tennis legend and genius inventor Rene Lacoste turned his nickname into Lacoste. He was the first one to put a logo on a garment, giving us the infamous crocodile tennis polo, starting a journey that even today combines advancements in tech sports gear with stylish fashion. There are other brands that boast similar roots. Some make gear for specific sports that double as fashion trends; others have gone on to define what it means to be a prep, a wasp, and define a major facet of American and British fashion. Let’s take a peek at the 10 Lacoste-like brands below. Key Takeaways  For this quest, I began by poring over hundreds of brand and customer reviews and sifted through the best-selling fashion and sportswear brands until I whittled it down to the 10 finalists you see on this list. Overall, the best brand like Lacoste is FILA because it’s trendy, well-made sportswear with a major emphasis on tech. For a less sporty, still very preppy offering, check out US Polo Assn. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs View More On Wahts Best Overall: FILA Why this brand is great: Much like Lacoste, FILA is also rich in sports history. Established in 1911, FILA also became popular in the ’80s, having its moment in the trendy spotlight and now finding itself a solid, established brand in the sportswear/athleisure department renowned worldwide for its quality. They always focus on tech first, so no matter how attractive a pair of sweatpants, golf shorts, or tennis shirts may appear, you’re going to love the way it feels when you wear it. Why I highlighted this product: Combining a timeless vintage look with the best technology of today, this performance polo is perfect for the tennis prepster. Coming in four classic colors, this iconic 1975 tee is perfect for the court. It’s sweat-wicking, offers UV sun protection, and is manufactured with antimicrobial properties to keep unwanted odors at bay. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although it’s certainly a trendy sports brand, it might not carry the same ‘high-end’ feel as Lacoste. Best Everyday: Wahts Why this brand is great: A truly modern brand, Wahts offers preppy mainstays with a more youthful and trendy appeal. Fifteen years ago, the Dutch founder, a Silicon Valley innovator, noticed the casual nature of tech business wear and wanted to capitalize on the change in fashion. Today, the brand combines technical fabrics with luxurious materials in classic silhouettes and sustainable practices to give you the ‘new classic,’ combining fashion with functionality and versatility. Why I highlighted this product: A clean and casual yet elevated pair of shorts is what every prepster needs. You can even dress this pair up with some loafers if need be. With a relaxed, contemporary fit, they’re made from a sophisticated cotton pique fabric that makes them so easy to slide on in the morning without feeling too slouchy or casual. I love the elastic waist and hidden zip side pockets for a lean silhouette. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Lacoste is a rather logo-heavy brand, whereas Wahts is pretty clean and simple. Best Polo: Collars \u0026 Co. Why this brand is great: Polished yet comfortable, Collars \u0026 Co. has found a way to make dressing in a collared shirt for work actually bearable. The brand prides itself on high-quality materials, excellent fit, and those small details that really make its polo shirt better than the rest. Born out of the struggle of one working professional to combine style and comfort, it was first spotted (and funded) on Shark Tank. Now, you can buy their classic men’s preppy style or peruse their features in all of the major men’s magazines. Why I highlighted this product: Based on the Italian quiet luxury trend (a must-have for a true wasp), the Portofino Pique Cotton Polo is just as technically savvy as it is cozy. It’s got an attractive shape with just the right fit at the arms and the perfect amount of drape throughout the body. The elegant cotton pique is a luxury textured pattern that combines style with durability. It’s super soft, breathable, hypoallergenic, and feels amazing on the skin. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The material on some of their polos appears shiny in certain lights. Best Bags: Roderer Why this brand is great: If you typically turn to Lacoste for accessories, then you might also like Roderer. Launched in Dubai in 2016 under the ‘less is more’ concept, the brand is all about having fewer items but investing in high-quality, well-made goods with a clean, timeless aesthetic. Similar in product range, size, shape, and look to Lacoste, these bags are true luxury essentials, focusing on that understated, minimalist sophistication that’s all the rage these days. Why I highlighted this product: Much like Lacoste’s messenger bags, the Award bag is stylish, compact, and highly versatile. It’s made from gorgeous handmade, soft-grain Italian leather and is clean save for the silver hardware and silver steel logo discreetly placed on its front. Fits both an iPad and a laptop and also comes in a mini size for shorter, playful excursions. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The price point is a bit higher than Lacoste here, but it gives you the same feel and something slightly different than the masses. Best Sneaker: Tropicfeel Why this brand is great: If you love turning to Lacoste for your kicks, then you might also like Tropicfeel. These sneakers carry the same preppy profile and trend-worthy silhouettes. As much as Lacoste is a heritage brand and banks on tradition, they are also no stranger to innovation and undergoes constant updates to feel fresh. Enter Tropicfeel. The brand is pretty new but places a high emphasis on highly functional travel and sports gear with a nice, timeless flair to boot. Plus, I love their massive focus on sustainability and transparency as a certified B-Corp. Why I highlighted this product: The perfect Americana shoe for the casual prep, the Sunset AC75 sneaker, which is part of their Sunset America’s Cup edition, comes in multiple colors, but I love it in navy with white and red shoelace holes. Boasting thousands of stellar reviews and an excellent price point, it quickly transforms into a snug slipper for serious beach vibes. I love that it’s super lightweight, water-friendly, and slip-resistant, plus it’s anti-bacterial for odor control. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although you can get shoes and some travel gear here, the wide range of clothing available at Lacoste isn’t found here. Best on Amazon: Vineyard Vines Why this brand is great: As the official style of the Kentucky Derby, the Premier Lacrosse League, and head of the Charles Regatta, Vineyard Vines, it’s safe to say, has preppy down pat. It’s been seen on the likes of Barack Obama and Prince Harry, just in case you need another stamp of approval. Family-owned and operated since 1998, this brand offers good-quality performance gear, comfy layers, preppy basics, and swimwear for the whole family. Why I highlighted this product: I really like their T-shirts, especially the short-sleeved vintage tee with a whale pocket. It comes in several colors and is made from 100% soft-washed cotton for that lived-in, super comfortable feeling. Perfect if you want to rock a tee from a brand like Lacoste. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although certainly good quality, some feel that it’s somewhat overpriced. Best Budget: US Polo Assn. Why this brand is great: With a history reaching back to the 1880s, even farther than Lacoste, US Polo Assn gets its sporty start in the game of polo (in fact, all of their products are sanctioned by the United States Polo Association, the governing body for the sport of polo since 1890). Much like Lacoste, this brand gives you that prep school, waspy look for less, offering pants, polos, tees, and even swimwear. Why I highlighted this product: They have a lot of great polos for the prepsters, but I love this striped pique shirt because of the fine quality of its cotton and the printed chest stripes that have a sporty feel. It’s attractive, it’s easy to wear with khakis, shorts, or jeans, and it even comes in pink. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This brand is more affordable than Lacoste, but I wish that they were transparent about the materials they used. Best Luxury: Polo Ralph Lauren Why this brand is great: I probably don’t need to tell you that Ralph Lauren is one of the most iconic brands on the planet. A true arbiter of American fashion and preppy chic style, it’s a global leader with over 50 years of distinction. They offer several different lines, from designer ready-to-wear straight from the runway to the more casual offerings of the Polo line, which bears a high resemblance to Lacoste in their ability to transform sports clothes into fashion trends. Why I highlighted this product: I just had to showcase their Olympic inspired Polo Shirt because of its emphasis on sport. With a slim fit and trendy color blocking, it’s a part of the Summer Olympics Collection, so it has that slightly exclusive feel. It’s got all the right preppy details, from an official tournament logo, a signature pony logo on the chest, and large ribbed cuffs for scrunching and styling. Made of recycled poly, it’s got an eco flair and is great for sport thanks to stretch mesh and moisture-wicking properties. Flaws but not deal-breakers: You truly can’t go wrong with the classy, elegant Ralph Lauren, but the price point may be too steep for some. Best Performance: Wilson Why this brand is great: Ah, another true heritage brand. Founded in 1914 in Chicago, Wilson is the manufacturer of high-performance sports equipment, apparel, footwear, and accessories. (I always think of their tennis balls). Plus, they’ve maintained one of the longest-standing brand partnerships in sports—with the NFL. So even though sport comes to mind before fashion when it comes to Wilson, the brand actually sits at that perfect intersection of trend and functionality, thanks to the major uptick in streetwear and athleisure. Why I highlighted this product: No matter how trendy or cool, Wilson never crafts a piece of clothing just for looks. The parkside half-zip pullover is just as handy for sport as it is for fashion, thanks to anti-odor, quick-drying, and breathable technology. Both light and soft, it’s made from a combo of cotton, poly, and viscose, which helps it maintain shape retention. This sweatshirt is in it for the long haul. Flaws but not deal-breakers: They may not have the trend power of Lacoste or carry the same high-end feel, but they do make plenty of fashionable athleisure outfits and lots of sports clothes you can count on. Best Quality: Peter Millar Why this brand is great: Though somewhat expensive, Peter Millar is a very high-quality brand that offers well-tailored clothes for the prepster and Southern gentleman. The company began in 2001 with a single cashmere sweater—the ultimate symbol of the wasp. Since then, they’ve offered luxury, elegance, and superior craftsmanship in their ready-to-wear, performance sportswear, and resort apparel. Because their clothes will last you for years, I consider them an investment brand. Why I highlighted this product: If you need something to wear on the golf course, then consider the Shackleford Performance Hybrid Short. They come in five colors for easy styling and boast a classic fit and lots of versatility. This comes down to the four-way stretch mobility and water resistance, which helps you take this short from the green to having a scotch at the club to a jump in the pool (yes, they double as swim trunks). Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although Lacoste maintains a youthful feel, Peter Millar feels somewhat more mature and not as trendy. View More On Collars \u0026 Co. Buying Considerations for Brands Like Lacoste Heritage Not all brands like Lacoste need to be a heritage brand with dozens of years of history, but it certainly helps. Being able to trace back a brand’s roots to its origins in sport gives us context, informs the brand’s dedication to performance, a big aspect of athleisure companies like Lacoste, and lets us know that the clothes will be comfortable and are worthy of wear. Some of the brands on this list are new, which is totally fine, but they all place an emphasis on high-quality materials, sustainability, and timeless preppy styles you can count on. Performance  Although the fashion polo is one of Lacoste’s shining products, what really keeps customers coming back for more is their performance gear. Even the clothes that are meant for fashion contain elements of enhanced wearability, whether it be high-quality, breathable fabrics or even water and anti-microbial elements. All of the brands like Lacoste that I considered are exceptionally comfortable and durable, combining style with functionality. Price Lacoste is on the low end of luxury, sitting comfortably at a middle price point, though it carries an exclusive feel. I tried to focus on a wide range of price points, so luckily, you can pretty much pick from any of the brands like Lacoste on this list. Some are more affordable than others, with Ralph Lauren sitting at the top—but not too out of reach. View More On Tropicfeel How We Chose  Lots of Lacoste-like brands claim to make fashionable, preppy clothes with performance and functionality at their heart, but sometimes, these claims just don’t hold up. So, wherever possible, I chose brands that are highly reputable, carry some element of sport or performance in their brand identity, and pride themselves on quality and functionality. I also sifted through hundreds of customer reviews and combed through the best fashion forums, landing on my top 10 by selecting brands that people rate highly and would likely buy again. Price: Does the brand promise lots of clean-cut, preppy styles, but the price is through the roof? I pay attention to the value a product brings and decide if its price measures up. Variety: If a brand offers preppy styles and performance wear, then it makes the list. I need to see a combo of both fashion and function to deem a brand like Lacoste. Brand Reputation: How do people feel about a brand over time? If it’s not beloved, with excellent customer service and a positive image in society’s consciousness, then it’s not making the cut.

Trust Rachel to bring you everything fashion, including the best sporty-preppy brands out there. Final Verdict  Brands like Lacoste should carry the same preppy, classic waspy style with a sporty twist. My top pick is FILA because it’s also a heritage brand steeped in sports tradition, places emphasis on tech as well as style, and is very on-trend. FAQ Brands like FILA, Polo Ralph Lauren, Vineyard Vines, Brooks Brothers, and Tommy Hilfiger compete with Lacoste. While pricier than many high street brands, Lacoste is not a luxury brand. Their goods are costly because they’re made with high-quality materials and come with an iconic status.
