While there’s plenty to look forward to during the holiday season, it’s also the most hectic time of the year as you scramble to collect gifts for everyone on your wishlist, attend an unyielding number of social obligations, and strive to look your best for every event on your calendar. Because god forbid you show up to your family’s Christmas dinner sporting five o’clock shadow. But contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a complicated grooming routine to look good. In fact, the most simple steps in everyday care can have the largest impact on your appearance, well-being, and overall confidence. To look your best throughout the holiday rush, Manscape’s Chairman™ Pro Package is the only tool you need in your arsenal. Whether you use it yourself or gift it to a loved one, Manscaped has pulled out all the stops to ensure you look sharp amid a crazed festive season. Keep reading to discover why the Chairman™ Pro Package is our secret weapon this year. In This ArticleGrooming is EssentialThe Chairman™ Pro PackageGrooming RoutineWhy It Stands OutReady to Gift Why Grooming is Essential for the Holidays There’s always that one scruffy cousin who plops down at the Christmas table, hair mussed up, a raggedy beard growing, and a faint scent of pot clinging to his clothes (no? Only my family?). Met with stares and sighs of judgment – why couldn’t he shave for one day of the year? – let’s just say… you don’t want to be that cousin Beyond what others think, the holidays are a time to put your best foot forward, if not only for yourself. Nothing boosts confidence like being dressed to the nines with a freshly shaved face. And when you feel like your most confident self, you’re ready to make a lasting impression, be it at the family dinner table, the office holiday party, or Secret Santa with friends. Staying well groomed during the holidays doesn’t have to be a hassle. You don’t need to spend hours in front of the mirror before heading to your relatives or a full cabinet of products to achieve a sleek look. In fact, the biggest impact you can have on your appearance is simply a solid shave. The Chairman™ Pro Package: The Perfect Holiday Gift Manscaped For yourself or an unkempt loved one, the Chairman™ Pro Package is a standout holiday gift. Considering it’s actually useful, you can rest assured it won’t collect dust in the back of someone’s closet or, worse, get regifted next year *shudders*. Aside from the premium quality of the products inside, the package includes everything needed in a single kit for easy gifting. It comes complete with a stylish travel case to take on the go – prime for the gifter who hates wrapping presents. Manscaped goes beyond a classic manscaping trimmer with this one, making it well worth the wishlist. It’s packed with features that set it apart from standard shavers, like a fully waterproof design, an LED spotlight, SkinSafe® technology to do away with pulling, and a FlexAdjust pivoting head that follows the contours of the face. With a 75 minute runtime, you can spend less time charging and more time shaving, especially if you’re traveling during the holiday season. It’s a stellar option for guys with sensitive skin, men on the move, or anyone tired of replacing their electric shavers on an annual basis. My bald boyfriend has run through at least a dozen electric shavers in the past six years. I gift him one every birthday and holiday in hopes that it will make a difference in his grooming routine. Spoiler: they always die within a year. Always. But this season, he’s getting Manscaped’s Chairman™ Pro Package so that I can finally think of a better gift idea next year. Holiday Grooming Routine Made Easy Manscaped The Chairman™ Pro Package takes the guesswork out of an impactful grooming routine and is the ultimate choice for a Christmas gift. Complete with everything necessary to achieve a barbershop quality shave on the head or face, it’s the ultimate way to look your best without overcomplicating things. The package includes three products: Chairman™ Pro Electric Foil Shaver Power Shave Gel Soother Aftershave Serum Together, they form a simple, quick grooming system that reduces irritation and enhances results. Talk about useful for the busy holiday season. Here’s how the Chairman™ Pro Package works as a three step system: Step 1: Lather up with Manscaped’s Power Shave Gel. This can be used on both your face and head if you’re gunning for a Mr. Clean look. It’s ideal for sensitive skin with the inclusion of witch hazel, apple extract, and white willow bark, and results in a close, smooth shave. Step 2: Get buzzing with the Chairman™ Pro Electric Foil Shaver. With interchangeable heads, you can achieve the exact length you want, from sexy subtle stubble to a fresh baby face. Best of all, the shaver is engineered to cut down on friction and contour with your face so you won’t be sporting red, irritated skin at Christmas dinner. Step 3: Finish off with the Face Shave Aftershave Serum, designed with liquid exfoliants to lift shaving debris and leave your skin smooth and hydrated. It includes innovative ingredients like red algae, menthyl, and vitamin B3, and it also smells great if you’ll be cozying up with someone around the fire… Why Manscaped Stands Out Manscaped Rather than pumping out thousands of products like major grooming brands, Manscaped focuses on what really matters: high quality solutions that help men look and feel their very best. With a specific concentration on grooming for guys, Manscaped engineers top of the line ethical and dermatologically tested products. The entire range skips out on harmful ingredients and is vegan, cruelty-free, alcohol-free, and paraben-free, making it well suited to men with all skin types. Finished with a luxurious, fresh green, and light wood scent, the Manscaped line is a far cry from drugstore products clogging up your bathroom counter. The Chairman™ Pro Package is well worth snapping up to make a real difference in a grooming routine during the holidays and every other day, too. Ready to Gift? Dads, brothers, friends, boyfriends, situationships, and beyond, Manscaped is the go-to destination for premium holiday grooming gifts for guys. These products say, “I care about you more than a trip to CVS,” while still maintaining an affordable price point. The Chairman™ Pro Package is the ultimate gift for the well groomed man, and for even more impact, bundle it with other Manscaped products like The Lawn Mower 5.0 or the Crop Preserver for a full set of holiday grooming essentials. Regardless of what you choose, a holiday grooming kit from Manscaped is the gift that keeps on giving.
