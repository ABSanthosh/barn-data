Kennedy when he was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963.As she sauntered, casual but determined, along streets filled with passers-by, Ms. Badu performed a slow-motion striptease, gradually shedding her hoodie, shirt, sneakers and then underclothes before collapsing to the ground naked, as if she had been shot. Drawn across Ms. Badu’s back was a single word: Evolution.Few performing artists have been more committed to the concept of evolution than Ms. Badu, 53, who later explained to her numerous critics that the video was not a stunt, but a sincere act of protest against cultural conformity.“I know I don’t always have the most popular positions,” Ms. Badu said by phone from Los Angeles. “And it can be offensive to be not conforming. But I’ve always been that kind of human; I’ve never been anything other than that.”ImageMs. Badu and Francesco Risso attending the Met Gala together in 2022.Credit...Nina Westervelt/The New York TimesFor that reason alone, the timing seems more apt than ever for Ms. Badu to receive the ultimate fashion recognition: On Monday night at the Museum of Natural History in New York, she will receive the fashion icon award by the Council of Fashion Designers of America.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
