  "description": "In my world, some things are inevitable come fall: cooler temperatures, pumpkin spice products consuming my local Trader Joe's, my mom playing Christmas music in her car as early as September, and - perhaps most predictable of all - me buying a new Free People jacket that I'll wear through the new year. While some people might kickstart their autumnal festivities with an apple-picking excursion, my fall doesn't really begin until I've added a cozy, new Free People style to my closet. Last year's elected favorite was none other than the Pippa Packable Puffer Jacket - which is still my go-to travel jacket. My style of choice this season, however, is the Free People Chloe Jacket ($198). I'm far from the first person to fall in love with the comfy jacket; not only has it been bubbling up on TikTok, but the topper is also regarded as one of Free People's bestselling styles. With its flattering fit, quilted composition, and wide array of pattern options, it's not hard to see why this statement piece has garnered so much attention - along with a permanent spot in my wardrobe. Ahead, I break down what makes this Free People jacket one of fall 2024's best coats. What I Like About Free People's Chloe Jacket First and foremost, I love just how endlessly comfortable this jacket is. It's made from a lightweight cotton and rayon material, with a polyester filling that's plush and squishy; it's like getting all the benefits of a cozy down jacket rolled into the structure of a chunky cardigan. The material isn't so heavy that I feel overwhelmed or constricted, but it's also just thick enough to where I can comfortably wear it in lower winter temperatures. This jacket's styling versatility is also endless - whether I want to layer it with a basic T-shirt or team it with a bulky sweater, the product's oversize fit makes it functional enough to work with so many different clothing types. And I appreciate that despite having a steeper price tag, I feel like I'm getting the most for my money with this Free People jacket. I've been wearing it nonstop already this fall (even in 70-degree temperatures) and I know that I'll have no issue wearing it throughout the colder winter months, too. With its floral design, I could probably even get away with donning it throughout the spring season! Its lightweight build is so unique, I honestly forget that I'm often wearing a jacket at all. Plus, the style's packable design makes it a great option for travel. Whether I'm embarking on a road trip or jet setting to another country, it's a style that doesn't take up too much packing space in my carry-on suitcase. What's Worth Noting Unlike traditional zippered or button-down jackets, this style is fitted with hook closure accents, which keep both sides of the jacket pulled together for a more closed-in look. On occasion, the hooks will unlatch and I'll have to reattach them; overall, I find myself fidgeting with this jacket more as opposed to standard zippered styles. Additionally, because of its dolman silhouette, the layer also has a boxier design. The looser fit gives the jacket a lived-in feel that I enjoy, but other reviewers noted it was a bit too oversize for their preferences. I recommend referencing Free People's style guide to source your perfect size, and consider sizing down if you're concerned about it being too large on you. Who Is Free People's Chloe Jacket Best For? If you're in the market for a style that you can comfortably wear through even the most confusing transitional weather - from chilled mornings to warm afternoons and cold nights - this Free People jacket will be your new go-to. It's breathable enough that you won't feel bogged down by heavy material, but its quilted design also ensures ample warmth and insulation in lower temperatures. With a wide variety of pattern and color options, you won't have any trouble finding your dream style - or even stocking up on the jacket in multiple variations (because the more, the merrier!). Additional Details The jacket is available in US women's sizes XS through XL. It comes in 12 different pattern and color options, including a checkered black and white style, striped red and brown variation, and a floral maroon combo (my print of choice). This jacket is crafted from a quilted fabrication that's plush and surprisingly warm, with an insulated design that'll help users stay warm in brisk seasonal temperatures.
