  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I'll admit it: low-rise jeans don't exactly inspire excitement. In fact, most people still associate them with the early 2000s - when Britney Spears' butt crack was practically a pop culture mascot. Not exactly a golden era for denim (especially for those of us who tried to pull it off). But here's the thing: the low-rise trend is back, and this time, it's different. Today's version isn't about skin-tight jeans paired with baby tees. It's more laid-back - think beachy, baggy jeans that feel effortlessly cool rather than constricting. That shift alone was enough to get me curious. And eventually, it got me to buy a pair. Enter: Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans ($148). The only low-rise jeans I own - and honestly, the reason I'm about to own more. There's something about the cut, the fit, the vibe . . . they just work. I reach for them constantly, and I'm not looking back. What I Like About the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans You know the look the second you see them: the relaxed straight leg, frayed hems, a little distressing - these jeans are a total 2000s throwback, but in the best way. They've got that effortless style, but with a looser fit that feels way more current (and way less scary to wear). I throw them on all the time, not just because they're cool, but because they go with literally everything. Blazer and boots? Done. Tank top and Birks? Easy. They somehow manage to feel put-together without trying too hard. And the best part? They're made from 100% Japanese cotton, so they actually hold their shape. No weird bagging, no stretching out. Just great jeans that I can always count on. Not to mention they wash like a dream - I just air dry them, and they're back to looking brand new (but still retro). What to Consider Before Buying the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans 100% cotton denim definitely isn't for everyone. Personally, I prefer it because it holds its shape for as long as I own the jeans - no sagging, no stretching out in weird places. And over time, the Madewell Dean Easy Straight jeans mold to your body and feel more natural. Still, no stretch means no (immediate) give, so if stretchy jeans are your preference, I'd recommend Madewell Tapered Denim Trousers ($50, originally $148) instead. Who Are the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Best For? If you prefer structure over stretch and appreciate jeans that hold their shape over time, these are for you. They're especially great if you're into relaxed styling - think oversized button-downs, boxy tees, and effortless layers - but still want to look put-together. The low-rise fit and straight leg give off major early 2000s energy, but with a more modern, wearable update. Bonus: they're available in multiple washes and lengths, making them a solid option for a range of body types and personal styles. If you're someone who leans minimalist, likes a no-fuss fit, and doesn't mind a little break-in time, you'll probably live in these. Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes Are Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Worth the Splurge? For the price, Madewell is competing with other premium denim brands, and I'd say they've earned their place. These jeans truly deliver on the \"premium\" label. Not only do they offer a relaxed, timeless style, but they're also made from high-quality Regenagri-certified cotton, meaning they're produced with regenerative farming practices that support environmental sustainability. Beyond that, they hold up beautifully over time. With proper care, these jeans will last for years, both in terms of fit and appearance. Additional Details Made with Regenagri-certified cotton, produced using regenerative farming practices that promote environmental sustainability. Low-slung fit, sitting comfortably on the hips Available in two washes: Monessen and Shibori. Sizing ranges from 23 to 33 in standard, petite, and tall options. Features a button fly and is machine washable for easy care. Where Are Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Available? You can shop these jeans directly from Madewell or at Nordstrom. Rating: PS - Shop Something Related A few other bestsellers from Madewell include Madewell Darted Barrel Leg Jeans ($138) and Madewell Perfect Vintage Wide Leg Crop Jeans ($138) which are worth giving a try for trendy styles you'll find just as comfortable.
