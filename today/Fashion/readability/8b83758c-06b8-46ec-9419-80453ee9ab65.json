Other retailers such as John Lewis curate an edit of dresses that could be suitable for a wedding without being bridesmaid specific. With supermarkets already experiencing success with their existing clothing offerings (Sainsbury’s TU clothing became a £1bn brand in 2022) it appears their next target is the budget bridal market.George at Asda bridesmaid dress multiway £32. Photograph: /PR imageDelia Phillips, senior buying and design director at George at Asda, describes the collection as “pocket-friendly and size-inclusive”. It follows the release of its £60 wedding dress in 2006 (it sold out within hours) and a line of bridal lingerie first released in 2012. Last September Sainsbury’s TU followed suit, releasing a £22 wedding dress. Phillips says its low-cost bridesmaid collection has “been carefully curated to reflect this season’s most popular wedding themes, offering a range of elegant designs for the entire bridesmaid party”. The four different dress styles come in three colours – navy, blush pink and sage – a popular colour palette for spring and summer weddings. Its most expensive option, at £32, can be styled four different ways.According to research, the average cost of a wedding in 2025 is £25,625, a 3.7% rise from 2024 figures. But now, with inflation at an unexpected 10-month high, those figures could rise again. Many bridal parties will be looking to reduce costs. An expensive dress that is generally only worn for a couple of hours could be the first item to be culled. With the emergence of dupe culture, where many consumers fail to tell the difference between a designer item and a similar cheaper iteration, perhaps a supermarket dress for less than £40 could be the next humble bridal brag.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday.",
