Instead, embrace the season with floor-length gowns in soft pastels like pale yellow (a big color trend) and sage green. Take it up a notch with fresh details like puff sleeves and 3-D rosettes. Or, lean into the “new neutrals” trend with an earthy, elegant Mocha Mousse hue that’s just as versatile as classic black but slightly more unexpected.Mare Mare Bree Puff-Sleeve V-Neck Satin Slip Midi Dress, $, available at AnthropologieReformation Chime DressReformation Chime Dress, $, available at ReformationShow Me Your Mumu Lisa Maxi DressShow Me Your Mumu Lisa Maxi Dress, $, available at Show Me Your MumuRick Owens Hollywood Athena Arrowhead Maxi DressRick Owens Hollywood Athena Arrowhead Maxi Dress, $, available at SSENSESir Serene Scarf DressSir Serene Scarf Dress, $, available at SirRetrofete Sylvia DressRetrofete Sylvia Dress, $, available at RevolveCoperni Asymmetric Flower Maxi DressCoperni Asymmetric Flower Maxi Dress, $, available at SSENSESpring Cocktail Wedding Guest DressesCocktail attire strikes the perfect balance between formal and fun, giving you plenty of room to play with silhouettes, fabrics, and hemlines (yes, minis are fair game!).
