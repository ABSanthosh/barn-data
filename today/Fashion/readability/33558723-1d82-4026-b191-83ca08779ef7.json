It is also mostly sold out.When designing the company’s new 2-in-1 Maxi Dress, Lululemon’s goals were “comfort, performance and versatility.” Numerous TikTok videos have been made debating its value and style.Credit...LululemonMay 23, 2025Updated 2:15 p.m. ETThe dress has no frills. It has no patterns or intricate detailing. It doesn’t even have straps. And yet, it has divided the internet (or at least one small corner of it).Lululemon’s new 2-in-1 Maxi Dress, as the name suggests, offers two ways to wear it: a long strapless dress, that converts into a skirt when the bodice is folded down. And it has become the subject of videos with millions of views on TikTok debating whether the dress is cute — and if it’s worth the $148 price.“That’s an insane price for any dress, let alone a dress made out of athleisure material that’s supposed to be casual,” said Niccie Jamitkowski, 21, whose reaction video to the dress has 2.5 million views.Of the 2,000 comments on Ms. Jamitkowski’s video, she said the responses have been “split down the middle” in terms of people voicing support and criticism of the clothing item.“Half of the comments are like, ‘I think it’s really cute — don’t tell people what to wear,’ and then the other half of the comments are like, ‘No I agree, I think it’s really ugly — it doesn’t make sense that Lululemon is putting out a long maxi dress,’” Ms. Jamitkowski said.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
