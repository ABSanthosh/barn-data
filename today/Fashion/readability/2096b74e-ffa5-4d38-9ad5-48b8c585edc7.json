During a phone interview from her Portland, Ore., home in December, Naomi Sarna listed just a few of the gems and minerals that were on windowsills, in glass cases and sitting on the floor beneath her desk.“I’m always surrounded by my stones,” said Ms. Sarna, a jewelry artist and gem carver whose collection of several hundred pieces, kept in her homes in New York City and Portland, was gathered during visits to mines around the world. “I have to see pieces to get to know them and become excited about their potential.”Born within walking distance of the great mines of Butte, Mont. — a city whose mineral resources once prompted the nickname the Richest Hill on Earth — Ms. Sarna was a child when she accompanied her maternal grandfather on explorations of defunct mines and the local university’s collection of minerals.ImageNature is a perennial theme in Ms. Sarna’s work: Petals, buds, leaves, mountains and shells recur, often rendered in sinuous lines reminiscent of flowing water.Credit...Jeremy Bittermann for The New York TimesThat self-reliant community fostered her drive to create: “We learned to do everything with our hands,” said Ms. Sarna, whose first foray into jewelry came at 7 years old when she glued shells onto plastic discs and sold them, as earrings, to neighbors. (Ms. Sarna declined to disclose her current age, saying, “If you’re a woman over 50, people think about you in a certain way.”)At 20, she completed a three-year course in classical sculpture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. There, she sought “to understand what created the line of beauty,” said Ms. Sarna, who has made serpentine curves a recurring theme in her work.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
