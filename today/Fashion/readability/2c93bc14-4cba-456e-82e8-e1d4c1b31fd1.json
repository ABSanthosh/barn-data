  "description": "Tiny handbags, be damned - this season is all about bold totes that are big enough to carry your entire life in. And as someone whose closet is chock-full of clutches, crossbody bags, and a number of other compact purse styles, I have very mixed feelings about the trend. But if there was ever a handbag that might sway my loyalties, I knew it would be the Cuyana Easy Tote ($268) - a standout piece from the luxury, ethical brand behind some of today's most polished fashion essentials. In all truth: I've had my eye on Cuyana's chic tote offerings for a while now (thank Meghan Markle for that!). So naturally, when I heard that Cuyana was planning to do a major makeover on its handbag and tote stock, my interest was immediately piqued. After all, this was the same brand beloved and religiously worn by celebrities like Jessica Alba and Angelina Jolie. Any collection revamp would have to rival some of the designer's cult-favorite styles like the (now defunct) Classic Structured Leather Tote, all while still staying true to Cuyana's reputation for timeless elegance. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to take Cuyana's popular bag style, the Easy Tote, for a test-drive before the product's debut. I'll admit: even as a fan of the brand, I was wary about whether the style could live up to the hype of the luxe designer's other, more staple bags. But so far, Cuyana's new Easy Tote has managed to do the impossible - make a tote believer out of even the most adamant mini-bag loyalist: me. The bag has been my greatest accessory companion over the past few weeks - and I have an inkling it will continue to be my go-to long after, too. Read on for my honest review of Cuyana's Easy Tote style. About the Cuyana Easy Tote The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop in two styles: a classic, horizontal Easy Tote and a Cuyana Tall Easy Tote ($268). The Easy Tote comes in eight different colors, including cappuccino (my bag of choice), caramel, black, and stone. The style is also available in a handful of fresh, seasonal colorways that include daffodil yellow, indigo, and ecru. This particular style is Leather Working Group (LWG)-certified, which affirms that the bag's leather is tanned in an environmentally responsible way. What I Like About the Cuyana Easy Tote Even upon first wear, you can tell the tote is built to last - a theme that's consistent with most all of Cuyana's product inventory. The bag is crafted from a lightweight, pebbled Italian leather that's designed to soften with each wear - making it a chic and comfortable style that's perfect for the long haul. The tote is also astonishingly lightweight - so much so that Cuyana has even marketed it as being the brand's \"lightest bag ever.\" As someone who has had some time to take the product for a spin, I can confirm: it really does live up to the airy hype. I'm notorious for carrying a lot of stuff with me wherever I go - whether it's to the gym, airport, office, and beyond, I always have plenty of my own daily essentials in tow. As a result, I've historically had to rely on bulky, heavy, and downright inconvenient totes to keep all of my handbag must haves organized. But thanks to Cuyana's Easy Tote, I get the space of a deep and chunky tote, all without any of the hassle or added weight. I suspect this is in part due to the tote's minimal design, which avoids cliché bag buffers like synthetic lining or bulky hardware. More than anything, I just love the timeless elegance of Cuyana's Easy Tote. The relaxed style boasts more of a squishy, breathable feel that's simple, stylish, and, best of all, subtle. Statement handbags and purses might be popular nowadays, but like most trends, it's difficult to predict whether they'll remain relevant in the next season. With the muted design of the Cuyana Easy Tote, I have no doubt that the bag will be a sophisticated and polished staple in my closet for years to come. What's Worth Noting The tote features a double-handbag design, which aims to create a more streamlined look, allowing users to easily switch between carrying the bag by hand or by shoulder. Initially, I was concerned that the shorter straps might look cluttered or even feel suffocating on my arm when I opted to hold the bag on my shoulder. Fortunately, the straps are flexible and can easily be pushed down into the tote when needed, all without causing damage or creases. While I wasn't immediately sold on the strap design, I've come to see the appeal - especially since it's like getting two bags in one. Another thing to note are the minimal storage compartments. The tote features a single, large hanging wall pocket on the interior, which is the perfect size for holding your phone, cardholder, or go-to lipstick or any other valuables you might need on hand. Personally, I don't mind that the bag has only one storage pocket - when it comes to totes, the simpler the design, the better. That being said, if you are someone who relies on having more structure or organized spaces in your bag, it's certainly something to be aware of and maybe it's worth purchasing a handbag organizer to go with it. Who Is the Cuyana Easy Tote Best For? Some people mark the beginning of a new chapter in their life with a fresh hairstyle or other grown-up investment. Others celebrate it by splurging on a new Cuyana handbag. I, like so many other fans of the luxury brand, prefer the latter - which is why I'd say this Cuyana tote is perfect for anyone looking for a timeless bag they can take anywhere and carry through any season. The deep style boasts plenty of interior space that's capable of holding everything from a school binder and work laptop to a reusable water bottle, wallet or cardholder, travel beauty bag, staple pair of sunnies, and so much more (even all at once!). Whether you're a grad student looking for a chic bag for school, a corporate worker in need of a practical tote to carry to and from the office, or just someone hoping to add a more relaxed style to your wardrobe, the Easy Tote encompasses the ideal, go-anywhere bag that will help you feel polished and supported in any season. Where Is This Cuyana Tote Available? The Cuyana Easy Tote is available to shop exclusively at the brand's website.

The bag is crafted from a lightweight, pebbled Italian leather that\u0026#39;s designed to soften with each wear — making it a chic and comfortable style that\u0026#39;s perfect for the long haul.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eThe tote is also astonishingly lightweight — so much so that Cuyana has even marketed it as being the brand\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;lightest bag ever.\u0026#34; As someone who has had some time to take the product for a spin, I can confirm: it really does live up to the airy hype. I\u0026#39;m notorious for carrying a lot of stuff with me wherever I go — whether it\u0026#39;s to the gym, airport, office, and beyond, I always have plenty of my own daily essentials in tow. As a result, I\u0026#39;ve historically had to rely on bulky, heavy, and downright inconvenient totes to keep all of my handbag must haves organized. But thanks to Cuyana\u0026#39;s Easy Tote, I get the space of a deep and chunky tote, all without any of the hassle or added weight. I suspect this is in part due to the tote\u0026#39;s minimal design, which avoids cliché bag buffers like synthetic lining or bulky hardware. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eMore than anything, I just love the timeless elegance of Cuyana\u0026#39;s Easy Tote. The relaxed style boasts more of a squishy, breathable feel that\u0026#39;s simple, stylish, and, best of all, subtle. Statement handbags and purses might be popular nowadays, but like most trends, it\u0026#39;s difficult to predict whether they\u0026#39;ll remain relevant in the next season. With the muted design of the Cuyana Easy Tote, I have no doubt that the bag will be a sophisticated and polished staple in my closet for years to come.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/erJx_nsjEnuB5F8DcgxwDFDETkI=/fit-in/792x1019/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_ABzVOP_c24ed4de0f295850_IMG_5431.jpg\" width=\"792\" height=\"1019\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/erJx_nsjEnuB5F8DcgxwDFDETkI=/fit-in/792x1019/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_ABzVOP_c24ed4de0f295850_IMG_5431.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Bsj2bnfRG03OLvadqsRxdGVBQFE=/fit-in/1584x2038/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_ABzVOP_c24ed4de0f295850_IMG_5431.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePOPSUGAR Photography | Kyley Warren\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s Worth Noting\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eThe tote features a double-handbag design, which aims to create a more streamlined look, allowing users to easily switch between carrying the bag by hand or by shoulder. Initially, I was concerned that the shorter straps might look cluttered or even feel suffocating on my arm when I opted to hold the bag on my shoulder. Fortunately, the straps are flexible and can easily be pushed down into the tote when needed, all without causing damage or creases. While I wasn\u0026#39;t \u003cem\u003eimmediately\u003c/em\u003e sold on the strap design, I\u0026#39;ve come to see the appeal — especially since it\u0026#39;s like getting two bags in one.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eAnother thing to note are the minimal storage compartments. The tote features a single, large hanging wall pocket on the interior, which is the perfect size for holding your phone, cardholder, or go-to lipstick or any other valuables you might need on hand. Personally, I don\u0026#39;t mind that the bag has only one storage pocket — when it comes to totes, the simpler the design, the better. That being said, if you are someone who relies on having more structure or organized spaces in your bag, it\u0026#39;s certainly something to be aware of and maybe it\u0026#39;s worth purchasing a \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Purse-Organzier-Organizer-Zipper-Medium/dp/B07DKD7MB2/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=popsugarshopx-20\u0026amp;asc_source=google_newsstand\u0026amp;asc_campaign=feed\u0026amp;asc_refurl=https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/cuyana-easy-tote-editor-review-48904560\u0026amp;ascsubtag=___psv__p_48904560__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ehandbag organizer\u003c/a\u003e to go with it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"8\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/C7g2omDB-ZmZtuiZyPBSOGH90bw=/fit-in/792x1244/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_e2AQhK_9e8fce3dda43827b_IMG_5374.jpg\" width=\"792\" height=\"1244\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/C7g2omDB-ZmZtuiZyPBSOGH90bw=/fit-in/792x1244/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_e2AQhK_9e8fce3dda43827b_IMG_5374.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/i2SvI6t5cvrFS-4x0DEah0kVr_g=/fit-in/1584x2488/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2022/07/31/075/n/1922564/tmp_e2AQhK_9e8fce3dda43827b_IMG_5374.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePOPSUGAR Photography | Kyley Warren\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"9\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho Is the Cuyana Easy Tote Best For?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eSome people mark the beginning of a new chapter in their life with a fresh hairstyle or other grown-up investment.
