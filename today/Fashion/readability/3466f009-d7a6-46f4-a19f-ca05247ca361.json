  "description": "Image Source: Getty Images | Gotham Image Source: Reformation Taylor Swift is just a girl like the rest of us - and like any true fashion lover, she's got a thing for corset tops. Honestly, who can blame her? They cinch you in all the right places, add a flirty touch, and somehow make even the simplest outfit look totally put together. Whether you're pairing one with jeans, leather pants, a skirt, or shorts, they just work. Case in point: Swift's latest date night look with boyfriend Travis Kelce featured a soft blue corset from Reformation - the Seren Top ($168). And surprise, surprise - it's still in stock. We were kind of shocked too, since most things she wears sell out in seconds. The fact that this piece is still available feels like a minor miracle. Priced under $200, it's a no-brainer - cute, stylish, and perfect for summer nights. If it's good enough for Taylor Swift's date night, it's definitely good enough for ours. We're adding one to our cart ASAP, and if you're a Swift fan, this one's definitely worth it for you, too. What Is the Reformation Seren Top? Taylor Swift wore the cornflower shade of Reformation's Seren Top for a date night out with boyfriend Travis Kelce in NYC. The top is still available in all four colors on Reformation's website, so you can take your pick. It's designed to fit snugly and is made from a heavyweight crepe fabric that's thick enough to hold its shape, giving it that polished, structured look you want from a corset-style top. The fabric is mostly made from Naia Renew acetate (fancy talk for a sustainable material that comes from wood pulp), mixed with some polyester to make it tougher and last longer. It feels crisp and smooth - not super soft or silky - which helps maintain that clean, sharp look when you wear it. If you're not too focused on the eco-friendly aspect, there's a similar option on Amazon: the Lizynuty Crop Top ($13). It nails the same look, but is made from 100 percent polyester, so it's less green and can feel a bit less comfy on your skin. Definitely not the same quality, but hey - options are always nice, right?",
