In true legendary fashion, she donned a full white ensemble that featured an 18-foot custom cape and a wide-brimmed feathered hat. The look was actually created by Ross herself in partnership with independent label Eleven Sixteen by Ugo Mozie. The cape was no joke—it took five red carpet attendants to help carry and position the train as Ross ascended, taking up the entirety of the steps. The picture-perfect moment was reminiscent of Rihanna’s grand entrance in her Guo Pei gown for 2015’s “China: Through the Looking Glass.” Kevin Mazur/MG25//Getty ImagesDiana Ross arriving on the steps of the Met Gala. Once on the carpet, Ross revealed to Vogue’s correspondent La La Anthony that the look honored the entirety of her family, even those not in attendance at the event. As a result, the train was hand-embroidered with the names of her five children and eight grandchildren. Shortly after her jaw-dropping entrance, her daughter Tracee Ellis Ross arrived in an equally beautiful powder-pink custom Marc Jacobs look.Surprisingly, it’s been over 20 years since Ross attended the Met Gala. Her last appearance was in 2003 when the event was sponsored by Tom Ford. However, Ross admitted to Anthony that she almost skipped this year’s altogether. “Well, there was not a plan. Everything was really, really at last moment. My son persuaded me, ’cause I’m actually on tour,” she explained. Good thing he did, or else we wouldn’t have gotten such an iconic Met Gala moment.",
