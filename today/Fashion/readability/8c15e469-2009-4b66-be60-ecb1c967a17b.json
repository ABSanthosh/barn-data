  "description": "From The White Lotus to Summer House, it’s hard to miss all the warm-weather and vacation-ready fashion that’s been on our screens. And it’s inspiring us to upgrade our own spring wardrobes, especially while many of us have just done our annual closet cleanouts. So if you’re realizing that you may need a spring dress (or two) to round out your warm-weather outfits, look no further than the trends taking over the season.There are plenty of styles (many of which we saw during Paris Fashion Week) worth experimenting with. Think everything from nostalgic bubble hems and playful drop waists to joyful butter yellow and timeless polka dots.So, whether you’re in need of an everyday must-have to wear to the office, a flirty style for date nights, or a special-occasion dress for spring weddings and parties, take inspiration from the trending styles below. DashDividers_1_500x100 Milkmaid Dresses Whimsical and nostalgic, milkmaid dresses are a go-to style for frolicking through fields… or any other spring activity. Usually defined by puff sleeves, corseted bodices, ruffled straps, and smocking, the breezy silhouette is a fan-favorite for celebrities and TikTok influencers alike. It’s also been reimagined from a casual, rustic style to one that can be worn to the office or weddings. DashDividers_1_500x100 Denim Dresses Whether you’re heading to a backyard party, country festival, or brunch, a denim dress is an easy and versatile staple for casual outings. And since there’s a wide range of lengths, silhouettes, and denim washes on the market, the classic style has been refreshed for 2025. Opt for a casual button-down mini, a drop-waist maxi, or anything in between. DashDividers_1_500x100 Butter Yellow Dresses After its surge in popularity last year, butter yellow is back in full force this spring. That’s especially evident in the spring dress lineups from our favorite brands. Pick from casual minis, versatile midis, and tried-and-true maxi slip dresses for every type of occasion, from Mother’s Day to wedding season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Drop-Waist Dresses Drop-waist dresses made their return last year when the European summer aesthetic was all the rage. Luckily, they’re not going anywhere this season, from stretchy-cotton midis to taffeta-like gowns. If in doubt, look to V-shape waists and dipped hip details rather than harsh seams to dip a toe into the trend. DashDividers_1_500x100 Polka Dot Dresses Whether you want to channel Julia Roberts’ brown horse race ensemble in Pretty Woman, or Marilyn Monroe’s white number in The Seven Year Itch, throw on a polka dot dress to create your own cinematic look. This spring, stick to classic black-and-white color palettes for a timeless look, or neutrals like navy and brown for a more minimalist take on the print. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bubble Hem Dresses As playful as it is versatile, the bubble hem provides a maximalist (yet still wearable), nostalgic touch to dresses. While bubble hem skirts have had their time in the spotlight, we’re looking at full-blown bubble hem dresses now. And since they’re predicted to be a defining trend of 2025, there’s no better time to try it out. For spring, look out for warm-weather-approved fabrics, like linen and crisp cotton poplin. Plus, details like smocked bodices and airy open backs. DashDividers_1_500x100 Floral Dresses Yes, florals are a perennial staple, but it’s impossible to ignore the bolder iterations being scooped up by shoppers this season. Whether the print is micro or large-scale and abstract, vibrant pinks, blues, and yellows feel especially fresh. Also, look out for botanical prints, and more unexpected blooms like sunflowers and hydrangeas for a splashier take. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lace Dresses Lace may feel most appropriate in the realm of formalwear… or lingerie, but we’re here to prove that the elegant fabric can be incorporated into your everyday looks, too. Consider pieces trimmed with lace along the hems or appliqués rather than full panels that scream evening. Right now, you can even find plenty of styles with sheer skirts that feel decidedly flirtier and bold rather than conservative or matronly. Like what you see?
