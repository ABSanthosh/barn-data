The discovery has inspired a lot of emotional reactions on social media.Credit...Andres Gutierrez/Anadolu, via Getty ImagesFeb. 18, 2025Updated 6:33 p.m. ETIt is easy to believe that the black seadevil anglerfish, with its gaping maw of razor-like teeth, a bioluminescent rod sticking out of its head and lidless eyes used to scan the deepest, darkest depths of the ocean, might make someone cry with fright.It is perhaps less believable that such a creature, the kind so freakish it inspired a particularly scary scene in the children’s movie “Finding Nemo,” would move people to genuine, raw tears of emotional overwhelm.On social media, a seadevil has done just that, becoming a folk hero in recent weeks after swimming great lengths from its typical home, some 200 to 2,000 meters deep in the ocean, to the surface. Some of the fish’s fans have turned the watery odyssey — which ended in death — into a poignant version of the hero’s journey.“My first reaction was, ‘Oh my god, this fish is terrifying,’” said Hannah Backman, 29, who lives in Minneapolis and posted about the fish on TikTok. But, she said, she eventually succumbed to the poetry of a lone fish approaching the light: “This poor fish is just spending her literal last seconds trying to do something beautiful.”“I did shed a few tears,” she added.In late January, the seadevil made headlines when it was spotted near the surface by a group of researchers off the coast of Tenerife in the Spanish Canary Islands. It was a rare event and “a dream come true,” said one photographer with the group who was able to capture the fish on camera. The team observed the fish, which was already injured when it was spotted, for several hours. The seadevil ultimately died.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
