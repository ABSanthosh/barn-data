  "text": "Nothing feels like a luxury fairytale quite like an evening filled with jewels in Kyoto. Earlier this week, Chanel celebrated the launch of its “Reach for the Stars” high jewelry collection among fashion’s most fabulous with a stunning excursion to Japan. For “It” girl and style icon Devon Lee Carlson, the night was a whirlwind dream. Before heading out, Carlson playfully stacked her Coco Crush bracelets and rings, which perfectly complemented the edgy vibe of her sequined leather halter dress. The impressive collection consists of 109 pieces that deeply honor the historic legacy of Gabrielle Chanel. Signature motifs abound—lions, comets, and the debut of wings, all of which reference iconic moments throughout the designer’s life. Chanel’s star sign, Leo, is manifested through her lifelong collection of feline sculptures. Since then, the lion has become an integral symbol for the brand’s high jewelry collections. Meanwhile, the comet represents a direct through-line to Chanel’s first-ever 1932 Bijoux de Diamants line, a revolutionary idea in the diamond space amidst turmoil of that year. Finally, and perhaps most important, are the wings. This motif is represented in pieces such as the impressive “Wings of Chanel” necklace, which features a boldly sculptural design and detachable pendant of star-shaped diamonds that doubles as a bracelet (also a favorite of Carlson’s). The centerpiece—a cushion-cut Padparadscha sapphire, never before seen in a Chanel high jewelry collection. As the house founder once famously said, “If you were born without wings, do nothing to prevent them from growing.”See How Devon Lee Carlson Gets Ready for Chanel",
