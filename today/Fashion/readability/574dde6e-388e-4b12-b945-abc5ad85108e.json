  "text": "You’ve likely seen all iterations of skinny jeans—cigarette legs, slim cuts, jeggings, you name it. But in 2025, there’s a new version to set your eyes on: The Alix.A collaboration between FRAME Denim and TikTok star Alix Earle, this new silhouette—which comes in two colorways, Flaunt and Black Coated, and is available starting January 23—banks on the comeback of skinny jeans in an era dominated by barrel legs and baggy fits. And, given that virtually everything the influencer touches turns into trending gold, it’ll be no surprise if the slimming style sells out.Ahead of the collaboration’s launch, Earle spoke with ELLE.com to discuss working with FRAME Denim, what she learned while designing The Alix, and, most importantly, her thoughts on the return of skinny jeans. Why do you think skinny jeans are due for a comeback?I know that there’s been a wave of baggier jeans, which I also love, but I’ve always had a pair of skinny jeans in my closet, which is how this idea came to be. I wore skinny jeans to a football game in one of my videos, and I had so many people in my comments freaking out about the skinny jean. I thought that it would be such a fun moment to have a campaign [with FRAME Denim] around bringing the skinny jean back. Skinny jeans most recently had a moment in the mid-2000s. How do you feel about trends from that era making a return? I feel like fashion always tends to repeat itself in a sense, and I think trends are fun to follow. But something I’ve learned over the past few years, as I’m trying to get a little bit more into the fashion space, is to wear what works for you and what’s comfortable for you. That’s a really big thing I’m embracing with this campaign.I definitely had a ton of skinny jeans when I was younger, and I probably style them a little bit differently now than I used to. But I think it’s always fun recycling old trends and bringing them into a new day and age.Courtesy of FRAMECourtesy of FRAMEWhat was the most important lesson you learned while working on this collab? It’s OK to take risks. I think that’s a big thing in fashion as well—not being afraid to step outside of the box or step outside of the norm. Over the past few years, I’ve been able to work with many different stylists and experts in fashion, and the main thing I’ve taken away is just to do what makes you happy and embrace your own sense of style. If you’re following along with too many other people, then it gets a little lost in the sauce.You had a say in the fit and feel of these jeans. For you, what stands out about The Alix?This pair of skinny jeans is super comfortable. That’s a big thing. I think baggy jeans have become so trendy because of their comfort, so these are a nice fit. They’re not too low-waisted or high-waisted; I think they sit right in the middle and fit just right.If you had to choose one of the two washes for The Alix, which would you choose, and why?I would probably choose the darker wash—the Black Coated. I always love to wear a skinny jean with a heel and possibly on a night out, so I think those are the ones that I’ll probably end up reaching for more. In general, how would you style these jeans?They’re pretty versatile, but I’ll be sticking to a heel or boot on the bottom—I don’t think I would really be wearing them with sneakers, which I used to do in the past! On top, whatever I’m feeling. You can dress them up with a blazer or a jacket, or you can wear a baggy or tight shirt. How do you think becoming an influencer has affected your personal style?I’m still trying to figure out my personal style, but having a big audience has definitely helped me along the way, because I’m receiving so much feedback in real time. I think I went through a period where I was listening to the feedback a little too much and trying to please other people over myself, so being an influencer has definitely given me this newfound sense of confidence in what I like to wear and staying true to that. You’re definitely open to a lot more opinions—when [I wear] something that doesn’t look great, my audience tells me. It’s always good to have that kind of honest criticism, but overall, it’s helped me nail down exactly what I like to wear and feel confident in that. With that in mind, how would you describe your personal style today? I always love to integrate a little bit of sexiness into my style, but I still love to be classy and chic at times. That said, I’m still so young, so I definitely like to be playful. And I’m open to trying more things, too, like showing a little bit more skin—but that might be because I’ve lived in Miami for so long.The Alix jeans reflect that personal style in that they can be worn in a classy, chic way, but they also lean into the sexiness with the tight fit of the skinny silhouette, and they’re flattering. I always think my butt looks better in skinny jeans than it does in baggy mom jeans. Also, they go great with heels—which, if I could wear a heel all the time, I would.
