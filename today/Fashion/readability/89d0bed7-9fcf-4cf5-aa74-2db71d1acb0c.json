  "text": "Courtesy of Savage X FentyRihanna sends the internet into a tizzy every time she posts a new photo of herself, but today’s Instagram is especially exciting for fashion fans. The mogul just announced a limited-edition collaboration between her brand, Savage X Fenty, and Italian fashion house Diesel—and ELLE.com has the exclusive story behind the capsule. The idea came while Rihanna and Savage X Fenty chief design officer Adam Selman were chatting about the fashion industry at large, gossiping about who’s doing what and to what degree of success. “Ri was like, ‘I love what Glenn [Martens] is doing. This is so major.’ I was like, well, we should do a collab. Then we got on the phone with Diesel,” Selman says. “We were all obviously extremely excited when Fenty contacted us for this collab,” Martens, creative director at Diesel, said exclusively to ELLE via email. “Rihanna has always reflected the Diesel woman: edged, opinionated, declarative, sexy. She was one of the first talents to support Diesel since my very first collection for the brand, so I am very proud to have had the opportunity to create something with her. She very much knows what she wants, which makes the process so much easier. It all felt effortless—just fun!” The line marks Diesel’s first foray into lingerie, creating what Selman calls “a perfect, symbiotic relationship.” Diesel’s expertise in denim and longstanding history as a style disruptor paired seamlessly with Fenty X Savage’s extensive understanding of fit, sizing, and the technical aspects of intimates. “Fenty is the perfect partner to dive into this new category,” Martens said. “We both focus on empowerment and confidence, showing how to challenge the norm while building a strong community. Each brand offers a diverse range of styles, making fashion inclusive and celebrating individuality, encouraging people to express themselves freely. We are both provocative; we dare.” The range includes bustiers, string bikinis, thigh-high stockings, teddies, and more, all branded with the limited-edition Diesel x Savage X Fenty logo, a feature that Rihanna herself pushed for, according to Selman. Prices range from $30-$90 and shoppers can expect Savage’s trademark extended sizing. “We say it’s for the bedroom, but I could definitely see people wearing it out and about,” says Selman. “It’s for the party girls.” Rihanna and Marten’s collective vision carries through to the campaign imagery, shot by photographer Salvatore Matarazzo and videographer Jacopo Farina, featuring real Italians at a beach in Tuscany. “The campaign portrays a judgment-free day in the Italian sun, showcasing people of all ages, body types, genders and ethnicities feeling confident in their outfits,” the press release details. The collection is available now in select Diesel and Savage X Fenty retail locations, at savagex.com, and on diesel.com. Meg (she/her) is the associate fashion commerce editor at ELLE.com, where she specializes in shopping stories spanning the fashion, home, and lifestyle categories. Over the past three years, she has devoted countless hours to researching brands, testing hundreds (maybe even thousands!) of products, and deep-diving into market and consumer trends. Her favorite job responsibilities consist of co-writing the monthly series Same Same But Different and curating the fashion market for ELLE Escapes. Meg graduated magna cum laude from the Missouri School of Journalism with an emphasis on magazine editing. In 2020, one of her feature stories in the service article category was recognized by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. The year prior, the Society of Professional Journalists named voxmagazine.com “Best Affiliated Magazine” in its Mark of Excellence Awards, when she was on staff. Meg’s stories have appeared on Cosmopolitan, Town \u0026 Country, Harper’s Bazaar, and Good Housekeeping, among many other outlets. Her personal passions include travel, buffalo sauce, and gardening. You can find her in New York, where she lives, or on Instagram, where she also lives. She will never stop hoping for a One Direction reunion tour.",
