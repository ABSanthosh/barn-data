  "text": "Getting Paige DeSorbo ready for her first CFDA Awards appearance was, as she described, like stepping into a Gossip Girl–inspired daydream. Known for her comedic flair on Summer House, DeSorbo brought her lighthearted sense of humor to the red carpet, where she opted for a look steeped in classic glamour. Her first social media post of the night stirred curiosity, with followers asking in the comments what hotel or venue she was in. As it turned out, it was simply her home, which she describes as \"very Parisian.\"During the pre-CFDA fitting, her stylist, Maren Taylor, gathered a curated selection of dresses, including a standout piece that DeSorbo hadn’t anticipated would be the final look until she tried it on. “I didn’t have a set idea, so Maren brought a range of options, and when I tried on this one, I knew it was the one,” she recalls. “It was worn on the runway by Naomi Campbell, kind of in a different way, with the neckpiece down. When I put it on, I just instinctually pushed it back. It felt like a modern Audrey moment, like Disney villain meets Audrey Hepburn, and I love that!”(Image credit: Lucio Andreozzi)Taylor echoed DeSorbo’s sentiment about the choice, a piece she knew was destined for a red carpet moment since it debuted on Naomi Campbell on the Off-White runway in the F/W 23 collection. “It’s a new silhouette for Paige, but with her love for fashion, I knew she would be drawn to the overall story of it,” Taylor shared. “For her first CFDA Awards, I had a feeling she was going to want to do something that felt different and pushed her envelope.”(Image credit: Lucio Andreozzi)With the dress confirmed, DeSorbo moved into hair and makeup as her glam team arrived in the early afternoon. Her hairstylist, Mitchell Ramazon, helped her achieve a timeless, swept-up style that suited the gown’s structured neckline. “Mitchell really wanted to keep my hair down, but I had a vision for the dress, and I felt this Audrey Hepburn updo would complete it perfectly,” DeSorbo explained.Taylor Fitzgerald stepped in until the makeup look was complete, leaving DeSorbo with just enough time for photos. Her cat, Daphne, even joined in for the shoot. “She loves the glam process, lying on the racks of clothes, especially the pricier pieces. She’s got a great eye!” DeSorbo laughed.(Image credit: Lucio Andreozzi)Reflecting on how her style has evolved since her first red carpet, DeSorbo recalled some of her previous looks from years ago but ultimately wouldn’t change a thing. “I really never regret any of my fashion choices, because I know in that moment I loved it,” she shares.The CFDA Awards mark a night to celebrate fashion—and a milestone for DeSorbo and Taylor, highlighting a deep, shared appreciation for fashion’s transformative power. “One of the reasons I love working with Paige is that our visions tend to align,” Taylor said. “Some clients take a back seat, but Paige is right there with me—it’s such a rewarding experience.”(Image credit: Lucio Andreozzi)Photographer: Lucio Andreozzi Stylist: Maren Taylor Hairstylist: Mitchell RamazonMakeup Artist: Taylor Fitzgerald Sierra Mayhew was always destined to work in fashion, but she didn't know it at first. Growing up with no choice but to wear a rotation of school uniforms and activewear, her love for fashion really blossomed when she moved away for college and was able to finally define her very own personal style. Shortly thereafter, she interned at Elle magazine and instantly knew that editorial was for her. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, she worked for ShopBazaar, contributing regularly to Bazaar.com, and finally made her way to Who What Wear, where she is an associate editor. When she’s not working, you can catch her always trying to catch a flight, trying the latest fitness craze in New York City, or exploring luxury vintage boutiques.",

Mayhew was always destined to work in fashion, but she didn\u0026#39;t know it at first. Growing up with no choice but to wear a rotation of school uniforms and activewear, her love for fashion really blossomed when she moved away for college and was able to finally define her very own personal style. Shortly thereafter, she interned at Elle magazine and instantly knew that editorial was for her. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame, she worked for ShopBazaar, contributing regularly to \u003ca href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/author/226573/sierra-mayhew/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBazaar.com\u003c/a\u003e, and finally made her way to Who What Wear, where she is an associate editor. When she’s not working, you can catch her always trying to catch a flight, trying the latest fitness craze in New York City, or exploring luxury vintage boutiques.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
