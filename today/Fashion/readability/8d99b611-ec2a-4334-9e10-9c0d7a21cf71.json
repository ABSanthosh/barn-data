It shows her cooking, creating and harvesting, and feels like a billboard for things to come.In “With Love, Meghan,” Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, visits with friends like the actress Mindy Kaling, discussing food, her life and how to entertain.Credit...NetflixMarch 4, 2025Updated 4:58 p.m. ETMeghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has returned to the small screen with a new cooking and lifestyle show that was released on Netflix on Tuesday.Filmed at a property near her home in sunny Montecito, Calif., the eight-episode series positions Meghan, 43, as a modern domestic goddess embracing the do-it-yourself delights of cooking, crafting and entertaining.“Love is in the details, gang,” she says on an episode of the show, while preparing her own lavender towels.The series, which Netflix has pitched as “inspiring,” saying it “reimagines the genre of lifestyle programming,” is directed by Michael Steed, who worked on “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown.” It is executive produced by Meghan and is loosely organized around a series of creative projects — teaching a friend to make bread, throwing a game night for friends and planning a brunch — and offering tips along the way.“We’re not in the pursuit of perfection,” Meghan explains in the show as she makes crepes. “We’re in the pursuit of joy.”It has been about five years since Meghan, and her husband, Prince Harry, officially stepped back from their royal duties in Britain. The family is now firmly planted in Southern California. Prince Archie is 5 and Princess Lilibet is 3.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
