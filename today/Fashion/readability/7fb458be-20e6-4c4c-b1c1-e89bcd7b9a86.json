Any products or services put forward appear in no particular order. if you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Collars and Co has flipped the script on business casual. Launched in 2021, the brand made its name with the Dress Collar Polo™—a sharp, structured collar sewn onto a buttery-soft performance polo. It’s the kind of hybrid design that solves a problem you didn’t know you had: looking crisp under a blazer without the bulk, sweat, or restriction of a traditional dress shirt. In this Collars and Co review, we’re looking at how the brand has grown since landing a Shark Tank deal with Mark Cuban and Peter Jones, generating over $20 million in revenue and expanding its lineup to include stretch dress shirts, tailored chinos, and Italian-inspired layering pieces—all engineered for comfort, polish, and versatility. Whether you’re commuting to the office or dialing into a client call from home, Collars \u0026 Co delivers a look that means business without feeling like it. Key Takeaways Collars and Co is a modern menswear brand known for its patented Dress Collar Polo™, blending the comfort of performance polos with the formality of dress shirts. Backed by Shark Tank investors, the brand has achieved over $20 million in revenue since its 2021 launch. Products are made with lightweight, 4-way stretch fabric and feature structured collars that hold up under sweaters and jackets. Customers love the elevated feel and versatility, though sizing and fit can vary slightly depending on the item. Ideal for guys who want to look sharp without sacrificing comfort—perfect for hybrid work, travel, or casual Fridays. Overview Of Collars \u0026 Co. About the Brand In a menswear market overcrowded with stiff collars and outdated dress codes, Collars \u0026 Co has emerged as a smart, modern disruptor. Founded by entrepreneur Justin Baer in 2021, the brand went viral for its Dress Collar Polo™—a shirt that pairs the structure of a dress collar with the ease of a performance polo. The concept was so well-received it landed Baer a deal on Shark Tank with Mark Cuban and Peter Jones, and helped drive over $20 million in sales within two years. What sets this label apart—and what makes it worth covering in any honest Collars and Co review—is its commitment to functional tailoring. Every shirt is built to perform, with OEKO-TEX-certified fabrics, wrinkle resistance, and sweat-wicking stretch blends. Add in endorsements from the likes of NFL legend Tiki Barber and golf icon Nick Faldo, and you’ve got a brand that’s not just chasing trends—it’s rewriting the rules of business casual. Product Overview At the heart of any Collars and Co review is one simple question: Can a polo shirt really replace your dress shirt? With their hero product, the answer is yes. Their English Spread Collar Polo is the standout—a clean-cut shirt built with a proprietary four-way stretch performance fabric and a reinforced collar that doesn’t collapse under pressure. Whether layered under a blazer or worn solo, it holds its shape and delivers sharp lines from Zoom to cocktail hour. Other offerings include the Cutaway and Semi-Spread polos, performance dress shirts, and lightweight layering pieces like their Lucca Luxury Touch tees and Maverick Blazer. All materials are engineered for real life—meaning they’re breathable, quick-drying, and machine-washable. The shirts blend polyester, viscose, and elastane for structure and softness, and collar stays come standard for that extra polish. Most items are updated seasonally, with color drops that skew professional and versatile—think navy, white, sand, and light blue. Comfort and Fit If you’ve ever peeled off a sweat-soaked Oxford after a long day, you’ll understand the appeal. Collars \u0026 Co shirts are built like athletic wear disguised as business attire. That four-way stretch fabric is a frequent favorite in customer reviews, praised for its flexibility, softness, and surprising breathability. In comfort terms, this isn’t just a performance upgrade—it’s a lifestyle one. You can wear these shirts on a plane, at a meeting, or out to dinner and still feel like you’re in a tech tee. The collars do lean more structured—great for aesthetics, though some guys who prefer ultra-relaxed necklines may find them slightly rigid at first wear. Sizing Guidance Sizing at Collars \u0026 Co runs from Small to 4XL, with most items offering a gently tailored silhouette—not too boxy, not aggressively slim. Based on thousands of customer reviews, the fit generally holds true to size, especially if you’re used to brands like Bonobos or UNTUCKit. That said, if you’ve got a broader chest or thicker arms, you may want to size up in the polos, as the shoulder fit can run snug. The brand’s online size charts are detailed and accurate, helping take the guesswork out of first-time orders. Still, without physical retail stores in most cities, there’s no option to try before you buy—an area for improvement as the company scales. Value Analysis Let’s be honest: at $60–$90 per shirt, this isn’t bargain bin pricing. But Collars \u0026 Co lands in that rare sweet spot where price meets long-term payoff. The shirts look like luxury, wear like loungewear, and hold up after dozens of washes. Compared to mid-range staples like Charles Tyrwhitt, Mizzen+Main, or Brooks Brothers, the value is strong—especially when factoring in the brand’s patented collar tech and performance-focused fabrics. That said, there are trade-offs. The shirts are made from a synthetic blend—not luxe natural fibers like Pima or Egyptian cotton—so traditionalists might find the hand-feel less premium. And while Collars \u0026 Co frequently runs sitewide sales, still some shoppers may find full-price a stretch unless they’re prioritizing performance and polish over fabric origin. There’s also the matter of fit and availability. The core lineup leans classic and clean—think crisp whites, soft blues, and seasonal earth tones. If you’re looking for bold patterns or formal French cuffs, you won’t find them here (yet). And with limited brick-and-mortar locations, trying before you buy isn’t always possible—though the 30-day return policy does soften that limitation. Ideal Customer Profile This Collars and Co review makes one thing clear: the brand is made for modern professionals who want to dress well without overthinking it. If you’re a hybrid worker, frequent traveler, or someone who values looking sharp with minimal effort, Collars \u0026 Co nails the brief. It’s especially ideal for guys who layer polos or shirts beneath sweaters and blazers—thanks to that stay-put collar that actually holds its shape. On the flip side, purists who prefer classic cotton dress shirts or hate synthetic blends may not vibe with the performance fabric feel. But for most guys tired of stiff collars, ironing boards, and sweat stains? This might just be your new uniform. Pros And Cons When weighing Collars \u0026 Co’s offerings, there are notable advantages and drawbacks that shape the overall customer experience. Pros Innovative collar design: The patented structured “English spread” collar consistently delivers a polished look, staying crisp under sweaters and blazers, according to hundreds of verified customer reviews. This addresses a frequent complaint with standard polos and dress shirts that lose their shape throughout the day. Four-way stretch fabric: The shirts combine polyester, viscose, and elastane, resulting in impressive flexibility and comfort that rivals many performance brands. This material excels in breathability and offers a soft feel, allowing for ease of movement at the office or on the go. Wrinkle-resistant and easy care: Collars \u0026 Co shirts require little to no ironing, making them an excellent pick for busy professionals or frequent travelers. Most users report the shirts maintain their structure and finish after multiple washes. Strong value for modern professionals: Priced between $60 and $90, these shirts occupy a strategic middle ground between mass-market brands and luxury offerings. The combination of convenience, comfort, and style often justifies the investment. Versatile design: With styles that blend dress shirt sharpness and polo comfort, Collars \u0026 Co items transition well from conference room to casual settings. The product line covers core staples along with trendy seasonal releases. Cons Synthetic feel may not suit all: While the four-way stretch fabric offers performance benefits, some users—especially those accustomed to high-thread-count cotton—find the synthetic blend less luxurious. Sensitive skin types occasionally report the material can feel less natural. Fit can be restrictive for some: The tailored, athletic cut flatters many, yet buyers with broader shoulders or more muscular builds sometimes need to size up. Tall individuals may find sleeve lengths slightly short. The silhouettes are trimmer than typical retail brands. No fully natural fiber options: The dependence on synthetic blends means Collars \u0026 Co is not an optimal choice for customers who prefer 100% natural fabrics for breathability or sustainability reasons. Higher price than some synthetic competitors: Despite strong value, the pricing remains higher than many mass-market or budget options offering synthetic or blended shirts, which may deter price-sensitive shoppers. Limited in-store experience: As a direct-to-consumer brand, Collars \u0026 Co is mainly available online. Those who prefer trying products in-store before buying must deal with shipping and returns for sizing adjustments. Final Verdict After digging into this Collars and Co review, one thing is clear: this brand understands the modern man’s wardrobe dilemma—and solves it with style. The combination of structured, stay-put collars and performance-level comfort hits a rare balance that most dress shirts miss entirely. These aren’t just clothes; they’re tools for looking sharp without the extra effort. Are they for everyone? Not quite. If you’re all about natural fibers or prefer more traditional tailoring, the synthetic stretch blend may not check every box. But for the vast majority of professionals—especially those navigating hybrid work, frequent travel, or just tired of ironing—the value proposition is strong. Collars \u0026 Co delivers a crisp, tailored look with zero fuss, and in today’s menswear landscape, that’s more than enough to earn a spot in regular rotation. If you’re after shirts that can handle boardrooms, date nights, and red-eyes without losing shape or comfort, this brand should be on your radar.

But Collars \u0026amp; Co lands in that rare sweet spot where price meets long-term payoff. The shirts look like luxury, wear like loungewear, and hold up after dozens of washes. Compared to mid-range staples like Charles Tyrwhitt, Mizzen+Main, or Brooks Brothers, the value is strong—especially when factoring in the brand’s patented collar tech and performance-focused fabrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are trade-offs. The shirts are made from a synthetic blend—not luxe natural fibers like Pima or Egyptian cotton—so traditionalists might find the hand-feel less premium. And while Collars \u0026amp; Co frequently runs sitewide sales, still some shoppers may find full-price a stretch unless they’re prioritizing performance and polish over fabric origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also the matter of fit and availability. The core lineup leans classic and clean—think crisp whites, soft blues, and seasonal earth tones. If you’re looking for bold patterns or formal French cuffs, you won’t find them here (yet).

You can wear these shirts on a plane, at a meeting, or out to dinner and still feel like you’re in a tech tee. The collars do lean more structured—great for aesthetics, though some guys who prefer ultra-relaxed necklines may find them slightly rigid at first wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSizing Guidance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSizing at Collars \u0026amp; Co runs from Small to 4XL, with most items offering a gently tailored silhouette—not too boxy, not aggressively slim. Based on thousands of customer reviews, the fit generally holds true to size, especially \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/brands-like-lacoste/\"\u003eif you’re used to brands like\u003c/a\u003e Bonobos or UNTUCKit. That said, if you’ve got a broader chest or thicker arms, you may want to size up in the polos, as the shoulder fit can run snug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brand’s online size charts are detailed and accurate, helping take the guesswork out of first-time orders. Still, without physical retail stores in most cities, there’s no option to try before you buy—an area for improvement as the company scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eValue Analysis\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/xrhis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-lifestyle-Navy-Floral-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s be honest: at $60–$90 per shirt, this isn’t bargain bin pricing. But Collars \u0026amp; Co lands in that rare sweet spot where price meets long-term payoff. The shirts look like luxury, wear like loungewear, and hold up after dozens of washes. Compared to mid-range staples like Charles Tyrwhitt, Mizzen+Main, or Brooks Brothers, the value is strong—especially when factoring in the brand’s patented collar tech and performance-focused fabrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, there are trade-offs. The shirts are made from a synthetic blend—not luxe natural fibers like Pima or Egyptian cotton—so traditionalists might find the hand-feel less premium. And while Collars \u0026amp; Co frequently runs sitewide sales, still some shoppers may find full-price a stretch unless they’re prioritizing performance and polish over fabric origin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s also the matter of fit and availability. The core lineup leans classic and clean—think crisp whites, soft blues, and seasonal earth tones. If you’re looking for bold patterns or formal French cuffs, you won’t find them here (yet). And with limited brick-and-mortar locations, trying before you buy isn’t always possible—though the 30-day return policy does soften that limitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIdeal Customer Profile\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Collars and Co review makes one thing clear: the brand is made for modern professionals who want to dress well without overthinking it. If you’re a hybrid worker, frequent traveler, or someone who values looking sharp with minimal effort, Collars \u0026amp; Co nails the brief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s especially ideal for guys who layer polos or shirts \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-sweater-brands-for-men/\"\u003ebeneath sweaters\u003c/a\u003e and blazers—thanks to that stay-put collar that actually holds its shape. On the flip side, purists who prefer classic cotton dress shirts or hate synthetic blends may not vibe with the performance fabric feel.

This might just be your new uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePros And Cons\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/fsb/xrhis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth.jpg\" alt=\"Male model wearing a blue Collars and Co shirt\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cc-Photos-Blue-Houndstooth-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen weighing Collars \u0026amp; Co’s offerings, there are notable advantages and drawbacks that shape the overall customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePros\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInnovative collar design\u003c/strong\u003e: The patented structured “English spread” collar consistently delivers a polished look, staying crisp under sweaters and blazers, according to hundreds of verified customer reviews.

These aren’t just clothes; they’re tools for looking sharp without the extra effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre they for everyone? Not quite. If you’re all about natural fibers or prefer more traditional tailoring, the synthetic stretch blend may not check every box.
