These days, it seems plaid wins over Peppa Pig.Double trouble … Beyoncé and Blue Ivy, right, at an NFL game in Houston, Texas, last December. Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesWhen I spoke to dress historian Alden O’Brien in 2023, she told me that during the early 18th century, children transitioned to adult dress fairly early, but “as attitudes towards childhood changed – letting children be children, play, have less constricting clothes – the age for moving out of children’s dresses rose”.That 18th-century shift is often ascribed to the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s book Emile, Or Treatise on Education, which advocated letting kids be free to roam in nature. According to Alasdair Peebles, expert collector of historical boy’s clothes, the impact of that 1762 book was felt in the 1770s when “boys start wearing trousers”, as well as “skeleton suits, which are a bit like modern playsuits”.So how does the way we dress children speak to how we see childhood now? Deniz Arzuk is a critical childhood scholar who sees it as “embedded in the wider social economic structure”. The way we dress children, she says, “is tied to the way that we construct our class identities, our aspirations, and, specifically today, there is the online presence and maintaining the look”. I don’t think when my three-year-old and I end up in Crocs with matching Spider-Man charms – her work, not mine – we are maintaining some kind of cohesive look. But then the subconscious is a powerful thing. Plus, for parents who make a habit – and possibly an income – from posting on social media, matching outfits feel tailor-made to gain likes.It feels as if there is also a potent nostalgia at play in the way some parents dress their kids – just look to the market for £60-plus vintage 90s OshKosh dungarees on Vinted for evidence. A lot of how we dress children, argues Peeble, is also to do with “using your children to embody fantasies” – in fact, he was dressed in lederhosen and kilts by his mum. If you had a relatively carefree childhood in the 1980s while decked out in dungarees and shell suits, might you be more likely to try to replicate the look on your own children as a subliminal attempt to reconstruct your childhood?skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionTwin set … serial mini-me dresser Kim Kardashian with her daughter North West in 2016. Photograph: Broadimage/Rex/ShutterstockPeeble’s precocious alpine styling perhaps plays a part in why he believes “that it’s mothers who have usually been more invested in dressing their children”. He points, for a historical example, to Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who “wrote letters to her friends about all the outfits she was making for her son … she goes on in a very gushing way about how gorgeous he looks in all the clothes.“Your child was an accessory in a sense,” he continues. You could “demonstrate, through the opulence of their clothing, your wealth and status”. It tallies. Back then it might have been “French silks, cut velvets … possibly a wig and a tricorn hat with gold lace”. Now it might be a Mini Rodini bomber jacket or an organic cotton onesie with a peace sign print. It sounds a bit grim but, as Arzuk says, “the way we invest” in our children “is a way of building up the social capital … it’s about investing in our position in society”.A more fun spin would be to focus on the fact that today, adults dress more like children, with many predominantly kidswear brands now offering kid-inflected adult clothes that aren’t Crayola-bright or unicorn-heavy. Organic Zoo is one such company. According to its founder, Paulina Atkinson: “These days, there is a more visible connection between kids’ fashion and adults’ fashion, and both inspire each other. Kids’ clothes became more than just cute prints and adults’ styles are more relaxed and less formal.” Atkinson thinks this is a good thing, saying: “For a lot of parents and children, it is a great joy to twin with their outfits, so why not?”Kids intrinsically dress well. They embody clothes with unabashed, unadulterated personality. They dress with a lack of self-consciousness; prints clash, colours bark, cuts squabble for attention but, because it is done without a care, it works. What adult wouldn’t want to emulate that?To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in the measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – subscribe to receive fashion statement in your inbox every thursday.",

If you had a relatively carefree childhood in the 1980s while decked out in dungarees and shell suits, might you be more likely to try to replicate the look on your own children as a subliminal attempt to reconstruct your childhood?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement\"\u003e\u003ca data-ignore=\"global-link-styling\" href=\"#EmailSignup-skip-link-9\"\u003eskip past newsletter promotion\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp id=\"EmailSignup-skip-link-9\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"after newsletter promotion\" role=\"note\"\u003eafter newsletter promotion\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure id=\"12631708-3539-4ac0-9603-cd5f095d7c3f\" data-spacefinder-role=\"supporting\" data-spacefinder-type=\"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"img-3\"\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=380\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=380\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 1300px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 980px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 660px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=605\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 480px)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\"/\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" media=\"(min-width: 320px)\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Serial mini-me dresser Kim Kardashian with her daughter North West in 2016.\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e8e2a755514a28a030186ba2722a85fd0b532cb/0_47_2096_2752/master/2096.jpg?width=445\u0026amp;dpr=1\u0026amp;s=none\u0026amp;crop=none\" width=\"445\" height=\"584.2748091603054\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-spacefinder-role=\"inline\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003csvg width=\"18\" height=\"13\" viewBox=\"0 0 18 13\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTwin set … serial mini-me dresser Kim Kardashian with her daughter North West in 2016.\u003c/span\u003e Photograph: Broadimage/Rex/Shutterstock\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeeble’s precocious alpine styling perhaps plays a part in why he believes “that it’s mothers who have usually been more invested in dressing their children”. He points, for a historical example, to Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who “wrote letters to her friends about all the outfits she was making for her son … she goes on in a very gushing way about how gorgeous he looks in all the clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Your child was an accessory in a sense,” he continues. You could “demonstrate, through the opulence of their clothing, your wealth and status”. It tallies. Back then it might have been “French silks, cut velvets … possibly a wig and a tricorn hat with gold lace”. Now it might be a Mini Rodini bomber jacket or an organic cotton onesie with a peace sign print. It sounds a bit grim but, as Arzuk says, “the way we invest” in our children “is a way of building up the social capital … it’s about investing in our position in society”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA more fun spin would be to focus on the fact that today, adults dress more like children, with many predominantly kidswear brands now offering kid-inflected adult clothes that aren’t Crayola-bright or unicorn-heavy. Organic Zoo is one such company. According to its founder, Paulina Atkinson: “These days, there is a more visible connection between kids’ fashion and adults’ fashion, and both inspire each other. Kids’ clothes became more than just cute prints and adults’ styles are more relaxed and less formal.” Atkinson thinks this is a good thing, saying: “For a lot of parents and children, it is a great joy to twin with their outfits, so why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKids intrinsically dress well. They embody clothes with unabashed, unadulterated personality. They dress with a lack of self-consciousness; prints clash, colours bark, cuts squabble for attention but, because it is done without a care, it works. What adult wouldn’t want to emulate that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in the measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-fashion-statement-newsletter-our-free-fashion-email\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"\u003esubscribe to receive fashion statement\u003c/a\u003e in your inbox every thursday.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
