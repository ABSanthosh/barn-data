Each bottle costs almost $250.On Monday, President Trump posted about his new line of fragrances on Truth Social.Credit...Haiyun Jiang/The New York TimesJuly 1, 2025, 3:20 p.m. ETAs the United States Senate debated through the night on Monday, going back and forth on President Trump’s agenda, the president himself made an announcement. “Trump Fragrances are here,” he posted on Truth Social that evening in between posts about tariff revenues and the spending bill. “They’re called ‘Victory 45-47’ because they’re all about Winning, Strength, and Success.”The limited edition fragrances for men and women come in 3.3-ounce bottles topped with a golden statuette of the president. His autograph is displayed on the base. Each bottle costs almost $250, which is more than similarly sized luxury scents from the likes of Dior (its signature Sauvage costs $165) or Chanel (the iconic No. 5 perfume costs $110).The Trump Fragrances add to an ever-expanding list of merchandise branded with Mr. Trump’s name and likeness, which now includes a cellphone, high-top and low-top sneakers, diamond-encrusted watches, guitars with “Make America Great Again” emblazoned across the necks and digital trading cards featuring him in an array of theatrically heroic poses, sometimes in superhero costume. The products are sold through licensing deals that, according to his financial disclosures, bring him over $7 million in income.Victory 45-47 is the second line of presidential fragrances; the first, called Fight, Fight, Fight, was released during the campaign. That scent’s packaging featured a triumphant photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air, a nod to an assassination attempt against him last year. In videos online, perfume reviewers and enthusiasts noted that the actual bottle of Fight, Fight, Fight that shipped featured just a sticker logo on the bottle but that the fragrance smelled “fresh.”ImageThe new product from Trump Fragrances is called Trump Victory 45-47 and comes in men’s and women’s scents.Credit...Trump FragrancesTrump Fragrances “represent winning,” said Mr. Trump, standing in front of four American flags in a video on the company’s website. “Get yourself a bottle and don’t forget to grab one for your loved ones, too. They’ll thank you and they’ll even smell good.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
