As more and more sustainable brands come out of the woodwork, Sockwell is one that has emphasized eco-consciousness for more than a decade. Since hitting the scene in 2011, the Chattanooga-bred brand consistently stands out by committing to comfortable products and ethical manufacturing. The result of combining the two: American-made Merino wool socks that you have to slip on to believe. Sockwell’s path to making a quality pair goes beyond gathering high-quality materials that hold up after years of wear. Its founders and designers built a brand that prioritizes ethical sourcing, in turn minimizing their environmental impact and supporting local communities along the way. From the U.S.-based farms where it sources wool to the innovative knitting mills where their socks are made, Sockwell takes pride in every step of their production process. Explore how Sockwell socks are not just made in the USA but crafted to make a difference. In This ArticleThe Sockwell StoryBeyond ComfortWhy MerinoThe Making of Sockwell SocksSockwell's Impact on Local CommunitiesConclusion Crafted in the Heart of America: The Sockwell Story Sockwell launched in 2011, three years after Thomas Lee and Jim Markley founded it in 2008, pairing decades of experience in sports apparel and hosiery manufacturing. Years later, it’s clear that it was a match made in heaven, ultimately leading to the pair working with Mercedes Marchand, an essential designer who worked with Jim at Smartwool. After she left Smartwool, Mercedes followed her passion for the industry to develop and design a therapeutic collection of socks, ultimately becoming a seamless addition to the brand. Now, almost 15 years later, Sockwell’s dedication to local production remains as essential to its strategy as it was from Day 1. Founded in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the brand was born from a desire to reimagine average socks by prioritizing premier quality and American manufacturing. Their local mill, Heritage Hosiery, has been operating since the mid-’90s and boasts a collection of the finest Italian-made knitting machines capable of churning out Sockwell socks right here in the States. Think of it as an international affair, with the final result being premium USA-made socks. According to the brand, it couldn’t make such impeccable socks without USA-grown Merino wool, assuring that it’s the perfect fiber to keep your feet healthy while lowering your carbon footprint. Even more, though, it’s a significant step toward revitalizing the American textile industry. Learn more about Sockwell’s local commitment. Sockwell’s Sustainable Journey: Beyond Comfort Sustainability will always be in style at Sockwell, abiding by ethical practices like responsible yarn dyeing and sustainable packaging. The brand’s key partner, Meridian Specialty Yarn Group, is a North Carolina-based leader in its field and recently built a dyehouse allowing for low-liquor-ratio dyeing, which cuts the amount of water needed in half. The conservation doesn’t stop there, though. By transitioning from standard, petroleum-based nylon to recycled nylon socks, Sockwell has saved more than half a gallon of gasoline for every pound it uses. The material is constructed of Repreve® nylon, a pre-consumer fiber waste that helps eliminate the need for crude oil. Since 2011, the brand has used locally sourced Merino wool from ethical American farmers who abide by the Five Freedoms of Animal Welfare before crafting every pair stateside, promising fair treatment and high-quality results. In addition to shedding the carbon footprint connected with wool fiber, American breeds’ anatomies do not require mulesing to secure material. Overall, the brand’s American Merino wool supply chain assures nothing short of the best results for all parties involved. Once the brand’s bread and butter is spun and sewn, it ships every order using poly mailer bags from EcoEnclose, a leading name in sustainable packaging supplies. These lightweight and weatherproof poly mailers are made in the USA using 50% post-consumer waste. Best of all, they’re equipped with an adhesive strip that lets you reuse it in case you need to make a return. Since 2008, the brand has even used the same cardboard boxes it’s received products in to ship the socks to stockists. That said, it should come as no surprise that Sockwell employees recycle every bit of paper that comes through their office. Sockwell’s sustainable approach extends beyond its materials, as the brand constantly seeks modes to minimize their impact throughout the entire operation. Whether using recycled and recyclable materials in their packaging or partnering with suppliers who share their commitment to ethical and sustainable practices, the Chatanoonga imprint sets a gold standard in its space. Discover Sockwell’s sustainable practices. Why Merino? The Comfort and Ethics of Sockwell Wool Merino wool has almost too many benefits to count on one hand, with its natural absorbency, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating, and odor-preventing properties. Let’s take it from the top, as few things are more irritating than getting your socks and feet wet on rainy days. And, in case they get wet, all you have to do is take your shoes off and let the socks dry, which they will do in mere minutes. Next up, Merino wool’s temperature-regulating properties can keep feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer, adjusting alongside the season so you don’t have to stock up on different types of socks based on the weather. Last but certainly not least when it comes to anything feet-related, the sweat and bacteria that seep into Merino wool socks have no opportunity to grow and leave you with smelly toes after getting home. All of this harkens back to moisture management, which handles the sweat naturally. Sockwell’s use of USA-sourced Merino wool is immensely strategic, benefiting customers and the environment. Rambouilette sheep are naturally resistant to parasites and disease thanks to their lack of wrinkles. And the premier pro of using Merino wool? Longevity. No one likes swapping between pairs of socks because one has a hole in it, and Sockwell asserts that “Merino wool socks can replace twenty or thirty pairs of cotton and synthetic alternatives.” Feel the difference with Sockwell Merino wool: See the Collection Woven with Precision: The Making of Sockwell Socks Sockwell’s dedication to crafting high-quality wool socks starts with the first step in its manufacturing process, spanning cities across America and utilizing cutting-edge technology to set a new standard for how socks are made. Step one is sourcing the finest Merino wool from local sheep herders. This material embarks on a bit of a journey, first being transformed into yarn in South Carolina and then getting dyed to countless hues in North Carolina. Said colorful yarn then arrives at Sockwell’s top-tier knitting mills in Tennessee, where those advanced Italian-made machines come into play, weaving intricate patterns and precise designs. These state-of-the-art machines are programmed using specific instructions for each specific sock, ensuring consistent quality and an ideal fit. But Sockwell’s production process is more than just automated machinery. Skilled technicians oversee every step to guarantee that the machines are running smoothly and that every pair meets Sockwell’s lofty standards. The company implements a unique linking technique to create a virtually seamless toe panel for lasting comfort. Throughout the whole process, rigorous quality checks guarantee that every pair of Sockwell socks lives up to their reputation. Take a closer look at the production process. Strengthening Chattanooga: Sockwell’s Impact on Local Communities Few things are as critical in a world dominated by big-box retailers and e-commerce monopolies as supporting local businesses. By empowering the Chattanooga textile industry, Sockwell is one of many community-supporting businesses sticking to its humble roots and maintaining the city’s legacy, which dates back more than a century. Following in the footsteps of the Dixie Spinning Mills, the Standard Coosa Thatcher, and so many other textile factories of yore, Sockwell embraces a contemporary approach that forges a broader future for the city and, hopefully, the methods of production that brands enforce. As a result, Sockwell is an active contributor to the local economy by creating jobs and supporting local initiatives. In the long run, the brand’s fruitful relationship with the community revitalizes its storied textile tradition, fostering a sense of pride in American-made products. Sockwell’s presence in Chattanooga serves as a sliver of hope for the future of domestic manufacturing, proving that businesses can thrive in their field while prioritizing ethical and sustainable practices. Help in supporting local industries Conclusion From sourcing local, ethically produced Merino wool to shedding waste through their entire process, Sockwell’s commitment to sustainability stands at every level. Their dedication to regional manufacturing supports the community, reduces transportation costs, and makes a remarkably positive environmental impact. By choosing Sockwell, you’re not just investing in premium socks, so you don’t have to keep ordering the same dozen from Amazon: you’re supporting a brand that prioritizes the health of the planet and the well-being of its workers. Sustainable fashion socks are crucial to lowering your carbon footprint, and Sockwell is second to none in that department. They are a leader in comfortability and eco-cognizance, and their role in reshaping the textile industry without sacrificing results is beyond admirable. From compression socks designed for travel, exercising, and prolonged standing to colorful crew socks for kicking back and staying cozy, the brand has a range of pairs suitable for anybody – and that means anybody. With diabetic-friendly options and sportier pairs finished off with plantar support, strategic shoppers with pre-existing conditions can still find the perfect fit.

Let’s take it from the top, as few things are more irritating than getting your socks and feet wet on rainy days. And, in case they get wet, all you have to do is take your shoes off and let the socks dry, which they will do in mere minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks.jpg\" alt=\"group of people wearing knee high socks\" width=\"480\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks.jpg 480w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-150x135.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-444x400.jpg 444w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-222x200.jpg 222w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext up, Merino wool’s temperature-regulating properties can keep feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer, adjusting alongside the season so you don’t have to stock up on different types of socks based on the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast but certainly not least when it comes to anything feet-related, the sweat and bacteria that seep into Merino wool socks have no opportunity to grow and leave you with smelly toes after getting home.

Rambouilette sheep are naturally resistant to parasites and disease thanks to their lack of wrinkles. And the premier pro of using Merino wool? Longevity.

Even more, though, it’s a significant step toward revitalizing the American textile industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn more about Sockwell’s \u003ca href=\"https://go.linkby.com/DMUUIBLA/pages/our-story\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003elocal commitment\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"comfort\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eSockwell’s Sustainable Journey: Beyond Comfort\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSustainability will always be in style at Sockwell, abiding by ethical practices like responsible yarn dyeing and sustainable packaging. The brand’s key partner, Meridian Specialty Yarn Group, is a North Carolina-based leader in its field and recently built a dyehouse allowing for low-liquor-ratio dyeing, which cuts the amount of water needed in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield.jpg\" alt=\"alpacas in field\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield.jpg 1000w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_alpacasinfield-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conservation doesn’t stop there, though. By transitioning from standard, petroleum-based nylon to recycled nylon socks, Sockwell has saved more than half a gallon of gasoline for every pound it uses. The material is constructed of Repreve® nylon, a pre-consumer fiber waste that helps eliminate the need for crude oil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2011, the brand has used locally sourced Merino wool from ethical American farmers who abide by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.aspca.org/sites/default/files/upload/images/aspca_asv_five_freedoms_final1.ashx_.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eFive Freedoms of Animal Welfare\u003c/a\u003e before crafting every pair stateside, promising fair treatment and high-quality results. In addition to shedding the carbon footprint connected with wool fiber, American breeds’ anatomies do not require mulesing to secure material. Overall, the brand’s American Merino wool supply chain assures nothing short of the best results for all parties involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the brand’s bread and butter is spun and sewn, it ships every order using poly mailer bags from EcoEnclose, a leading name in sustainable packaging supplies. These lightweight and weatherproof poly mailers are made in the USA using 50% post-consumer waste. Best of all, they’re equipped with an adhesive strip that lets you reuse it in case you need to make a return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos.jpg\" alt=\"bamboos\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos.jpg 800w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos-150x133.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos-450x400.jpg 450w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos-225x200.jpg 225w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_bamboos-768x683.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2008, the brand has even used the same cardboard boxes it’s received products in to ship the socks to stockists. That said, it should come as no surprise that Sockwell employees recycle every bit of paper that comes through their office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSockwell’s sustainable approach extends beyond its materials, as the brand constantly seeks modes to minimize their impact throughout the entire operation.

The Comfort and Ethics of Sockwell Wool\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerino wool has almost too many benefits to count on one hand, with its natural absorbency, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating, and odor-preventing properties. Let’s take it from the top, as few things are more irritating than getting your socks and feet wet on rainy days. And, in case they get wet, all you have to do is take your shoes off and let the socks dry, which they will do in mere minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks.jpg\" alt=\"group of people wearing knee high socks\" width=\"480\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks.jpg 480w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-150x135.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-444x400.jpg 444w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sockwell_peoplewearingkneehighsocks-222x200.jpg 222w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext up, Merino wool’s temperature-regulating properties can keep feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer, adjusting alongside the season so you don’t have to stock up on different types of socks based on the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast but certainly not least when it comes to anything feet-related, the sweat and bacteria that seep into Merino wool socks have no opportunity to grow and leave you with smelly toes after getting home. All of this harkens back to moisture management, which handles the sweat naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSockwell’s use of USA-sourced Merino wool is immensely strategic, benefiting customers and the environment. Rambouilette sheep are naturally resistant to parasites and disease thanks to their lack of wrinkles. And the premier pro of using Merino wool? Longevity. No one likes swapping between pairs of socks because one has a hole in it, and Sockwell asserts that “Merino wool socks can replace twenty or thirty pairs of cotton and synthetic alternatives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel the difference with Sockwell Merino wool: \u003ca href=\"https://go.linkby.com/DMUUIBLA/collections/shop-all-mens-socks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eSee the Collection\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-making\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eWoven with Precision: The Making of Sockwell Socks\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSockwell’s dedication to crafting high-quality wool socks starts with the first step in its manufacturing process, spanning cities across America and utilizing cutting-edge technology to set a new standard for how socks are made. Step one is sourcing the finest Merino wool from local sheep herders. This material embarks on a bit of a journey, first being transformed into yarn in South Carolina and then getting dyed to countless hues in North Carolina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock.jpg\" alt=\"construction of a merino sock at Sockwell\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock.jpg 480w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock-400x400.jpg 400w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Sockwell_constructionofamerinosock-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSaid colorful yarn then arrives at Sockwell’s top-tier knitting mills in Tennessee, where those advanced Italian-made machines come into play, weaving intricate patterns and precise designs.

Skilled technicians oversee every step to guarantee that the machines are running smoothly and that every pair meets Sockwell’s lofty standards.

In the long run, the brand’s fruitful relationship with the community revitalizes its storied textile tradition, fostering a sense of pride in American-made products. Sockwell’s presence in Chattanooga serves as a sliver of hope for the future of domestic manufacturing, proving that businesses can thrive in their field while prioritizing ethical and sustainable practices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://go.linkby.com/DMUUIBLA/blogs/blog/your-sockwell-socks-are-made-right-around-the-corner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHelp in supporting local industries\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fin-ver\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eConclusion\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom sourcing local, ethically produced Merino wool to shedding waste through their entire process, Sockwell’s commitment to sustainability stands at every level.
