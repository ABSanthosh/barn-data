These high-rise performance leggings are designed to feel comfortable all day long. Since the material is stretchy, the brand recommends sizing down if you’re in between sizes, whether you pick a short, regular, or long length.“These leggings are actually comfy enough to wear for all day vs the traditional leggings that fit more snug,” one customer explained. Many have noted that they own several pairs of this style, with one writing: “Love these leggings. Second pair I own. Gifted a pair to my sis and she too loves them.”Shop VuoriVuori AllTheFeels Legging, $, available at VuoriVuori Long Sleeve Halo CrewThe Best Workout-to-Weekend CrewneckThe Hype: 4.8 out of 5 stars, 3,207 reviewsGo from the gym to brunch to the airport in a performance crewneck that’s as soft and cozy as it is stylish and sleek. This one is available in so many fall-ready colorways, it’ll be hard to narrow down which to pick (or force you to add multiple to your collection).From customer reviews, we can surmise that this top is heavier than the Daydream Crew, but lighter than the Essential Hoodie. “Perfect for fall or spring days. Heavier than a T-shirt but not a sweatshirt. I have short arms so I only buy shirts with a band at the sleeve. Going to have to get more colors,” one customer wrote.

They’re available in regular and long lengths.One happy customer wrote, “These are soft, comfortable and actually flattering. They're the only joggers I wear out and about (as opposed to just house pants). I like that it's recycled material. Wash and wear beautifully.” Another added: “I have gone back \u0026 forth on the joggers due to a higher price but finally bought a pair \u0026 am glad I did. They are so soft \u0026 comfortable.
