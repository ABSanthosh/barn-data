And What Makes it ‘Woke’?A catchy song by an Irish singer, and a simple dance to go along with it, have given social media creators an easy trend to emulate.CMAT, an Irish singer whose full name is Ciara Mary-Alice Thompson, has had her song “Take a Sexy Picture of Me,” become a TikTok sensation with help from a simple dance that fans call the Woke Macarena.Credit...Henry Nicholls/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJune 5, 2025Sam Morris has had videos blow up on TikTok before, but he still didn’t expect this to happen.In the weeks since he posted choreography to a snippet of the song “Take A Sexy Picture Of Me” by the Irish singer CMAT, the dance he created has emerged as a full-fledged trend. Creators are using the moves on social media, and crowds are performing them at CMAT’s concerts.“It’s not my first, first rodeo, but I wasn’t expecting it,” said Mr. Morris, a 37-year-old writer and content creator based in Brighton, England.The actual dance is simple and straightforward. Following along with the words of CMAT’s song, (“I did the butcher / I did the baker / I did the home and the family maker / I did schoolgirl fantasies,”) Mr. Morris’s dance has participants miming chopping and baking on their way, hopefully, to TikTok fame.The dance kicked around for several weeks, but took on new relevance when it was given a catchy (and, for some, confusing) nickname: the Woke Macarena.So, what is happening here?CMAT, an emerging star, released “Take a Sexy Picture of Me” last month. She said on social media that she wrote the song, which is about the different phases you go through as a young woman, after receiving a flood of “nasty comments” on her physical appearance.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
