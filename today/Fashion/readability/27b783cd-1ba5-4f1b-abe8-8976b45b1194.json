Cross/The New York TimesJune 29, 2025Updated 3:54 p.m. ETAaron Corn spent a recent afternoon adding some pizazz to his 1991 Subaru Sambar, a white pickup truck that looked as if it had shrunk in the wash.As his wife, Laura, packed the Sambar with drinks and snacks, Mr. Corn carefully applied decals to its side paneling that contained the Japanese symbols for Fujiwara Tofu Store, a fictional business in the manga series, “Initial D.”In the series, the main character drives a hatchback. But near his home in Leesburg, Va., Mr. Corn, 50, tools around in his Sambar, a type of vehicle known as a Kei truck. Ubiquitous in Japan for decades, Kei trucks are extremely small, decidedly slow and, despite a series of federal and state laws that can make them difficult to import and register, quietly growing in popularity among American consumers.Mr. Corn, who works as a consultant, recalled the moment he first spotted a Kei truck in the wild, at an auto repair shop about three years ago.“They had been on my radar,” he said, “but when I finally saw one in person, I knew that I had to have one.”After he finished applying his decals, Mr. Corn and his wife, 39, braved bad weather, downed trees and closed roads on a two-hour drive to Alexandria, Va., for an evening meet-up of the Capital Kei Car Club.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
