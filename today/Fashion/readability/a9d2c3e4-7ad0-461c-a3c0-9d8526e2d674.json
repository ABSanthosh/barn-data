It goes for $228. It’s the cheapest, most simple, unlined basic jacket on this list, and chances are you will be happy with this jacket. And you don’t need any of these other jackets on the list. But these other jackets go insane in terms of quality, in terms of famous celebrities wearing them. We’re breaking down this jacket, the Huckberry jacket, all the way up to the most famous celebrity wax jacket of all time! In This ArticleBreaking This DownComparison ChartHuckberry Wax TruckerBradley Mountain Cabin JacketFreenote Cloth Rider's JacketRogue Territory Supply JacketWatch This ReviewThat’s All, Folks! How We’re Breaking This Down What’s up, everyone, it’s Michael! Today, during the wax jacket Olympics, we will be looking at four wax jackets, and we will break down each jacket into categories. Number one: what are the base statistics? Then we will break down into sizing – how does it fit, who should it fit? Then we get into accolades. Then we will do the cons. What is something that I don’t like about the specific jacket? And finally, my favorite, I will say who I think should actually wear this jacket. Let’s check out the best waxed canvas jackets for men. Comparison Chart Product Specifications and Construction Features Fit and Sizing Accolades Cons Target Audience Huckberry Wax Trucker 7 oz Martexin sail cloth, unlined Basic, lightweight, rain-resistant Standard fit, suitable for most body types Most affordable on the list No lining, feels more like a shirt Casual wear, those seeking a simple style upgrade Bradley Mountain Jacket 12 oz fabric, Japanese cotton flannel lining Eight pockets, leather tab with D-ring Shorter fit, designed for a more rugged build Most ingenuitive, underrated brand Short hem, could use more flat-felled seams Outdoorsy types, utility-focused users Freenote Cloth Rider’s Jacket 10 oz Martexin wax, cotton flannel and satin lining Gusseted for movement, elastic bands for flexibility Slim fit, symbiotic silhouette Best constructed jacket No significant cons noted California cool, motorcycle enthusiasts Rogue Territory Supply Jacket 10 oz fabric from India, Martexin waxed, unlined Slim cut, rounded chest pocket, well-crafted cuffs Slimmest fit, flattering on lean builds Best dressed, celebrity favorite No lining, may be restrictive when layered Stylish, rugged yet refined look seekers The Budget-Friendly Champion: Huckberry Wax Trucker The Iron Snail The Huckberry Wax Trucker jacket is a seven-ounce Martexin sailcloth. Martexin is the waxing company, and then right next to them, literally the building right next to them, is Fairfield Textile Mills. So they make the fabric, and Martexin waxes it. Interestingly, I believe all of the companies we’re talking about today use at least Martexin wax. The last company actually uses fabric from India, but they wax it with Martexin wax. We’ll get to that later. This is the lightest fabric of the entire bunch. This jacket can be worn when it’s a little warmer outside, especially because it also does not have a lining. This is like a very heavy Oxford shirt – not very heavy at all. The Iron Snail It feels more like a shirt than an actual jacket. These jackets are Huckberry’s number one selling product, and I think that’s for a reason. Either way, because of that, they are cut more generally, so this fits me okay, but if I was an inch or two taller, this would fit me how I would like it. It’s a little more cropped than the line version I believe, but basically a standard fit. I am 5’9” and 148 lbs, so sizing is good. Generally, anyone is going to be able to fit into this jacket. You can be big or small and still be happy. The Iron Snail Now, my favorite part – well, my second favorite part – the accolades! This jacket obviously has one accolade, one major accolade, and that is that it is the cheapest jacket on this list by almost a hundred dollars. It comes in 98 dollars cheaper than another one, but it kind of smacks the competition on the rumpus. It does have a con. As I said before, everything has a con; nothing is perfect in life. You have to accept that before you get too old or you also get disgruntled, you know? The number one con here, actually we’ll talk about in a little bit because I really want to thread the needle when we get to the last product. The Iron Snail But all in all, it is a fantastic jacket, built pretty well, and like I said, you would all be happy with this jacket. No one would get this jacket and be like, ‘Oh, it sucks!’ So, who’s the stereotypical person I think that would be wearing a Huckberry unlined wax trucker jacket? Just this regular guy trying to upgrade a style a little bit. He likes to wear this jacket when it’s raining outside with a hat and people that just want to be casual. Okay, next up! The Hidden Features King: Bradley Mountain Cabin Jacket The Iron Snail I like Bradley Mountain because I like products that have a ton of hidden features in them, things that make them stronger, things that make them more useful. I drool over that, and Bradley Mountain is the absolute king of that. The Iron Snail You’d be able to notice right away that this fabric is dramatically heavier than what’s used on the Huckberry jacket. Twelve ounces on the outside! We also now have a 100% Japanese cotton lining on the inside. It’s flannel, so it’s very fluffy. When we really want to talk about features, this jacket is where things get insane, and that is my favorite part about this jacket. The Iron Snail The most simple thing is that it has eight pockets total on your front chest area. I’m counting the breast area as three because of the super cool fly rod snap. I have no idea what that is. I mean, I could take a guess, but I don’t know for sure. On the inside of one of the pockets, there’s a leather tab with a D-ring on it – it’s a place where you could put your tools or something like that. Either way, you know, use your imagination. I’m not going to do that for you. The Iron Snail But they even miss one of the greatest details on their jackets, which is that all of their buttons have leather washers behind them, so that way they tear less easily and stay on even stronger. Huckberry cuts their jackets for like an everyday dude, but Bradley Mountain clearly cuts them for someone that’s a bit burlier, someone that’s layering, someone that’s doing a lot of physical labor. So this is an extra small, and it fits me really well. There is nothing upsetting about that or anything. It’s also a little shorter than the Huckberry jacket, which I like. The Iron Snail Okay, and now the accolade section – two, well, one really weird accolade for this brand I’ll talk about last, but the first one obviously: most ingenuity! It’s so obvious that Bradley Mountain thinks extensively about all of its products to the most utilitarian degree possible. My backpack from them has six areas where you can add leather to store things better. It has a ton of pockets and is brilliantly laid out and brilliantly executed. Most importantly, the accolade I want to give Bradley Mountain is ‘Most Underrated, Most Likely to Succeed in the Long Term.’ The Iron Snail I just feel like this brand is not really talked about enough. I think they’re an absolutely fantastic brand all around that doesn’t get enough credit. This jacket has two cons: the hem of this jacket – I usually prefer things with a rather long hem. It could be twice as long. This doesn’t bother 99% of people, but to me, it makes this part of the jacket seem a little flappy, a little odd, so I personally prefer long hems. The Iron Snail The other thing that is a con about this jacket, at least for me – in all practicality, this will never be an issue for you – I wish Bradley Mountain used some more flat-felled seams on their stitching. Like I said, you’re never gonna bust through the seams, but it would just be nice. It’s like an above and beyond measure. This jacket is suited for the outdoorsy type. It’s called the cabin jacket for a reason – someone who would use all of the front pockets and the tool slots and everything like that would love this jacket. My girlfriend Taylor’s brother is a fly fisherman. He would love it because it has a fly rod snap. The Craftsman’s Dream: Freenote Cloth Rider’s Jacket The Iron Snail This next jacket is the epitome of artistry, dedicated craftsmanship, construction quality, and materials – anything you could possibly imagine. This jacket is almost at the mecca of – this is the Freenote Cloth Rider’s jacket. The first thing is that it’s 10-ounce Martexin wax fabric, but on the inside, we have 100% cotton Japanese flannel lining on the chest, and in the sleeves, we have a satin lining. It does, when you put the jacket on, make it feel a billion times more premium. When you slide the jacket onto your body, I feel like Ghost Rider right before his head explodes! The Iron Snail What’s so special about this jacket, though, has to do with the back of this jacket. You’ll notice that it’s gusseted, so there’s a little extra movement when I move my arms, but we can still keep the jacket slim. Most importantly, elastic bands are on the inside of this jacket. I haven’t cut this jacket open, so I don’t know exactly what Freenote Cloth is talking about, but instead of just having gussets where I have more movement, it also has a little bit of stretch to it. So even if the gussets are kind of maxed out, I can still move a little bit more. Freenote Cloth has some of the best sizing in the business, so this is a size small, and it just fits me how I like. It also has a very recognizable silhouette where the jacket doesn’t wear you, and you don’t wear the jacket – it seems like a very symbiotic relationship. The Iron Snail In terms of accolades for this jacket, surprisingly, I only have one, but it is a very, very good one, and that is that it is the best-constructed jacket of the lot by a country mile. I don’t know how exactly far that is; maybe this length of one Garth Brooks song? Who is the stereotypical person that I see liking and wearing this jacket? Obviously, Freenote Cloth is a California company, and this is called a rider’s jacket – I’m kind of only talking about rider’s jackets today but still, to me, this is the epitome of a cool dude in California who has a motorcycle’s jacket. The Celebrity Favorite: Rogue Territory Supply Jacket Finally, the most famous jacket of the entire bunch! This is certainly one of the best waxed canvas jackets for men. How could I do part two of this Olympic series and not include the Rogue Territory Supply jacket in tan? It’s very, very famous – James Bond wears it, Ryan Reynolds wears it in a movie. This does use a 10-ounce fabric that you would think is Martexin. It’s a very pleasant feel in the hand, but either way it is fabric from India using Martexin wax. The Iron Snail So instead of using Fairfield Mills, they use one of India Mills, and then they send it to Martexin to get waxed there. There is no lining, which we’ll talk about at the end. This is definitely the slimmest fitting jacket of the bunch by design – it says that on the website. I am wearing just a t-shirt under this, and I could layer it if I wanted to, but I would start to look a little puffy. That’s not the point of this jacket. The Iron Snail The point of the jacket is really like Daniel Craig, James Bond, and Ryan Reynolds. This jacket is incredibly flattering on people because of its slimness and because of how it is cut. So I got a size small. I feel like it looks great, and it’s incredibly flattering. It goes into who I think this jacket is for, but we’ll touch on that in a second. The construction of this jacket is also fantastic – this rounded chest pocket is not easy to do. A lot of thought goes into this garment in general. The Iron Snail The cuffs are also beautiful, and that is why the biggest accolade of this jacket is ‘Best Dressed’ – the sexiest jacket of the bunch! Maybe it’s specifically because I’ve seen Ryan Reynolds actually wearing this jacket, but this feels like a Ryan Reynolds-esque jacket. The every man that’s kind of cool, that’s really dressed well, that’s at their kid’s soccer game with a coffee just like chilling, kind of talking to the other dads, kind of not. To me, it strikes that balance between ‘Yeah, I wear rugged clothes, but I’m very, very well aware that I won’t be doing very rugged activities while wearing these clothes.’ The Iron Snail The one con that Rogue Territory and Huckberry have for me is that they are not lined. I personally always like a lining on wax jackets just so the wax doesn’t touch your clothes or your arms or something like that, but that’s it. Other than that, it’s flawless!

It’s a little more cropped than the line version I believe, but basically a standard fit. I am 5’9” and 148 lbs, so sizing is good. Generally, anyone is going to be able to fit into this jacket.

On the inside of one of the pockets, there’s a leather tab with a D-ring on it – it’s a place where you could put your tools or something like that. Either way, you know, use your imagination.

Huckberry cuts their jackets for like an everyday dude, but Bradley Mountain clearly cuts them for someone that’s a bit burlier, someone that’s layering, someone that’s doing a lot of physical labor. So this is an extra small, and it fits me really well. There is nothing upsetting about that or anything. It’s also a little shorter than the Huckberry jacket, which I like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185991\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185991\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley Mountain Cabin Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket6_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185991\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, and now the accolade section – two, well, one really weird accolade for this brand I’ll talk about last, but the first one obviously: most ingenuity! It’s so obvious that Bradley Mountain thinks extensively about all of its products to the most utilitarian degree possible. My backpack from them has six areas where you can add leather to store things better. It has a ton of pockets and is brilliantly laid out and brilliantly executed. Most importantly, the accolade I want to give Bradley Mountain is ‘Most Underrated, Most Likely to Succeed in the Long Term.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185992\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185992\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Bradley Mountain Cabin Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket8_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185992\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just feel like this brand is not really talked about enough. I think they’re an absolutely fantastic brand all around that doesn’t get enough credit. This jacket has two cons: the hem of this jacket – I usually prefer things with a rather long hem. It could be twice as long. This doesn’t bother 99% of people, but to me, it makes this part of the jacket seem a little flappy, a little odd, so I personally prefer long hems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185993\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185993\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket9_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.gif\" alt=\"Bradley Mountain Cabin Jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185993\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing that is a con about this jacket, at least for me – in all practicality, this will never be an issue for you – I wish Bradley Mountain used some more flat-felled seams on their stitching. Like I said, you’re never gonna bust through the seams, but it would just be nice. It’s like an above and beyond measure. This jacket is suited for the outdoorsy type. It’s called the cabin jacket for a reason – someone who would use all of the front pockets and the tool slots and everything like that would love this jacket. My girlfriend Taylor’s brother is a fly fisherman. He would love it because it has a fly rod snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"freenote\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://freenotecloth.com/products/riders-jacket-waxed-canvas-oak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Craftsman’s Dream: Freenote Cloth Rider’s Jacket\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185981\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185981\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://freenotecloth.com/products/riders-jacket-waxed-canvas-oak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.gif\" alt=\"Freenote Cloth Rider\u0026#39;s Jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185981\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis next jacket is the epitome of artistry, dedicated craftsmanship, construction quality, and materials – anything you could possibly imagine.

You’ll notice that it’s gusseted, so there’s a little extra movement when I move my arms, but we can still keep the jacket slim. Most importantly, elastic bands are on the inside of this jacket. I haven’t cut this jacket open, so I don’t know exactly what Freenote Cloth is talking about, but instead of just having gussets where I have more movement, it also has a little bit of stretch to it. So even if the gussets are kind of maxed out, I can still move a little bit more. Freenote Cloth has some of the best sizing in the business, so this is a size small, and it just fits me how I like. It also has a very recognizable silhouette where the jacket doesn’t wear you, and you don’t wear the jacket – it seems like a very symbiotic relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185996\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Freenote Cloth Rider\u0026#39;s Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185996\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of accolades for this jacket, surprisingly, I only have one, but it is a very, very good one, and that is that it is the best-constructed jacket of the lot by a country mile.

Obviously, Freenote Cloth is a California company, and this is called a rider’s jacket – I’m kind of only talking about rider’s jackets today but still, to me, this is the epitome of a cool dude in California who has a motorcycle’s jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"rogue\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.rogueterritory.com/products/supply-jacket-ridgeline?variant=39769814040681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Celebrity Favorite: Rogue Territory Supply Jacket\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.rogueterritory.com/products/supply-jacket-ridgeline?variant=39769814040681\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.gif\" alt=\"Rogue Territory Supply Jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the most famous jacket of the entire bunch!

There is no lining, which we’ll talk about at the end. This is definitely the slimmest fitting jacket of the bunch by design – it says that on the website.

These jackets are Huckberry’s number one selling product, and I think that’s for a reason. Either way, because of that, they are cut more generally, so this fits me okay, but if I was an inch or two taller, this would fit me how I would like it. It’s a little more cropped than the line version I believe, but basically a standard fit. I am 5’9” and 148 lbs, so sizing is good. Generally, anyone is going to be able to fit into this jacket.

This jacket obviously has one accolade, one major accolade, and that is that it is the cheapest jacket on this list by almost a hundred dollars. It comes in 98 dollars cheaper than another one, but it kind of smacks the competition on the rumpus. It does have a con. As I said before, everything has a con; nothing is perfect in life.

No one would get this jacket and be like, ‘Oh, it sucks!’ So, who’s the stereotypical person I think that would be wearing a Huckberry unlined wax trucker jacket? Just this regular guy trying to upgrade a style a little bit. He likes to wear this jacket when it’s raining outside with a hat and people that just want to be casual.

I’m counting the breast area as three because of the super cool fly rod snap. I have no idea what that is. I mean, I could take a guess, but I don’t know for sure. On the inside of one of the pockets, there’s a leather tab with a D-ring on it – it’s a place where you could put your tools or something like that. Either way, you know, use your imagination.

Huckberry cuts their jackets for like an everyday dude, but Bradley Mountain clearly cuts them for someone that’s a bit burlier, someone that’s layering, someone that’s doing a lot of physical labor. So this is an extra small, and it fits me really well. There is nothing upsetting about that or anything.

It’s so obvious that Bradley Mountain thinks extensively about all of its products to the most utilitarian degree possible. My backpack from them has six areas where you can add leather to store things better. It has a ton of pockets and is brilliantly laid out and brilliantly executed.

I think they’re an absolutely fantastic brand all around that doesn’t get enough credit. This jacket has two cons: the hem of this jacket – I usually prefer things with a rather long hem. It could be twice as long. This doesn’t bother 99% of people, but to me, it makes this part of the jacket seem a little flappy, a little odd, so I personally prefer long hems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185993\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185993\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/BradleyMountainCabinJacket9_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.gif\" alt=\"Bradley Mountain Cabin Jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185993\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other thing that is a con about this jacket, at least for me – in all practicality, this will never be an issue for you – I wish Bradley Mountain used some more flat-felled seams on their stitching. Like I said, you’re never gonna bust through the seams, but it would just be nice. It’s like an above and beyond measure. This jacket is suited for the outdoorsy type. It’s called the cabin jacket for a reason – someone who would use all of the front pockets and the tool slots and everything like that would love this jacket. My girlfriend Taylor’s brother is a fly fisherman. He would love it because it has a fly rod snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"freenote\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://freenotecloth.com/products/riders-jacket-waxed-canvas-oak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Craftsman’s Dream: Freenote Cloth Rider’s Jacket\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185981\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185981\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://freenotecloth.com/products/riders-jacket-waxed-canvas-oak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.gif\" alt=\"Freenote Cloth Rider\u0026#39;s Jacket\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185981\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis next jacket is the epitome of artistry, dedicated craftsmanship, construction quality, and materials – anything you could possibly imagine.

You’ll notice that it’s gusseted, so there’s a little extra movement when I move my arms, but we can still keep the jacket slim. Most importantly, elastic bands are on the inside of this jacket. I haven’t cut this jacket open, so I don’t know exactly what Freenote Cloth is talking about, but instead of just having gussets where I have more movement, it also has a little bit of stretch to it. So even if the gussets are kind of maxed out, I can still move a little bit more. Freenote Cloth has some of the best sizing in the business, so this is a size small, and it just fits me how I like. It also has a very recognizable silhouette where the jacket doesn’t wear you, and you don’t wear the jacket – it seems like a very symbiotic relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1185996\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1185996\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Freenote Cloth Rider\u0026#39;s Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FreenoteClothRidersJacket3_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1185996\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of accolades for this jacket, surprisingly, I only have one, but it is a very, very good one, and that is that it is the best-constructed jacket of the lot by a country mile.

There is no lining, which we’ll talk about at the end. This is definitely the slimmest fitting jacket of the bunch by design – it says that on the website.

A lot of thought goes into this garment in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1186000\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1186000\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue Territory Supply Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket4_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1186000\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cuffs are also beautiful, and that is why the biggest accolade of this jacket is ‘Best Dressed’ – the sexiest jacket of the bunch! Maybe it’s specifically because I’ve seen Ryan Reynolds actually wearing this jacket, but this feels like a Ryan Reynolds-esque jacket. The every man that’s kind of cool, that’s really dressed well, that’s at their kid’s soccer game with a coffee just like chilling, kind of talking to the other dads, kind of not. To me, it strikes that balance between ‘Yeah, I wear rugged clothes, but I’m very, very well aware that I won’t be doing very rugged activities while wearing these clothes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1186001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1186001\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue Territory Supply Jacket\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen.jpg 854w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/RogueTerritorySupplyJacket5_TISBestWaxCanvasJacketsForMen-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1186001\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@TheIronSnail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eThe Iron Snail\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one con that Rogue Territory and Huckberry have for me is that they are not lined.
