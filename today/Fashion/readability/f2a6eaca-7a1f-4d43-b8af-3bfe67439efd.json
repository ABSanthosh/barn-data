If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.As much as I love my go-to hair products, I’m always looking for better, more cost-effective options. This is especially true when it comes to a product that I use frequently, like shampoo. I’d obviously heard of Native, the new, relatively clean drugstore brand, and have even tried out their natural deodorant a time or two. But once I heard that they offered sunscreens, moisturizer, and even hair care, I knew I had to do a Native shampoo review. They had me at “thoughtfully made with clean ingredients” but left me wondering, “Is Native shampoo good? Will it actually clean my hair and leave it feeling silky, bouncy, and refreshed?” Let’s delve in below. In This ArticleHow We TestedAbout Native ShampooBuying ConsiderationWhy It's GreatHow To Use ItFlaws But Not DealbreakersAlternativesWhy Trust UsVerdictFAQs native / Instagram How We Tested I was pleased to discover that there are several different Native shampoo and conditioner lines to choose from according to hair type. So, I first had to assess my own personal hair type before selecting. I go into that in further detail below. As for the categories, Native has moisturizing, volumizing, strengthening, curl care, and a daily clean line to choose from. I have relatively thick hair, so I feel the need to wash my hair only twice a week. To give this Native shampoo review a fair shake, I decided to wash my hair with it for two weeks so I could see how it looked and felt after four applications. Measurements For this Native shampoo review, I took a hard look at my hair type before selecting from their range of shampoo offerings. I have moderately thick, color-treated hair with some texture that is wavy in certain areas and can always use an extra dose of hydration. This led me to the moisturizing shampoo. According to the description, it gently cleanses, replenishes moisture, and rinses clean. Perfect. For my next step in the Native shampoo review, I chose the Coconut and Vanilla scent because I thought it would be most pleasing on an everyday basis. They offer seasonal varieties, but I wanted to review a scent that is most often available for purchase. TL;DR Native Shampoos are available in various lines depending on your hair needs. They’re safe for all hair types, including color-treated and dry, damaged hair. Expect a shorter list of transparent ingredients. A low price point and ‘a little goes a long way’ product make it excellent value. I felt that it did a decent job cleansing my hair without stripping it. About Native Shampoo Much like its simple and clean white bottle, Native is all about fewer ingredients and greater transparency, hence the phrase “thoughtfully made with clean ingredients” printed on the bottle. This is bolstered by the transparency chart at the back that gives a description of each ingredient and what it does. But the word ‘clean’ feels subjective. A glance at the ingredients reveals that it contains fragrance, which isn’t great for those with sensitive skin, and there’s some chatter of a class-action lawsuit about their use of PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, which are in pretty much everything. Conclusion: not yet reached, so it really doesn’t prove much yet. What I do know is that Native shampoos are sulfate- and paraben-free. Sulfates can be pretty stripping to hair, especially if it’s color-treated. I prefer to use shampoos without it, which leads me to my next point. I love that Native shampoo is suitable for pretty much all hair types, including color-treated, fine, dry, and damaged hair. They even have various lines specifically tailored to certain hair needs and hair types. Native offers a variety of subtle yet yummy scents, including new seasonal varieties. However, one of its best features is the low price tag. If you purchase from their website, all orders over $10 ship for free. For 16.5 oz, it’s hard to find a decent product for such a low cost, especially if you’re looking to scale back from more expensive shampoos. megans.1904 / Instagram What To Consider Before Buying Before purchasing Native shampoo, it’s important to consider your hair type. This will help you choose which line is best for you. Is your hair dry, coarse, or even aging and in need of hydration? If so, then the moisturizing line is for you. To give a great weightless lift to fine, thin hair and restore some bounce, the volumizing line is a must. The strengthening line is ideal for damaged, distressed, lifeless locks that need fortifying. It will restore moisture and prevent future breakage. The curl care line gives curls essential moisture while helping to maintain curl pattern and that delicious, springy bounce. And finally, the daily clean line is ideal if your hair is in a pretty healthy state and needs a straightforward clean with adequate hydration. iamservante / Instagram Why It’s Great/Why I Liked It After washing my hair several times with the Coconut and Vanilla moisturizing shampoo, I felt like it cleaned my hair pretty well. It worked into a nice lather but didn’t leave my hair feeling overstripped or too squeaky-clean after the fact. As for the scent, it was light yet pleasant, with a yummy touch of vanilla. If you want a shampoo that smells good, Native is a solid choice. I will say that after using the conditioner, I felt that my hair was hydrated but there was a level of nourishment missing when compared to my usual shampoo and conditioner brand I purchase at my salon. Additionally, I loved the price point—the price is a bit steeper on Amazon, but only $10 for 16.5 ounces on the Native website. And it did take only one or two pumps to adequately cleanse and cover my scalp, helping its value to stretch even further. This wouldn’t be an honest Native shampoo review if I didn’t mention that. How To Use it Like many good shampoos, Native takes only a pump or two to work into a decent lather. You want to massage it directly into your scalp, avoiding the lengths of your hair. As the shampoo rinses out, it will cleanse the more delicate ends of your hair. The focus should really be on your scalp, the part of your skin that produces sweat and oils. Use as frequently as you would wash your hair, anytime. Although I will say that your hair might feel less oily over time with use, so you may even be able to scale back over time and increase the time between washes. deyluvzaid / Instagram Flaws but Not Deal-breakers Though the shampoo had a soft, subtle scent that I liked and did an adequate job at cleaning my hair and left it feeling refreshed, I don’t think that it delivers the salon-quality nourishment and manageability I’m used to. As someone with thick hair that gets frequent highlights, I really feel like I need extra durable, high-quality products to keep my hair in check, at least shortly after my hair has undergone the coloring process. That said, the curl line seems to work really well for those with curly hair looking to restore bounce. And for guys who have relatively healthy hair that doesn’t need a ton of conditioning to survive, I think Native is an affordable, no-brainer choice. native / Instagram You Have Options: 3 Alternatives If Native isn’t your thing, you have options. Another accessible, relatively natural brand is Aveeno Daily Moisture Shampoo. Made with oat milk, colloidal oatmeal, and almond milk, it gently cleanses the hair while restoring hydration for all hair types, but especially dry, damaged hair. Like Native, it’s cheap, sulfate- and paraben-free, and safe for color-treated hair. I also like Burt’s Bees Very Volumizing Shampoo for guys with thin, fine hair or those looking for added bounce and body. It’s an eco-conscious brand as well that uses ingredients from nature to enhance its clean formulation. But the cleanest option you can try is EWG-verified Avalon Organics Volumizing Rosemary Shampoo. It’s certified organic, smells amazing, and uses rosemary to invigorate that scalp and truly promote hair growth. And it’s got pretty good value, too. Why Trust Us?

Verdict To conclude this Native shampoo review, I have to give props where props are due. Here is a decent-quality, super-affordable shampoo product that comes in delicious scents and a variety of lines to give your unique hair type a good cleanse. I like that it leaves hair feeling soft and refreshed after, though I would recommend a more heavy-duty shampoo if your hair is in need of extra love and care. The daily line is a great choice for guys looking for a simple, effective clean, and the Native Coconut and Vanilla moisturizing shampoo does a good job of getting hair nice and clean. FAQ Native shampoo is a safe, relatively clean brand that cleanses the hair without stripping it, leaving it feeling healthy, silky, and refreshed. While there are some people out there who have claimed Native caused hair loss, there has yet to be any definitive proof that this hair loss experienced had anything to do with Native products.
