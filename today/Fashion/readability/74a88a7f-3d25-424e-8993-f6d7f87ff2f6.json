People who are “natty,” or natural, abstain from steroids and PEDs, also called “gear” or “juice” in the gym, while others use the drugs to develop muscle at an accelerated rate.Some people are forthright when Mr. Boulet asks, with a cameraman in tow, a question that is often not spoken, or at most in a locker-room whisper. Jordan Wondergem, a trainer lifting at the gym that afternoon, said she was “currently natural,” but had used steroids in the past when she prepared for a bodybuilding circuit.“I started competing in bodybuilding around 2018, and that’s when I decided to try steroids,” said Ms. Wondergem, 34.Steve Shobert, 39, had just finished up a set of hack squats at Fit Club when Mr. Boulet came up to him. Mr. Shobert admitted to using testosterone and Primobolan, a steroid once famously used by the baseball player Alex Rodriguez, to bulk up for an upcoming competition.“I was really hoping you were going to tell me you were natural,” said Mr. Boulet, whose own biceps are big enough to pique curiosity about whether he himself is natty or not.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
