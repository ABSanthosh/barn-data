  "description": "Straw accessories always make a comeback once summer hits — especially when it comes to toting around basket bags for picnics and wearing hats to the beach. And this year, they’ve got the luxury seal of approval — from raffia clutches at Bottega Veneta’s spring/summer 2025 show to straw boater hats at Chanel’s cruise collection, proving that coastal materials are key to nailing the fisherman aesthetic.But straw (and raffia, rattan, and jute) is far more versatile than it gets credit for. We’ve previously made the case for wearing raffia accessories year-round — not just at the beach — by pairing them with everything from cocktail dresses to tried-and-true denim.Now, we’re spotlighting all the ways to work these natural textures into your summer wardrobe — from the office (juxtaposed with tailored pieces) to weddings to actual vacations (styled with breezy linen dresses, cute coordinating sets, and playful bubble hems). Think colorful raffia slides or woven platform sandals that add texture to minimal looks, and statement earrings wrapped in raffia or rattan that channel tropical ease. And don’t overlook straw bucket and cowboy hats made for festival season.Read on for warm-weather outfit inspiration and to shop some of our favorite raffia bags, hats, shoes, and jewelry on the market. DashDividers_1_500x100 Raffia \u0026 Straw Bags We know them, we love them — the woven bags that signal summer’s arrival. While roomy straw totes are the classic beach companion, there are far more wearable (and whimsical) takes on the raffia bag worth trying. Consider a structured shoulder bag, a mini top handle for al fresco dinners, or a crossbody in a boxy or basket shape that works just as well in the city as it does on vacation. Straw Hats Picture yourself on vacation, lounging in a dramatic straw hat that shields your face from the blazing sun. Now imagine wearing it to a music festival, a tennis match, or the park. A wide-brimmed style might feel like a stretch in those settings — but if you’re still into the summer trend, try a straw cowboy hat, a raffia bucket hat, or even a rattan visor for an elevated yet unfussy look. Raffia \u0026 Straw Sandals It’s officially sandal season, and a straw pair is the easiest way to channel your inner White Lotus character. Right now, we’re especially into raffia slides and trending platform sandals that can take you from day to night without missing a step. Classic beige and tan styles are always a solid bet, but this season also brings playful options in saturated hues like butter yellow and turquoise. Straw Jewelry Whether you’re into tightly woven rattan or playful raffia tassels, there’s a place for them in your jewelry collection, too. Statement earrings are our go-to — an easy way to elevate any look with a hint of texture. Try dramatic drop styles for vacations or warm-weather weddings, or opt for chunky woven hoops to wear on repeat all summer long. Like what you see?
