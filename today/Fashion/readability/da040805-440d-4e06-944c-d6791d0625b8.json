The frontman has been announced as the new face of the fashion brand Stone Island, fronting its autumn and winter campaign.He has been a fan of the label for years, even lugging its parkas on tour in the middle of summer. In July 2017, he pleaded to the “cunt” who stole some of the brand’s signature jackets from his hotel room at the Glastonbury festival to hand them back, adding “all will be forgiven”.Other names involved include DJ Peggy Gou – the first woman to be featured in a Stone Island campaign, the actor Russell Tovey and the skateboarder Sage Elsesser.A promotion for Stone Island’s AW 24/25 campaign featuring Liam Gallagher. Photograph: Stone IslandIn his younger years, Gallagher was perhaps best known in the fashion world for crashing the Versace catwalk in 1996. Last year, he teamed up with Adidas to release its LG2 SPZL X trainers, which are white with bottle green stripes.He even set up his own fashion label, Pretty Green, in 2009. The line, which was launched two months before Oasis’s first breakup, included polo shirts, knitwear, coats and shoes.While it launched to large fanfare, with 100,000 fans vying for items on its opening day, crashing its website in the process, the label’s popularity waned. The company fell into administration in 2019 and was bought by JD Sports.Gallagher’s 24-year-old son, Lennon, has also made a foray into fashion, recently starring in a Burberry campaign.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionOther brands have looked to capitalise on the Oasis reunion.
