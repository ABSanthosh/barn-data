I don’t think that anything really has the easy sophistication of a great men’s pea coat jacket. It’s something that you can throw on without thinking in the morning, but it looks amazing with everything. Let’s start by clearing up any confusion about what a pea coat jacket is: simply put, the two defining characteristics of a pea coat are the double-breasted lapel and the fact that it is made of wool. Some people will say that true pea coats are always navy blue (in a nod to their naval heritage), but today’s pea coats come in a wide array of colors. Indeed, designers have been experimenting with men’s pea coats for so long that you can actually find pea coats that are neither double-breasted nor wool. The popularity of these jackets gives us a lot of ground to cover in this roundup of the 6 best pea coats for men. I’m sure you’ll be able to find a version of this menswear classic that you can’t wait to add to your closet somewhere on this list. So, without any further ado, let’s jump right into it. Key Takeaways There were a truly staggering amount of options for me to go through to come up with this list of the 6 best pea coats for men. It seems like every single menswear brand out there has its own version of the pea coat. That makes shopping for one challenging, but I’ve reviewed them all, and I’m hoping that I’ve helped bring a little clarity to the experience for you. Overall, the best pea coat for men is the wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat. It’s a thoroughly modern pea coat in terms of both its material composition and its style. I also love the fact that it comes in so many different shades of black and gray, making it possible to find exactly the color that will complement the rest of your wardrobe. I should also single out the Nautica Men’s Classic Double Breasted Pea coat because it’s such a great example of classic pea coat design. And finally, many readers might be interested in the high-wool percentage of the APTRO Men’s Pea Coat Wool Jacket. In This ArticleOur PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChooseWhy Trust UsFinal VerdictFAQs coofandyofficial / Instagram Best Overall: wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat Why it’s great: I’ve put the wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Pea Coat at the top of this list of the best pea coats for men for a number of different reasons. The biggest reason, though, is the innovative and exciting design that it features, with lots of little details that raise it above the rest of the pack. And, as a result of how it’s cut, the jacket looks modern and sleek while it also has enough down-filling and windbreaking capabilities to keep you warm whatever the weather. Who is this for? I’d recommend this jacket to anyone who’s on the lookout for their next highly dependable and highly fashionable winter jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This jacket definitely isn’t the one for you if you’re looking for a highly traditional pea coat. Fit: Standard | Material: 80% Terylene, 20% Wool | Sizes: XS–3XL | Colors: 12 | Care: Hand Wash Cold Best Budget: COOFANDY Mens Notched Collar Pea coat With Pockets Why it’s great: Next up, we have a pea coat from a great budget brand that regularly shows up on our lists here at FashionBeans. This COOFANDY entry in the ranks of men’s pea coats is made from a blend of polyester and viscose that manages to feel really great despite the synthetic origin of the materials. I’d also highlight the really cool notched collar, which helps the jacket make its own unique statement. Who is this for? The COOFANDY Mens Notched Collar Pea coat With Pockets is a high-quality option that you can pick up from Amazon without any fuss or a huge hit to your budget. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Although the fabric that the coat is made from does feel great, I wouldn’t really begrudge any purists who are looking for a real wool coat overlooking this one. If that’s not really important to you, though, then this is a great option. Fit: Standard | Material: 80% Polyester, 20% Viscose | Sizes: M–2XL | Colors: 10 | Care: Machine Wash Best Luxury: Brooks Brothers Men’s Wool Classic Pea Coat Why it’s great: My pick for the best luxury pea coat goes to one of the classic American brands, Brooks Brothers. Their Men’s Wool Classic Pea coat is a real winner that looks almost exactly like one of the old-school men’s pea coats that you can imagine sailors wearing. Unlike many of the other, less expensive options on this list, the Brooks Brothers Men’s Wool Classic Pea Coat is actually made from 100% wool—which is a huge plus. It almost goes without saying. But it also does explain the hefty price tag. Who is this for? Those who aren’t really happy unless they have the absolute best should really have a think about shelling out for this beautiful jacket. Flaws but not deal-breakers: If you’re on the lookout for a men’s pea coat that will fit you a little tighter, then I wouldn’t really recommend this jacket because it’s a bit oversized. Fit: Oversized | Material: 100% Cotton  | Sizes: S–2XL | Colors: 1 | Care: Dry Clean Only Best on Amazon: Nautica Men’s Classic Double Breasted Pea coat Why it’s great: The Nautica Men’s Classic Double Breasted Pea coat is a functional and aesthetic pea coat that hits all the boxes it needs to hit. The wool blend the coat is made from isn’t overly thick, which helps keep the profile of the jacket in check. In the lighter colors available, the two side pockets break up the solid feel of the jacket and give it some balance. All in all, it’s a well-made and well-designed coat. Who is this for? This jacket occupies something of a middle position between the budget COOFANDY Mens Notched Collar Pea coat With Pockets and the luxury Brooks Brothers Men’s Wool Classic Pea Coat. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I’m not a huge fan of some of the colors that this is available in, but luckily, the classic navy blue option is on point. Fit: Standard | Material: 52% Wool, 40% Polyester, 8% Other Fibers | Sizes: S–6XL | Colors: 6 | Care: Dry Clean Only Best Wool: APTRO Men’s Pea Coat Wool Jacket Why it’s great: The next product we’re covering on our list of the best pea coats for men is a great wool blend number from APTRO. Their Men’s Pea Coat Wool Jacket is made from 80% wool, with just enough polyester to keep the wind out on cold days. The jacket comes in a wide variety of colors that you could actually see yourself wearing: no funky green or red jackets here. Who is this for? If you’re very sensitive to the material quality of the clothes you wear, then this high wool pea coat might be the best option for you. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I really love this jacket, but my only criticism would be about the detachable ribbed collar, which many people who want a traditional-looking pea coat will immediately remove. Fit: Tight | Material: 80% Wool, 20% Polyester | Sizes: XS–2XL | Colors: 9 | Care: Dry Clean Only Best Single Breasted: PASLTER Mens Single Breasted Pea Coat Why it’s great: Here we have the PASLTER Mens Single Breasted Pea Coat. This is a very singular-looking single-breasted pea coat that hangs to the middle of the hip when sized properly. It’s also made from really high-quality cotton, which really adds to the quality feel of the jacket. It’s also something that feels long and substantial, which makes it easy to create really cool looks. Who is this for? This is a great option for someone who’s not really looking for a traditional pea coat but is rather interested in finding a great overcoat. Flaws but not deal-breakers: I do wish that this pea coat jacket had some external pockets to carry those everyday essentials like keys and a phone, but I’m sure you can find some other places to put those. Fit: Standard | Material: 100% Cotton  | Sizes: S–2XL | Colors: 7 | Care: Hand Wash Only latte__lee / Instagram What Makes The Best Pea Coats For Men? Weight The weight of a pea coat, whether you’re looking at a classic navy style or a modern twist, plays a huge role in when and where you can wear it. Traditionally, men’s pea coats tend to be on the heavier side since they’re made from thick wool (or, more often these days, a thick wool blend), which adds to their iconic structure and provides warmth. That heft is part of what makes wearing a pea coat feel so substantial and such a great solution for those who need a warm yet chic winter coat. However, modern versions come in various weights, giving you more options depending on your climate or comfort preference. I’d recommend that you pick a weight that suits when and where you’ll be wearing it. Material Composition Next, you should consider the material you’d most prefer a pea coat to be made from. As we outlined at the start of the article, the traditional men’s pea coat is made from 100% wool, but there are not a ton of modern men’s pea coats that are only made from wool. That’s for a couple of reasons, including the fact that adding some synthetic materials can make pea coats both more windproof and lighter as well. That’s a great combination for a winter coat if you ask me. Exactly how much wool you should look for in a pea coat depends on your personal preference, as well as the weather conditions you see yourself wearing it. Fit \u0026 Rise Lastly, you’ll want to think about how you’d like your new pea coat to fit and where it should hit in terms of length. Some might argue that a pea coat should always land at the mid-thigh for that classic look, but I don’t think that that’s a hard rule. Waist-length pea coats can also be stylish and practical, and these are debatably more popular these days. Your proportions are also an important factor to consider in this context. If you’re looking to create the illusion of height, then a slightly longer coat can help. On the other hand, if you’re tall, then a traditional shorter pea coat can balance out your proportions nicely. Also, consider whether you want a snug or looser fit—both can look sharp depending on your personal style. thenauticalcompany / Instagram How We Chose A new pea coat can represent a significant investment for many people, and with that in mind, I take great care in providing advice that will help FashionBeans readers make the right purchase for them. When it comes to the best pea coats for men, I focused on offering a variety of options instead of listing a bunch of men’s pea coats that all look the same. While I was evaluating different options for this list of the best pea coats for men, I paid special attention to three key factors we prioritize here at FashionBeans: Brand Reputation: Whether the coat comes from a famous brand with decades of history or a newer company, I always ensure that the brand has a strong reputation for producing high-quality, reliable products. Design: As someone passionate about fashion, I have to assess whether a pea coat offers something distinctive in terms of style or detail. If it doesn’t have something that sets it apart, then I’m hesitant to say it’s a must-have. Price: Although some pea coats on this list might lean toward the pricier side, I always ensure that each one offers value that matches its cost. That will help you feel that your investment is worthwhile and avoid any buyer’s regret. Why Trust Us?  The best reason to trust the FashionBeans editors is that we’re a group of men obsessed with style, and when it comes to men’s pea coats—or any area of men’s fashion—it’s safe to say that we know our stuff. We spend our days talking about style, and each of us has a deep knowledge of our own favorite corner of the fashion world. If you still need convincing, then check out some of our other articles, like our guide to black denim jackets, our list of the best waxed jackets, or our rundown of the best trucker jackets. We use a collaborative process to pull together articles like this one, ensuring that we’re making the best use of our collective expertise. Here’s how it works: first, each team member creates a personal shortlist of their favorite products (in this case, pea coats). Then, we all get together to discuss and refine the list, ensuring that it represents a mix of quality, style, and versatility. This process takes time, but we believe that it consistently results in well-rounded lists that we’re proud to stand behind. Final Verdict  At the end of the day, I really love my pick for the overall best pea coat for men, the wantdo Men’s Wool Blend Jacket Stand Collar Windproof Pea Coat. I think that it’s a great choice for anyone who wants a thoroughly modern version of the pea coat that’s form-fitting and incredibly cool. I’ve been wearing mine for the last few weeks, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon. Or, until next summer at least. FAQ There are two factors that make up the difference between pea coats and trench coats: whether or not the coat is double-breasted and how long or short the coat is. Pea coats will generally be double-breasted and reach the lower thigh at their lowest, while trench coats are (usually) single-breasted and are often considerably longer. These are definitely two types of jacket that are close cousins, but there are differences between them. Well, like most questions that go “is/are ______ still cool?” the answer is going to depend on who you ask. If you ask me, pea coats are definitely still cool, and that doesn’t look likely to change at any point in the near future.

Traditionally, men’s pea coats tend to be on the heavier side since they’re made from thick wool (or, more often these days, a thick wool blend), which adds to their iconic structure and provides warmth. That heft is part of what makes wearing a pea coat feel so substantial and such a great solution for those who need a warm yet chic winter coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, modern versions come in various weights, giving you more options depending on your climate or comfort preference. I’d recommend that you pick a weight that suits when and where you’ll be wearing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial Composition\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, you should consider the material you’d most prefer a pea coat to be made from. As we outlined at the start of the article, the traditional men’s pea coat is made from 100% wool, but there are not a ton of modern men’s pea coats that are only made from wool. That’s for a couple of reasons, including the fact that adding some synthetic materials can make pea coats both more windproof and \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-light-jackets-for-men/\"\u003elighter\u003c/a\u003e as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a great combination for \u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-winter-jackets-men/\"\u003ea winter coat\u003c/a\u003e if you ask me. Exactly how much wool you should look for in a pea coat depends on your personal preference, as well as the weather conditions you see yourself wearing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFit \u0026amp; Rise\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, you’ll want to think about how you’d like your new pea coat to fit and where it should hit in terms of length. Some might argue that a pea coat should always land at the mid-thigh for that classic look, but I don’t think that that’s a hard rule. Waist-length pea coats can also be stylish and practical, and these are debatably more popular these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour proportions are also an important factor to consider in this context. If you’re looking to create the illusion of height, then a slightly longer coat can help. On the other hand, if you’re tall, then a traditional shorter pea coat can balance out your proportions nicely. Also, consider whether you want a snug or looser fit—both can look sharp depending on your personal style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_1182991\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1182991\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica.jpg\" alt=\"man in a navy double breasted pea coat by Nautica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1250\" srcset=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica.jpg 1000w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica-150x188.jpg 150w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica-320x400.jpg 320w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica-160x200.jpg 160w, https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/thenauticalcompany_maninanavydoublebreastedpeacoatbyNautica-768x960.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1182991\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CHKbFoglgXC/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003ethenauticalcompany\u003c/a\u003e / Instagram\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"i-choose\"\u003eHow We Chose\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new pea coat can represent a significant investment for many people, and with that in mind, I take great care in providing advice that will help FashionBeans readers make the right purchase for them.
