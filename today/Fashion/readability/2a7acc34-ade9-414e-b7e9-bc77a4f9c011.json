Many styles are available in petite, standard, tall, plus and curvy sizes, making it easy for all of us to enjoy the classic and on-trend styles. But beyond the extensive jean selection, Madewell also has many other denim styles (like vests and jackets) perfect for Canadian tuxedos and accessories (like clogs) to make surprising statements.Madewell Denim Crewneck Vest, $, available at MadewellThe Darted Barrel-Leg JeanMadewell The Darted Barrel-Leg Jean, $, available at MadewellThe Anouk Platform Clog SandalMadewell The Anouk Platform Clog Sandal, $, available at MadewellDenim Relaxed Carpenter OverallsMadewell Denim Relaxed Carpenter Overalls, $, available at MadewellBubble-Sleeve Jean Bomber JacketMadewell Bubble-Sleeve Jean Bomber Jacket, $, available at MadewellMadewell Dresses On SaleWhether you’re looking for a tried-and-true midi dress that can go from the office to the park to dinner, a casual mini dress for weekend jaunts, or bold maxi dresses for spring parties, Madewell’s dress section has it all.
