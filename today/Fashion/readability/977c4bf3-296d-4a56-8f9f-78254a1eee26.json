Everyone knows that you should dress for the job you want — not the job you have. And unless you work from home, you need to get it right. In fact, even if you do work from home, you deserve to don some of the best men’s dress shirts so you can have all of those Zoom calls. Professional attire is a tricky situation, a “necessary evil,” if you will. It’s definitely not the most comfortable, it’s not always the most stylish, and shopping for it is overwhelming with the wide range of brands and formalities. So, you’re finally ready to take your workwear game to the next level. Do you need the top-of-the-line luxury brand? Or do you like the performance look and feel? Whatever your preference is, I’m confident that this list will serve you well in your search for the best men’s dress shirts. Key Takeaways I’ve been in the dress shirt game for a while, from college internships to my first “big boy” job. So, I’ve been aware of the big players and best fabrics for a few years. To find the best dress shirts for men, I used my past experience and compared them with customer reviews and fabric compositions to find the best styles based on comfort, material, and fit. My best overall pick is the Van Heusen Men’s Dress Shirt because of its easy-care fabric, followed by Uniqlo’s Super Non-Iron Slim-Fit Shirt for its budget appeal. In This Article Our PicksBuying ConsiderationsHow We ChoseWhy Trust Us? Final VerdictFAQs charlestyrwhitt / Instagram Best Overall: Van Heusen Men’s Dress Shirt Why it’s great: The Van Heusen Men’s Dress Shirt solves the biggest problem most men have with dress clothes: Wrinkles. Made from “reprocessed” polyester and cotton, this long-sleeve button-up has wrinkle-resistant features and is machine washable, so you can just throw them into the washer and let the fabric technology do the rest. This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. It also comes in plenty of sizes and colors, so you’re sure to find one that works for you. Who is this for? Businessmen who are always on the move and need something that’s convenient to wash, dry, and wear. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The neck and collar may run a bit tight, so consider ordering a cut above your usual size. Material: 65% Reprocessed Polyester, 35% Cotton | Sizes Available: 14″–18.5″ Neck 32″–33″ / 36″–37″ Sleeve | Colors Available: 21 |  Collar: Point | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Regular Best Linen: Luca Faloni Portofino Shirt Why it’s great: If you’re a linen devotee and love spending your days at the beach or on the water after work (must be the life), then Luca Faloni’s White Linen Portofino Shirt is made just for you. It’s one of the best men’s dress shirts you can get. Designed specifically for summer months, the linen fabric ensures that you’ll maintain your temperature, even when wearing this long sleeve under the sun. Who is this for? It’s the best summer attire for men who want to look sharp, even when wearing shorts and sandals. Flaws but not deal-breakers: It’s pretty expensive for a casual dress shirt, and we highly suggest you choose the color white. Material: 100% Linen | Sizes Available: XS–4XL | Colors Available: 26 | Collar: Signature “paramontura” | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Slim or regular Best on Amazon: J.VER Men’s Dress Shirts Why it’s great: When it comes to great Amazon finds, the J.VER Men’s Dress Shirts are right at the top, with almost 20,000 positive ratings. This long-sleeved button-down has stretch fabric (cotton-polyester-spandex blend) that’s soft to the touch while also providing ease of movement. Depending on the color you go with (and there are many), the buttons are nearly invisible as they blend in with the fabric. Its adjustable cuffs also offer a few styling options for when you’re at casual or formal events. Who is this for? This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. It’s a great choice for men who love wearing snappy dress shirts for both formal and casual events but don’t want to worry about wearing out a super expensive shirt. Its stretchy nature provides enough breathability to keep the guys cool all day. Flaws but not deal-breakers: Some colors may run a little see-through, so it’s best to have base layers when wearing them. Material: 62% Cotton, 35% Polyester, 3% Spandex | Sizes Available: S–6XL | Colors Available: 36 | Collar: Spread | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Classic Best Budget: Uniqlo Super Non-Iron Slim-Fit Shirt Why it’s great: The Uniqlo Super Non-Iron Slim-Fit Shirt comes in three glossy shades: Light blue, black, and white. Its front placket and cuffs complement the shape of the collar, which is designed to look great with a tie or on its own. This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. Considering its machine-washable and wrinkle-resistant features, this shirt is a bang for your buck, priced at around just $40. In fact, I actually own a few of these (bought them for a college internship) and can vouch for these — they’re slim, crisp, and washing is fairly simple. Who is this for? Guys who want simple elegance at a reasonable price. It even comes in simple spread collar and button-down alternatives. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The shirt has impeccable quality for its price, but it’s best to avoid a Windsor knot when wearing a tie, as it tends to crease the collar. Material: 100% cotton | Sizes Available: XS–3XL | Colors Available: 3 | Collar: Semi-wide | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Slim Best Luxury: Charles Tyrwhitt Non-Iron Twill Shirt Why it’s great: The Charles Tyrwhitt Non-Iron Twill Shirt is everything a luxury dress shirt should be. Made of 100% soft, pure cotton, it comes in 12 patterns and colors that will turn any regular guy into a boardroom CEO (results not guaranteed). This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. You’ll have a low-lift maintenance experience with its non-iron fabrics, you can just wash, dry, and wear it anytime. This top also comes in classic, slim, and extra slim fits; optimal comfort depending on your preference. Who is this for? This is the best choice for guys who want to invest in top-quality dress shirts. The crisp colors make it the perfect partner for business suits and smart-casual chinos. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The price is over $100, but the soft fabric, along with its breathable build and complimentary brass collar stays, make it worth it. Material: 100% Organic Cotton | Sizes Available: Collar: 14.5–20”, Sleeve: 32–38” | Colors Available: 12 | Collar: Classic | Cuffs: Double button or square French | Fit: Classic, Slim, Extra Slim Best Performance: Mizzen+Main Leeward Dress Shirt Why it’s great: If there’s ever a piece of athletic gear disguised as a button-up, then it’s the Mizzen+Main Leeward Dress Shirt. It’s packed with performance features like a four-way stretch fabric and wrinkle resistance. It’s ridiculously lightweight and has quick-drying properties for those extra sweaty days. This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. It doesn’t compromise on style either, coming in nine core color variations and 15 seasonal shades. It boasts both classic and trim fits, and regular and tall lengths, allowing both slim and beefier dudes to enjoy all this shirt has to offer. Who is this for? This is probably the shirt most men dream of wearing to the office because of its superior comfort. The color variations make it easy to pair with dress pants, jeans, and chinos alike. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This has zero cotton—if you prefer classic non-technical fabrics, then this is not for you at all. Material: 88% Polyester, 12% Spandex | Sizes Available: S–3XL | Colors Available: 23 | Collar: Spread | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Trim, Classic, Regular, Tall Best Silk: Giorgio Armani silk-twill shirt Why it’s great: The Armani Silk Twill Long Sleeve Shirt is a standard silk dress shirt at a designer price point. It’s super straightforward. The materials’ natural luster and breathability shine through this piece. It has thermoregulating properties that help men stay cool, even in warmer parts of the country or seasons. This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. It can easily serve as anyone’s go-to outfit for top and social gatherings. This snazzy button-up comes in three elegant colors of beige, navy, and white. Who is this for? Men who want comfortable everyday wear that looks and feels slightly different from regular 100% cotton. Flaws but not deal-breakers: The shirt may run a little large, so if you’re a bulkier dude, consider ordering a size smaller than usual. Material: 100% Mulberry silk | Sizes Available: 14.5–18.5 | Colors Available: 3 | Collar: Italian | Cuffs: Single | Fit: Slim Best Everyday: Neem London Recycled Italian White Popover Shirt Why it’s great: The Neem London Recycled Italian White Popover Shirt challenges traditional dress shirt designs. Made from 50% recycled cotton and 50% organic cotton, this popover shirt looks great with undone buttons or paired with a blazer. This is one of the best men’s dress shirts. Its modern bent will certainly attract attention, and the soft, breathable fabric feels heavenly to wear throughout long days. The best part about Neem is that men can return worn products and earn credit. The brand will then reuse the old materials to create a new one — talk about taking sustainability to the next level. Who is this for? Environmentally conscious men who love to challenge the norm. Flaws but not deal-breakers: This popover shirt is more for relaxed, casual settings, as wearing it for corporate events without a blazer may be off-putting to your boss. Material: 50% Recycled cotton, GRS-certified organic cotton 50% | Sizes Available: S–XL | Colors Available: 1 | Collar: Spread | Cuffs: Single button | Fit: Relaxed View More on Neem London Buying Considerations For the Best Men’s Dress Shirts Material The material of your dress shirt affects how it feels, how it looks, and how easy it is to maintain. If you have long commutes or are constantly running from meeting to meeting, then consider a performance blend with polyester, as it has inherent anti-odor and wrinkle-resistant properties. But if you’re a guy who likes to go with traditional materials, then 100% cotton or even silk and linen are the best way to go in choosing the best men’s dress shirts, and they look much crisper when ironed. Fit The fit of your shirt is a matter of personal preference and body type. Personally, I love slim-fitting clothes, so I always go with slim dress shirts when available. (In fact, I’d never buy a classic-fit dress shirt.) But, if you prefer a baggier look or are on the heavier side, then opt for big-and-tall styles to make sure that your dress shirt looks appropriate when tucked in. Collar The collar is another important factor when deciding on the best men’s dress shirts. Brands that specialize in dress shirts will usually have several different customization options, so you’ll be able to find exactly what you’re looking for. Another part of this is a tie—if you have to wear one, make sure that the collar will look appropriate with a tie. There’s nothing worse than a great shirt that’s not designed for this looking off-kilter because you have to wear a tie. View More on Aurelien How We Chose As a men’s lifestyle and apparel writer, I interact with plenty of cuts, styles, and brands on a daily basis. Dress shirts are a particular area I’m passionate about because I’ve worn everything from great slim-fit dress shirts to tight, uncomfortable brands, so I know how important it is to find the right one. The resulting eight picks for the best men’s dress shirts were based on these factors: Setting: You have to figure out what your office or work environment is like. Most of the shirts on this list can be worn in just about every corporate setting, which is what I looked for when picking the best men’s dress shirts. They’re also all pretty versatile for those days when you have a dinner date or happy hour after the 9-to-5. Customer Reviews: Before making these recommendations, I verified the quality and fit by going through dozens of customer reviews from past purchasers. Price: This list has shirts ranging from the price of a dinner to a few hundred bucks. Make sure that the shirt you go with fits your budget and the amount of use it’ll get. There’s no sense in buying ultra-premium luxury apparel if you never really have to wear dressier clothes. Why Trust Us?

Final Verdict  The best men’s dress shirts balance price, material quality, and fit. After checking out dozens of brands and styles, my overall top pick is the Van Heusen Men’s Dress Shirt. It sports a traditional look, has performance elements for guys on the move, and comes in plenty of colors, so you’ll always look fresh at the office. It also comes in at a very reasonable price. FAQ They can be. Performance fabrics like polyester and spandex tend to have more stretch and breathability, while cotton is classier, but not as soft and is harder to wash and dry. Good quality dress shirts depend on price and fabric. Just because something’s expensive doesn’t mean it’s nicer than budget picks. Look for shirts that are made in ethical factories and that have positive customer reviews before investing in a certain brand. Expensive dress shirts are worth it if you’re wearing them every day. Guys who go into the office and have to wear a traditional dress shirt will benefit from the superior fit and quality of expensive dress shirts. But if you only occasionally wear a dress shirt, it’s best to go with a budget pick before settling on an investment piece. Joe Niehaus is a freelance writer here at FashionBeans.
