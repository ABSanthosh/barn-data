But – as far as fashion is concerned – it’s nighties that have a starring role.Early in the episode, Stalter wears a short frilled red nightie, with her dog in a matching design. Later, she wears a white frilled floor-length design, and it’s clear the item is something of a signature. If it’s a cute quirk for a character, it’s also in line with wider trends.Pyjamas have come out of the bedroom and into daywear over the last decade. Nighties might be in line to perform the same trick. The actor Daisy Edgar-Jones and model Kaia Gerber have worn nightdresses in daylight, with Gerber collaborating with the California-inspired brand Dôen last year to create her own. Sabrina Carpenter is known for her babydoll nighties, while Addison Rae wore a nightie-like dress for her performance at Coachella.Sabrina Carpenter – and dancers – on her appropriately-named Short n’ Sweet tour last year. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for AEGMost people will still associate pyjamas and nighties with bed – a private space which has, until recently, been free from fashion trends. A survey by YouGov in 2022 found that most people in the UK slept in pyjamas (47%) while 20% slept in their underwear and 20% slept naked.Post-pandemic, clothing worn at home is much more on the radar of fashion. Like Parker Posey’s in The White Lotus, Stalter’s nightie is likely to prompt others to think about switching from pyjamas when turning out the light.The design, which costs £130, is made by a British nightie brand If Only If. Its owner, Emily Campbell – who also provided the fabric for the dog’s nightie – says the popularity is already increasing. “Our annual growth is between 80% and 90% and this year is looking to be more,” she says. She anticipates that Too Much will increase the demand, although she won’t alter her small-batch production model. “They will sell out,” she says. “I’m fine with that. I’m never going to over-produce and have a load of nightgowns left over.”Chelsea Swain, Leslie Hayman, Kirsten Dunst and AJ Cook as four of the five Lisbon sisters in The Virgin Suicides (1999). Photograph: American Zoetrope/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockThe high street is also seeing more interest in the nightie. John Lewis reports searches for “nightdress” increased by 21% from 2024 to 2025, with sales up 14%. Cotton designs – such as a £34 white seersucker nightie – are particularly popular this summer.The heatwave might well be a factor for a rise in popularity – cotton nighties are a cool option. If Only If was founded by Campbell’s mother, Issy Falkner, who was going through menopause at the time. “I think that definitely had a bearing on her wanting to wear natural materials,” says Campbell. The brand’s cotton is organic, and “just the most beautiful thing to sleep in”.If Too Much is the latest example of the nightie on screen, other notable moments include Sofia Coppola’s first film, The Virgin Suicides, and Grace Kelly’s nightwear in Rear Window. These moments are documented on the Instagram account Nightgowns in Cinema. “Nightgowns have charm and grace,” the account’s founder says. “They make you feel like an old Hollywood star about to dramatically crash into silky bedsheets and cry, [or] like a 2000s teen girl about to call her best friend from a spiral-cord phone.”Addison Rae performs at Coachella. Photograph: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for CoachellaIn recent years, pyjamas have dominated romcom screen time – as worn by Bridget Jones in the original 2001 film – and they remain a popular bedtime choice.Another trend at John Lewis is mix-and-match designs – with sales up 55%. Marks \u0026 Spencer, meanwhile, reports that pyjamas with shorts are popular, with sales up 20% this year.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionNaomi Pike, a commissioning editor at Elle UK, has about 20 pairs of pyjamas. “It helps how I sleep,” she says, “if I have clean pyjamas that fit well, feel good.” She buys two or three sizes up for extra comfort. Meanwhile, the Nightgowns in Cinema founder – despite their love of the nightie – wears an oversized T-shirt and shorts to bed. “[Nighties] make me feel trapped,” they say.“We admire them, but when it’s time for real rest, we always reach for the comfiest and safest option.”Of course, an alternative is nighties making the move from bed to daywear. “It feels like it will be this summer’s story,” says Pike. “They feel quite gentle … we all need a bit more gentleness.”If, up till now, sightings of the nightie trend has been limited to thin celebrities, Stalter will open the trend up. “It can bring liberation to people who aren’t used to seeing their figure on the screen so much,” says Pike. “I think it could encourage [people to] think ‘Oh, I’m a curvier figure and I can still wear this trend, and I will wear this trend, and this is how I can wear it.’”",
