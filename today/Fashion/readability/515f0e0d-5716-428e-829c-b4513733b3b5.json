  "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style snapshots. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. After several seasons of digital-only or hybrid-presentation models due to the pandemic, New York Fashion Week has officially returned back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. From Sept. 6-10, Fashion Week brought together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the spring/summer 2025 season. They stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts (especially coming off the US Open), texture play, co-ord sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites, when necessary given the humidity in New York, were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS senior content director Jessica Andrews, PS associate director of Shopping Sarah Wasilak, and PS assistant editor of Shopping Kyley Warren attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.
