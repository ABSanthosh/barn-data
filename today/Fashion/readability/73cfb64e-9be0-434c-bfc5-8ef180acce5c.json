Her fifth solo album, “Joy’All,” was released in 2023. She lives in Los Angeles. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Rock the CasbahI’m always on the road, so if it’s February and I see something that suits a friend or family member, I’ll grab it and then squirrel it away until the holidays. You know it’s a good gift when you covet it yourself.I was just in Tangier on vacation after the Postal Service tour, and I did a lot of shopping in the casbah for holiday gifts. I’m a big fan of fake designer goods. You walk through these winding streets and there’s just like, hundreds of fake Goyard and Chanel bags, so I stocked up. Back in the States, in Atlanta, there’s a swap meet called Metro Mart where I love to get fake designer socks for my friends as their stocking stuffers.Spending so much money on something that’s real, that’s just not my style. My philosophy in life is “One up from the cheapest.” If I’m going to make a big purchase, first of all, it’s not going to be for me, and it’s not going to be an expensive designer bag. There’s something very punk rock about the fake stuff.Pet SoundsMy dog was actually a gift from my friend, [the rapper] Serengeti. It was 2020, I had been solo quarantining in Nashville and I was in a pretty weird state, like everyone. He was like, “Hey, do you want a dog? I can bring you a cockapoo.\" And I said, “Gimme 48 hours.” So, yeah — Bobby Rhubarb, the love of my life, was a gift from a friend. That’s changed my entire life and lifestyle.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
