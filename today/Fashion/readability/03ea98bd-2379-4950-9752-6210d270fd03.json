Nearby was Arthur Kulik, known as Jimmy Gambles, who is Mr. Forgeard’s right-hand man and his closest adviser in the game.“I don’t know about the other teams, but this is very serious to me,” Mr. Forgeard said. “I want to repeat. I’m trying to win.”That was the scene at the second annual PrizePicks World Championships, an event billed as the “ultimate fantasy competition” in which celebrity-led teams go head-to-head in a daylong contest of daily fantasy football skill.ImageKyle Forgeard of the Nelk Boys won last year’s event and was hoping to repeat.
