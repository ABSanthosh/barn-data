It turns out there is a lot of gray area in shades of beige.Sydney Gifford, left, and Alyssa Sheil, two influencers whose similar aesthetics are at the heart of a lawsuit before a federal court.Credit...Yasmin Yassin for The New York Times, Christopher Lee for The New York TimesPublished Dec. 5, 2024Updated Dec. 7, 2024The oversize beige cable-knit sweater.

So did the woman posed in front of the nondescript white wall.Days earlier, Ms. Gifford, a 24-year-old lifestyle influencer, had shared a photo with her thousands of followers that was virtually identical. The woman in this new photo was a fellow influencer, Alyssa Sheil, with whom she had gone shopping and done a photo shoot months earlier.At the time, she thought their interactions had been merely awkward. But as she scrolled through Ms. Sheil’s photos on Instagram for the first time in nearly a year, she said, Ms. Gifford suspected those meetings had been some kind of aesthetic espionage.Ms. Gifford claims that Ms. Sheil, 21, not only started to mimic her online persona but also appropriated her entire look. And now she is suing.Ms. Gifford had copyrighted several of her social media posts in January, after noticing the similarity between Ms. Sheil’s posts and her own. Several photos were submitted as evidence in the lawsuit Ms. Gifford filed this year in a federal court in Texas accusing Ms. Sheil of copyright infringement. But in the carefully curated world of social media, Ms. Gifford has leveled a perhaps more severe charge against her: stealing her vibe.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
