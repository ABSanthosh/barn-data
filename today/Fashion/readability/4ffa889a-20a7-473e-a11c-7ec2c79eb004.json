  "description": "When it comes to fashion, whether you're minimalist, maximalist, or something entirely in between, there's one staple item you need in your wardrobe: a leather jacket. It's truly the Swiss army knife of clothing. There are plenty of different styles to choose from, including oversize, cropped, and motorcycle - just to name a few. You can dress it up or down, and whether you're wearing it for a date or throwing it on for a quick grocery store run, there's nothing like a well-worn leather jacket that is perfectly you. However, finding a high-quality leather jacket at a price that won't break the bank is no easy feat. Luckily, we think we found a brand that checks all of our boxes and has something for everyone, no matter what style you're seeking. Allow us to introduce you to Quince. Quince is all about offering high-quality items made with premium materials at an affordable price. How do they do it? The direct-to-consumer brand uses a factory-direct model and keeps costs low by cutting out the supply-chain middlemen. They make home and travel products, but right now, our editors couldn't be more obsessed with their leather jackets. Ahead, three editors put three different styles of Quince's 100-percent leather jackets to the test. You can check us out modeling different options, read about how they worked for us, and then use our tips to help you make your own purchase - we promise you won't regret it. Keep scrolling to read our honest thoughts.",
