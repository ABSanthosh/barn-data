Give a piece of your heart with one (or two or three) of these heart-shaped jewelry styles. DashDividers_1_500x100 Heart-Shaped Necklaces When we think of Valentine’s Day jewelry, heart necklaces come to mind first, so we’ve included several dainty and chunky heart pendants and lockets, as well as out-of-the-box chains. Depending on your budget, pick from cubic zirconia crystals or genuine diamonds and mother-of-pearl designs. DashDividers_1_500x100 Heart-Shaped Rings Whether you’re looking for everyday signets, stacking bands, or intricate engagement-like styles, there are many heart-shaped rings to pick from that would make a great Valentine’s Day gift for a loved one or for yourself. DashDividers_1_500x100 Heart-Shaped Earrings Go bold with a drop heart earring, or keep it simple with a sleek stud or huggie. Puffy earrings don’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, so don’t be afraid of the statement designs. The bow trend also persists, so don’t skip the absolutely adorable bow-heart styles below.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Heart-Shaped Bracelets Give your giftee a piece of your heart with a charm bracelet that has your birthstone or name inscribed on it — or any of the other heart-adorned bracelets (including a literal heart-shaped bangle) as a token of your love.
