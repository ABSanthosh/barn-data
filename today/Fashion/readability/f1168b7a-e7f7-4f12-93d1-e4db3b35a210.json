Any products or services put forward appear in no particular order. if you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation. Few others so fittingly embody the saying “can’t live with them, can’t live without them” as a sister does. You know each other like the back of your hand, but finding good Christmas gifts for sisters (that she’ll love) is no small feat. Neither is shopping for your girlfriend for that matter, but don’t worry we have a list for that too.  When you do find that perfect Christmas gift for your sister, however, you’ll instantly become the brother of the year, gain clout for the next family get together, and finally solve the decades-long debate of who’s the better sibling (hint: it’s definitely you). It’s a win-win for everyone involved. We’ve scoured the web for the best Christmas gifts for sisters and/or sister-in-laws that are sure to please even the pickiest recipient. Read ahead to see our product picks for all price points. 1. Velvet Jewelry Travel Organizer If your sis has been bitten by the travel bug, she’s probably well aware of the nightmare that is a tangled mess of necklaces in her suitcase. This organizer has plenty of compartments and slots that will make storing her bling a breeze. It’s also the ideal way for her to transport the slew of necklaces and bracelets she’ll no doubt receive this Christmas. 2. Phone Case Constantly seeing your sister with an ever-busted phone or tired of listening to the long stories that accompany them? This phone case is created to fit into any person’s style and comes in every color under the sun for even the pickiest sister (options for iPhone 7 up and some android versions).  3. Phone Cardholder If your family has ever had a laugh over how often your sister tends to lose things, this item will be a revelation for her. Nudient has a magnetic cardholder (perfect pairing with one of their phone cases). A convenient phone case and wallet all rolled into one innovative package. Crafted from durable pebbled leather, it’s stylish enough to wear, she won’t miss her purse and it certainly beats having to track down a missing phone. 4. Toiletry Bag Any woman always seems to have a lot of loose things rolling around their purse, car, or house. If there’s an empty place to put something, it will be filled with junk (or treasures to her) soon. Help send a small nudge to organization heaven with a small catch-all bag, the perfect Christmas gift for a sister who loves to stay organized or for those other sisters who need to at least ‘appear put together.’ 5. Make Your Own Chocolate Truffles Kit What they say is true – ladies love their chocolate (which, for the record, who doesn’t?) and this kit will make it a breeze for her to whip up her own confections. This set includes all the goods, from organic cocoa powder to peppermint extract, which is essentially Christmas in a bottle. If you’re lucky, she may even share, what other Christmas gifts for sisters could you want? 6. Compact Luggage  Watching your sister come home for the holidays with some beat-up backpack and a glorified garbage bag isn’t fun for anyone to claim at the airport. Miss the next holiday embarrassment and grab a quality piece of luggage perfect for trips home and weekend getaways. 7. Cozy Scarf  Nothing more comforting than a big scarf – nothing else to say, a true no-brainer it will always be one of the nice Christmas gifts for sisters, even for the difficult one. 8. Leather Gloves Ubiquitous between men and women, leather gloves are a nice accessory in the colder months or simply a nice way to elevate an evening outfit (plus it’s hard to buy the wrong size), win-win.  9. Ultrasonic Diffuser + Essential Oils In a world where wellness is king, it’s hard to go wrong with an oil diffuser. Give her the gift of relaxation after a hectic holiday season with one of the best gifts for your sister this Christmas, all wrapped up in a sleek Scandinavian-style package. This nifty version features several ambient light modes and combinations, and even includes 10 essential oils for her convenience. 10. Drybar Hair Styler If you’re not well-versed in the world of hairstyling gadgets, allow us to explain this pick. Drybar is essentially the Rolls Royce of the hair world; a splurge, but a worthy one. This styling brush will instantly win you the award for the best Christmas gifts for sisters this year and will earn your sister’s respect once and for all.  11. Nike Sneakers You’re not the only one who appreciates a great pair of new sneakers to add to your collection. This pair from Nike is sure to put some pep in her step with their modern look and pink color that’s still on-trend. This is the perfect way to ensure that she sees through on her New Year’s resolution to get fit. 12. True Crime \u0026 Chill Candle There’s nothing like a cozy night, curled up with a glass of wine while horrific scenes of gore and brutal violence flash across the TV. If your sister has fallen into the hole of true crime documentary obsession, then she’s sure to get a kick out of this rather macabre candle. 13. Hand-Blown Stemware If you’re shopping for Christmas gifts for your sister-in-law, a fine set of glassware is a foolproof option – it’s universally pleasing and you can never really have too many wine glasses. This stemware set is available in many stylish hues and was handblown in Poland, a fun fact you can drop to ensure you seem every bit the master curator of finery. 14. La Vie Est Belle People-Pleasing Perfume Finding a great fragrance is a process of trial and error. But perhaps you can take the guesswork out of finding the perfect fragrance with the classic La Vie Est Belle. This perfume is highly rated across the board with an agreeable mix of black currant, tonka bean, and vanilla. 15. Non-Alcoholic Rosé While boozing it up is basically a requirement of the holiday season, not everyone is down for the drunken texts and head-splitting hangovers that often follow. One of the best Christmas gifts for sisters who might be taking it easy on the bubbly is a bottle of alcohol-free rosé. This refreshing compromise allows her to take part in the festivities and avoid the side effects that come with them. 16. K-Beauty Skincare Set For the past few years, Korean skincare has taken the beauty industry by storm with its many steps and some odd ingredients such as snail mucin (hey – if it works, it works). Save her the trouble of creating a complicated regimen with this convenient set of K-Beauty essentials. 17. Throw Blanket Yet another homeware you can never have too many of is throw blankets, making this one of the perfect Christmas gifts for sisters or sister-in-laws who seem to have everything. They’ll look great on her couch and are perfect for cuddling up with while catching up on those murder docs we mentioned earlier. 18. Coffee Table Book All siblings give each other a hard time here and there, but doling out the best gifts for your sister this Christmas shows your respect for her is always a win. This coffee table book is filled with badass entrepreneurs, artists, and designers that are sure to inspire. 19. Wine Soaps It’s safe to say that no one besides your 80-year-old grandmother is into receiving powdery old soap sets that will likely collect dust under the sink for eons. So why not spring for a set that smells good enough to eat (er, drink)? These vegan soaps are infused with wine and are perfect for the gal who likes bubbles of all kinds. 20. Espresso Machine Her days of having to spend an arm and a leg for her daily mocha soy latte with light foam at Starbucks are over. This espresso machine makes brewing up the perfect cup of joe a breeze. The best part? It won’t break your bank too severely either, coming in at just under $100. Giving Christmas gifts for sisters that save her and you money? Score. 21. Personalized Family Recipe Board You may need to rope mom in for one of these next Christmas gifts for sisters, but the effort will be well worth it. These wooden boards are made by scanning your recipe card and etching them into wood, preserving the handwriting, and making for a brag-worthy addition at your family’s next dinner party. You’ve got to love technology. 22. Zodiac Necklace Whether your sister believes in astrology or has a more down-to-Earth view on things, a simple piece of gold jewelry is always going to be a winner. Just make sure you do a bit of research to avoid choosing the wrong sign. 23. Copic Markers Any artist will tell you that Copic Markers are the be-all and end-all in terms of quality. These markers are about as pricey as markers can get, but are known to be well worth the splurge. If she is an artist or just very anal about her note-taking game, this is one of the Christmas gifts for Sisters, clearly a no-brainer. 24. Smart Mug A mug is far from the most original Christmas gifts for sisters that you can choose, but we’re sure she’s never seen one quite like this. Meet the Ember Smart Mug. This app-controlled mug (words we never thought we’d be saying) will keep her coffee at the perfect temp for up to 90 minutes. 25. UGG Slippers It seems that everyone and their mother has decided to cop UGG’s latest take on a house slipper, and we can’t say we blame them. A stylish upgrade over for the classic home-slipper Christmas gift, this could be one of the safest gift ideas for your sister. Hopefully, you know her size and favorite color.  26. Chanel Lipstick While you may not be the leading expert on cosmetics, it’s safe to say you’ve heard of Chanel. While their famously pricey handbags may be a bit out of your budget, one of their swanky makeup products will do the trick nicely. 27. Sample Coffee Box When it comes to hot morning drink preference, you’re either in the tea camp or the coffee one. If your sister finds herself in the latter (and happens to love variety), then you can’t beat this fun coffee sample box.  28. Monogram Necklace For the sartorially savvy, these monogram necklaces have been a hot item for some time now. Really anything personalized is the winner of many Christmas gifts for sisters, even if it’s as small as a monogram. For extra points, you could even deliver it in the travel jewelry case from earlier in the list. 29. Hunter Chelsea Boots We all know Hunter for their iconic tall boot style, but the classic British brand has been branching out lately in terms of modernizing their line of Wellies. Their take on the Chelsea boot provides a suitable update on the gardener and festival-goer favorite. (Don’t be afraid to pick yourself up a new pair while you’re at it either.) 30. At-Home Facial Steamer A holiday season full of stress, dry windchill, and drunken evenings can be hellacious on the skin. This facial steamer is one of those no-brainer Christmas gifts for sisters and is basically a portable spa treatment without the exorbitant price tag– all she’ll need is water. 31. Silk Pillow Case The Slip Silk Pillowcase has been making its way on to Christmas wish lists for some time now, and for good reason. Silk is leagues ahead of traditional cotton pillowcases for its wrinkle-prevention and haircare benefits that are far more simple to attain than a cabinet full of dubious creams are. 32. Desktop Mini Fridge Whether she uses it for convenient drinks and snacks or skincare (may sound odd, but it’s a thing), this pint-sized fridge is sure to make her life a bit easier the next time she’s craving a quick sip or touch-up. 33. Himalayan Salt Tequila Glasses You heard it right – these shot glasses are hand-carved from Himalayan pink salt, taking one extra step out of the tequila slammer. Since the salt is naturally antibacterial, these are fit to be reused for countless fiestas in the near future. We’ll drink to that. 34. VIPERTEK Flashlight and Taser We’re all protective of our siblings and there’s nothing like the comfort of knowing that they’re safe. You can have the peace of mind that if anyone tries any funny business, she can make them wish they’d never crossed paths with her, and she’s sure to be appreciative of the gesture. 35. 3D Pen Whether your sister is a young creative or a designer looking to bring her artistic visions to life, this will be one of the outstanding Christmas gifts for sisters under the tree. This pen makes it easier than ever to get into the 3D printing craze (and without the price of the usual rigs). The pen includes three filament colors to get started – art skills not included. 36. Portable Charger We all know the pain of leaving the house for the day, only to see that your phone is at a 5% charge. A slim portable charger like this one can be a lifesaver in such situations, making one of those simple and easy Christmas gifts for sisters that she can actually use.  37. Cheese Tasting Box This tasting box has us ‘cheesing’ from ear to ear, and this one from Jasper Hill Farm is bound to be one the envied Christmas gifts for sisters under the tree. The cheese is made in Greensboro, Vermont, where—get this—there’s a 22,000-square-foot, seven-vaulted cellar for aging cheddars and blues, can’t beat a cool story to brag about when she opens it.  38. Kate Spade Umbrella You can add umbrellas to the list of phone chargers, TV remotes, and other things that always inexplicably go missing. The best Christmas gifts for sisters are the ones she’ll actually use, and this stylish umbrella from fashion icon Kate Spade is unlikely to ever leave her sight. 39. Audible Subscription Growing a library of physical books is always satisfying, but those hardback copies can really hurt the wallet after a while. The solution? Switch her over to audiobooks. They can be listened to during her work commute, at the gym, and she’ll never have to worry about creased pages or a bent cover ever again. 40. Acacia Wood Cheese Board If it’s difficult to find Christmas gifts for sisters, we present something she’s sure to love (you can’t go wrong with food). This cheese board has all the works: a nice acacia wood board, cheese knives, and ceramic bowls that slot into place. Cheese boards also make ideal Christmas gift ideas for your sister-in-law that you may not know too well. 41. 100 Wines Scratch-Off Bucket List Any excuse to chug through 100 bottles of wine is likely to be a welcome present for any wine connoisseur. If you’re looking for stocking stuffer Christmas gifts for sisters or just something a bit more budget-friendly, this scratch-off poster is the prime choice. 42. SodaStream Sparkling Water Maker Although controversial for its acquired taste, sparkling water is officially the newer, cooler, healthier alternative to soda. Instead of having to drop in for a new case of Perrier every week, the SodaStream makes it simple to brew up sparkling water of many different flavors. One of the Chirstmas gifts for sisters that keeps on giving.  43. Truff Hot Sauce Variety Pack If you’re a fan of the spice, you’ve likely already heard of these bougie hot sauces. Help your sis make her chicken, burgers, and other eats a bit more luxurious with these hot sauces, infused with black truffle, white truffle, and one even spicier variety. 44. Sunset Lamp Projector If your TikTok-obsessed little sister hasn’t grabbed one already, then you know what to do next. With this sunset lamp projector, every hour is golden hour and her selfie game will be forever changed. 45. Personal Fireplace If the real deal isn’t an option, this personal fireplace is the natural solution for creating a warm ambiance during the chilly winter months. It’s also perfect for whipping up a batch of s’mores in a pinch. 46. Map of Paris An essential for any Francophile, if your sister can’t quite cut a trip to Paris at the moment, pick up this vintage-inspired map print and pop it into a frame for a piece of wall art she can live vicariously through (at least for the time being). 47. Bow Earrings Rather than jumping headfirst into Christmas gifts for sisters (the kind that can really only be used a few days out of the year), these earrings offer the ideal amount of festivity. The price is also ideal if you’re giving your sister presents in her stocking. 48. Fitbit Luxe If there’s ever a time to receive fitness essentials, it’s right after a season of rich food, lazing by the fireplace, and drinking one too many glasses of eggnog. This version of the beloved Fitbit is sleek, stylish, and has a built-in sleep tracker for ensuring she catches up on her Z’s. 49. 3-in-1 Charging Station In a world where everything is at the touch of a button, you’d think a convenient all-in-one charger like this would have come around sooner, but we digress. This charging station will keep her iPhone, Apple Watch, Airpods, and even her Apple Pencil fully charged right by her bedside. 50. Indoor Bonsai Tree Since we were all corralled indoors many moons ago, indoor plants have become even more of a popular method of décor. This bonsai tree will thrive indoors and make for a fine addition to her plant shelf. Just make sure to remind her to keep it inside. 51. Sheet Mask Subscription Visiting your local cosmetics store can be overwhelming, especially when you discover the sheer volume of sheet masks available. But this face mask subscription box will take the guesswork out of picking, making things easier for you and her by delivering a set each month. Also, if you haven’t yet, you may want to consider picking one up for yourself. 52. Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker This is definitely one of those Christmas gifts for sisters that she’d never think to buy herself, but won’t be able to live without it once she has it. A necessity for on-the-go use on a summer holiday. 53. At Home Murder Mystery Night This may be one of the more Halloween-themed ‘Christmas gifts for sisters, but we did include a murder mystery candle on this list. For the lover of board games and Clue-style murder mystery, this game will make for an entertaining vintage-themed night in. If you’re looking for Christmas gifts for sister-in-law, this is a fun way to tie the whole family in. 54. Agate Coasters Agate and geode motifs have been a staple of Millennial décor for the past few years and we still can’t deny the way they class up a space. Grab these for the décor-obsessed sister if she hasn’t already. 55. LED Skin Therapy Mask This seemingly Hannibal Lecter-inspired mask may look like something out of a nightmare, but the technology of these masks has been proven to heal wounds and reduce inflammation, even being used by US Navy SEALs in the past. 56. Puffer Tote  This is a fun one, the perfect Christmas gifts for sisters that are looking for something a little different. We all know that puffer anything is all the rage – so why not make it into a bag that can carry everything under the sun she could possibly have? Plus with a small phone pouch on the outside, there is no way she already has one just like it.  57. LED Herb Garden If your sister is constantly buying plants but struggles to keep them alive for more than a month, try something that’s guaranteed to make her feel like she’s got two green thumbs. This one does all the work for you, right in the kitchen. This compact smart garden combines technologies that provide automated light, irrigation, and nutrients to your plants—even in rooms without daylight. 58. Tea Sample Box  Let your sister have a taste of the sophisticated lifestyle with a variety of dissolvable shaped tea drops. No need to go out and buy expensive kits with diffusers, teabags…forget it all. Pair one of these Christmas gifts for sisters with a fun mug for a well-rounded, best-brother-of-the-year gift.  59. Fun Retro Mug  Notice what we did here? Never a bad choice to add to someone’s collection, this mug is fun, wallet-friendly and even tells you what to do, enjoy!  60. Notebook  Everyone needs something to write in, simple notes or scrawling stories, it’s hard to not have a use for a notebook. With fun details, it’s an easy gift to love.  61. Noise Cancelling Wireless Earphones  Give your sister a break from all the family chatter with the gift of noise-canceling kindness (in headphones form), fun, amazing quality and a few different color options, it can’t be beat (get it?) 62. Cold Brew Coffee Maker Nothing like the holiday season to start new habits, help her save on those expensive boutique coffees and make some yum cold brew right in the kitchen, your sister’s wallet will be screaming a thank you. Wrapping Up (The Gifts) Finding Christmas gifts for sisters and sisters-in-law (and family members in general) may seem impossible, but we hope this list provides you with some go-to options sisters of any kind will love. If you haven’t found what you’re looking for maybe look for something funny or if in a bind look for some great last-minut gifts that could help.
