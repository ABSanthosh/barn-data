  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Marisa Petrarca I've never had the pleasure of living somewhere warm, so I've subsequently mastered the art of staying cozy. My go-to for braving Midwest winters is the Aritzia Super Puff, which I almost always pair with my Bombas wool calf socks, and trusty Timberland boots. While I previously thought I had the whole equation figured out, I recently got wind of a genius innovation I wish I had known about sooner: fleece-lined leggings. Intrigued, I did some research and scooped up the bestselling Baleaf Women's Fleece Lined Leggings ($29, originally $38) to test their effectiveness against the brutal Minnesota cold. Turns out, they're exactly what I needed to transform my winter wardrobe, and they're currently discounted. Ahead, I break down everything you need to know about these fleece-lined leggings from Amazon. What I Love About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings What I love about these fleece-lined leggings is that they're much warmer than my usual go-tos from Old Navy or Lululemon, yet they're equally stretchy and soft. The fleece interior doesn't make me sweat when I wear them inside (and I run warm!), but keeps my legs shielded from the piercing cold when the temperature is only in the teens. Given the fact that these leggings are fleece-lined, I don't think I'll be reaching for these for indoor workouts. However, I can confirm their thick fabric has you covered during exercises like squats, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through at the gym. And even with their added layer, they're plenty flexible for easy movement, with what I'd describe as medium compression. What's even more remarkable is their sleek design. Despite the addition of the soft fleece interior layer, they look just like \"normal\" leggings. Plus, they have two deep pockets, one on each side, that are large enough to fit my iPhone 14 Pro. There's also a zippered pocket on the back waistband for a key, license, or credit card. What's Worth Noting About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings My sole grievance with the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings is the slight roominess in the groin area. Although this hasn't kept me from wearing them, I'd prefer a more snug fit in this area to prevent any sagging and make them look a bit more flattering. It's worth noting that I'm not alone in this observation; several other customers have also pointed out this detail in their reviews. Another caveat to consider before you buy them is that not everyone thinks they're well-suited for the cold. While they work for me and are certainly a much warmer option than the rest of my leggings, one person, who rated them three stars, left the following review: \"Ordered these for an upcoming trip to Iceland, they are super comfy \u0026 fit well however they are not that warm. Wore them today in 30-degree weather \u0026 I was still cold.\" You might have to test them yourself to determine if they'll be warm enough for you. Who Are the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings Best For? The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings are best for people who love wearing leggings year-round, but are in need of a more heavy-duty pair for when temperatures plummet. They're cozy, yet sleek, proving you don't have to compromise on style for warmth. Not to mention, they prioritize practicality with two types of pockets to store all your small, on-person essentials. Where Are the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings Available? The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings are available via Amazon or direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, baleaf.com. Additional Details About the Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings The Baleaf Fleece-Lined Leggings come in sizes X-Small to 3X-Large. They come in several colors to suit every style. They're made of 87 percent polyester and 13 percent spandex. They come in a petite version and a classic version.
