  "description": "With April showers approaching, it’s time for the return of the trench coat, the quintessential spring must-have. Not too heavy, not too light (dare we say, just right?), and typically made from water-repellant and wind-resistant fabrics, trenches are the outerwear of choice for transitional weather. While knee- and calf-length jackets are always a wise wardrobe investment, this season, a new crop of, well, cropped styles are trending.  Rather than a traditional, longline trench coat, cropped styles are a bit boxier and often more casual, offering a modern twist on a classic staple. From chic khaki and green options to unique silhouettes and fabrics, like cape jackets and denim iterations, there are plenty of styles to peruse.Read on to pluck out a sporty design for long walks, a lady-like style for work and al fresco dinners, or a versatile jacket that can do it all.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
