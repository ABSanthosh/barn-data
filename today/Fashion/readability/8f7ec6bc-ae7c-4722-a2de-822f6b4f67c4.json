Or is this a hoax?Melania Knauss at her wedding to Donald Trump in Palm Beach in January 2005.Credit...Jeffrey Langlois/Palm Beach Daily News, via ShutterstockVanessa FriedmanVanessa Friedman has covered political image-making and its influences since Bush v. Gore, including Volodymyr Zelensky and his olive green T-shirt and the appearance (and reappearance) of the white pantsuit.March 26, 2025, 10:03 a.m. ETIs it or isn’t it?On Tuesday, a listing surfaced on eBay purportedly offering Melania Trump’s wedding dress for sale. You know, the one designed by John Galliano for Dior couture, reportedly costing more than $100,000, worn by the first lady at her Mar-a-Lago wedding to Donald J. Trump and featured on her only Vogue cover, in February 2005.The dress, priced at $45,000 by a woman who identifies herself as Svjabc1 and is in Massapequa, N.Y., is described as being “made of duchesse satin” with “a figure-hugging silhouette, a 90-meter voluminous skirt and embroidered with 1,500 Swarovski diamonds.” According to the listing, the seller bought the dress from Mrs. Trump for her own wedding in 2010 for $70,000. It does not come with any proof of authenticity, other than 21 photos highlighting its billowing train and diamanté embroidery, which are juxtaposed against the famous Vogue cover, presumably to show the similarity.The magazine story, which described the soon-to-be Mrs. Trump’s search for her gown during the couture shows, also contained many details about the dress that made news at the time and have resurfaced with the sale, including the fact that it weighed 60 pounds and took 550 hours to complete.Almost immediately the news was embraced by numerous outlets, proclaiming, “You Can Buy Melania Trump’s Wedding Dress” (The Spectator) and “How Much Would You Pay for Melania Trump’s Wedding Dress?” (The Cut). As of Wednesday morning, the listing was being “watched” by 224 people.ImageThe eBay listing of the wedding dress put up for auction.Credit...eBayLeaving aside the fact that the seller acknowledges on the listing that she made “a few changes” to the gown — more satin, more embroidery and straps — which means it no longer looks identical to Mrs. Trump’s gown, there’s another problem. The designer Hervé Pierre, Mrs. Trump’s longtime stylist (he made her inauguration gowns in 2017 and 2025), said of her wedding dress, “I stored the gown myself in Palm Beach.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
