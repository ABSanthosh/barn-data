We have now moved back home to be closer to family. We chose a small city that’s near several relatives. My partner has found work, but there are fewer options here for me. I have an exciting prospect in a larger city that’s two and a half hours away. There is an expectation that I will go into the office once a week. My brother, his wife and their two young children live there. They have a large house. A while ago, we talked about my staying with them once a month if I got the job. They were enthusiastic about it, and I was excited to spend time with them. More recently, though, they said they don’t want me or anyone else as a regular houseguest. I don’t think anything has changed in our relationship. I feel hurt and rejected. What should I do?SISTERWhen we really want something — like a job or a place to stay — it can be easy to lose perspective. But just because you need a bed does not oblige your brother and sister-in-law to put you up once a month. (It also raises the question of where you plan to stay during the other three weekly visits each month.)I understand your disappointment, which is probably heightened here by your brother and sister-in-law’s change of heart. But they were entitled to think it over and discuss your request privately. Raising two young children and running a house — along with working at their jobs — sounds like a full plate to me. Adding a regular houseguest to their responsibilities may be too much for them now.Still, I understand that you feel bad. But don’t waste too much energy on recriminations. You have a housing problem to solve: Turn your focus there. You might ask your prospective employer if anyone in the office has a room to rent once a week. But even commuting for a few hours, one day a week, seems worthwhile for an exciting new job, right?ImageCredit...Miguel PorlanFinding the Love in a Gift CardSince I was a kid, my aunt has sent me $100 gift cards for birthdays and Christmas. It was a lot of money to me when I was younger, and it was exciting to have extra cash for books and music. She was wealthier than we were, and I appreciated her generosity. But now, my spouse and I are extremely well off. I don’t need the money. Gifts make me uncomfortable, and cash gifts (like gift cards) feel especially weird. On top of that, I haven’t seen my aunt in 20 years. There’s never a thoughtful card or call to make me think she wants to deepen our relationship. Is it possible to decline her gifts?Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
