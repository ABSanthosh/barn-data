  "description": "Every year at this time, we find ourselves craving new sweaters - you just can't beat that thrill of finding a new knit or sweatsuit set to cozy up in all season long. And while we're firm believers that you can never have too many sweaters in your wardrobe (especially if you live somewhere cold), dishing out the money to spend on a variety of styles is often a burden on our wallets. Fortunately, there are plenty of stylish sweaters out there that are equal parts cozy and affordable, and we've recently discovered a few of our favorites on Amazon. It's no secret that the retailer is a hub for deals across pretty much every major category. But when it comes to fashion, the retailer delivers in more ways than one with a massive selection of knits and other top-rated clothing, all at unbelievably low prices - we're talking so affordable, you won't have to spend a penny over $25. Whether you want an elevated yet comfortable sweatshirt or a fitted turtleneck for layering, we've got options that'll impress you. Take a look at our favorite Amazon sweaters under $25, and score a few before they sell out. With deals like this, we have no doubt they'll be gone in the blink of an eye.",
