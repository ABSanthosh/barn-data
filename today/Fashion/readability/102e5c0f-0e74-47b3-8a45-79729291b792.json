Top Notes: Sandalwood | Middle Notes: Sage, Citrus, Mandarin Orange | Base notes: Clary Sage | Size: 3.4 fl oz | Type: Eau de Cologne | Season: Spring and Summer the_fragrance__island / Instagram Buying Considerations for the Best Hollister Cologne Now that you’ve lasered in on a scent you’d like to try, there are some things you should consider before you make that final purchase. Price Just because a cologne is pricey doesn’t mean it’s the very best! Stick to your budget; you’ll be able to find a cologne you like that won’t break the bank by limiting your cologne search to the ones you can afford. Likewise, expensive colognes can be well worth it. It depends on your situation and your budget. Size Cologne bottles are priced by their size; depending on how often you plan on wearing your cologne (every day or just for special occasions) will help you determine the size of cologne you purchase and how much you spend. For instance, I store a smaller bottle of the Coastline Cologne exclusively for business trips. This is because it passes airport flying requirements and gives me something different when working abroad. Similarly, I have a larger bottle of the scents I like to use daily, like Hollister Wave, to keep up. I also enjoy using it if I’d like to refresh clothes in my closet but need help to throw them in the wash. Scent Everyone has their scent preference for their cologne, so make sure the colognes you’re looking at reflect what you like or what your girl likes. No matter how much the bottle costs, you don’t want to spend anything on a cologne that you won’t like or only sort of like. You should also experiment; our tastes can change as we age, so don’t hesitate to dip your feet into unknown waters. Maybe you want to learn more about sandalwood colognes after years of the beach scene. Do what you feel is right; the cologne should engage and bolster your confidence! Long-lasting Most important when considering the best Hollister cologne is whether it’s a long-lasting cologne. Depending on your reasoning for getting a cologne, whether for a special evening out or for withstanding your long work days, you’ll want something to last for that ride. justinscents__81 / Instagram Why You Should Trust Us I’m quite a fan of colognes in general and Hollister cologne in particular.
