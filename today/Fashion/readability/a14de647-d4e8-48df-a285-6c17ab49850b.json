But What to Wear?Tips from The Times’ fashion director on how to navigate the sartorial anxieties of the season.Credit...Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosVanessa FriedmanVanessa Friedman is the fashion director and chief fashion critic for The Times.Updated Ah, the joys of Christmas: sleigh bells, fir trees, Santas, the office holiday party.The office holiday party?The return to work has meant not just a return to commuting and ergonomic chairs, but a return to the rituals of the professional world, and with that, the work party. And if you thought it was hard to remember what to wear when you have to get up in the morning and actually get out of the house and interact with colleagues and clients, how much more confusing is the idea of what to wear when you have to get up in the morning, get out of the house, interact with colleagues and clients — and then attend a festive event with those same colleagues and clients that purports to be a relaxing bonus to all but is actually a minefield of potential missteps, anxiety and sartorial dissonance?And you thought end-of-year reviews and contract negotiations were tough. It’s enough to bring out the Grinch in us all.Indeed, the office holiday party — once upon a less culturally sensitive time known as the office Christmas party — is such a notorious quagmire that there was an entire 2016 movie entitled (yup) “Office Christmas Party,” featuring Kate McKinnon of “Saturday Night Live” and “Barbie” in a series of ugly Christmas sweaters and Jennifer Aniston in full-on navy corporate glory, both gleefully exploiting the comedic potential of the event. If you want to know what not to wear, that film is a good place to start.Still, since that cinematic ode to gala goofiness opened in actual theaters, the fashion part of it all has only gotten more complicated. In part because the office dress code itself has largely devolved into the generic suggestion to look “appropriate,” a word that has as many interpretations as there are lights on the Rockefeller Center tree.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
