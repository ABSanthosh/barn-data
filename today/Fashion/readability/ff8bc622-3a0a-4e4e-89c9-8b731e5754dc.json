  "text": "For many, the world of rodeo is steeped in tradition, with deep roots in American history. But for others, it can seem disconnected from contemporary cultural trends. Enter the Desert Rodeo, a new event in Thermal, Calif. — a community in the festival-friendly Coachella Valley — that was held over the weekend. The event sought to bridge a gap by crafting a space where rodeo enthusiasts and festivalgoers could come together to celebrate their shared passions.The rodeo did not have an official connection to the popular Stagecoach Festival, a country music event held over the weekend in nearby Indio, but the timing was not a coincidence. “I am a big country music fan,” said Cassie DiLaura, one of the Desert Rodeo’s founders. “We noticed that there wasn’t really an activity or experience to enjoy during the day before heading to some of the festivals, so we wanted to create a daytime experience that was open to the entire community.”The event tried to bring a new vibe to the world of rodeo.“A lot of rodeos are in coliseums and enclosed spaces,” said Cam Payne, who was attending both the rodeo and the Stagecoach Festival. “They don’t have the energy that this one has, because you can get a lot of people who love country music and love rodeos at the same time, it’s such a different vibe. I feel like this is the 21st-century rodeo.”“I’d say it’s a slice of America, but with a bit of a Stagecoach twist,” said Bardo Novotny, a producer and guitarist who was also attending both events. “It’s like a bedazzled American flag.” Mr. Novotny’s style blended the looks of both events: a cowboy hat, Metallica T-shirt and Lucchese boots.“Stagecoach is selling out quicker than Coachella, and it’s this weird time where it’s becoming so popular,” he said. “There’s obviously going to be a lot more eyes and mainstream influences on the whole culture.”For Sadie Rey, Mr. Novotny’s girlfriend, it was her first time at a rodeo. The couple came with their friend Taylor Morland, a rodeo fan, and the group filmed TikTok videos in the stands.Ms. Moreland added: “It’s about time California had an infusion of rodeo culture. And it’s great that it’s attracting a younger crowd.”Talia Jackson, an actress and singer, said she believed mixing rodeo and festival culture could revitalize both worlds. “I think if more people realized that these types of experiences are available to them, so many more would love to participate,” she said. Ms. Jackson said the vibe reminded her of growing up in the Midwest. “In places like Nebraska, Ohio or Texas, this is just normal life. It’s great to see that culture brought to California because it’s so normalized in other states, but here, it feels like something special.”So, what do the true cowboys think?“The more the merrier,” Jack Chase and Chance West, a pair of professional Saddle Bronc champions who were competing in the rodeo, said in unison. Cassidy Barnes, another competitor, added, “Probably the majority is here for Stagecoach, which is great, it’s a great festival, and I mean, it’s awesome that people came to see us, too.” Joseph Gonzalez, a cowboy wandering around the Outlaw Oasis, a merchandise area at the rodeo, was hopeful that exposure to a new crowd would be a good thing.“Not necessarily a crisis, but the rodeo culture is kind of dying,” he said. “This rodeo is a good way to get people here — young kids, families — you don’t have to own a horse, you don’t even have to live the life, as long as you like horses, cowboys and rodeo. I mean, social media, the internet, it’s a good way for people to learn about rodeo culture.”Bryce Eberly, who was attending his first rodeo, came away impressed. “I love the idea that it captures the essence of what Stagecoach is supposed to be, and it’s really cool,” he said.Colton Tran, another attendee, said: “I feel like it meshes those demographics, and I know it’s modern like Stagecoach and Coachella is a modern culture, bringing in the old school, I think it’s a good thing. I think it’s progressive.”The event hopes to expand going forward. “We have big plans for the coming years,” Ms DiLaura said.But will those who came this year return next year? “I would love to come next year,” Ms. Jackson said. “This whole month of April, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m going to be here for Stagecoach, but there’s really nothing to do other than Stagecoach.’ Then I thought, ‘That’s not true, not anymore, right?’”Site Index",
