Housed in compacts modeled after the famous striped sun umbrellas, the cheek palettes come in four different shade sets, each containing two blushes, a highlighter, and a silky bronzer. For the eyes, the collection has a new set of shadow sticks, including lavender, champagne, and burgundy shimmers. But if it’s a glittering lip you’re after, the Afterglow Lip Oils offer hues like classic Orgasm (a peachy gold) to Wondrous, a tart berry shade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eShop on May 19 at \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.narscosmetics.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNARS\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e8 of 8\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.stories.com/en_usd/roksanda-collection.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eROKSANDA \u0026amp; Other Stories collection\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo celebrate the imminent arrival of summer, Roksanda Ilinčić is teaming up with \u003ca href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2024/06/11738869/and-other-stories-brianna-lance-collaboration-review\"\u003e\u0026amp; Other Stories\u003c/a\u003e to launch a sunset-inspired collection.
