  "description": "You can find me in loungewear pretty much any day of the week - and 90 percent of the time, there's a bathrobe thrown over it. Over the years, my robe has become what I lovingly refer to as my \"house jacket,\" because I'm always cold. Recently, I decided to retire all my worn-out ones and invest in something I actually love. Enter: the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe ($103, originally $129). I'd seen it during boutique hotel stays and all over my social feeds, so I finally gave in. What sold me? Shoppers won't stop raving about it - and now, neither can I. The best part? Now through May 1, you can grab it for 20 percent off, plus free shipping. That's a total steal. Available in 10 stunning colors, it's also the perfect gift for your mom this Mother's Day - and yes, I'd 100% recommend it.",

  "text": "What I Like About the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe The material is what really won me over. It's lightweight yet incredibly soft and cozy, made of a four-ply gauze that adds just the right layer. I don't get too hot or too cold when I wear it, making it the perfect transitional piece as the weather warms up. Honestly, I never want to take it off.What's Worth Noting About the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe Because it's made from light and breezy Turkish cotton — which I love, mind you — it's definitely on the lightweight side. So if you're hopping out of the shower expecting a thick, plush robe to bundle up in, this isn't that. Instead, it's more breathable — like a luxe, dainty extra layer (that just so happens to look really good, too). It makes the perfect gift, because not many people own robes this lightweight and soft — but once they do, I promise they'll fall in love. Just a heads-up before buying: this robe isn't meant to be hefty!Who Is the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe Best For?This robe is perfect for anyone who prioritizes comfort, style, and a touch of luxury — whether you're a dedicated homebody, a new parent needing cozy moments, or someone who just wants to elevate their self-care routine. Its lightweight yet cozy fabric is ideal for people who run cold (despite being thin, it still keeps me warm!) or want a breathable layer they can wear year-round. If you're ready to trade in your worn-out loungewear for something that feels like a boutique hotel experience at home, this robe is absolutely made for you.Additional Details The robe comes prewashed, so you can throw it on the moment it arrives — plus, it won't shrink in the wash. Made from 100% Turkish cotton, it's noticeably softer than your average cotton. It's machine-washable, so caring for it is low-maintenance. Where to Shop the Parachute Cloud Cotton Robe This lightweight robe is available online and in store at Parachute Home. Rating: ★★★★★",
