Circulose, which is made from 100% textile waste, is a \"dissolving pulp\" that can be turned into fibers like viscose and lyocell, and then spun into yarns, woven or knitted into fabrics. \"Investing in next-generation materials is essential to achieving our goal: ensuring that 100% of our materials are recycled or sustainably sourced by 2030,\" Cecilia Strömblad Brännsten, H\u0026M Group's head of resource use \u0026 circularity, said in a statement. \"Scaling access to these solutions is key to accelerating the shift towards a circular economy for fashion.\" {H\u0026M Group}Lacoste names new CEOÉric Vallat, chief executive officer of Rémy Cointreau Group, is set to join Lacoste as CEO, effective Sept. 1. Vallat will succeed Thierry Guibert, who has served as Lacoste's CEO since 2015. Guibert will continue in his role as CEO of Lacoste parent MF Brands Group and of Maus Frères Group.

Today, brands tap stars (established and emerging alike) as ambassadors, but how much do celebrities actually earn from these deals? Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals. An artist with a significant online following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. {The New York Times/paywalled}2025's fastest-growing DTC beauty companiesA report titled \"The State of Retail 2025 Beauty\" by data analytics firm Consumer Edge identifies the top 40 and 20 direct-to-consumer beauty companies in the U.S. and U.K., respectively. Rhode, Maëlys and Phlur have had the strongest DTC sales growth in beauty this year. Salt \u0026 Stone, Spoiled Child, Beauty of Joseon, Primally Pure, Oakcha, Qure Skincare, Glowbar, Peachy and V/O Med Spa also made Consumer Edge's top 20. {Beauty Independent}Homepage photo: Johnny Dufort/Courtesy of Self-PortraitPlease note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
