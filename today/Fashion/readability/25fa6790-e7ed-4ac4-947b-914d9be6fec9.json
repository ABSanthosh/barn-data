If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as the outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and wow factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a sherpa coat or the sporty edge of a puffer, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. This season, the top coat is getting a modern twist with ladylike details and cape silhouettes, while wintry leather and suede jackets hold their ground (though not without fresh updates, from vibrant colors to bold faux-fur trims). Bombers are vying for the spotlight, too, feeling particularly on-point in warmer winter climates. And if you’re in need of a warm layer to drape over your winter wedding guest attire? Look no further than the faux-fur coats topping our edit (Topshop’s, Gap’s, and Abercrombie’s are incredible). As far as specific items go, fan favorites like the Aritzia slouch coat, the North Face puffer, and the teddy-like UGG coat prove that staying warm doesn’t mean compromising on style. Whether you’re bundling up, keeping it tailored, or planning outcoats to pair with your coziest oversized scarf, our picks ahead make braving the cold downright fun. DashDividers_1_500x100 Faux-Fur Coats Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. From Topshop’s hip-grazing silhouette to Gap’s best-selling knee-length style, these jackets balance boldness with cozy comfort. They’re perfect for pairing with denim or a sweater dress to dress up the casual winter staples. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Jackets Suede jackets are stepping it up with fun, vibrant shades this winter, like Free People’s rust red rendition and Urban Outfitters’ cobalt blue style. A classic refreshed for those who like their layers heavyweight and punched up with a little more personality. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Jackets The puffer jacket is a winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool. From North Face’s iconic 1996 Retro Nuptse to Coach’s cute (and reversible!) cropped design, these go with everything, from comfy travel pants to date-night looks (or sweats when you’re keeping it lounge-y for weekend errands). Fully lean into the vibe with coordinating puffer boots.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Leather Coats Leather coats are a closet mainstay for a reason: They do the most (in a good way). Plush-lined styles (like Asos Curve’s long silhouette lined with shearling) bring serious warmth for frigid days, while lightweight options (like BDG’s fur-trimmed aviator) are just the thing for milder temps. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sherpa Coats Sherpa coats bring a plush, textural twist to cold-weather layering. From statement designs like Damson Madder’s checked and bow-adorned jacket to timeless teddy silhouettes like UGG’s Gertrude and J.Crew’s winter-white peacoat, they’re ideal for adding warmth and a fun touch to your winter wardrobe.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Ladylike Wool Coats Curved lines, sharp collars, and sleek details give classic wool coats a fresh spin this season. Look at Reformation’s bow-tied jacket or Madewell’s bold red design — they’re ladylike, minimal, and anything but boring (especially if you go bold by styling yours alongside the dress-over pants trend).  DashDividers_1_500x100 Bomber Jackets Bomber jackets are getting a sport-luxe makeover with padded and quilted designs (perfect for brisk chills), slouchy faux leather (bonus points for trendy colors like burgundy), and even reversible options (who doesn’t love a two-fer?). Style them over clingy knits with jeans and a statement belt for an “I tried, but not too hard” nonchalance. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cape Coats Cape coats are one of those runway trends that are actually wearable IRL. From Dôen’s plaid take to Banana Republic’s bright red number (hitting two trends at once), these styles deliver drama with a polished sensibility. Like what you see?
