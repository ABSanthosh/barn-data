Mr. Malinak was a senior at the university, and Ms. Brown was a junior.The couple, who are now married, thought Mr. Malinak “would be a great match for me,” Ms. Brown said.So they made small talk that night in 2015, but Ms. Brown noticed Mr. Malinak’s nervousness. “He was stammering and very fidgety.” To put him at ease, she spontaneously kissed him as they stood in the corner of a room. “I relaxed right away,” he said.Mr. Malinak, now 31, and Ms. Brown, 30, got to know each other over the next few months, hanging out in groups with friends. “I thought she was cute and felt comfortable being around her, but our interaction was superficial,” Mr. Malinak said. He graduated that June, and they amicably parted ways.They reconnected in May 2016, when Mr. Malinak, who was working as a video game developer in Dallas, visited Stanford to attend a reunion for his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon. “When I knew about my trip, Brianna came to mind,” he said. “I told Reed and Anna that I’d like to reconnect, so they planned for the four of us to attend a SigEp beer tasting.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
