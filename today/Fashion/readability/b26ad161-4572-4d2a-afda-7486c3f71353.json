  "description": "For decades, A-listers have glammed up for the Golden Globes, turned out for the SAGs, and pulled out almost all the stops for the Grammys. But the mother of all award shows is the Oscars, where the all-star Hollywood glamour is always on full display.From couture gowns to custom-made looks, the Oscars red carpet at the Oscars showcases the best, most unforgettable fashion, from Audrey Hepburn's white Givenchy dress in 1954 to the Dior gown Jennifer Lawrence wore to accept her Academy Award in 2013. It has also given us  outfits that pushed the limits of what’s considered formalwear: Take, for example, Sharon Stone's 1998 Gap-shirt-and-Vera-Wang-skirt combo or Ariana De Bose's Valentino crop top-and-pants look, which she paired with a long train, in 2022.While we patiently wait for this year’s Oscars — happening this Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, FYI — we’re brushing up on our Academy Awards fashion history with a trip down memory lane. Ahead, reminisce over the best Oscars red carpet looks of the past few decades, according to our fashion team. Audrey Hepburn, 1954It never took much to make the late Audrey Hepburn look glamorous, but in this Givenchy gown, Hepburn, glowing from winning an Oscar for Roman Holiday, is nothing short of perfection.Photo: NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images. Grace Kelly, 1955Designed by arguably the most famous costumer in history, Edith Head, Grace Kelly's Oscars look was, like most of her outfits, an absolute winner.Photo: Silver Screen Collection/Hulton Archive/Getty Images.

Celine Dion, 1999A woman wearing a suit on the red carpet is hardly surprising in 2025.
