  "text": "In a technology-focused world where machines produce so many of our everyday items, the intricate craftsmanship that only true masters can achieve is increasingly rare. But when does craftsmanship transcend utility and reach the level of an art form? There is no one better to answer that question than the legendary Swiss watchmaker Jaeger-LeCoultre. To continue its Made of Makers program, a partnership with contemporary artists that explores the parallels between horology and art, the brand has tapped famed French perfumer Nicolas Bonneville for an extraordinary collaboration. \"Art, to us, is the expression of human creativity. It's a reflection of the culture of its time, and the only purpose of art is to generate and create emotions,\" says Matthieu Le Voyer, CMO of Jaeger-LeCoultre. \"We strongly believe that the worlds of watchmaking and of the arts share common values of human credibility, reflection, creativity, craftsmanship, and emotional resonance.\"Bonneville has been recognized as an innovative scent artist for his masterful combinations, using traditional and avant-garde techniques to produce captivating sensorial experiences. Presented with the challenge to create the olfactory identity of Jaeger-LeCoultre, he composed a collection of three stunning fragrances that embody both artisanal craftsmanship and savoir faire.Courtesy of Jaeger-LeCoultreCourtesy of Jaeger-LeCoultre \"Using only rare and precious ingredients, and distilling raw materials down to their pure sense, I focus on finding the nuances around a single scent to guarantee an exclusive identity that is memorable and unique,\" Bonneville says. \"Every element I select plays a crucial role.\" The Precision Pioneer is inspired by the Maison's origins. Essences of cedar and incense meld into an amber accord to evoke the intense heat of the blacksmith's fire and comfort of a wooden watchmaker's bench, where raw materials are transformed into masterpieces of precision. \"The raw materials for me are a witness of time,\" Bonneville says. \"There is also a link to time with frankincense, which is more spiritual—a link with eternity.\"The Timeless Stories draws inspiration from Jaeger-LeCoultre's iconic Reverso watch, which was created to withstand the rigors of polo matches. Woody and leathery notes give reminiscence of stables and saddles, while the opening note of violet leaves evokes the freshness of a verdant playing field. \"For this fragrance I pushed the boundaries, and it was quite challenging for me,\" Bonneville recalls. \"I used an overdose of orris, the most expensive raw material for a perfumer. You need to grow the bulb for two years to bring it to maturity, so it has that link to time as well.\"The Celestial Odyssey pays homage to the relationship between watchmaking and astrology, embodying the sun, moon, and stars with notes of patchouli, amber wood, and vanilla. \"I focused on patchouli, which is very iconic, but here I used it in a different way, with an extraction process that revealed more facets,\" the perfumer notes. \"Patchouli is a dark and light raw material, very earthy, woody, in the background, and on top it's fresh and comforting. For me this was the moon phase.\"Courtesy of Jaeger-LeCoultreThe partnership between the watchmakers and the perfumer revealed a deep connection that represents Jaeger-LeCoultre's identity perfectly. Just as a watch intersects the space between utility and fashion, fragrances also marry function with emotion, blending style with sentiment effortlessly.Courtesy of Jaeger-LeCoultreAnd while these transcendent fragrances are offered exclusively to clients of the Maison, they also can be experienced at Jaeger-LeCoultre's \"Reverso Stories\" Pop-Up at Hudson Yards in New York City, from December 6th to 15th. The multi sensory experience is being staged to celebrate the launch of a new limited-edition Reverso, with an immersive journey through the nine decades of craftsmanship, innovation, and design behind the storied watch; Along with the olfactive discovery of Nicolas Bonneville’s creations, it also features a selection of the Made of Makers collaborations. If you are interested in visiting you can book online or register upon arrival for a chance to witness these sensorial works of art firsthand. The fragrance collection will also be featured at the Jaeger-LeCoultre flagship boutique, located at 701 Madison Ave in New York City.",
