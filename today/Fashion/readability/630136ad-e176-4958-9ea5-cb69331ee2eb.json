The energy throughout the 45-minute set was nothing short of electric, from the moment she began with “Push 2 Start” until she closed out with “Water,” a moment the crowd, naturally, went wild.Emma McIntyreOn stage, the recently-announced Pandora ambassador mixed metals with stacked gold and silver Pandora Essence bangles and Timeless Pavé rings, and her famously short hairstyle was accented with big hoop earrings complete with ME tooth charms. In her campaign with Pandora, the singer, who styled her jewelry and charms to pay homage to her life journey, explained that the tooth reminds her of her fans, otherwise known as Tygers. “I wanted whatever would shine the most on stage,” the singer told ELLE.com after her performance. “We got some time to play around with the charms so we added some personalized tiger teeth, and I always love stacking rings and bracelets, too.” Aside from her Pandora jewels, Tyla appeared at the music festival wearing a gold bedazzled bikini top, a slouchy tied-up white tank, vintage Dolce \u0026 Gabbana bottoms, and ripped fishnets with heeled cheetah-print booties. “Whatever I want to feel performance-wise for that specific show, I have to dress that way because it takes me into that world,” Tyla said. “Yesterday, I was on a spicy moment. I wanted to show skin. We kind of made it like high fashion with some DIYs.”The overall vibe was fierce and fun—there was a giant tiger balloon that Tyla spray painted her name on in the middle of her performance, to the crowd’s applause—and she brought out Becky G to perform “On My Body.” The Grammy winner even went into the crowd towards the end of her performance and showed off her incredible connection with her fans, who were thrilled to see the viral sensation in person.",
