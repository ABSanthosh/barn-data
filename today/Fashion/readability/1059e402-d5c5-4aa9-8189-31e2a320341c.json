Something will suffer.”The audience of roughly 3,000 young women listened, rapt. They wore pins that read “Dump your socialist boyfriend” and “My favorite season is the fall of feminism.” In ruffled sundresses and cowboy boots, they shimmied to the “Church Clap.” When Ms. Loesch stepped off the stage, and out came Trump World rock stars Charlie and Erika Kirk, the young women came up to the microphone one by one to ask for advice — on finding a husband, on raising Christian children, on what to tell friends who judged them for wanting to marry young. “I must have missed it in Matthew — which is ‘Go forth and become C.E.O. of a shoe company,’” Mr. Kirk told the audience, voice inlaid with an eye roll.It was the largest young conservative women’s event in the country, hosted by Turning Point USA, the organization Mr. Kirk leads that claimed a critical role in turning out young voters for President Trump. Most attendees had come to the Young Women’s Leadership Summit not so much for advice on how to lead, but how to live. Because sure, the personal is political — but it’s also practical, palatable. They got clear marching orders. “Less Prozac, more protein,” said Alex Clark, a wellness influencer and podcast host who headlined the weekend. “Less burnout, more babies, less feminism, more femininity.”The conference was part sorority house (Saturday night was “Girls Night In”), part church and part suburban Tupperware party, with a heavy dose of “Unleash the Power Within.” Many attendees were raised in conservative homes. Others represented a new political constituency: Molded politically by Mr. Trump’s rise and rocked emotionally by the pandemic, they began listening to wellness influencers like Ms. Clark, whose voices became a gateway to the conservative political movement.ImageAlex Clark, second from left, a wellness influencer and podcaster, headlined the event.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
