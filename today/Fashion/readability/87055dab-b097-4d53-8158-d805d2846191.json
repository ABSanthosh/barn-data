I had a limited number of hours to read them and write evaluations explaining my reasons for accepting or rejecting them: This essay was “too hot.” That essay was “too cold.” And this one? This one was “just right!” And here’s why. (There were more than three essays to evaluate, but for narrative’s sake …)This year marks a decade of my work for Modern Love and the column’s 20th anniversary. A beautiful alignment, if you ask me.To celebrate this milestone, Dan and I created a special package of articles exploring the column’s history and impact. Whether you’re a new reader or a Modern Love loyalist, we think you’ll enjoy perusing these stories.Modern Love’s 20th AnniversaryThese real stories often have real-life impacts on readers.
