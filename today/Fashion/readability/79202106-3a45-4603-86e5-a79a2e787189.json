  "description": "Out of pure curiosity (and with a little fear of the cringe), I recently scrolled way too far back in my old photos to pinpoint the last time I proudly toted a Vera Bradley bag. After wading through a parade of painfully awkward concert pics, I finally spotted it: my beloved hot-pink wristlet, in a photo timestamped 2010 on Facebook. That fabric wristlet went everywhere with me until one fateful day when I tucked it away in my closet next to its matching tote and, honestly, forgot it even existed - that is, until 2024. Lately, I've been getting the sense that Vera Bradley is on the brink of a comeback. The brand has stepped beyond its iconic floral prints, embracing more modern styles like understated colors, trendy bows, bag charms, and youthful silhouettes like crescent shapes (kind of similar to my favorite Staud bag, but in a signature Vera pattern and unstructured shape). Naturally, I had to scope out their updated lineup (specifically on Amazon because I'm an impatient Prime shopper), and before I knew it, the Cotton Hathaway Tote ($70, originally $100) was in my cart. So, did this order spark the official rekindling of my Vera Bradley love affair? The verdict, ahead. About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available in seven designs on Amazon, or nine if you shop directly from Vera Bradley's site. It comes in four fabric options: cotton, nylon, leather, and canvas. Choose from three sizes: mini, small, and regular. The regular size measures 13.25\"W x 13.0\"H x 5.25\"D with a 10.25-inch handle drop. It's machine-washable on a cold, gentle cycle with like colors. What I Like About the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote What I love about the Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is, first and foremost, its understated autumnal hues. I chose the Marrakesh Cinnamon design, which features a warm brown base topped with a rich floral pattern. It has a subtly bohemian vibe and feels quintessentially autumn. Unlike the bold pink bags I used to carry back in 2010, this one's easy to style with my everyday wardrobe. I honestly can't remember if Vera Bradley offered anything this toned down back then, but back in the day, it felt like their unofficial motto was \"the brighter, the better.\" Another thing I love about this tote is the size. I used to own what's now called the Original Tote Bag, and let's just say, I had no business using it as a bookbag in high school. I'd stuff it with textbooks, workout clothes for gym class, and anything else that could fit until it was so overloaded I had to grab a second bag. Now, as an adult, it's such a relief to have a bag that's spacious (but not too spacious) and perfect for stashing my essentials - like a lightweight jacket, book, water bottle, wallet, makeup bag, you name it - without feeling overstuffed. Maybe it's the nostalgia or simply how much I love my new purchase, but carrying this handbag just puts me in a good mood. I'm a texture person, so the soft cotton reminds me of all things warm and cozy. It feels easy, familiar, and effortlessly stylish, like it's always been a part of my wardrobe. What to Consider Before Buying the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote One concern that popped up a few times in the reviews was that some shoppers weren't sure how to tie the bag to achieve the folded-in sides shown in one of the product photos. \"I can't for the life of me get the sides to fold in like it shows in the description picture,\" one reviewer shared, giving it three stars. \"That was the only reason I got this because I wanted to have the ends fold in so it's not a huge, bulky, wide bag.\" While I hadn't initially thought about compressing the tote, once I figured it out, I couldn't wait to wear it that way. Inside, there are two strings you simply tie together in a bow, and the sides naturally fold in. Just secure the tie closure, and voilà - you've got a more compact, less bulky bag that looks extra chic. I'm excited to wear it this way on days when I only need a few essentials and can forgo the full-size tote. Where Is the Vera Bradley Cotton Hathaway Tote Available? The Vera Bradley Women's Cotton Hathaway Tote is available on Amazon as well as direct-to-consumer from the brand's website.
