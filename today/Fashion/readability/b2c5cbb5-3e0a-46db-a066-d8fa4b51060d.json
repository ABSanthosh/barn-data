So, he excluded his unusual job from his Bumble profile.Even after matching with Jessica Rose Rega on Oct. 27, 2020, he decided to conceal his true identity as a psychic medium known as Jonathan Mark. In addition to working with clients, some of whom are celebrities, he collaborates with law enforcement on difficult cases.Mr. Filiberto and Ms. Rega spent the next week getting to know each other virtually. He was careful to keep his work a secret. On Nov. 7, 2020, they finally met in person for their first date at McKeown’s Pub in Huntington, N.Y.After they found a table in the enclosed area outside, Mr. Filiberto went inside to get drinks. But that took longer than both expected. “I just thought he wasn’t interested,” Ms. Rega said. “I saw him chatting with all these guys, and the bartender was serving other people.”When Mr. Filiberto finally returned to the table 30 minutes later, he felt terrible. He quickly made up for it with his charm. “Jon was super talkative and outgoing,” Ms. Rega said. “I can be shy at times when meeting new people, and I felt immediately comfortable with him. We didn’t want the date to end.”[Click here to binge read this week’s featured couples.]A week later, they went on a second date at Croxley’s Ale House, a restaurant and bar in Farmingdale, N.Y., and later shared a first kiss.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
