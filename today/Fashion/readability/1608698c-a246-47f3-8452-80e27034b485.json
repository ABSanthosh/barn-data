  "description": "If you're into fashion and an avid TikTok scroller, you've probably come across the viral and somewhat controversial Coperni one-leg jeans. People who got their hands on them are asking followers how they should style them - and even whether or not they should keep them. Those who are still on a waitlist or are simply curious about the trend are going so far as to DIY the jeans by taking a scissor to one leg of an old pair. I, on the other hand, dared to step into the Romeo Hunte Black One Leg Pant ($232, originally $725), an alternative take on the same silhouette that's even more eye-catching (which, how is that possible?). These jeans were, without a doubt, one of the most polarizing looks I've ever worn - and I've tried some pretty divisive clothing, from Skims butt-enhancing shapewear to the brand's famous push-up nipple bra, and many a sheer naked dress. After wearing the jeans around town to run errands and obviously attracting some attention (stares, double-takes, and the like), I've put together a detailed review of these jeans, which are undeniably weird but exciting the internet enough to strike up a conversation. About the Romeo Hunte Denim Raw Edge One Leg Jeans The jeans are available in sizes XS-XXL and have a 28.5-inch inseam, 12-inch rise, 18-inch knee opening, and 12-inch leg opening. They are made in Portugal from 100 percent cotton and have a zip-fly, two front pockets, and one back pocket. The jeans weigh just over 25.5 ounces when rolled. They are mild dry clean only. They can be teamed with the matching Romeo Hunte Sports Bra ($68, originally $295) for a full co-ord set. While they are on sale at Revolve, you can finance your purchase on Romeo Hunte's site with four separate payments. What I Like About the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans As someone who enjoys a bold look, I'm all about testing the waters in an avant-garde design. I like that these jeans are the obvious focal point of an outfit, meaning styling can and should be kept simple - a white tee, heels, and sunglasses are really all you need to complete the moment. I also appreciate the fact that they're a straight fit. I think a flare or super slim/skinny-cut leg would make these more difficult to walk in. Instead, these zip up smoothly and don't feel at all restrictive. While the denim isn't stretchy, it is soft, which adds to the comfort of the fabric against my skin. For me, this is a requirement when testing out such a risqué trend. What to Consider Before Buying the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans It probably goes without saying that these jeans are not for the faint of heart, and they will invite head turns. If you don't typically love trying out new trends, I'd attempt a DIY project before making this purchase, just to test the waters. Note that these jeans are also heavy, largely because of the patchwork design with extra shredding, which adds volume and texture all at once. Because one leg is completely free, the other will naturally feel weighed down by comparison when you're wearing them. For reference, rolled up, the jeans weigh just over 25.5 ounces, whereas my standard Levi's weigh 20 ounces - and they have a whole extra leg of material to account for! It's also worth noting that the cutoff on the right side of the pants is short. These definitely bare a hint of my right butt cheek from certain angles, and they're a bit roomy in the waist area, so I'd venture to say this isn't a sizing issue. I took a small, which, according to Romeo Hunte's size chart, is right for my measurements, but the jeans were a bit loose in the waist. However, if I had sized down, they definitely would've been too snug in the single pant leg to pull up properly. That being said, I often experience this issue in jeans as someone with athletic thighs. Who Are the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans Best For? These jeans are best for someone who likes to make a style statement, and they are specifically appropriate for a party, flashy event, or night out. Comfortability should also be taken into account - if you're someone who isn't used to asymmetrical hemlines, doesn't love heavy fabric, or prefers a more minimal aesthetic, these pants probably won't be your cup of tea. Where Are the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans Available to Shop? The Romeo Hunte jeans are available to shop on Revolve, as well as on the brand's website, and the 12th Tribe Eastwood Light One Legged Boyfriend Jeans ($98) is a similar style. You can sign up for the waitlist to shop the viral Coperni One-Leg Denim Trouser ($440). Of course, you can always opt for a DIY approach and take a scissor to one leg of an old pair of jeans if you're set on the style.

I also appreciate the fact that they\u0026#39;re a straight fit. I think a flare or super slim/skinny-cut leg would make these more difficult to walk in.

While the denim isn\u0026#39;t stretchy, it \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e soft, which adds to the comfort of the fabric against my skin. For me, this is a requirement when testing out such a risqué trend.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Buying the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eIt probably goes without saying that these jeans are not for the faint of heart, and they \u003cem\u003ewill\u003c/em\u003e invite head turns. If you don\u0026#39;t typically love trying out new trends, I\u0026#39;d attempt a DIY project before making this purchase, just to test the waters. Note that these jeans are also heavy, largely because of the patchwork design with extra shredding, which adds volume and texture all at once. Because one leg is completely free, the other will naturally feel weighed down by comparison when you\u0026#39;re wearing them. For reference, rolled up, the jeans weigh just over 25.5 ounces, whereas my standard Levi\u0026#39;s weigh 20 ounces — and they have a whole extra leg of material to account for! \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eIt\u0026#39;s also worth noting that the cutoff on the right side of the pants is \u003cem\u003eshort\u003c/em\u003e. These definitely bare a hint of my right butt cheek from certain angles, and they\u0026#39;re a bit roomy in the waist area, so I\u0026#39;d venture to say this isn\u0026#39;t a sizing issue. I took a small, which, according to \u003ca href=\"https://www.romeohunte.com/pages/size-chart-1?ref=popsugar.com\u0026amp;=___psv__p_49442474__t_w__r_www.popsugar.com%2Ffashion_\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRomeo Hunte\u0026#39;s size chart\u003c/a\u003e, is right for my measurements, but the jeans were a bit loose in the waist. However, if I had sized down, they definitely would\u0026#39;ve been too snug in the single pant leg to pull up properly. That being said, I often experience this issue in jeans as someone with athletic thighs. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4obPa_6LFhqlNFD5Cp5ErMhgKP4=/fit-in/792x1408/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/12/738/n/1922564/tmp_SVhAlK_6697410efd35aa90_ezgif-6f4dbc2aadee50.gif\" width=\"792\" height=\"1408\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4obPa_6LFhqlNFD5Cp5ErMhgKP4=/fit-in/792x1408/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/12/738/n/1922564/tmp_SVhAlK_6697410efd35aa90_ezgif-6f4dbc2aadee50.gif 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/d3eGbgxnXVJlGdSOucMCUd79VlU=/fit-in/1584x2816/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/12/738/n/1922564/tmp_SVhAlK_6697410efd35aa90_ezgif-6f4dbc2aadee50.gif 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slwasz\" data-vars-href=\"https://www.instagram.com/slwasz\" data-vars-ga-action=\"click\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Sarah Wasilak\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho Are the Romeo Hunte One Leg Jeans Best For?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eThese jeans are best for someone who likes to make a style statement, and they are specifically appropriate for a party, flashy event, or night out.
