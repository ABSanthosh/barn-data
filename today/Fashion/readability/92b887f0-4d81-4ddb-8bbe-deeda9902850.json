Claiming a spot on the list of best men’s fragrances is an impressive feat. And if you swear by luxury colognes, you’ve most likely heard about Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani, but what’s the big deal? Well, that’s what this Acqua Di Gio reviewer set out to discover, and boy did I discover. This fan-favorite was released in 1996 with the help of its creator Alberto Morillas. Morillas had the idea of capturing the epitome of freedom; a windy, salty ocean breeze that can be celebrated by men of all ages. It’s a perfect summer scent that’s still pretty versatile. All that goodness aside, just because Acqua Di Gio has been a go-to scent for men for decades doesn’t mean you should buy a bottle blind. Dig a little deeper into the smells, longevity, and popularity—all the wonders of this scent will be explored below. Just scroll down and indulge. Key Takeaways Acqua Di Gio has a thoughtful, well-constructed Armani scent design with a harmonious mix of fragrances, making it almost instantly recognizable. Combining rich sea notes, bright citrus, and sensual musks, you’re rewarded with a nature-inspired scent masterpiece. Admittedly, it’s not the cheapest cologne, but it is a brilliant choice for an everyday fragrance that will leave an uplifting, masculine impression on whoever you run into. After reading this Acqua Di Gio review, you’ll see that it truly has helped set the tone for almost every citrus aquatic on the market today. I don’t think many men would regret giving it a fair shot. In This ArticleNotes \u0026 ScentUsageTrend and PopularityWhat We LikeFinal VerdictAlternative OptionsFAQs thescent.connoisseur / Instagram Fragrance Notes \u0026 Scent Top notes: Lime, Lemon, Bergamot, Jasmine, Orange, Mandarin Orange, Neroli Middle notes: Sea Notes, Jasmine, Calone, Peach, Freesia, Rosemary, Hyacinth, Cyclamen, Violet, Coriander, Nutmeg, Rose, Mignonette Base notes: White Musk, Cedar, Oakmoss, Patchouli, Amber Alberto Morillas created Acqua Di Gio to speak to the idea of freedom. It mimics the scents found on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Giorgio Armani lived and worked. These locales inspired him to bring the smells of the Mediterranean and of the Caribean to a men’s fragrance. The wind and water almost make it the cologne equivalent of a beautiful day sailing the ocean; a salty sea breeze, the sun warming your skin, and bitter citrus nipping your nose. Acqua Di Gio holds all the signifiers of a perfect summer day. When you first spray it on, you’ll immediately notice a bright hit of citrus. Lemon, lime, and Orange mingle with exotic Calabrian Bergamot right away. The top notes give way to the slightly bitter tang of Green Tangerine and sweet, metallic Neroli soon after. As the scent lingers and evolves, the middle notes shift to smells of the sea, accented by Jasmine, Freesia, Peach, and Persimmon. I love the middle notes of Coriander and Rosemary because they blend well with the sea notes, as does the clean, flowery smell of Rose and Hyacinth. Finally, the base notes reveal rich Amber, Musk, Cedar, and Patchouli that linger and tantalize the senses. This perfect balance of scent evolutions captures the freshness of the sea and wraps it in an invigorating, woody glow you’re sure to love. Usage \u0026 Occasion There’s no denying from this Acqua Di Gio review that it’s a very versatile scent. However, there are certain people, seasons, and situations it’s ideal for. If you’re a younger gent heading to a waterfront brunch, this cologne will do you proud every single time (it doesn’t have to be that exact scenario). Its popularity among the younger crowd in warmer weather is long-lasting for a reason, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t ideal for any guy looking to make a youthful impression all year. The same goes for evening occasions leaning toward the formal side. There’s no reason not to spritz this on with a nice suit for a night out, but it doesn’t have the same intensity you might want from a slightly deeper cologne. Basically, this is your go-to for more light-hearted occasions that don’t require you to wear a puffer jacket. Packaging \u0026 Price It’s official. A Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio men’s review told you this isn’t the cheapest cologne. If you know Armani, that’s no surprise. However, it is surprising that a 3.4oz bottle can often be had for around the $100 mark. Compared to some other name-brand colognes, that’s a pretty solid bargain. If you aren’t sure if you’ll like it, grab a travel size for under $50. The bottle is fitting for such a light scent. The minimalist, frosted glass fits the bright and aquatic scents it contains, topped by a matte silver cap that lets you know how soft and comforting this cologne really is. It’s a package that compliments the fragrance to the fullest. Trend and Popularity Plenty of Acqua Di Gio reviews will say it easily makes the top-selling cologne list regularly and has been proving that since the nineties. I think it’s pretty safe to say this is a popular scent. Some people even argue that it’s the best-smelling men’s cologne of all time, but we can all agree that’s very subjective. Best smelling of all time or not, you can imagine that this scent will be on trend for a long time. If it’s important to you to have one of the hottest colognes around, Acqua Di Gio won’t let you down. Worn by both older and younger men without smelling particularly “old” or “young,” Acqua Di Gio occupies a perfectly versatile middle ground anyone can enjoy. Of course, not everyone is a fan, but the continued popularity of this legendary fragrance can’t be denied. You might not smell totally unique, but chances are you’ll love it like Armani’s army of loyal customers. _perfume_bangladesh / Instagram Sillage and Longevity The sillage has some staying power, but not in the “someone’s overcompensating” way, but more in the “someone here has excellent taste” way. People will smell it from a few feet off, and if you’re lucky, the right people will step closer to get a better whiff of the sexy-smelling guy. Since it’s a primarily aquatic scent, it’s not going to be an aroma bomb, but it does a good job of surrounding you with smell-good power. Don’t get me wrong, though, you can easily overspray and end up choking yourself and anyone who gets too close to you. With normal sprays on your wrist, neck, and chest, you should be fine. On average, you can expect about 5-6 hours of scent out of the cologne, and sometimes up to 9 hours. This isn’t super impressive, but it has a solid longevity level for a daily wear scent. What We Like  The charming, natural, authentic scent takes you right to the Mediterranean seaside, leaving you feeling clean and fresh too. It has a long-lasting scent that smells amazing but is never too overpowering or cloying. It’s a fairly affordable everyday cologne, especially compared to other designer brands. Flaws But Not Deal Breakers   Most detractors will say Acqua Di Gio isn’t unique enough to leave a lasting impression or an impression that’s too familiar. If you’re going on a date, you run the risk of reminding them of their dad, brother, or ex-boyfriend… yikes. lacherieperfumaria / Instagram What Are Customers Saying about Acqua Di Gio Customers are crazy about it, and this Acqua Di Gio cologne review is here to provide proof. They have been for a long time, and they probably will be for years. Plenty of women like Ashlee say it’s the perfect cologne to buy for the men in their lives. “I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it smells sooo good when he wears it. I notice right away when he walks by me, but it’s not overbearing, just the right amount of scent.” This is frequently a go-to summer scent for countless guys, but for gents like Even, it’s his everyday, every-season cologne. “Acqua Di Gio is an amazing cologne. I am always being told hours after having put it on that I smell great, and the scent isn’t too strong to the point where it shoots up your nose like a lot of other brands. I’ve been using this scent for years, and it’s definitely one of my favorites.” The biggest issue people have had, although it’s barely an issue in my book, is that the paint on the bottle cap tends to peel off. Seriously, make sure you buy from a reputable seller. Final Verdict Going into an Acqua Di Gio review, you probably already knew it was very popular and highly rated. Not everyone will love the scent, but I still recommend it to cologne newbies and aficionados alike. It’s a great everyday cologne, it’s a safe choice when you want to smell good, and it won’t overpower anyone in your vicinity when you’re indoors (as long as you don’t bathe in it like a crazy person). You might not get extra unique points, and some people might even dock you for wearing such a super-popular fragrance. But if you like it, you aren’t alone. Acqua Di Gio is a beloved cologne for men of all ages. If you want to smell like you belong in a high-fashion beachwear ad, this crisp and casual scent will knock your socks off. cris_essence_collector / Instagram Alternative Options Davidoff Cool Water Pierre Bourdon dreamt up Cool Water in 1988, and it’s another very popular aquatic men’s fragrance with top notes of lavender, seawater, mint, coriander, and rosemary. It gives way to refreshing hints of jasmine and geranium that melds into Sandalwood and slightly spicy Neroli. The base notes feature deep scents of Cedar, Oakmoss, and Musk. Cool Water is a bit heavier and muskier overall, but it provides a similar scent profile for you to try instead. Kenzo Pour Homme Kenzo’s Pour Homme is another aromatic aquatic cologne popular among men. It came out in 1991 as a brainchild of Christian Mathieu. Like Cool Water and Acqua Di Gio, it has top notes of Bergamot and seawater along with tart citrus. The Middle notes include Juniper Berries, Pine, and Carnation. There are also hints of decadent Lily-of-the-Valley, Orris Root, and Nutmeg. The base notes of Vetiver, Balsam Fir, Cedar, and Sandalwood for a rich, earthy finish. They blend beautifully and create a warm, nature-inspired scent profile. Salvatore Ferragamo Acqua Essenziale The final Acqua Di Gio alternative is Acqua Essenziale by Salvatore Ferragamo. This aromatic fragrance came out in 2013 thanks to Alberto Morillas, who if you remember, also created Acaua Di Gio. This scent includes some familiar fragrances, but it’s the most unique of all the alternatives listed, in my opinion. The top notes of citrus are spiked with refreshing mint notes that give way to seaside-inspired smells along with heady Lavender, Rosemary, and Geranium. The Patchouli base notes are similar to Acqua Di Gio, but the Vetiver, Labdanum, and Musk end up stealing the show in Acqua Essenziale. FAQ Imagine walking along a sunny, sandy beach on a warm summer day in Italy or Greece. That’s where Acqua Di Gio takes you. Bright hits of floral and citrus enliven your mood before giving way to the salty smell of ocean air. The middle notes enchant and then eventually give way to those deep, sensual base notes of earthy, rich, woody luxury. Longevity varies based on a lot of factors, but on average, Acqua Di Gio lasts between 5 and 7 hours. It’s got moderate sillage and projection, which is nice if you hate overwhelming scents. Typically, the first 2 hours of the scent are the strongest, shifting from top notes to middle notes. Then the base notes steal the show from hours 3-7. Sometimes it still lingers on your skin and clothes for hours after use. For fans of their aquatic aroma, Armani offers more than just the original Acqua Di Gio, which boasts the lightest scent profile of the bunch. Acqua Di Gio Profundo is a nice middle ground regarding scent strength. Then you have Acqua Di Gio Profumo, with the most pungent scent, projection, and sillage of the three colognes. So it’s less a matter of “best” Armani cologne and more a concern of how strong you want your Acqua Di Gio scent to be. In the 1980s, Armani had already achieved fame as a famous fashion house with perfumes and cologne offerings. In the 1990s, they expanded their fragrance products, and Acqua Di Gio was born in 1996. Alberto Morillas brought the scent of Giorgio Armani’s favorite Italian island to the whole world. The editorial team at FashionBeans is your trusted partner in redefining modern men’s style.

A Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio men’s review told you this isn’t the cheapest cologne. If you know Armani, that’s no surprise.

I think it’s pretty safe to say this is a popular scent. Some people even argue that it’s the best-smelling men’s cologne of all time, but we can all agree that’s very subjective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-smelling-colognes-for-men/\" data-lasso-id=\"1222124\"\u003eBest smelling of all time\u003c/a\u003e or not, you can imagine that this scent will be on trend for a long time.

They have been for a long time, and they probably will be for years. Plenty of women like Ashlee say it’s the perfect cologne to buy for the men in their lives. “I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it smells sooo good when he wears it. I notice right away when he walks by me, but it’s not overbearing, just the right amount of scent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is frequently a go-to summer scent for countless guys, but for gents like Even, it’s his everyday, every-season cologne. “Acqua Di Gio is an amazing cologne. I am always being told hours after having put it on that I smell great, and the scent isn’t too strong to the point where it shoots up your nose like a lot of other brands. I’ve been using this scent for years, and it’s definitely one of my favorites.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest issue people have had, although it’s barely an issue in my book, is that the paint on the bottle cap tends to peel off.

Not everyone will love the scent, but I still recommend it to cologne newbies and aficionados alike. It’s a great everyday cologne, it’s a safe choice when you want to smell good, and it won’t overpower anyone in your vicinity when you’re indoors (as long as you don’t bathe in it like a crazy person).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might not get extra unique points, and some people might even dock you for wearing such a super-popular fragrance.

A Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio men’s review told you this isn’t the cheapest cologne. If you know Armani, that’s no surprise.

I think it’s pretty safe to say this is a popular scent. Some people even argue that it’s the best-smelling men’s cologne of all time, but we can all agree that’s very subjective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-smelling-colognes-for-men/\" data-lasso-id=\"1222124\"\u003eBest smelling of all time\u003c/a\u003e or not, you can imagine that this scent will be on trend for a long time.

They have been for a long time, and they probably will be for years. Plenty of women like Ashlee say it’s the perfect cologne to buy for the men in their lives. “I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it smells sooo good when he wears it. I notice right away when he walks by me, but it’s not overbearing, just the right amount of scent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is frequently a go-to summer scent for countless guys, but for gents like Even, it’s his everyday, every-season cologne. “Acqua Di Gio is an amazing cologne. I am always being told hours after having put it on that I smell great, and the scent isn’t too strong to the point where it shoots up your nose like a lot of other brands. I’ve been using this scent for years, and it’s definitely one of my favorites.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest issue people have had, although it’s barely an issue in my book, is that the paint on the bottle cap tends to peel off.

Not everyone will love the scent, but I still recommend it to cologne newbies and aficionados alike. It’s a great everyday cologne, it’s a safe choice when you want to smell good, and it won’t overpower anyone in your vicinity when you’re indoors (as long as you don’t bathe in it like a crazy person).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might not get extra unique points, and some people might even dock you for wearing such a super-popular fragrance.

The base notes feature deep scents of Cedar, Oakmoss, and Musk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool Water is a bit heavier and muskier overall, but it provides a similar scent profile for you to try instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kenzo-Homme-Piece-Toilette-Spray/dp/B00GDGZU1Y?tag=fsb_1120546-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" data-lasso-id=\"1161519\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eKenzo Pour Homme\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenzo’s Pour Homme is another aromatic aquatic cologne popular among men. It came out in 1991 as a brainchild of Christian Mathieu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Cool Water and Acqua Di Gio, it has top notes of Bergamot and seawater along with tart citrus. The Middle notes include Juniper Berries, Pine, and Carnation. There are also hints of decadent Lily-of-the-Valley, Orris Root, and Nutmeg.

This aromatic fragrance came out in 2013 thanks to Alberto Morillas, who if you remember, also created Acaua Di Gio. This scent includes some familiar fragrances, but it’s the most unique of all the alternatives listed, in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe top notes of citrus are spiked with refreshing mint notes that give way to seaside-inspired smells along with heady Lavender, Rosemary, and Geranium.
