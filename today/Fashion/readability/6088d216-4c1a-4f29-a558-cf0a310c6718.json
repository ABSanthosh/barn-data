This is Chris, He’s The Creator behind Clicky Bezel @ClickyBezel In many industries, passion paves the way for innovation, and this isn’t an exception for the world of horology. Such is the story of Chris, the creative force behind Clicky Bezel, a YouTube channel that has quickly become an innovative resource for watch enthusiasts worldwide. His expertise has captured our readers on the site for the past few months with insightful watch reviews and round-ups (more of which you can find here), with more (lucky for all of us!) in the works. But now, we’re turning the tables to get to know the man behind the ticking clock—and the camera. The Important Stuff  Name: Chris Tran Location: San Francisco, CA Full-Time Job: Full-time Creative Manager at Williams Sonoma and Content Creator around Watches. YouTube: Clicky Bezel Instagram: @clickybezel https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Shopping_Watches_in_Japan_and_Where_to_Find_Them-ezgif.com-webp-to-mp4-converter.mp4 What item made you fall in love with the industry?  The infamous Casio Calculator watch. Without this watch, my interest in this weird obsession for things that tick and keep time would probably never come to be. What’s the most unusual source of inspiration you’ve ever used for your content? Music is very important to me. For most video creators, music is usually in the last stage of the editing process once you have your final cut down in your video editor. However, for my process, music is first before I even start the edit. In a way, music is what helps me guide my edit. It’s unconventional, but it works for me. @ClickyBezel How has YouTube/social media impacted your life/career?  I’ve always been obsessed with watching videos on YouTube ever since its inception. Nowadays, Youtube is a way for me to express my creativity on a medium that has potential to reach millions of people. With my recent success seen through a few of my videos, it’s still crazy to me that viewers are resonating with my stories, especially content that is more personal to me. This is what keeps me going! What’s the funniest or most embarrassing moment you’ve experienced while filming one of your videos? On my video about my travels to Japan and the watches I’ve picked up along the way, I featured my wife in a scene that had her slapping me in the face. I wanted it to be real! We did several takes and every time it got more and more intense. My wife was reluctant to play the “mean wife” but it was worth it in the end as it ended up being an iconic part of the video. I promise my wife is the sweetest! What is something you want our readers to know about you?  This is the first time I’ve ever mentioned this publicly. The Clicky Bezel YouTube channel first started off as an ASMR channel focusing on ASMR from dive watches. It was a fun idea I had at the time when I was discussing with my watch industry friends. I’ve since made the videos private as it might make viewers uncomfortable if they aren’t familiar with ASMR. Should I make it public? @ClickyBezel What are your favorite brands right now?  Oof, this is a tough one, but the brands that come to mind are: Kurono Tokyo Zenith Vacheron Constantin and of course, Rolex What Brands should our readers look out for? Kurono Tokyo Minase Kuoe Citizen Universal Geneve IWC Zenith What are some of your favorite creators in your niche (besides yourself, of course!)?  These are all of my favorite watch YouTubers: @JenniElle @LumeShot @TheIronSnail (This is his personal channel but is a part of @TheoandHarris, a full-fledged watch channel) What first got you interested in your niche?  If we’re going way back, I always remembered seeing my dad and uncle wearing watches growing up. Eventually, their enthusiasm for watches grew on me, and I naturally began taking on the hobby. Only for me, I took it and ran with it. I’m still running. What’s your go-to EDC? I have around 50 watches in the collection, but the one that gets the most wrist time has to be my Rolex Oyster Perpetual reference 116000. It’s a silver dial and goes with practically any outfit and occasion. @ClickyBezel What’s your proudest moment since starting your creator journey?  I’ve experienced many proud accomplishments with the Clicky Bezel channel, but I have to say my proudest is a recent one. A legend in the watch industry by the name of Eric Wind of Wind Vintage (former Hodinkee contributor and Vice President, Senior Specialist for Christie’s), recently took notice of my shopping video in Japan and personally contacted me to collaborate on a few videos together on my channel. Stay tuned! What is your favorite place your social media account has taken you?  As of writing this, Japan. This was the first time I’ve dedicate a huge portion of my trip to creating content and working with watch brands in Japan. What is your most memorable moment with a brand in your niche?  Very early in my YouTube journey, I was fortunate enough to be contacted by several watch brands. One of which was a watch store in Korea operating under the name “Whatawatches” that offered enthusiast-level watches, as well as limited edition watches from watch brands like Laco, a German watchmaker. After working on a couple projects with Whatawatches, my wife and I decided to give them a surprise visit at their headquarters in Gangnam, Korea where the CEO greeted us with such gratitude and hospitality. Daniel Kim, the CEO, told us he was literally writing up an email to me regarding another collaboration right when his assistant informed that “Mr. Clicky Bezel” was out in the front. Not only was the surprise visit delightful, it ended up being productive as well! @ClickyBezel Any other information you want our readers to know?  I’m based out of San Francisco. If you ever find yourself in the bay and feel like talking watches, feel free to reach out and let’s make it happen!",
