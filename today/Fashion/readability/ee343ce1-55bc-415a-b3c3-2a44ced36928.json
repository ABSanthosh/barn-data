The two kicked around the small beach town of Santa Teresa, on the western coast, for more than a month before laying eyes on each other.When they did, there were sparks but few words. At a dinner with mutual friends, Ms. Baroni, who is from Italy, was immediately intrigued by the handsome, curly-haired American. Shared glances prompted Ms. Baroni to pivot from English, of which she knew just a few words, to Spanish, in which she was fluent. Mr. Keating spoke Spanish passably, so it was in that language that they shared stories about how their paths had crossed.Ms. Baroni, 27, grew up in Liguria, Italy. After earning a bachelor’s degree in modern languages and cultures for business and tourism from the University of Genoa, she worked as a sales manager for a company that made biodegradable bags. But during the pandemic, she became hooked on surfing, and by the end of 2021, had bought a one-way ticket to Costa Rica and settled in Santa Teresa, which is known for its superb year-round waves.At the time, Mr. Keating, 31, was a self-described surf bum. “I lived simply, or, you could also say, in poverty,” he said jokingly. In Santa Teresa, he shared a home with several roommates and swarms of mosquitoes; to thwart the insects, he slept inside a tent set up in his bedroom. A skunk bedded down in the kitchen sink. “It kept the rodents out, so we let it stay,” he said.Mr. Keating spent his childhood in Oceanside, Calif., a small Southern California beach town. He played baseball for Vanguard University, earning a bachelor’s degree in business administration and a master’s in organizational psychology. He then pursued a career in modeling and acting. He appeared in a commercial for Mountain Dew and was cast in the reality dating show “FBoy Island” in 2021. He was booted off in the fourth week.By late 2021, he was delivering refrigerators to college dorm rooms and dreaming of a different life. “I wanted to surf with cool people, have a family and find meaningful work,” he said. He packed his 1985 Nissan truck with donated baseball equipment and set off for Costa Rica. During the five-week road trip, he gave the baseball gear to children in Nicaragua.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
