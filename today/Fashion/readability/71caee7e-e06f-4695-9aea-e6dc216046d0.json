  "description": "This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here.The best holiday gift for your loved one with a pet is something relating to their pet. You likely already figured this out, as having a pet is a major part of, if not their whole personality. I say this because that’s very much me: My life revolves around two 11-lb. Chihuahuas that I would do anything for, and the gifts I’m most excited to receive are those that are either for them or about them. (Their sweater collection is way better than my own, I must admit.) So, I’ve curated some of the most delightful products on the market right now for the dog owner, cat owner, or simply animal lover on your shopping list.   All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
