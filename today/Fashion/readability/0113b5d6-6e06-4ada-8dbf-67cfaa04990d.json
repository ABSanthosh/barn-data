  "text": "Is it just me or has everyone's skincare routines doubled in steps over the last few years? I, too, fell victim to the 10-step skincare routine filled with serums, devices, and creams in 2024, but I'm vowing to shorten that routine without sacrificing effectiveness. In my search for products to achieve glowing, hydrated skin, I've noticed some of my favorite content creators using Olay's viral Cleansing Melts—and their skin has never looked or felt better.Olay's Cleansing Melts are water-activated facial cleansers that clean, tone, and refresh the skin for a deep yet gentle cleanse. To use them, you start by running each small, travel-sized pad under water for three seconds to dissolve it. Then, you rub your hands together to create a rich, creamy lather, massage the product into your skin, and rinse as normal. It takes care of three steps and leaves your skin perfectly primed for the Olay Super Serum ($35) that we all know and love. I know this sounds too good to be true, but just wait until you see the results. I enlisted two creators, Ahlam Yusuf and Meghan Currie, to show us why we should be upgrading (and downsizing) our skincare routines in 2025. I won't spoil the ending, but they make a strong case below.THE PREPAhlam's everyday skincare routine: \"As a busy mom, I'll admit my skincare routine often gets skipped because, by the end of the night, I just don't have the energy for multiple steps. That's why I love Olay Cleansing Melts. They simplify everything into three easy steps—soak, activate, and wash—while still giving me a deep clean. It's quick, effective, and perfect for my schedule.\"Ahlam's skincare green flags: \"I always look for products that are gentle on my skin but still effective. I check for clean ingredients, no harsh sulfates, and whether it balances oil without drying me out. Bonus points if the product has a clever design or makes the routine more enjoyable like Olay Cleansing Melts, which lather beautifully and are fun to use.\"THE RESULTSAhlam's skincare testimony: \"What sets Olay Cleansing Melts apart is their 3-in-1 formula. It cleans, tones, and refreshes without leaving my skin feeling tight. The lack of sulfates and harsh preservatives is a huge plus, and the melts are so easy to use. I also appreciate the travel-friendly packaging that doesn't take up too much space. The Cleansing Melts are proof that effective products can still feel luxurious, even on a busy schedule.\" Olay Cleansing Melts + Hyaluronic THE PREPMeghan's everyday skincare routine: \"I like to keep my everyday skincare routine pretty simple and most importantly quick! I hate to admit it, but I'm a bit lazy when it comes to skincare, so I like to stick to the classics—cleanser, hydrating toner, moisturizer.\"Meghan's skincare green flags: \"My number one green flag when it comes to skincare products is if it's a brand I trust. If a brand was always on my mom's vanity growing up, I know I can trust it. I have a distinct memory of my mom using her Olay moisturizer every night before bed, and now I also use Olay every night before bed.\"THE RESULTSMeghan's skincare testimony: \"I'm obsessed with watching the skin-fluencers post their 10-step nighttime routines, but I still stick to my little three-step routine. My typical 'get unready' routine starts with taking off my makeup with my Cleansing Melts. I've been loving the hyaluronic acid melts lately. The Cleansing Melts are unlike any other product I've tried. I'm convinced they were created for lazy girls like me—cleanse and tone in one step? I'm sold. I always get the random itch to take off my makeup mid-day, so keeping a few cleansing melts in my purse has been a game changer. The products are simple and gentle, yet effective. My skin loves them!\" Olay Cleansing Melts + Hyaluronic Aniyah Morinia is an NYC-based associate beauty and fashion editor at Who What Wear.

I hate to admit it, but I\u0026#39;m a bit lazy when it comes to skincare, so I like to stick to the classics—cleanser, hydrating toner, moisturizer.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeghan\u0026#39;s skincare green flags: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#34;My number one green flag when it comes to skincare products is if it\u0026#39;s a brand I trust. If a brand was always on my mom\u0026#39;s vanity growing up, I know I can trust it. I have a distinct memory of my mom using her Olay moisturizer every night before bed, and now I also use Olay every night before bed.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-results-6\"\u003eTHE RESULTS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1920-80.jpg.webp 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1600-80.jpg.webp 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1280-80.jpg.webp 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-768-80.jpg.webp 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-415-80.jpg.webp 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-360-80.jpg.webp 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-320-80.jpg.webp 320w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)\"/\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-320-80.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Creators test Olay Cleansing Melts\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1920-80.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1600-80.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1280-80.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-768-80.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-415-80.jpg 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-360-80.jpg 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i-320-80.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8S3wGoo8FTdQ4zkYwCHR5i.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMeghan\u0026#39;s skincare testimony: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m obsessed with watching the skin-fluencers post their 10-step nighttime routines, but I still stick to my little three-step routine. My typical \u0026#39;get unready\u0026#39; routine starts with taking off my makeup with my Cleansing Melts. I\u0026#39;ve been loving the hyaluronic acid melts lately. The Cleansing Melts are unlike any other product I\u0026#39;ve tried. I\u0026#39;m convinced they were created for lazy girls like me—cleanse and tone in one step? I\u0026#39;m sold. I always get the random itch to take off my makeup mid-day, so keeping a few cleansing melts in my purse has been a game changer. The products are simple and gentle, yet effective.

She\u0026#39;ll never pass up the opportunity to uncover an NYC hidden gem or mix and mingle with her friends (all while swapping holy-grail products, of course).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
