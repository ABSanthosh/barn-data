Here is what it is like to navigate the big opportunities – and impossible demands‘She was sitting at the kitchen table, eating raw cauliflower. For dinner.” It’s September 2024 in London and my friend is reflecting on her time sharing an apartment with fellow models in Paris the previous year. I am grimly amused, but unsurprised. This is the type of story models are always telling.I would know, because I became a model at 21 – quite late, by industry standards – and have walked in several London shows, as well as fittings, showrooms, campaigns, editorials, lookbooks and e-commerce for brands such as Moncler, Lacoste and Toni \u0026 Guy. Since I started, I have tried to build a thick skin to protect myself against rejections from castings and call-backs, as well as the ubiquitous skinny body standard. But when I get selected for a show, there is always the underlying fear that perhaps I took it too far – that I lost too much weight again. Because an overwhelming proportion of models are, as they have always been, very thin. Continue reading...",

And now he knows his way around the White House too – the US seat of power that is all too welcoming for sexual predators. Visiting the American capital this week, McGregor met Donald Trump in the White House on Saint Patrick’s Day, wearing an outfit that had the markings of a man after the president’s own heart: a three-piece pinstripe suit.Trump loves a suit, so you can also easily imagine that the New York tycoon in him loves a Gordon Gekko-esque pinstripe. McGregor’s meeting was strongly condemned by Ireland’s taoiseach, while an Irish rape crisis charity described it as “sinister”. But, with his sartorial choices, McGregor showed himself to be the latest Trump loyalist with a penchant for a strong-lined suit. Continue reading...",

H\u0026M has long been a big player in this space, and its spring/summer 2025 collection proves why.“We wanted to offer exceptional pieces that bring energy and light,” said H\u0026M’s womenswear design lead, Eliana Masgalos, in a press release. “A sense of escape felt very relevant: We wanted to play with a beautiful bohemia, rock icons, and festival freedom.”This vintage-inspired drop is the first of two, and features “classic rock ‘n’ roll staples” like lace-up shirts, laser-cut mini skirts, studded blazers, and snakeskin accessories. (While they’re all desert-ready, many styles are also versatile and appropriate for other spring activities, like parties and cocktail hours.) To further get you in that festival mindset, H\u0026M tapped Tyla and FKA Twigs — both of whom will be performing at Coachella next month — to lead the campaign. Read on to shop the dreamy and nostalgic styles starting at 10 a.m. EST. And if you haven’t gotten your hands on them already, make sure to also check out H\u0026M’s Studio collection, The White Lotus capsule, and upcoming Magda Butrym collaboration. DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M Spring Dresses Inspired by both the ‘70s and ‘90s, you can find a mix of romantic flowy maxi dresses (very Stevie Nicks) and edgy leather minis (more Courtney Love). Available in a range of neutrals and snakeskin prints, they can fit into anyone’s wardrobe — or blend into the landscapes of your next festival. DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M Spring Tops \u0026 Outerwear From ribbed-knit tunics and lacy button-downs to ruffled blouses, the tops in this collection have a whimsical element that blends the vintage with the modern. There are also leather blazers and bomber jackets (perfect for a rock festival), as well as trendy butter-yellow outerwear (perhaps for a bubblegum pop concert). DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M Spring Skirts, Shorts \u0026 Pants While white bottoms aren’t ideal for a muddy outdoor concert, they are a spring and summer staple. Try a ‘70s-esque wide-leg jean with front patch pockets, zip-up seams, and studded sides — or perhaps one of the ultra-mini skirts that feel very Y2K. DashDividers_1_500x100 H\u0026M Spring Accessories Top off your festival look with totally-rad jewelry, aviator sunglasses, slouchy handbags, and more fun accessories. Look out for chunky resin rings and statement pendant necklaces. And, depending on the occasion, slip into a pair of fringe heels or snakeskin mules.

Calling all Western fashion lovers: Zara’s latest Studio collection drop for spring/summer 2025 is full of boho-inspired styles that’ll have you dreaming of a trip to the desert. Photographed by Steven Meisel, the “On The Road” campaign captures the “spirit of joyful adventure,” according to a press release, meant to mirror the inspiration for the collection: “rugged beauty and the American Southwest landscape.” The assortment immediately transports us to a carefree Colorado state of mind — or to a desert festival like Coachella with its studded shorts, fluttery-sleeve dresses, and tie-front vests, adorned with patchwork lace, paisley prints, and snakeskin. But the accessories are the real star of the show: gladiator sandals, layered necklaces, and fringe belts with a vintage flair are the perfect finishing touch to your outdoor concert look. (It’s never too early to start planning for the Cowboy Carter tour.)Below, shop the sought-after Zara Studio collection, which ranges between a $30 pair of panties and a $500 suede dress coat, now.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara SS25 Studio Collection Dresses The boho-inspired dresses predominantly come in maxi silhouettes — think flowy button-down frocks and spring-ready slips that are appropriate for al fresco dinners and casual weddings alike. There are also some fluttery minis in the mix that would complement any vacation wardrobe.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara SS25 Studio Collection Matching Sets Whether you’re looking for a modest matching blouse and maxi skirt, a skin-baring criss-crossed bralette and mini short set, or an elevated duster coat and trouser duo, this collection has effortlessly chic separates for everywhere from the office to the festival. DashDividers_1_500x100  Zara SS25 Studio Collection Shoes \u0026 Bags Style your look from head to toe with Zara Studio’s lineup of handbags, shoes, and accessories. Look out for spacious work-appropriate totes and on-trend fringe styles. To really lean into the laidback look, try a lace-up sandal or a studded slingback. DashDividers_1_500x100 Zara SS25 Studio Collection Jewelry \u0026 Accessories Top off your outfit with chunky mixed-metal pieces that’ll jingle and jangle with every move. (Think door-knocker earrings, layered chain necklaces, and charm rings.) There are even body-chains that you can style under bralettes and vests for a sparkly surprise or over dresses and blouses for a statement.  Shop full Zara Studio collection Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lewis-hamilton-fashion-outfits-49193195",
    "description": "There's no doubt about it, Lewis Hamilton is a driving force in the world of fashion. The Formula 1 driver has become almost as famous for his love of bright, bold, and eccentric outfits as he has for his many championship titles, and there's no sign of him putting the brakes on his wardrobe choices anytime soon. With a number of races under his belt this season, Hamilton has regularly been spotted in the paddock wearing an array of looks that put him in first place in the fashion stakes. Notably, he did so before it became a trend among athletes as fashion pages dedicated to driver style like F1 Paddock Fits can attest. The 40-year-old has regularly discussed his personal style, which often includes a mix of emerging, diverse designers and pieces from larger fashion houses. In a previous interview with Vogue, Hamilton said: \"[F]ashion is about freeing yourself - it's about self-expression; it's about you; it's about slowly, over time, evolving and learning more about yourself and what you like and how you want to show up - how you want to be seen. What makes you feel great? It's a great feeling when you put on a piece of clothing and throw your shoulders back and are just like: I feel great today. That's what fashion does.\" Hamilton works with stylist Eric Mcneal; is conscious of the environmental impact of fashion; and is constantly striving to promote more diversity, both within motorsport and the fashion industry. He's cohosting the Met Gala in May 2025 and he's a fitting choice for the theme \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" which celebrates the history and enduring impact of Black dandyism. When the famed driver attended the Met Gala in 2021, he used his platform to invite three emerging Black designers to his table (Theophilio, Kenneth Nicholson, and Jason Rembert of Aliétte).
