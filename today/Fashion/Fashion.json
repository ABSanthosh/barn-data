    "description": "As much as we love diving headfirst into the latest fashion trends, there’s no denying the magnetic pull of a matching sweatsuit or lounge set. They’re cozy, they’re comfy, they’re cute — and, when made with quality and care, they’re built to last. Plus, the versatility. Toeing the line between sporty athleisure and polished co-ords, sweatsuits are the ultimate shortcut to looking casual yet put-together. Throw one on when you can't be bothered to style an outfit. Or default to your favorite when tackling a week’s worth of chores in a few hours. Working remotely and need to feel slightly more “dressed” than your pajamas? Problem solved. And on travel days? Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: You can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered. Ahead, discover 18 top-quality, stylish sweatsuit sets from retailers we love and trust. Whether you’re looking for lightweight short sets and breathable cotton co-ords for warm weather or weighty and more structured layers for indoor hibernation mode, you’ll find your new go-to right here.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

    "description": "As shopping editors, we know all the best secrets for navigating Nordstrom's site to find standout styles (and even better deals). It's our job to uncover top-rated products, and Nordstrom certainly doesn't disappoint. Right now is a great time to score some of the brand's most popular pieces at prices you'll love - especially the ones on sale. If you find yourself in the market to update your closet with a new clothing item or even a top-rated pair of shoes, we have more than a few suggestions. We've curated products that are not only trending, but included in our own personal favorites as well, with many being highly discounted. Below, we've laid them all out for you - because, after all, what are shopping fairy godmothers for? Nordstrom recently released tons of new products under $50 to the sale section that are sure to sell out quickly, plus a few cult-favorite pieces that are hard enough to find in stock. From a top-rated swimsuit to stylish dresses and editor-loved sunglasses, these pieces are designed to live in your closet for the longterm - even as they endure multiple trend changes and TikTok aesthetics. Check out the best Nordstrom clothes and accessories that customers are currently loving from the retailer ahead, and buy them before they're gone.",
