    "description": "In the president’s second term, it’s out with the quiet decorum of the Bidens and in with loud American bling. What do the big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos promise for the future?The age of Donald Trump is an assault on the senses. There is a brutish grandeur to a president who, in his heavy, shoulder-padded Brioni suits, looks like a buffalo painted by Holbein. Geopolitics has been warped into a Lord of the Flies fever dream, presided over by a bronze face-painted playground bully. Bedazzled cowboy hats and Maga caps, YMCA and raised fists, speak of a culture with the volume dial turned up. Just as power has been cut free from responsibility, so has prestige been unchained from taste. Trump 2.0 feels like a Space Mountain ride with no safety bar – and it is just getting started.Fashion speaks loudly in this new world. Two weeks into the second Trump term, power dressing already has a new look. Out with the careful patrician decorum of the Bidens, in with a novel era of American bling. The cultured metropolitan allure of the Obamas is a distant memory, overlaid with bright lights, big hair, vulgar slogans and expensive logos. Elon Musk’s preposterous flight jacket. Melania Trump’s strange hat. Lauren Sánchez’s inauguration-day lingerie. It is, as the kids say, a lot. Continue reading...",

    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Tarnish-free gold jewelry sounds like the ultimate cheat code — pieces that won’t fade, dull, or turn your skin green, no matter how much you wear them. But do they exist on a budget? The short answer: kind of. Unless you’re investing in solid gold (which is expensive), no jewelry is completely resistant to wear over time. But thanks to smarter materials and better plating techniques, you can get long-lasting shine without the hefty price tag. “‘Tarnish-free’ means the jewelry is resistant to discoloration from air, moisture, or skin oils,” explains Jennie Yoon, founder and CEO of Kinn Studio. “While no jewelry material is completely immune to wear over time, tarnish-free pieces are designed to maintain their original appearance for much longer.” The key? High-quality base metals, thicker gold layers, and protective coatings that help plated pieces hold up to daily wear. One of the biggest game-changers in affordable jewelry is physical vapor deposition (PVD), a high-tech plating method that makes gold layers tougher, thicker, and more resistant to fading. “Recent advancements like PVD coating, thicker micron plating, and anti-tarnish treatments allow us to create beautiful, long-lasting pieces at a price point that is accessible to more people,” Yoon explains. But longevity isn’t just about the plating method — it also comes down to how you wear and care for your jewelry. “Avoid exposure to water, sweat, and chemicals like perfumes or cleaning products,” Yoon advises. “Storing your pieces in a cool, dry place and cleaning them with a soft cloth can make a huge difference in keeping them looking new… A well-made piece of plated jewelry can last for years with proper care.” So what’s the difference between gold plating, vermeil, and solid gold? Gold plating is the most affordable, but it’s also the least durable — just a thin layer of gold over brass or stainless steel. Vermeil is a step up, with a thicker layer of gold over sterling silver, making it more resistant to tarnishing. And solid gold? That’s literally the gold standard for jewelry that stays pristine forever — but at a cost. Ahead, we’re breaking down the best tarnish-free gold jewelry brands for everyday wear — whether you’re looking for an investment piece, fun heart-shaped design, or an everyday go-to that won’t quit. Jenny Bird Every fashion insider knows that Jenny Bird delivers the sculptural hoops, chunky chains, and sleek cuffs that instantly pull a look together. R29 editors, including fashion director Irina Grechko, swear by the brand for pieces, including the water-durable collection, that can handle nonstop wear. Crafted from recycled 14K solid gold and ultra-durable stainless steel, these essentials bring the statement without tarnish or green marks.  Mejuri By far one of the most beloved jewelry brands, Mejuri makes some of the best everyday jewelry — from delicate and sparkly to bold and lustrous. With a commitment to 95% recycled gold, the brand blends sustainability with durability, offering everything from solid 14K gold designed for nonstop wear to 18K gold vermeil layered over sterling silver for long-lasting shine. Whether you’re finally splurging on that investment piece or adding to your daily stack, these designs are made to go the distance. Kinn Kinn is redefining modern heirlooms with fine jewelry crafted to stand the test of time. With solid gold as the foundation — the ultimate standard in tarnish-free wear — and high-quality vermeil built for longevity, these pieces are designed to be worn daily rather than saved for special occasions. “Balancing affordability with quality requires a commitment to using high-quality materials, such as sterling silver bases for vermeil or thicker gold plating,” explains Yoon. The result? Investment-worthy staples that won’t lose their luster, whether you wear them for years or pass them down for generations. Missoma From bold, trendy statements to timeless classics, Missoma has made demi-fine jewelry a must-have. Designed in London and handcrafted for stacking, the brand delivers chunky chains, sculptural hoops, and stackable rings in recycled 18K gold vermeil, gold plating, and sterling silver. Covetable collaborations with fashion notables like Lucy Williams and Harris Reed — as well as an appearance in the Barbie movie — only add to its cult status. And for those ready to invest? The Missoma Fine collection elevates bestsellers in recycled 14K solid gold and diamonds — classic, with a twist. Catbird The purveyors of all things teensy, delicate, and just left of center, Catbird makes cool person jewelry — the kind you collect, stack, and never take off. Designed in Brooklyn and crafted with over 95% recycled 14K solid gold and recycled diamonds, the brand’s whisper-thin rings, glimmering chains, and tiny starry diamonds won’t tarnish, fade, or lose their glow. Catbird also practically invented the stacking game — and changed jewelry again with its Forever Bracelet, a clasp-free solid gold chain custom-fitted and welded directly onto your wrist for a seamless, always-on look that’s become a signature of the effortlessly cool. Monica Vinader Monica Vinader reimagines fine jewelry through the lens of fluid, organic shapes and nature-inspired textures, resulting in pieces that feel both effortless and quietly striking. From sculptural pearl drops and softly contoured gold bands to gemstone beaded bracelets with molten-like detailing, each design embraces natural irregularities that set it apart.

    "description": "We don't know about you, but we're currently in our football era - and it's all thanks to Taylor Swift. Ever since the pop superstar made her surprise appearance at that fateful Sunday Night Football game last year, we've found ourselves hyper-focused on the football season more than ever before. Sure, the games themselves are entertaining - when you've got generational talents (and TikTok-loved players) like Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow all in the league, you can bet some pretty high-stakes showdowns will take place. But perhaps even better than who's playing on the field is who's showing up and showing out in the stands - especially when the talent is Ms. Swift herself. The 2025 Super Bowl is set to take place this Sunday, Feb. 9, at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans; the Kansas City Chiefs will face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, marking the second time in three years that the two NFL teams have competed against one another for the championship title. The Super Bowl matchup will feature some of the league's most prominent stars, including none other than Swift's boyfriend, three-time Super Bowl-winner and tight end Travis Kelce. And with Swift's attendance for the game seemingly confirmed to People by Kelce's brother, Jason, NFL fans (and Swifties alike) have even more to get excited about. The musician's presence became a fixture at NFL games last season. From creating touchdown-celebration handshakes with Brittany Mahomes to chatting up Donna Kelce with a vodka cranberry cocktail in hand, Swift appears to be leaning all the way into her WAG era - and inspiring a whole new legion of fans to obsess over the game (or at least tune in to see what she's wearing). Whether you're a dedicated NFL viewer looking to embrace the Swift x NFL crossover or simply a loyal Swiftie hoping to love the sport just as much as the singer, you can conquer the upcoming Super Bowl LIX in style with these game day outfits - all of which are inspired by Taylor Swift's outfits, no less. From her favorite red lipstick to logo sweaters with \"NFL (Taylor's Version)\" printed across the front and other stylish football outfits that play into this iconic crossover between sports and pop culture, here's what to wear to wear to a football game with a Swiftie-inspired twist.",
