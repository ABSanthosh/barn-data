    "description": "It offers the silhouette of a vest top but with more structure and looks good when you layer (just don’t use a cardie)What with being neither a page boy nor a snooker player, I had not given much thought to waistcoats until recently. I guess I thought of them as belonging to a wardrobe that didn’t concern me: a world of braces, cravats and flat caps. Of Guy Ritchie films, wedding rentals and carnation buttonholes.Well, I guess the joke’s on me now, because waistcoats aren’t novelty or naff any more. They are happening, and I need to get up to speed on how to wear them. The waistcoat has entered the fashion chat in the slipstream of the trouser suit. Women have been wearing them for decades, but until the last decade it remained a slightly niche move – not weird or eccentric, just a bit of a statement. It is only in the past few years that suits on women have become unremarkable. Continue reading...",

And there are plenty of outfits and glam moments to come from her time in Fiji. Working closely with stylist Emily Men with assistance from Karissa Loveday, Madix chooses summer-ready outfits that exude main-character energy, perfect to recreate if you're hosting a birthday dinner or even attending a fancy party.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-linen-pants-women?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When it’s too hot for jeans but you still want to wear pants, linen is the answer. Light, breathable, and blessedly low-maintenance, linen pants are the rare summer essential that checks every box: They’re comfortable in triple-digit heat, instantly pulled-together, and look just as good with a bikini top as they do with a blazer. Whether you’re braving a humid subway platform, wandering a weekend farmers’ market, or dressing for a European summer, linen pants are your one-and-done solution.This season, the category is quietly thriving. You’ll find exaggerated barrel-leg silhouettes as the heat-proof answer to everyone’s favorite jean, cargo styles with a utilitarian feel, and striped pairs that tap directly into the sardine girl summer and fisherman trends. Meanwhile, wide-legs — from drawstring and low-slung to sharply pleated — are everywhere, anchoring everything from office looks to beach outfits with equal ease. Black linen makes the case for warm-weather minimalism, while crisp white remains a forever staple for those devoted to versatile neutrals.Ahead, we’ve gathered the standout linen pants to wear now — tailored, slouchy, coastal-coded, and everything in between. The best part? They’re as cool as they look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Linen Barrel Pants This voluminous silhouette has touched all our wardrobe favorites — from jeans to travel pants and loungewear — and now it’s taking shape in linen fabrications. The result? Structured ease that feels trend-forward and heat-wave approved. Linen Cargo Pants Linen gives this utility classic a lighter, breezier feel. Oversized pockets and drawstring waists make these cargo styles equal parts functional and fresh. Wide-Leg Linen Pants Wide-leg linen pants are the silhouette of the season, offering ease, movement, and so much comfort. Try a low-slung drawstring style with a ribbed tank, or dress up a pleated pair with an oversized button-down. White Linen Pants Crisp white linen is a forever favorite that works for the office, beach days, and everything in between. Go wide-leg for extra drama or tailored for a polished finish. Linen Striped Pants Stripes are inherently summery, especially when paired with linen and a breezy silhouette. Channel coastal-core with a pair styled alongside raffia accessories and a fisherman sandal. Black Linen Pants If you’re committed to black wardrobe staples, linen is your summer loophole. Lightweight and clean-lined, black linen pants deliver sleek minimalism without the heat. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-cotton-underwear-for-women?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "There are a lot of cute underwear options out there — mesh, modal, barely-there lace — but when your skin is feeling sensitive, the humidity is at 90%, or you’re just trying to get through the summer day sans swamp, there’s really only one fabric that deserves the crown: cotton. Cotton underwear isn’t just the OG for comfort — it’s better for your body. The fabric is naturally breathable and soft on skin, making it a go-to for anyone prone to irritation or chafing. Unlike synthetics (looking at you, nylon), cotton doesn’t trap heat and, worse, moisture (which can lead to bacteria). That’s a big deal if you’ve ever dealt with discomfort or that not-so-fresh feeling after a long day in tight, non-breathable undies. In short: cotton keeps things cool and dry where it counts. That’s not to say you can’t wear whatever you want — your body, your rules. But if you’re looking to upgrade your underwear drawer this summer, with pieces that check both the cute and practical boxes, this edit is it. Every pick here is made from at least 70% cotton (with most in the 90%-to-100% range), so you’re getting all the benefits of breathability without compromising on style. From no-show thongs and comfy bikinis to cozy briefs, boyshorts, and easy cotton bras, we did the digging to find the softest, cutest, and highly-rated pairs. Cotton Thongs Ideal for no-show days, cotton thongs offer minimal coverage. These styles combine soft fabrics with a stay-put waistband for a comfortable fit that doesn’t dig or shift throughout the day. Cotton Bikini Underwear A reliable everyday option, bikini underwear features a mid-rise waistband and moderate back coverage. The breathable cotton construction helps reduce moisture buildup and irritation, making this a versatile pick for daily wear. Cotton Briefs Designed with a higher rise and full back coverage, briefs are a favorite for their secure fit and all-day comfort. In cotton, they feel soft against the skin and provide breathable support — ideal for those with sensitive skin or anyone seeking more coverage. Cotton Hipster Underwear Hipster cuts sit low on the hips with slightly more coverage than bikinis but less than briefs. These styles are great under mid-rise bottoms and offer comfort with enough stretch to move with you without riding up. Cotton Boyshorts \u0026 Boxers  With a wider leg opening and longer cut, boyshorts and boxers are a comfortable choice. Their smooth, non-binding silhouette helps prevent lines under loose shorts or flowy dresses — or work on their own as loungewear or sleepwear bottoms. Cotton Bras Cotton bras offer lightweight support and a softer, more breathable feel than many synthetic, underwire options. From unlined bralettes to lightly padded styles, these picks prioritize comfort without sacrificing shape or structure. Like what you see?
