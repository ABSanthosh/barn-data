When we’re shopping and see something we like, the first thing almost all of us do is look at the price. What with money not growing on trees and all that. If I see something nice in a shop, then check the tag and find it to be out of my budget (or just overpriced), I move swiftly on. By the same logic, if I spot a contender for this monthly roundup but then discover it’s prohibitively expensive – which happens a lot these days, “sticker shock” being a familiar syndrome in an era of fashion hyperinflation – I am not inclined to include it.But we can’t be sensible all the time. I don’t need to remind you that it’s better to buy fewer good, long-lasting things than loads of cheap tat. Then there’s the fact that, sometimes, an object is worth spending money on not because it’s objectively worth a lot of money, but just because it’s worth a lot to you. Plus, June is my birthday month, so you have to indulge me, OK? So, there’s a couple of splurges in here, should you be in the market for a dreamy dress or two.

    "description": "Plenty of \"And Just Like That\" spoilers are lurking below, FYI. You can't tell the story of \"Sex and the City\" and its revival/sequel \"And Just Like That\" without spending an inordinate amount of time discussing the fashion. Over the course of the original show's six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw became a universal style icon. She inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. Styled by the inimitable Patricia Field, Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) delighted in getting dressed. Her style was quirky, vibrant, romantic: she'd stop by McDonald's in a pink Oscar de la Renta frock or go wedding-dress shopping with a belt tied around her bare stomach. Throughout the series, as well as in the three \"Sex and the City\" movies that followed, Field and Parker set trends, launched design careers into the stratosphere, and created an endless stream of iconic looks. Now, the \"And Just Like That\" outfits aim to carry on that legacy. Image Source: HBO [Carrie Bradshaw] inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. With costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago on board, Carrie still enjoys fashion on \"And Just Like That,\" but the writers also use it as a mechanism to communicate her state of mind. When she wore a tulle skirt and black headpiece to Big's funeral in season one, it was to make her late husband proud. Later, as she started to date and feel like herself again, she was back in a Norma Kamali ruched blue dress that fit impeccably well; it's so quintessentially her that fans dubbed it the \"Carrie dress.\" Likewise, in season three, she steps out in a quirky Strawberry Shortcake-style hat that has the internet divided, much like that time she almost got married with a bird on her head. The message? Bradshaw is officially back and in her element (we hope). Image Source: HBO Fashion is obviously sacred to Bradshaw, but other characters have memorable style moments as well. Miranda Hobbes's colorful halter dress and Seema Patel's leopard look from season one could've been right at home in the original series. In season two, the characters dressed up to attend the fictitious, \"Veiled Beauty\"-themed Met Gala: Lisa Todd Wexley in a breathtaking red Valentino gown and Charlotte York Goldenblatt in a bold corset top and skirt. At times, their looks carry a greater significance. Think of Rock Goldenblatt's unconventional styling of their Oscar de la Renta dress as they prepared to share their gender identity with their parents in season one. Or Miranda's uncharacteristically sexy halter jumpsuit as she stepped outside a stale marriage to flirt with Che Diaz at the bar. In season three, Patel's impossibly chic white fringe dress proved she had no business scouting movie locations all day while Todd Wexley's quirky, oversize ball necklace is a nod to her penchant for thinking outside-the-box, a trait that clashes with her unimaginative documentary producers. Ahead, check out the best \"And Just Like That\" outfits so far - and shop the best fashion from season three.",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/megan-thee-stallion-dreamcon-anime-cosplay?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Megan Thee Stallion was on a mission as she scanned a room full of fans at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston: to find the best cosplaying hottie during the opening night of Dream Con. Dozens of attendees rushed to the front of the stage hoping that the costumes they spent hours—weeks and in some cases even months—putting together would catch her attention. The three-time Grammy-winning rapper hyped up a woman with an epic green wig who was dressed as Broly, a character from Dragon Ball Z. And she ran with open arms toward two other women dressed as characters from her favorite anime, My Hero Academia. Meg herself donned a purple wig and dressed as Yoruichi Shihouin from Bleach, one of the many times we’ve seen her cosplay. This time, she was greeted by thousands also in cosplay, cheering and chanting her name. “The hotties are making me feel so good! I feel right at home, babe,” she told host Storymode Bae after admitting she’d been nervous. And by “home,” she didn’t mean that solely because the convention and sold-out panel were in her hometown. After the fandom convention hosted by the popular streaming group RDCWorld announced Meg as the headliner, controversy followed. Social media users called out the organizers for engaging with posts in support of Tory Lanez. Some speculated that Meg would pull out of the convention altogether, even despite her tequila brand, Chicas Divertidas, being a sponsor. Others said the incident highlighted a broader issue: a hostile environment for Black women overall at Dream Con, where about 28,000 attendees were expected. Organizers issued an apology to the rapper on X: “We recognize that our actions contributed to a negative online environment, and we take full responsibility as we work toward fostering a more positive and respectful space.” Black women leading up to and at Friday’s panel held organizers’ feet to the fire and made sure that Meg felt celebrated and seen.  The misogynoir Meg faced isn’t unique. Black women and femmes in anime and gaming communities often face disrespect and criticism just for existing in the space. And like Meg, their balm for this hasn’t been to retreat from the hobbies they love, but rather to show up and show out. And they did just that at Dream Con 2025. Personifying their favorite heroes, villains, memes and more, Black women practiced boundless imagination and whimsical escapism. The convention also hosted numerous women-led panels. “I feel like being here is us contributing to a better culture so we can see other women that are like us like, ‘Hey girl, we see you, You don’t have to worry about the femcels and the incels and all those people who are trying to make you to be who you aren’t.’” said Bernette Fondong, a 28-year-old visiting from Atlanta. Fondong, who has been cosplaying for eight years, came dressed as Marvel’s Scarlet Witch. She attended with her friend Trisha Pilgrim, 28, from Maryland. As a nod to her queer identity, Pilgrim cosplayed as Emporio Ivankov, a gender-bending character in One Piece.  “I just really appreciate that Black women are creating that space and we’re coming out and we’re cosplaying and we’re just creating that space in spite of it all,” Pilgrim said. “We really know how to stand against adversity. I feel like we’re just making it a more accepting culture for women to feel more free in their cosplay and to show up and be here.” Even outside of the cosplay community, it’s long been considered taboo for Black people to lean into nerd culture. And though there’s been more visibility and acceptance in recent years, there are still few official spaces for Black nerds to gather en masse. For attendees experiencing their first anime convention, like Chantel Green, spaces like Dream Con attract a special energy. “My first animecon ends up being a Black anime con and it makes me really excited because Black nerds, we just weren’t seen,” said the 31-year-old from Detroit. She dressed as Persephone from Lore Olympus. “For me to come here, I feel truly blessed and I feel happy here.” Cosplay for Black women has also become an outlet for them to express their creativity with special makeup effects, stitching techniques and hairstyling. And it’s a steadily growing community. Alex Box, 28, was inspired to cosplay by her mother, a costume designer who worked on prom dresses and Princess Tiana gowns. The Houston native valued the bonding time she got to spend with her as she got guidance in making her Elphelt Valentine costume, which took four months to make.  Lanihya Duncan, a 27-year-old from Chicago who studied special effects makeup in college, got into cosplaying after her friend suggested it to her. Now at her second Dream Con, she took pride in her handmade Lulu from Final Fantasy costume, which took her two months to create. For Duncan, spaces like Dream Con allow Black weebs to not have to hide who they are. “Being Black, it can be hard for people to really show that because [of pressure to] fit in,” she said. “ But Dream Con is like no, you can be both. It’s amazing to embrace because Black cosplayers have that little umph that you can’t see. Who else is gonna be rocking braids, cornrows and afros with a Killua costume?” Gabrielle Kanu, a 35-year-old Houston native, said cosplaying feels “freeing.” Since 2016, she’s dressed as Sailor Moon, Storm and Sophie Hatter. This year, she’s Dorothy, giving a mix of The Wiz and The Wizard of Oz. “There’s no trying to codeswitch for anybody. We can be us all the time, every time. You can see the beauty and shapes of everybody around here. I’m a little plump and I’m glad I am and you see everyone else who’s glad of who they are,” she said “It’s kind of like being at an HBCU. It’s literally like a homecoming.” @_tarynitup Meg teased a new anime she’s making at #DreamCon ♬ original sound – Taryn Finley During Friday’s event, Meg also announced that she’s making an anime with Prime Video. Though she didn’t go into the details, she revealed that she collaborated with Boondocks producer and voice actor Carl Jones to create it. This marks a major stride for Black women behind the scenes in anime and opens up the genre for newcomers to dip their toe in. While it’s not on Black women to fix the sexism, homophobia and transphobia they encounter in alternative spaces — or in any spaces for that matter — there’s an intrinsic power we possess in showing up as we are in these types of spaces. For Meg, the public has witnessed her do that time and time again. “My proudest achievement is staying strong through adversity. I feel like a lot of people in my shoes would have gave up,” she said during the Q\u0026A. “The Hotties have my back.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Every May, Miami’s streets get an extra dose of vibrant colors, shimmering fabrics, and glistening skin as brands, models, influencers, and fashion lovers congregate for a celebration of swimwear and resortwear. And this year’s Paraiso Miami Swim Week was no exception — making a splash with every show and preview.From local Miami-based brands, like Luli Fama and Sigal, to up-and-coming LATAM brands presented by Vogue Mexico and many more, the runways featured new collections and trends to get excited about. Some still ring true from 2024’s swim week, like ombré sunset palettes, netted coverups, sparkles galore, and cowboy-styling touches. But we made sure to look out for fresh, unexpected trends that’ll have you standing out this summer.  A welcomed return of swim shorts, surprising fiery red statement pieces, unexpected resortwear cardigans, and countless other styles beckoned to us like sirens. Ahead, explore the top Miami Swim Week trends to elevate your own swim collection and inspire your summer vacation outfits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Under-The-Sea Designs \u0026 Clam Shell Tops Seashells and starfish and squids, oh my! From intricate beaded designs and 3D appliqués to fish prints and kitsch shapes, the under-the-sea theme (echoing on the same summer 2025 dress trend) was ubiquitous. French-inspired, Italian-made brand Oséree brought us Little Mermaid-approved clam shell-shaped necklines on one-pieces and dresses, while luxury London-based Oceanus showcased hand-embroidered seascapes across its swim and resortwear. Meanwhile, Florida’s Salty Mermaid gave a version with playful shell and palm tree patches on bikini tops.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Retro Swim Skirts \u0026 Shorts We were pleased to see a return of swim skirts and shorts, offering a retro touch that gives Americana or European Summer vibes, depending on styling. Since itty-bitty bottoms have become more prevalent, this extra coverage actually feels quite refreshing. Nearly every brand surprisingly showed swim skorts (or mini skirts over bikini bottoms), and a few like luxury Paris-based brand Leslie Amon, Instagram-able Florida brands Montce and Monday Swimwear leaned into the ‘70s hot pants look, all with matching tops. Try this trend if you’re hoping to have a nostalgia-tinged summer. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Transitional Swim Cardigans Yet another happy surprise was the influx of cardigans in the form of swim tops, coverup separates, and resortwear. Not quite the preppy staple you may be expecting on the sand, but brands made cardigans beach-ready via relaxed tie-front designs (Shan and Oséree) or with stones and shell-shaped hardware (Azulu and Leslie Amon). These styles are especially ideal for extra sun protection and for going from the pool to a restaurant without changing. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Fiery Red Amongst the expected sea of blues and sunset hues, on-trend butter yellows and pistachio greens brought extra joy. But it was the bright red swimwear that really popped from the rest. The mod-inspired collection from Azulu gave us matching sets, while chili-pepper-embroidered designs from Sigal diverged from its usual hand-painted prints. Cupshe also featured the bombshell color on swimwear, including some colorblocked with purple for even bolder looks. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Peek-a-Boo Thong Straps We were doing double takes all week as double-strap bikini bottoms appeared on the runways. From cleverly-placed waist cut-outs (Montage) to extra straps only visible from the back (Luli Fama), these styles gave the illusion of wearing two pairs of bottoms. Thong straps attached to, or peeking out from, low-slung coverups and lounge pants (Oh Polly) was also a popular version of the look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Creative Crochet Coverups \u0026 Appliqués Intricate crocheted pieces added extra texture to many collections this year. Of course, it manifested mostly through simple coverups, but elements like shimmering yarns, 3D crochet rosettes, and fish appliqués elevated them. Brands like Leslie Amon, Salty Mermaid, Oséree, and Cupshe even created full-on crochet bikinis or sets that featured crochet details on bra cups and bikini straps for an extra-special touch. DashDividers_1_500x100 Swimsuit Trend: Bold Cut-Out One-Pieces We’re all sure to have a hot girl summer like Megan Thee Stallion, who debuted her new swimwear brand by walking the show in a metallic one-piece swimsuit with a bold torso cut-out. Many brands similarly designed suits with multiple daring cut-outs, making for intriguing looks (and even more interesting tan lines). When you’re searching for a one-piece this summer, look out for these skin-baring details and low-back silhouettes that are also versatile enough to wear as a bodysuit for al fresco dinners, music festivals, and other summer activities.
