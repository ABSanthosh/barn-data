But do they keep you warm?• Don’t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereAs an arctic blast hit the UK this week, most of us turned to our trusty puffer jackets and woolly hats. Others dug out something a little more surprising from their accessories arsenal: a micro beanie.Worn high across the forehead, these bijou beanies are purposely rolled up by wearers, leaving their ears exposed to the elements. With roots in maritime and military settings – they were originally rolled up to avoid any obstruction to hearing – they are sometimes called fisherman or watch caps. But rather than being worn on the high seas, they are now sported by creative types in offices and coffee shops from London to Lancaster. Continue reading...",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If we had a dollar for every time we’ve seen sequins, velvet, or tassels in the last month, we’d be rich enough to buy every party outfit we ever wanted. Alas… Now that holiday invites are coming in thick and fast, we’re auditing our wardrobes (and wallets) for party-appropriate looks. Some of us will jump glitter-jeans-first into maximalist revelries, there are others who prefer less pomp and circumstance, and will seek quiet ways to celebrate the season in style. Just as no two parties are the same, there isn’t just one festive outfit formula” Whether you prefer a wide-leg pant over a swishy skirt or cozy sweaters over breezy halter tops, rest assured that no one’s expecting you to wear anything you don’t want to. Consider this your sign to push aside all your presumptions about holiday style and wear what truly makes you feel in the spirit of the season. Dress up the clothes you already have in your wardrobe, swap them out with friends, or invest in new pieces that you know you’ll wear again and again. Below, discover five alternative holiday party outfit ideas to try this year. Alternative Holiday Party Outfit: Floral Print While we tend to rule out floral prints for winter, we could all use a bit of sunshine during this long, dark season. Trade in your go-to sequins for a more versatile floral shirt and matching trousers, or a printed dress with tights and boots. FYI: A larger-scale graphic will look more wintry (and more formal) than a dainty one. Alternative Holiday Party Outfit: Burgundy Instead Of Red Burgundy is great when you want to dress on theme but can’t get on board with Santa Claus red. The dark red hue is much easier to style, even acting as a neutral. Opt for a one-and-done co-ord, and you’ll be sure to wear it long after the festive season is over. Alternative Holiday Party Outfit: Utilitarian Pairings Yes, your more utilitarian-feeling pieces can be dressed up for the holidays, too. Add a formal accent, like a cinched blazer and skinny heeled boots, to your camo cargo pants. The result is a smartly constructed, comfortable look that’s suitable for an after-work office party or dinner with friends. Alternative Holiday Party Outfit: Dressed-Up Track Pants If the occasion allows for it, glam-ify your coziest track pants for the ultimate cool-girl vibe. Style with an off-the-shoulder knit, slinky bodysuit, or sheer mini dress. The party power here is in your accessories: Stack on loads of jewelry, and pair with statement shoes or a sleek handbag. Alternative Holiday Party Outfit: Boxy Silhouettes Often the best thing about a holiday party is the food. Factor this into your clothing choices with boxy silhouettes, such as oversized jackets and tees, button-down shirts, and wide-leg trousers. When in doubt, throw on a pair of sparkly heels.

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While we're still a little over a week out from 2024's biggest shopping day, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that span the entire month of November and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans. Regardless of what you're in the market for, you can save big on it right now. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best early Black Friday fashion deals. Looking for something specific?
