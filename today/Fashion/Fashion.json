    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/dior-fall-winter-2025-show-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "While the show notes may have read “Autumn-Winter 2025-2026,” for its latest ready-to-wear collection presented at Paris Fashion Week, Dior went back in time. Taking inspiration from Orlando — Virginia Woolf’s novel about a character who turns from a man to a woman and lives over the course of three centuries — women’s creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri’s latest offerings took cues from Elizabethan and Victorian eras, while also revisiting the heritage house’s own historical past. Designed as a multi-act performance, the show featured five individual vignettes of looks — whose scene changes were made obvious by props that ranged from a swing and a “prehistoric bird” flying above the audience to craters descending from the sky and icebergs rising from the floors. (The soundtrack was equally wide-ranging, with models going from walking to moody instrumental music to “Room of Fools” by FKA Twigs.)  As expected from the literary source of inspiration, the collection explored the balance between the masculine and feminine with delicate ruffles and bustiers punctuating severe waistcoats, frilly collars peeking out from underneath leather jackets, and lace-up riding boots styled with lace bloomers.  But while there were plenty of literal references to the eras the novel was set in — notably, removable statement collars, pantaloons (don’t let go of those capri pants yet!), and shirting with decorative cuff and neck detailing — the collection was reimagined through a timeless lens. There were wearable trench coats, moto leather jackets, technical jackets, and shaggy outwear that were, rounded out by the type of red carpet-worthy dresses that the house is known for. (And beloved by Dior ambassadors like Natalie Portman who was in attendance). View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 (@refinery29) Fitting of a time-shifting novel, for the fall 2025 collection, Grazia Chiuri flash-forwarded from exploring fashion of centuries past to those of more recent decades, “want[ing] to revisit the memories and gestures that belong to Dior’s heritage,” according to the press release. This resulted in exaggerated shapes that played homage to Gianfranco Ferré, Dior’s designer in the ‘90s, and lace-adorned “J’Adore Dior” T-shirts made famous by John Galliano in the ‘00s. Ahead, the standout looks from the Dior Fall 2025 collections. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

Okay, it also means that spring is nearly here, but we’re especially excited about the return of another H\u0026M Studio drop.Refinery29 readers tend to gravitate towards (and help sell out) these drops, but if you’re unfamiliar with them, H\u0026M Studio releases bi-annual, limited-edition collections full of the retailer’s most fashion-forward and high-quality styles. And the newest one is full of power dressing designs for everywhere, from the office to the pool.“For SS25, we looked to the power woman and imagined her whole day — not just corporate life — because her strength and sense of style goes beyond the 9-to-5,” said H\u0026M Studio designer, Linda Wikel, in a press release. “She needs it all: tailoring, statement dresses, shirting, easy separates, and denim. But in a way that brings together gravitas and glamour.” The pieces are very clearly inspired by ‘80s corporate workwear, featuring sharp shoulder pads, draped blouses and dresses, pleated trousers, and square-toe loafers in many neutrals. But it’s also inspired by “the vibrant style of Miami and Los Angeles,” via high-cut swimsuits, shiny leggings, paper-bag jeans, underwater prints, and bold reds and lime greens, according to the brand.I got the chance to try some H\u0026M Studio samples ahead of this drop, and can attest to the versatility of the styles and quality of the fabrics, but would recommend sizing down from your typical size, especially in baggier, oversized designs like the button-down tops.The accessories may be our favorite part of the collection, though. From briefcase-inspired bags, angular heels, and silky knee-high socks fit for the office to statement earrings and metal-frame sunglasses ready to be shown off at poolside parties, this collection can literally style you from head to toe. The new collection will be available to shop on March 6 at 10 a.m. EST. Shop full H\u0026M Studio S/S 25 collection Like what you see?
