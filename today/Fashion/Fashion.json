    "description": "Are boxers the new beach dress? Are bermudas really back? And is wearing shorts to the office ever OK? Here’s how to prepare yourself for the great unveilingHappy shorts season. Not happy for everyone, though, is it? It’s probably not a stretch to say that for many of us, wearing shorts is up there with getting into a swimsuit or showing your feet for the first time that year. A watershed moment of dread that, unlike most scary things – eating out alone, caring what other people think – only gets worse as you get older.But it’s also summer, and sometimes only shorts will do. Plus, this year, there really is something for every leg. Culottes are back, except they’re structured and called bermuda shorts – and you can even wear them to work. So are 1970s sports shorts, if your summer reference is more Ridgemont High. It’s not unseemly to wear boxer shorts, especially if you’re on the beach, just try them in seersucker – or if you prefer the freedom of a skirt, how about a skort? Hate all shorts? Try jean-shorts or “jorts” – they’re better than they sound. Here is a foolproof guide to getting over shorts fear. Continue reading...",

I stretch, go downstairs, fill a bowl with iced water and, the theme of Transformers playing in the background, write my journal (a list of emails-I-forgot-to-reply-to). I drink hot water with cider vinegar to regulate my blood sugar levels, followed by tea using the baby’s leftover milk. Dragging a chilled jade gua sha spoon across my face in an attempt to reverse the ageing process, I then make my young sons’ porridge. While they eat, I plunge my face into the iced water until I can’t breathe, and begin my three-step routine (two La Roche-Posay serums followed by SPF). Some mornings, I run. Others, I cry into a coffee, albeit one made with organic milk, before taking a mushroom gummy to take the edge off the day. My partner and I divide childcare dropoffs – we’re late for both and broadly OK with that – and each have one day a week with the youngest.This is my routine. You might think it’s elaborate and weirdly specific, and you’d be right. Yet we live in an age of routines shared online, often in pursuit of some sort of personal optimisation – I’m aiming for somewhere between writing 2,500 words before breakfast (Anthony Trollope) and 5am cold plunge (fitness guru Ashton Hall). And however elaborate my morning seems to you, to me, it is nothing compared with the pernicious routine of the tradwife. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/addison-rae-style-summer-outfits?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Just as Charli XCX predicted at the end of her Coachella 2025 set, we’ve entered “Addison Rae summer” — a not-too-far departure from 2024’s brat summer. And like Charli, the TikTok star turned pop sensation — who wants to go by her mononym after the June 6 release of her self-titled album Addison — has a fashion sense that’s just as distinctive as her music projects.From itty-bitty denim shorts and round-toe pump heels to cropped graphic T-shirts and lingerie-as-outerwear outfits, Addison’s retro style is Britney Spears-coded with apparent influences from Lady Gaga, Lana Del Rey, Madonna, and Marylin Monroe — all of whom she names in her song “Money Is Everything.” The 24-year-old has a knack for Y2K-meets-Old-Hollywood dressing. And it’s inspiring our own summer outfits.If your hot weather style involves laidback, mismatched (and somewhat chaotic) looks, we promise that you can achieve a look that’s more Addison Rae and less Adam Sandler. So if you’d “rather get high fashion” and “get a taste of the glamorous life,” read on for the top summer must-haves to channel the “Aquamarine” singer. (Spoiler: pearls are involved.) Then, all that’s left to do is crack open a Diet Pepsi and “put your headphones on.”  DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Low-Rise Jeans \u0026 Shorts View this post on Instagram A post shared by Addison (@addisonraee) In true Y2K fashion, Addison is known for wearing low-rise jeans and mini shorts as everyday outfits and music video costumes. She specifically called out a pair of low-rise Lucky shorts as a staple in a recent GQ interview. On sweltering days, consider a pair of denim cutoffs (preferably with frayed edges) and on cooler days or summer nights, consider low-rise jeans in a flared or bootcut silhouette. Pair them with a graphic tee or bralette depending on the occasion and how scandalous you’re feeling. DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Lingerie Sets The singer also told GQ that beautiful lingerie is non-negotiable, especially worn under casual outfits to spark a sexy energy and confidence throughout the day. In addition to her sultry 2024 VMAs custom lingerie look, it’s also a staple in her music videos like “Diet Pepsi” (a cone bra and matching bedazzled ensemble), “Aquamarine” (under a sheer outfit), “Fame Is A Gun” (in pink latex), and “Times Like These” (paired with fishnet tights). For your own Addison-inspired lingerie, opt for matching sets with balconette bras, sheer bralettes, and corsets to wear under see-through tops and dresses, or on their own paired with your favorite denim for summer festivals and pool parties. DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Pump Heels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Addison (@addisonraee) “Walk in the room, my high heels on, I strike a pose / Young, dumb, and cute, nothing to lose,” Addison sings on “In The Rain.” When she’s not barefoot, she’s wearing stiletto pumps (quite different to trending kitten heels, but reminiscent of Y2K pop star style). From performing onstage to running errands, she typically opts for Louboutins and round-toe heels. Look out for designs with retro details like peep-toe cut-outs and slingback straps, which are favored by the singer, and wear them everywhere from summer weddings to rooftop parties. DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Graphic T-Shirts Some of the looks that put Addison on the fashion map were her Y2K Paris Hilton-inspired street style ‘fits, all of which included kitschy graphic tees. From pointed phrases to faux sport jerseys, her T-shirts always make a statement — so much so that Troye Sivan recreated one of Addison’s paparazzi photos for Halloween, wearing a pink “Libra” cropped tee and black pumps, while reading Britney Spears’ memoir. Opt for playful graphics and cheeky phrases when shopping and putting together your casual, throw-on-and-go summer outfits.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Pearl Necklaces View this post on Instagram A post shared by Addison (@addisonraee) Elevate your everyday and eveningwear looks with a strand of pearls to have “the heart of the ocean around your neck,” like Addison suggests in “Aquamarine.” Her mermaid-chic style reigns during the summer, whether through red carpet dresses, shell-shaped purses, glimmering jewel tones, or lustrous pearls. Luckily, you don’t have to pay a fortune to get the look. We’ve curated a range of simple pearl chokers, layered strands, and pendant necklaces to channel Addison. DashDividers_1_500x100 Addison Rae Style: Sheer Dresses Sheer fabrics are a bold-yet-wearable summer dress trend that Addison does well — from donning see-through sequined gowns in the “Aquamarine” video, to wearing a fluttery tulle frock at Coachella that revealed her album release date on underwear that peeked through. The singer obviously loves skin-baring looks, declaring: “I know you like when I wear this dress, I feel best when I’m wearin’ less” on “Times Like These.” For your own wardrobe, try sheer lace, mesh, and sequined dresses worn over swimsuits, boy shorts, slip dresses, or even over pants for a Y2K touch. Then float on as the ethereal pop princess that you are. Like what you see?

    "description": "If we could live in our out-of-office beachwear all day, everyday, we probably would — especially when the mercury has spiked and humidity makes ‘real’ clothes all too uncomfortable. Think, whimsical, tiered midi dresses that resemble Victorian nightgowns, linen palazzo pants that don’t constrict your legs, extra floaty “feels like nothing” skirts… Basically, clothing that’s as easy and breezy as we wish our surroundings were.Crochet dresses are one of summer’s key staples — right alongside breezy linen and lightweight cotton dresses, matching sets, and the kinds of easy pieces you’ll reach for on repeat. This season, they feel especially fresh thanks to updated takes that span from open-knit minimalist styles to colorful, embroidered designs and classic swimsuit coverups.Designers have leaned into both playful and pared-back interpretations — from fisherman-inspired netting to checkerboards and artisanal, hand-knit textures that feel more refined than retro. Whether you’re channeling a coastal European summer vibe (think a headscarf, raffia bag, and sunglasses) or styling for city life, these dresses deliver.Toss one on with sneakers for weekend errands or sightseeing, ordress it up with thong kitten heels or your go-to sandals. Whether you’re headed to a party, a picnic, or on vacation, the crochet dress belongs in your warm-weather rotation. Ahead, some of our favorites. DashDividers_1_500x100 Crochet Mini Dresses Crochet minis are the definition of throw-on-and-go. Their lightweight feel and shorter hemlines make them ideal for hot days, while the textured finish adds polish. From beach plans to casual nights out, these styles bring personality and playful energy to your warm-weather lineup — and make a strong case for showing some leg. Crochet Midi Dresses The midi is a summer go-to for a reason — long enough to feel styled, breathable enough to keep cool. Crochet adds a tactile feel to this universally flattering length, making it perfect for everything from weekend hangs to backyard parties. Wear it with ballet flats for an easy, French-inspired look, or layer it with a lightweight blazer if you’re navigating the office-to-outdoor balance. Crochet Maxi Dresses If you’re leaning into the fisherman aesthetic or European summer vibe, the maxi is your hero piece. These longer silhouettes feel relaxed yet directional — ideal for beach days, travel, or just catching a breeze on a hot city afternoon. Pair with heeled flip-flops, stacked jewelry, and sunglasses for an unfussy finish that still makes an impact. Like what you see?
