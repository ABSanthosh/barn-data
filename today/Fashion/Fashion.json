    "description": "Her novel about being Anna Wintour’s assistant caused such a storm, she wished she’d never written it. As the story becomes a musical with songs by Elton John, the author reveals why the imperious editor hasn’t spoken to her sinceWhen Lauren Weisberger was 22 years old, she got the job that she would end up being famous for all her life. Having “literally never had a job beyond working in a frozen yoghurt place, with a bit of babysitting and lifeguarding”, but hoping to become a writer, she secured an interview to be assistant to Anna Wintour, then editor-in-chief of American Vogue. To the general horror of the Vogue office in New York, she arrived carrying her CV and writing samples in the sensible, dowdy leather briefcase her parents had given her as a graduation present. “I was fresh out of college – four years of studying and partying and wearing sweatpants all day long. I wasn’t into fashion, so Vogue was a completely foreign culture to me.” To everyone’s surprise, she got the nod.The role was “demanding and fast-paced and stressful and head-spinningly around-the-clock. I would wake up every morning to voicemails left overnight, endless tasks that all needed to be done right away.” This was 1999 and “Anna didn’t have a computer. As her assistants, we were her computers. And everyone in the office was tall and gorgeous and slender and totally obsessed with this world in a way that felt toxic to me. Every minute in that office felt like an emergency. I was just a kid. I went into survival mode.” Continue reading...",

    "description": "The trend for ‘duck lips’ is over and many people are seeking to reverse their cosmetic treatments – often with painful and disfiguring resultsIt was her wedding photographs that did for Grace Stewart’s dermal fillers. By the time the 32-year-old married her long-term partner in 2022, she had been getting fillers for three years – first in her jaw, in pursuit of “that snatched look”, and latterly in her lips, cheeks, nose and chin. One image in particular made her do a double-take: a side-on candid shot in which she is being swept up in a hug by a cousin. “It was this really lovely moment, but all you can see is my chin curling up and this bulky jaw,” says the Nottingham-based social media manager. “I now think: ‘My Lord, why did I do that to myself?’”Stewart did not get any further treatments in the two years after her wedding, but while hyaluronic acid filler is typically marketed as temporary – lasting up to 18 months – she couldn’t seem to shake the volume that had been injected into her jaw. So, this year, she made like Kylie Jenner, Courteney Cox and Molly-Mae Hague and had social media’s latest injection du jour: hyaluronidase, or dissolver. “I now know that there’s a reason why my face is the shape that it is. It’s not supposed to have this angle to it that doesn’t flow,” she says. “I feel so sad that I felt the need to adjust how I looked just to feel like the best version of myself.” Continue reading...",

Regardless of where you live or how brutal the winter weather can get, finding a coat to sport during the year's coldest months can be daunting - and often, pretty costly, too. Fortunately, there's Amazon. And as with most of our shopping antics, we always know that we can turn to the retailer to find stylish yet affordable fashion pieces, from rain boots to cozy and affordable sweaters and cold-weather workout clothes for the new season. And this year, winter coats and jackets are no exception! Cold gusts of wind and brisk temperatures are at our doorsteps - and naturally, we need to be prepared. If you aren't fully stocked up on cute coats and jackets for the upcoming season, now is the time to get shopping. Already, Amazon has built a pretty impressive selection of outerwear for winter and (bonus!) all at incredibly fair prices, too. We rounded up our favorite options for you to shop through, all in a variety of colors and styles.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/cozy-earth-bamboo-pajama-set-review-49281580",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy In order to make my sleep environment feel comfortable and luxurious, I went on a hunt for the most comfortable mattress, a supportive pillow wrapped in a silky pillowcase, and sheets that feel like a cloud. But the cornerstone of my sleep setup is always my pajamas. In fact, I've made it a habit to wear matching pajama sets to get my mind and body ready for bed. I've searched high and low for the most comfortable pair, but with my high standards, it took me so long to find the perfect PJs. I needed them to feel like butter on my skin, but also lightweight and breathable so that I could wear them all year long. And of course, they had to look cute. When I came across Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set ($156, originally $195), I was curious to see what the hype was about, especially since it was an item on Oprah's Favorite Things list two years in a row. My fellow editors raved endlessly about the brand's cashmere cardigan and bamboo sheets, so I had high hopes for these pajamas. Believe me when I say they did not disappoint. And right now, they're 20 percent off, so there's no better time to treat yourself and stock up on these luxe PJs. What I Like About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set is by far the best pair of pajamas I have ever owned. From the feel to the look, these exude luxury. But let's start with the texture and the fabric, since these are the standout details. The brand says the pajamas are made from viscose from bamboo, but the material might as well be described as \"slices of heaven.\" It's silky and smooth with cloudlike softness, with the ideal amount of slip that allows you to move around without friction. The fabric offers a bit of stretch and flexibility, too. The PJs are warm and cozy yet lightweight and breathable, meaning I can wear them through all seasons of the year. While a matching set will always appear polished, these PJs embody quiet luxury. The collar and contrast piping deliver a tailored look, while the flattering yet relaxed fit is perfect for achieving comfort. The fabric also drapes beautifully with minimal wrinkles, so you'll look elevated - even if your hair is disheveled and you're hungover. The long-sleeved button-down top is equipped with an elegant pocket that adds sophisticated flair. The bottoms have an adjustable-tie waistband, so you have a secure fit no matter how much you toss and turn at night. The Bamboo Pajama Set makes me excited to go to bed, so although it's an investment, it's one that you'll actually enjoy. Needless to say, it's really difficult to change out of these in the morning. What's Worth Noting About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set has a relaxed, slightly oversize fit, so you don't have to worry about sizing up. As someone who is 5'1\", an extra small fit just right, leaving me with some room. The brand offers both regular and tall sizing, too, especially if you need extra length for your arms and legs. The brand also recommends sizing down if you're in-between sizes. Although these pajamas have proven themselves to be quite durable, proper care and maintenance are never a bad idea to extend shelf life. The brand recommends machine washing on cold with a normal detergent and no fabric softener or bleach and to machine dry normally. I like to put them in the delicates or gentle cycle, just to be extra cautious. Who's the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Best For? Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set is best for everyone and anyone who wants to truly invest in their sleepwear. The luxuriously soft fabric is so gentle on your skin, and it is breathable and stretchy, so it's great for those who sleep hot or want something lightweight for bed. Whether you're a homebody who loves to indulge and takes their sleep pretty seriously, or you're shopping for a luxe gift for your loved one, these pajamas are a purchase you won't regret. Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Worth the Splurge? These pajamas are no doubt a luxury, treat-yourself type of purchase and are in no way a true necessity. However, if you're like me and you enjoy splurging on sleep must haves, these Cozy Earth pajamas are worth every penny. I have tried cheaper alternatives that have the same feel, but they simply aren't as long-lasting. In fact, most of the alternatives lose their softness after several washes and they start to pill, if not rip and tear. I've had pairs of Cozy Earth pajamas that I put through the wash at least 15 to 20 times, and they still look and feel brand-spanking new. Plus, the brand is so confident in the quality of these pajamas that they offer a 10-year warranty and a 100-night sleep trial. Additional Details: Cozy Earth's Stretch-Knit Bamboo Pajama Set is made from 95 percent bamboo-based viscose and five percent spandex. These Cozy Earth Pajamas come in four colors. The pajamas are available in sizes XS–XXXL, in regular and tall lengths. They have a slightly relaxed fit. The brand offers a 10-year warranty, a 100-night sleep trial, and free shipping. Where Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Available? The Bamboo Pajama Set is available on cozyearth.com, and a select few colors and sizes are available on Amazon.
