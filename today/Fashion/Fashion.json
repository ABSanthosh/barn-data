If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. The arrival of the holiday season means it’s time for the fun of all the festivities, and also for the less-fun accompanying question: What am I going to wear to all these festivities?  Sometimes, figuring out outfits for everything on your calendar can feel insurmountable, and doubly so if you’re a plus-size shopper. Even when it seems like all the stores are stocked with holiday-perfect pieces, they often stop at XL, leaving the majority of shoppers out in the cold. Fortunately, there are some great brands stepping up with cute options for occasions from cozy to formal. Ahead, outfit ideas from plus and inclusive brands you might not know about. Plus-size holiday look for a family dinner: Wray NYC metallic dress As lovely as it would be to wear soft sweats to every holiday dinner, sometimes the occasion calls for something a little more put-together. Whether you’re dressing to impress your possible future in-laws or just want to be the most stylish person at your family’s annual restaurant outing, this metallic maxi dress from New York designer Wray Serna hits the mark. Her label Wray NYC has a wonderfully inclusive size range (XXS-6XL), and its new party collection has some serious gems.  I was immediately drawn to this metallic number when I saw it online, and it’s even better in person. While it has a simple shine in photos, it actually has a beautiful purplish-blue iridescence in real life. That unexpected twist separates this style from the typical party dress, which I love. And, most importantly, despite looking dressy, this piece is very comfortable, with zero pinching or clinging (perfect for a big meal).  I paired it with blue-accented boots to highlight the pretty iridescent tones and to bring a little extra warmth for a cold December evening. This particular pair is a prior season from Eloquii, but the brand has some cool wide-calf options in stock now, too. Plus-size holiday look for a formal event: Amsale asymmetric neckline satin gown Navigating a formal dress code can be stressful, especially when many of the plus size “black tie” options on the market can skew a little sexier than you might want for a fancy wedding or a conservative office holiday party. Fortunately, storied bridal label Amsale now has a “Dresses” collection full of sophisticated eveningwear.  Despite its name, the Slouch Dress style lives up to Amsale’s reputation for elegant simplicity, striking a perfect balance for those hard-to-navigate functions with a draped high neckline highlighting a peek of shoulder. (As someone with a very full bust, a full-coverage neckline that doesn’t feel frumpy is basically a unicorn, so I’m impressed.) The bias-cut column skirt laid nicely and made me look taller, too. Indeed, I felt downright statuesque in this dress —- truly a feat, considering I’m 5’4”. My only quibble is that, in some poses, I noticed a bit of bunching at the hip, but nothing that would prevent me from wearing this style happily. (If you love this neckline as much as I do but are looking for something a little less formal, Amsale also offers it in a midi dress and a jumpsuit.)  For sizing, it’s smart to remember that Amsale is a bridal label first and foremost. (The brand’s late founder Amsale Amberra is widely credited with creating the modern wedding dress, and that’s reflected in its eveningwear size chart.) I was happy to see that eveningwear runs in sizes 00-28, but a look at its measurements shows that, by and large, they fall into standard bridal sizing conventions (i.e. your bridal size is usually 2 sizes up from your “street size”). With that in mind, I tried on two samples: my usual size 20, and my bridal equivalent, a size 24. This navy dress is the 24, and it fits almost perfectly right off the rack. (The 20 was too small on my bust, and a bit too snug throughout the waist and hips as well, so I recommend sizing up at least one size, or two if you have a fuller bust.) This style is offered in a broad range of colors, but some are made-to-order only or have limited sizing in stock, so, if you’re looking for a gown ASAP, check out every color you’d consider for the best chance of getting one sooner than later.  I accessorized with a pair of sleek champagne pumps by Joan Oloff, a podiatrist turned shoe designer. I’m constantly on the lookout for comfort shoes that don’t look like comfort shoes, so I appreciate that Oloff uses her specialized knowledge and incorporates orthopedic features into her designs. The angled heel on this pump is visually interesting, and the built-in padding and arch support make them much more comfortable than your average heel. Plus-size holiday look for a date night: Rachel Antonoff x Nuuly short sweater dress I always look forward to sweater dress season — what’s better than being both cute and warm? So when I saw Rachel Antonoff’s wonderfully weird swan Fair Isle version for Nuuly, I rented it immediately. It’s just the thing for a holiday date night or a friend group party where you want to look good. The red keeps it festive without being too on the nose (which also means you can wear it past the holidays), and the unexpected intarsia swan design makes it a great conversation piece. The soft turtleneck and thick knit make it cozy enough for cold winter nights, and the curve-hugging silhouette keeps it hot.  I styled it with sheer black tights, but if that is too much leg out for you, I’ve heard great things about Noosh’s fleece-lined tights, which mimic the look of bare legs and sheer black tights, but feel like a full legging. I added my go-to everyday black leather boots from Naturalizer’s newly extended wide-calf collection and one of my favorite vintage finds: this oversized leather jacket. I was warm even when the temperatures dropped after the sun set at 4:30 pm. (The joys of living on the eastern edge of the time zone!) Plus-size holiday look for a night out: Abercrombie sequin mini There’s something so chic about a fully sequined mini dress with a high neckline and sleeves. It’s a perfect mix of form and function: The covered-up top half puts the focus on your legs, and the short hemline makes them look impossibly long. The long sleeves also make it possible to wear a full-sparkle number without the risk of a thousand tiny abrasions on the inside of my arms after having them rub against sharp sequins all night. Festive, but without the pain. This excellent version is from Abercrombie, and is available in its broadest size range to date (XXS-3XL). As someone who grew up when Abercrombie was not inclusive, I was as surprised as anyone that its modern era is so good: It has become one of my go-to brands for plus-size denim, and I’ve noticed that it has been both gradually adding more sizes in the rest of its clothing and including curve model representation in product images and campaigns. I’m wearing the XXL in this style, which is solidly my size per its sizing chart. The fit feels just right to me, as I like the true mini length. If you prefer the hemline to be a bit longer or are more of an exaggerated pear shape, I’d recommend sizing up one to have a little more wiggle room (literally and figuratively).  I personally love how short it is (it’s a personal pet peeve of mine when brands make mini dresses knee-length for plus sizes), so I just made sure to include an opaque pair of slip shorts underneath, ruling out any risk of wardrobe malfunctions. (I recommend Lane Bryant’s slip short if you want simple coverage without any shapewear squishing.)  Because more is more when it comes to New Year’s Eve and similar parties, I paired this with rhinestone Mary Janes and a crystal mesh handbag. This styling is a tried and true combination for me: I wore a shorter sleeve version of this look to the Ariana Madix x DSW holiday party recently (the Mary Janes are from her collection), and got so many compliments. I’ve since worn these shockingly affordable heels a few different times, and always end up admiring how pretty they are. (They’re wonderfully sparkly in person!) They’re also wide-width-friendly — the rounded toe bed means no toe pinching. Plus-size holiday look for a work party: Laws of Motion feather-trimmed sheath If you’re deep in corporate land, you know that the permissible range for festive fun is limited, to say the least. This feather-trimmed dress from Laws of Motion is exactly the thing: The high-necked sheath silhouette is unimpeachably professional, and the tonal feather trim brings just the right amount of zhuzh.  This is the type of dress that you’ll want to keep in your wardrobe for decades — I’ve had mine for years now, and it has saved the day many times when I needed something sharp but not boring. Most importantly, the brand definitely has your size: Laws of Motion uses an innovative data-driven fit system that offers thousands of “micro sizes” for different body shapes, resulting in a near custom fit for anyone in the standard size 000-40 range. Combined with the work the brand puts in upfront to get fit right in extended sizes (even its samples fit wonderfully), Laws of Motion is a great option if you’re looking for something boardroom-ready that’s going to fit like a dream.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Winter jackets are practical, but the best ones aren’t a supporting act — they’re the main character, serving as the outfit. That’s why we’re all about layering up in outerwear that delivers warmth and wow factor. Whether you’re leaning into the coziness of a sherpa coat or the sporty edge of a puffer, the right winter topper can transform even the simplest look into a moment. This season, the top coat is getting a modern twist with ladylike details and cape silhouettes, while classics like suede jackets and wool coats hold their ground (though not without fresh updates — we see you, scarf jackets). Trends like the utilitarian barn jacket and bombers are vying for the spotlight, too, feeling particularly on-point in less brutal climates. (Hello, LA winter.) As far as specific items go, fan favorites like the Aritzia slouch coat, the North Face puffer, and Lululemon puffer jacket prove that staying warm doesn’t mean compromising on style. For those craving luxe touches, a Zara fur coat, teddy-like UGG coat, and Barbour wax jacket offer elevated spins on seasonal staples. Whether you’re bundling up, keeping it tailored, or planning out party outfits, our picks ahead make braving the cold downright fun. DashDividers_1_500x100 Faux-Fur Coats Nothing says winter glamour like a faux-fur coat. From Zara’s cropped silhouette to Ganni’s playful leopard print, these jackets balance boldness with cozy comfort. They’re perfect for pairing with denim or a party dress. DashDividers_1_500x100 Puffer Jackets The puffer jacket is a winter essential that’s equal parts cozy and cool. From The North Face’s iconic 1996 Retro Nuptse to Lululemon’s sleek transformable design and Hollister’s faux-fur-lined option, these go with everything, from comfy travel pants to festive outfits (or sweats when you’re keeping it lounge-y). Fully lean into the vibe with coordinating puffer boots — bold, baby.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Sherpa Coats Sherpa coats bring a plush, textural twist to cold-weather layering. From statement designs like Oak + Fort’s checkered style to timeless teddy silhouettes like UGG’s Gertrude, they’re ideal for adding warmth and personality to your winter wardrobe. And if you’ve been eyeing the ever-popular Aritzia wool coats, a nubby sherpa version is the ultimate upgrade. DashDividers_1_500x100 Barn Jackets The barn jacket brings a workwear-inspired twist to winter wardrobes. From Barbour’s classic waxed version to Alex Mill’s modern red take, these balance pragmatism and style. We love them layered over chunky knits or paired with tailored separates for contrast. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ladylike Wool Coats Curved lines, sharp collars, and sleek details give classic wool coats a fresh spin this season. Look at Reformation’s bow-tied jacket or Madewell’s bold red design — they’re ladylike, minimal, and anything but boring (especially if you go bold by styling yours alongside the dress-over pants trend).  DashDividers_1_500x100 Leather Coats Leather coats are a closet mainstay for a reason: They do the most (in a good way). Plush-lined styles (like Abercrombie’s utility trucker) bring serious warmth for frigid days, while lightweight options (like Wray’s vegan leather blazer) are just the thing for milder temps. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cape Coats Cape coats are one of those runway trends that are actually wearable IRL. From Dôen’s plaid take to Banana Republic’s bright red number (hitting two trends at once), these styles deliver drama with a polished sensibility. DashDividers_1_500x100 Scarf Coats Scarf coats are multitaskers, keeping you warm without the fuss of extra layers. They’re a great outfit hack for dialing up any look — even jeans and sweatsuits. DashDividers_1_500x100 Suede Jackets Suede jackets are stepping it up with fun, vibrant shades this winter, like Urban Outfitters’ cobalt blue style. A classic refreshed for those who like their layers with a little more personality. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bomber Jackets Bomber jackets are getting a sport-luxe makeover with padded and quilted designs (perfect for brisk chills), slouchy faux leather (bonus points for trendy colors like burgundy), and even reversible options (who doesn’t love a two-fer?). Style them over clingy knits with jeans and a statement belt for an “I tried, but not too hard” nonchalance. Like what you see?

But JNCO (which stands for \"Judge None Choose One\") brings a whole new meaning to wide-leg jeans. Originally founded by Jacques Yaakov Revah and Haim Milo Revah in 1985, the label became a beloved '90s brand for skate, rave, and street cultures. The shape of these pants, with their oversize pockets and pooling material that grazed the floor, was inherently triangular. Many of them featured graffiti-like patches - with the signature logo following suit - colorful flaps, and contrast stitching to make a statement. Today, Milo and his daughter Camilla are successfully revitalizing JNCO, working alongside original designer Silvio Marceca to showcase the brand's roots while expanding into women's jeans. JNCO's also embracing sustainability and appealing to the eco-conscious customer by incorporating vintage pieces in the lineup. When I caught wind of JNCO's resurgence - celebrities including Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, and Post Malone have been wearing them proudly, according to Camilla - I figured trying them would be my ultimate test: When it comes to jeans, just how wide am I willing to go? [I] felt like I was channeling a healthy mix of Avril Lavigne, Ginger Spice, and every boy band in the '90s. I settled on two of the brand's most popular styles: the Easy Wide Pipes ($160), which is a more classic iteration, and the Hypnotix ($280), which features red and white wave panels down the side, making it a descendent of the Solid State collection. While I had a pretty solid handle on styling the Pipes silhouette, since they didn't feel as baggy as I expected, the Hypnotix definitely turned heads. I wore them with a cropped Disney tee to achieve ultimate nostalgia and felt like I was channeling a healthy mix of Avril Lavigne, Ginger Spice, and every boy band in the '90s. A waiter at the restaurant I went to even complimented the pants excitedly, then proceeded to invite me out dancing. \"I'll look for the jeans,\" he promised me with a wink! Ahead, you can read more about the comeback of these viral JNCO jeans, see my outfits, and decide if tapping into the trend is right for you. What Made JNCO Jeans Popular in the '90s? \"JNCO jeans are a symbol of rebellion and individuality,\" Camilla says. \"More than just denim, JNCO represents freedom, creativity, and bold self-expression.\" The brand's popularity surged even further when school districts banned them back in the '90s, cementing their \"youthful defiant\" status. Their shape was significantly more exaggerated than what was conventional at the time, and their artistic, graffiti-inspired embroideries were a mode of self-expression. Why Are JNCO Jeans Coming Back? If you're into fashion, you likely know that the thirst for '90s nostalgia is real, especially among Gen-Z. From Eilish's quintessential grunge aesthetic to Bieber's all-oversize-everything approach to dressing, celebrities are at the heart of JNCO's comeback, influencing TikTokers to embrace the look - down to keychains tugging at the belt loops. \"Younger generations are rediscovering our iconic wide-leg styles, while longtime fans are thrilled to see the return of a brand that's always stood for individuality,\" Camilla says, continuing, \"What sets JNCO apart is our commitment to artistry and subculture. From skate to graffiti to music, JNCO has deep roots in creative communities. Our designs - like the Tribals with their incredible graphics or the Mammoths with their daring proportions - aren't just nostalgic; they're bold, unapologetic, and unique in a way that other brands can't quite replicate.\" Current JNCO bestsellers include the Mammoth, with 40-inch leg openings, the Twin Cannons, Pipes, and Low Downs, according to Camilla. \"Since the brand's inception, these styles have defined our legacy in the world of denim and streetwear,\" she says. Image Source: PS Photography / Sarah Wasilak What I Like About JNCO Jeans As a big fan of '90s fashion, JNCO jeans feel ridiculously cool to me simply because they're different. While you already know I prefer a wide-leg silhouette - and these pants lend me all that and then some - they're also conversation starters. The oversize patches and logos on these jeans aren't itchy or uncomfortable whatsoever, and I find that the giant pockets - especially the ones at the back - actually add to the roomy feel of the pant leg. While the denim is structured, there's enough stretch to easily pull them up or down and move freely. How to Style JNCO Jeans I was pleasantly surprised by how seamlessly my two pairs of JNCO jeans fit into my wardrobe. Of course, balancing proportions is key, so I opted for a fitted top to allow the jeans their full volume. Camilla also suggests implementing this modern twist, but maybe adding some silver chains to mimic the old-school style. If you're going to layer, she recommends tailored blazers or bomber jackets for structure. And choosing the right footwear is a must. \"Chunky sneakers, combat boots, or platform shoes work perfectly with the oversize legs,\" she says. I wore Western boots with the Pipes to give them more polish, since these weren't as exaggerated in form, and chunky sneakers with the Hypnotix to impart a sporty vibe and also keep my balance in check given the weight of the pant legs - more on that ahead. What to Consider Before Buying JNCO Jeans When you first remove your JNCO jeans from their packaging, know that they may feel a little stiff at first and require some breaking in. After wearing the jeans for about an hour, they loosen up and even sway a bit at the hem with every step you take. Of course, this is also dependent upon which style you choose, as some pants have a wider opening than others. Scan the product page carefully for this info (it's all there in the description) and choose the correct inseam by measuring your current favorite pair of jeans that fit you well from the crotch seam to the bottom interior of the leg. There's also a helpful size calculator on the site to use as a resource. Most importantly, know that these jeans are heavy - at least, in comparison to your standard denim. My Hypnotix pair weighs over two pounds, whereas my classic Levi's are just over a pound. You can definitely sense the difference in mass when you're holding up the jeans in front of you, but once they're on, you sort of just succumb to their weight. Just think of it as an exchange for how friggin' cool you look. Where Can You Buy JNCO Jeans? JNCO's current stock is available to shop at jnco.com. You can also thrift some authentic vintage pairs on eBay, including the Mammoth ($2,300), Skate Phat Kangaroo ($375), Jesters ($1,000), and more.
