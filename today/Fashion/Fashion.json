    "description": "It’s our fashion guru’s birthday month, and she’s being sensible … mostly• Women’s spring wardrobe essentials: 27 easy-to-wear piecesI try to be realistic about what people will spend when I do these edits. When we’re shopping and see something we like, the first thing almost all of us do is look at the price. What with money not growing on trees and all that. If I see something nice in a shop, then check the tag and find it to be out of my budget (or just overpriced), I move swiftly on. By the same logic, if I spot a contender for this monthly roundup but then discover it’s prohibitively expensive – which happens a lot these days, “sticker shock” being a familiar syndrome in an era of fashion hyperinflation – I am not inclined to include it.But we can’t be sensible all the time. I don’t need to remind you that it’s better to buy fewer good, long-lasting things than loads of cheap tat. Then there’s the fact that, sometimes, an object is worth spending money on not because it’s objectively worth a lot of money, but just because it’s worth a lot to you. Plus, June is my birthday month, so you have to indulge me, OK? So, there’s a couple of splurges in here, should you be in the market for a dreamy dress or two. But also: the £46.75 swimsuit that’s in every chic holiday luggage, and some utterly brilliant earrings for less than £20. Because, that’s real life. Continue reading...",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-ballet-flats?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ballet flats have long been a wardrobe staple — the ultimate choice when sandals feel too exposed, sneakers too casual, and heels too fussy. But this season, the timeless silhouette is getting a playful upgrade, with designers embracing texture, whimsy, and a dose of nostalgia.Mesh styles — which soared in popularity over the past year — have evolved into a modern essential, with fresh takes featuring bold embellishments from bows to embroidery. Jelly ballet flats unlock peak childhood memories in grown-up, glove-like fits — and bonus: they’re waterproof, making them perfect for those sudden summer rain showers. Mary Janes feel newly charming in colorful linens and woven raffia, while darling crochet styles bring handcrafted, wanderlust-inspired vibes to any look. And if you’re craving color, butter yellow is the seasonal standout (do we sound like a broken record yet?) — soft, sunny, and surprisingly wearable.Though undeniably classic, ballet flats are especially appealing right now because of their balance: playful yet practical, timeless yet trend-forward, wearable yet anything but boring. Whether you’re pairing them with workwear for a commute, a summer dress on vacation, or denim shorts on a hot and steamy day, this summer’s wave of ballet flats delivers something for every aesthetic.Ahead, we break down the standout styles to shop now — each one primed for repeat wear all season. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Ballet Flats: Timeless Leather  Classic and versatile, leather ballet flats that never go out of style. With clean lines, soft materials, and sweet bow ties, these shoes are easy to pair with just about anything in your summer rotation. Best Ballet Flats: Mesh  Mesh ballet flats had a major moment last year — and they’re not going anywhere. This season, the trend feels more refined: sheer neutrals, delicate embroidery, and sleek studs that add texture without the weight. Best Ballet Flats: Mary Janes  Mary Jane ballet flats are still going strong — now rendered in fresh, personality-packed, and heatwave-ready designs. From sunny stripes to colorful linen and woven raffia, these playful updates add charm to even your most laid-back summer looks. Best Ballet Flats: Yellow  We’re in peak butter yellow season, and ballet flats are a fun way to work the shade into your summer rotation. From soft leather to breezy mesh, these sunny pairs brighten up everything from denim skirts to easy dresses. Best Ballet Flats: Woven Leather Woven leather is a great way to add texture while still keeping things timeless. Stick with a round toe for a more classic feel, or opt for a square toe and higher-cut vamp if you’re leaning modern. Best Ballet Flats: Jellies  We have The Row to thank for putting jelly flats back on the map — and this summer’s versions are even more playful. Red and blue remain fashion crowd favorites, while bright green and pink feel especially fresh in mesh fisherman styles and cutesy Mary Janes. Best Ballet Flats: Crochet  These textured flats offer a handcrafted feel that’s sweet, feminine, and decidedly low-key. Whether styled with flowy dresses or denim cutoffs, they add a dose of charm without feeling fussy. Best Ballet Flats: Satin  The ultimate balletcore pick, satin flats bring a soft, dressy touch that works just as well with a summer wedding guest dress as they do with an evening outfit. They instantly make even the most casual pieces feel more intentional. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/and-just-like-that-outfits-fashion-49192011",
    "description": "Plenty of \"And Just Like That\" spoilers are lurking below, FYI. You can't tell the story of \"Sex and the City\" and its revival/sequel \"And Just Like That\" without spending an inordinate amount of time discussing the fashion. Over the course of the original show's six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw became a universal style icon. She inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. Styled by the inimitable Patricia Field, Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) delighted in getting dressed. Her style was quirky, vibrant, romantic: she'd stop by McDonald's in a pink Oscar de la Renta frock or go wedding-dress shopping with a belt tied around her bare stomach. Throughout the series, as well as in the three \"Sex and the City\" movies that followed, Field and Parker set trends, launched design careers into the stratosphere, and created an endless stream of iconic looks. Now, the \"And Just Like That\" outfits aim to carry on that legacy. Image Source: HBO [Carrie Bradshaw] inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. With costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago on board, Carrie still enjoys fashion on \"And Just Like That,\" but the writers also use it as a mechanism to communicate her state of mind. When she wore a tulle skirt and black headpiece to Big's funeral in season one, it was to make her late husband proud. When she threw Big's blazer over her shoulders before heading out in a cocktail dress, her outfit suggested she's healing from his sudden death - and finding space for his memory (and belongings) in her new life. Later, as she started to date and feel like herself again, she was back in a Norma Kamali ruched blue dress that fit impeccably well; it's so quintessentially her that fans dubbed it the \"Carrie dress.\" Her Moncler x Pierpaolo Piccioli look in season two recalls the glamour of her tulle dresses from the previous series - and takes it to another level. Who else would wear a theatrical puffer coat and gown for the bomb cyclone but Carrie Bradshaw? Likewise, in season three, the first scene captured her in the perfect Simone Rocha look: the Spring 2024 sheer midi dress and coat with rosettes blooming from the pockets. In another scene, she steps out in a quirky \"Strawberry Shortcake\" hat that has the internet divided, much like that time she almost got married with a bird on her head. The message? Bradshaw is officially back and in her element (we hope). Image Source: HBO Fashion is obviously sacred to Bradshaw, but other characters have memorable style moments as well. Miranda Hobbes's colorful halter dress and Seema Patel's leopard look from season one could've been right at home in the original series. In season two, the characters dressed up to attend the fictitious, \"Veiled Beauty\"-themed Met Gala: Lisa Todd Wexley in a breathtaking red Valentino gown and Charlotte York Goldenblatt in a bold corset top and skirt. At times, their looks carry a greater significance. Think of Rock Goldenblatt's unconventional styling of their Oscar de la Renta dress as they prepared to share their gender identity with their parents in season one. Or Miranda's uncharacteristically sexy halter jumpsuit as she stepped outside a stale marriage to flirt with Che Diaz at the bar.

Ahead, check out the best \"And Just Like That\" outfits so far - and shop the best fashion from season three.",
