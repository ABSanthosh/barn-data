Its red carpet is the ultimate expression of the dream-big mindset, where anyone can be a princess or a dashing hero. But it has also become, in the 21st century, a pay-to-play game where fashion houses cut behind-the-scenes deals with actors to get their clothes in the spotlight. For women, it is also a tightrope walk through a savagely judgmental environment in which having just enough sex appeal is a golden ticket, but too much is a guilty verdict. Continue reading...",

    "description": "I'm trying to be more mindful about how and where I spend my money these days, while also making a conscious effort to support Latine entrepreneurs, creators, and business owners as often as possible. Latine fashion designers and clothing brands are not something we hear about often, but they exist and are out here making some seriously stylish and thoughtful clothing. There was definitely a time when even the idea of buying clothes, shoes, and accessories from a Latine-owned shop, let alone created by Latine designers, wasn't even on the radar, largely because representation was severely lacking. But now, we know that sometimes in order to support each other, we have to do a little digging and find those small businesses ourselves. And celebrities are getting in on the fun, from Mariah Carey in Flor de Maria heels to Blue Ivy Carter carrying a Ciriaco leopard print bag at the Super Bowl.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/spring-outfit-ideas-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Ever stand in front of your jam-packed closet, staring at more than enough clothing options, and think: I have nothing to wear? Same. But perhaps the issue isn’t that you’re out of viable outfit choices. You just need a fresh dose of inspiration — say: spring outfits — to help you see your wardrobe in a new way. That’s where Outfit Dump comes in. We supply you with enough ideas to fuel your style until the next drop comes along. Dressing for a new season can be equal parts exciting and challenging. It’s an opportunity to store away some of the well-loved pieces you’ve been constantly re-wearing in favor of wardrobe staples you’ve maybe been ignoring, while also a challenge to navigate the changing of seasons and unpredictable weather. The creative part of your brain probably needs some time to adjust to the newness when actually planning outfits that are both fashionable and practical.That’s where we come in: We scrolled, and scrolled, and scrolled through our Instagram feeds, searching for spring outfit ideas and inspiration. What we found were takes on some of the year’s budding trends — ruffles, oversized suits, leopard print, and more — that will have you in the mood for transitional-weather dressing. Ahead, find 19 looks worth adding to your moodboard this season. Spring Outfit Idea: Bright Suiting Who said office-appropriate outfits have to be boring? Push the edges of corpcore with suits in fun, cheery, spring-ready colors.Spring Outfit Idea: Soft Suiting  We understand if a highlighter-adjacent suit isn’t in your comfort zone — or if you’re not able to push the office dress code quite that far. Opt for less structured, more oversized suiting to add some softness to your 9-to-5 look. Spring Outfit Idea: Corpcore With a Twist A skirt suit is a classic springtime option. Take yours up a notch by going for more unconventional officewear-inspired pieces, like this cropped top with an attached tie.Spring Outfit Idea: Skirt Over PantsYes, this divisive trend has returned to the fashion week runways — and we say: go for it. We especially love the idea of double layering with a corset over a button-up top, as seen here. Spring Outfit Idea: Dress Over PantsAlternatively, how about a dress worn over a pair of trousers? Spring Outfit Idea: Mocha Mousse Neutral hues are in for spring, and there’s something that feels both comforting and luxe about this matching Mocha Mousse loungewear ’fit — just like the team at Pantone said there was when it was crowned the color of the year.Spring Outfit Idea: Pops of Color Monochromatic neutral may be the look of the season, but we wouldn’t deny the opportunity to add some color to our wardrobes. We love how the richness of the red handbag pictured here pops against the gray tones. Spring Outfit Idea: Capri Pants After reemerging last year, capri pants remained popular at London Fashion Week this past month. Whether you go for a wide-leg or more fitted pair, they give plenty of flexibility when it comes to getting dressed for transitional weather. Spring Outfit Idea: Frog Green Move over, brat green. A grassier, more subtle — yet still bold — frog green is on the rise for 2025, and it’s perfect for warm-weather dressing. We love the idea of wearing a pair of tights in the vibrant hue under a sheer skirt. Spring Outfit Idea: Leopard-Print Accessories Leopard print still isn’t going anywhere, but, this season, we’re taking a more subtle approach to the pattern, adding it to our outfits through spirited accessories like hats, bags, or shoes. Spring Outfit Idea: Lightweight Scarves Speaking of accessories, put the finishing touch on your outfits this spring with a thin, lightweight scarf to achieve instant Cool French Girl vibes. Spring Outfit Idea: Layering Sweaters Take your styling cues straight from the runways of New York Fashion Week by using your winter sweaters as spring accessories. Drape your favorite knits or cardigans over your shoulders, or tie them around your waist (or wherever else the mood may strike). Plus, it’s nice to have an extra layer handy for those crisper days. Spring Outfit Idea: Double Denim This season, we’re asking one very important question: Can you ever have too much denim? We’re leaning towards “no.” Expect to sport a bunch of double denim outfits — which can be customized to your own preferences, whether you prefer barrel-leg jeans, flares, dark washes, or anything else. Spring Outfit Idea: Tiered Dresses Our motto when it comes to picking out dresses to wear this spring? The more volume, the better. This long-sleeve white dress is the ideal place to start — the tiered skirt is full, but not too puffy, for those who prefer something slightly more understated. Spring Outfit Idea: Leather Jacket + Sleeveless Dress Break out your summer dresses a bit early by wearing a leather jacket (or any other go-to warm layer) over them. Spring Outfit Idea: Ruffled Blouse Take a classic outfit formula — white shirt plus jeans — and zhuzh it up with some ruffles. Thank us later.Spring Outfit Idea: Dressed-Up JumpsuitIt’s hard to go wrong with a pretty jumpsuit, but we especially love the flowy, exaggerated sleeves on this chocolate brown one. Spring Outfit Idea: Polo Sweater Polos and rugby sweaters are continuing to have their moment. Add a twist to the look with a colored collar (as opposed to the traditional white shade) matched to another piece of your outfit, like a pair of pants. Spring Outfit Idea: Midi Skirt + Boots Wearing a midi skirt with a pair of knee-high boots is an easy way to experiment with the balance and proportions of an outfit while also elevating the overall look.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Get excited, because there’s yet another White Lotus collaboration on the horizon that’ll have you planning your next vacation. Banana Republic, has just announced a new capsule collection, and have given us a sneak peek behind resort doors with mystical campaign images and videos.  And the biggest surprise is that Patrick Schwarzenegger, who plays Season 3 character Saxon Ratliff — the snooty, sex-crazed sibling that we love to hate — stars in the campaign. He wears many patterned short-sleeve tops and relaxed linen pants that are ready for any adventure (or poolside drinks). This comes just after fellow cast member Parker Posey modeled for the sister brand’s Gap spring campaign.  “The Banana Republic White Lotus collaboration brings the show to life with the perfect mix of effortless and vacation style,” said Schwarzenegger in a press release. “Banana Republic’s attention to quality and craftsmanship with this collection is impressive.” The limited-edition collection combines the brand’s signature aspirational-yet-achievable style with the series’ easy-yet-elevated costumes plus themes of travel and escapism into 24 vacation staples. And when we think of it, we’re sure many White Lotus guests, like the Ratliff family, would easily wear Banana Republic, which makes this partnership so spot on… and so perfect if you want to dress like your favorite characters. The resortwear includes colorful and patterned dresses, jumpsuits, button-downs, shorts, bucket hats, summer scarves, and more across womenswear and menswear. Many styles come in several cheerful prints and vibrant hues, like turquoise and yellow, to best complement your personal vacation style. The lightweight knits, linen, cotton poplin, and silk are also suitcase-approved, and ready to be packed for your next getaway. “This collection celebrates a sense of discovery and wit through a premium lens,” said Banana Republic’s head of marketing, Meena Anvary. “Featuring tropical and vintage-inspired prints from our archives and landscapes of Thailand, it embodies the spirit of adventure.” Banana Republic credit card members will be able to shop the collection through the app on March 5. Then, everyone will be able to shop the pieces online and in select stores on March 6. Styles will range between $40 and $300. Shop all Banana Republic Like what you see?
