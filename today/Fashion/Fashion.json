Or, as my colleague Jess Cartner-Morley called it last month, the Little Boxy Jacket. Soft and untailored, Chanel’s original boucle jackets were a rejection of the corseted silhouettes that were fashionable at the time. A century later, the brand continues to riff on the style – most recently with pastel-coloured and pearl-adorned versions down its couture catwalk.However, with prices starting from £2,000, they are a wardrobe staple most of us can only dream of. However, there is some good news: this spring, the high street has several iterations that could almost be the real thing, at more affordable prices. Here is my pick of the best.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/neendi-pajama-set-review-49431266",
    "description": "PS editors take sleep very seriously - we've tested TikTok sleep hacks, made sleepy-girl mocktails, and rounded up the best products for better sleep. So it's probably no surprise that we scour the internet for the best sleepwear styles, too. There's nothing as satisfying as putting on a fresh set of comfy PJs to lounge around or snooze in, but it's even better when they look as good as they feel. When our editors came across Neendi's pajama sets, we jumped at the chance to try them. The long sleeve button-down top and matching pants have a \"relaxed fit\" and are made from the brand's signature Norma fabric that's soft but durable. And because the silky-smooth fabric is made of rayon and viscose, you can feel good about throwing them in the wash (unlike most silk pajamas). But the best thing about Neendi's sets is that there's no need to sacrifice style for comfort. The eye-catching designs the pajamas come in - think vintage birthday cakes, groovy daisies, or bright pink takeout boxes - are unique compared to other options we've seen on the market. But are these the PJs of our dreams? We break down our experiences wearing, sleeping in, and even washing Neendi's pajama sets ahead. Keep reading for five editors' honest reviews - and to see all the fun patterns that struck our fancy.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-camel-toe-proof-thong-editor-review-48661732",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez I'm just going to come right out and say it: it's time to talk about camel toes. We've all been there at one point or another - we slip on our favorite pair of workout leggings and running shoes, only to look in the mirror and see that we can see much more than we bargained for. Namely, the outline of our labia majora. While some of us may have no problem with the idea of showing a little extra, others might not feel so comfortable. I am firmly stationed in the latter camp, which is why when I first heard about the camel-toe-proof Jiv Athletics High Rise Thong ($35), I knew I had to get my hands on a pair immediately. Like most good things in my life, I discovered the existence of camel-toe-proof underwear while scrolling through my TikTok feed late one night. After seeing one video where a woman was praising how amazing the thongs were, I started seeing more and more videos of women calling out Jiv Athletics for their amazing underwear. (Thank you, TikTok algorithm.) While I eagerly awaited the arrival of my own pair, I decided to read up on what made this underwear so different from everything else I had tried in the past. What I Like About the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong After receiving them in the mail, I washed them in a delicates bag, hung them to dry, and patiently waited for my turn to finally be free of my dreaded camel toe. The first time I wore them I decided to try them on with a pair of leggings I purchased a few months ago. In all honesty, I hadn't worn my leggings even once since I purchased them, because no matter how many different pairs of underwear I tried on with them, I was always left with bunching in the crotch area. (I run into this issue a lot with leggings that have a seam down the center.) After I put on my new panties, I immediately noticed how lightweight the fabric was. It honestly felt like butter, and I loved the fact that they were seamless, so I wouldn't run into any issues with panty lines. The underwear is also tag-less, which already made them more comfortable than half of the options in my panty drawer. I wore them all day, and with the exception of when I had to use the restroom, I honestly forgot I was wearing underwear at all – they were that comfortable. And as for my camel toe? I'll spare you the before photo, but let's just say I would not be wearing these leggings without the assistance of my new favorite underwear. Who Is the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong Best For? If you wear tight-fitting clothing, including workout shorts or leggings, this is the underwear to grab. I'm excited to know that I can now purchase any leggings without needing to worry about bunching, readjusting, or feeling self-conscious. If you're like me, and have been searching for the answer to your camel toe woes, pick up a pair to add to your underwear collection. Additional Details These underwear are made with recycled fabrics and environmentally friendly dyes. They're also made from 82/18 percent recycled micro-polyester spandex, and they have an anti-microbial cotton gusset as well as a moisture-wicking outer shell and breathable cotton liner, which helps promote airflow *down there*. The real magic is in the 3D knitted molded spacer fabric, which provides an extra layer of coverage that makes camel toes a thing of the past. Where Is the Jiv Athletics Camel-Toe-Proof Thong Available? The Jiv Athletics camel-toe-proof thong is available to shop on the brand's website and on Amazon.

While spring 2024 surprisingly brought us the Clarks Wallabee comeback, spring 2025 is bringing an equally preppy (and unexpected) style: the boat shoe. Then again, maybe we shouldn’t be surprised. The “fisherman aesthetic” started trending on TikTok this past January, casting its net as one of the biggest spring trends and putting nautical styles (we swear we’ll stop the puns soon), back into the spotlight. The newest ones you should test the waters with are from a Sperry x Aritzia collaboration.Sperry, the nostalgic original boat shoe brand founded in 1935, teamed up with Aritzia, the modern “elevated essentials” fashion brand, to reimagine the latter’s iconic boat shoes, re-designing two new styles. “The boat shoe is more than just a trend — it’s a timeless staple that has defined style for nearly nine decades,” said Sperry’s president Jonathan Frankel in a press release. “This partnership is a perfect fusion of heritage and modernity, bringing fresh versatility to an enduring icon.” The Sperry x Aritzia Slim Boat has a sleek, narrow toe box and anti-slip outsole (because functional fashion is at the heart of the fisherman trend). It comes in full-grain leather, and is available in brown and light brown colorways.Meanwhile, the Sperry x Aritzia Authentic Original 2-Eye, which resembles a loafer (also very on trend), features premium leather, rawhide laces, and the brand’s signature “Razor-Cut Wave-Siping” outsole. These are available in brown and tan.Perhaps the most exciting part is that both these styles can be customized (and we love customization… hello shoe charm trend). They each come with three sets of interchangeable laces, including colorful ones, to make these shoes even more versatile… and spring-ready.All that’s left to do is reel and hook these styles so you can start sporting them around spring gatherings and boardwalk strolls. The collaboration is available to shop now on Aritzia’s website and select stores. Then, shop them on Sperry’s website on March 25. Shop full Sperry x Aritzia collaboration Like what you see?
