    "description": "Argyle knits and plaid coats, tweeds and wool… This season the heritage look is back. The aim? Off-duty royal at BalmoralFashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and \u0026Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M\u0026S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay. Continue reading...",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Beanies? Gloves? Sure, they’re wardrobe essentials when the wind chill intensifies and your coffee cools down faster than you can sip it. But on the winter fashion scale, they’re pretty basic. Scarves, on the other hand, are anything but. These winter accessories have range and can transform an outfit with minimal effort. From patterned and colorful designs to luxe cashmere and wool fabrications, they’re the MVPs of cold-weather dressing. But if there’s one type that consistently steals the spotlight (and keeps us the coziest), it’s the oversized scarf — the stylishly and borderline excessive piece that turns bundling up into an art form.  This season, brands are doubling down on the trend, offering everything from ultra-plush styles with teddy-like shearling and fuzzy alpaca to vibrant patterns and mega-warm blanket silhouettes that rival your favorite throw. So, instead of splurging on yet another pair of forgettable gloves or a one-size-fits-all beanie, opt for an oversized scarf — it’s a budget-friendly way to embrace the scarf coat trend without committing to (or investing in) the full look. Keep scrolling to shop the season’s best options for every style and sensibility — you’ll be covered, both literally and sartorially. Oversized Scarves: Classic Prints Embrace timeless patterns like houndstooth, buffalo check, and herringbone that give these scarves a preppy-meets-polished vibe. The oversized designs breathe new life into classic motifs, epitomizing the stealth wealth aesthetic — aka styles you’ll never regret investing in. Oversized Scarves: Knitted This winter, opt for chunky cable knits and big, bold weaves that are all about texture. With just the right heft to keep you swathed in warmth and style, they pair especially well with sleek wool coats and layers of knits for full-on volume. Oversized Scarves: Big Color Energy This one goes out to maximalists and minimalists alike. Whether you’re embracing a multi-hued spectrum or seeking a singular pop against neutrals, these scarves are an easy way to inject a mega-dose of pigment into your look, delivering a zany energy we’re so here for. Oversized Scarves: Blanket The runway-inspired look maximizes on coziness. These scarves are like your favorite blanket made wearable, and are perfect for homebodies who want to bring the warmth wherever they go. Swathe yourself in one on frigid days, or drape a lighter-weight style across your shoulders for a dramatic finishing touch atop a blazer, chunky turtleneck, or wool coat. Oversized Scarves: Colorblocked Bold and bright, colorblock scarves bring a playful edge to any look. With unexpected combos like mustard with lilac or navy with coral, they add a fun pop to neutral winter layers and enhance maximalist palettes without going over the top. Toss one on for an instant dopamine rush during winter’s grayest months. Oversized Scarves: Plush Textures Bouclé, faux fur, and teddy textures bring a whole new dimension of softness. These scarves are a tactile treat, begging to be touched. Layer them over sleek silhouettes for a refined contrast, or lean fully into the snug vibes with matching textured pieces. Oversized Scarves: Wine Tones Decadent, wine-inspired hues add just the right amount of sophistication to your winter lineup this season. Whether you’re dressing up neutrals or going for a color-drench moment in fall’s It hue, consider these scarves a wearable pour of the season’s finest. Oversized Scarves: Bold Stripes These aren’t your classic Breton stripes. This season, the iconic pattern gets a glow-up with bold color combos, from sky blue and tan to hot pink and red. Reach for your favorite when you’re after a fresh twist on a timeless style. Oversized Scarves: Brushed A brushed scarf is all about adding a touchable, cozy texture to your look. Offered in mainstay neutrals and playful colors or prints, these scarves bring ultimate warmth with a classic sensibility that pairs effortlessly with any outfit. Like what you see?
