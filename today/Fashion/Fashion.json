It's our job to uncover top-rated products, and Nordstrom certainly doesn't disappoint. Right now is a great time to score some of the brand's most popular pieces at prices you'll love - especially the ones on sale. If you find yourself in the market to update your closet with a new clothing item or even a top-rated pair of shoes, we have more than a few suggestions. We've curated products that are not only trending, but included in our own personal favorites as well, with many being highly discounted. Below, we've laid them all out for you - because, after all, what are shopping fairy godmothers for? Nordstrom recently released tons of new products under $50 to the sale section that are sure to sell out quickly, plus a few cult-favorite pieces that are hard enough to find in stock. From a top-rated swimsuit to stylish dresses and editor-loved sunglasses, these pieces are designed to live in your closet for the longterm - even as they endure multiple trend changes and TikTok aesthetics.
