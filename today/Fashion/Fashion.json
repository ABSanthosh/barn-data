    "description": "For Muslims, Jummah has always been a time to dress your best, and a new exhibition documents just what that means for the older and younger generationsEvery Friday, for eight months, people attending Jummah at one of four mosques in Tower Hamlets became familiar with the same sight: a man with a camera and a woman with a clipboard, chatting to men as they entered and left the mosque, as part of a special project.Jummah, or Friday prayer, is a spiritual highlight of the week that brings the spectrum of Muslim communities together. And ever since it was established by the prophet Muhammad – who described Friday prayers as an “Eid” or celebration – there has been an idea of wearing your “Friday best”. What comprises this uniform is wide-ranging, from monochrome ankle-length Arab thobes to colourful south Asian kurtas, easy tracksuits to stylish blazers. The project set out to document the whole range, and forms the basis of a new exhibition in London’s Bethnal Green called Jummah Aesthetics: British Muslim Men and Their Sartorial Choices.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian as well as Emma and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And many of those items are on sale for Cyber Monday. The Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and these 12 are it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, many of which are on sale for Cyber Monday, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($49, originally $78), which is currently marked down for Cyber Monday. Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It comes in eight different colorways, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice), grey eucalyptus and bone, flush pink and bone, and nightfall and lilac ether, among others.
