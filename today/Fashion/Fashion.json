    "description": "Nightdresses are set to follow pyjamas out of the bedroom as daywear, with sales up on the UK high streetIn the first episode of Lena Dunham’s new Netflix sitcom Too Much, viewers might be taken with cameos from Dunham, Jessica Alba and the model Emily Ratajkowski, or the burgeoning romance between Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe. But – as far as fashion is concerned – it’s nighties that have a starring role.Early in the episode, Stalter wears a short frilled red nightie, with her dog in a matching design. Later, she wears a white frilled floor-length design, and it’s clear the item is something of a signature. If it’s a cute quirk for a character, it’s also in line with wider trends.

    "description": "Time to sign out of your Work Bag, sling a straw basket bag over your shoulder and feel your pulse slow downIs there any point putting an out of office on your emails when you go on holiday any more? “I won’t have access to emails.” Yeah, right. Sorry, you aren’t fooling anyone: no one goes on holiday without their phone in 2025. Your office know perfectly well that if you don’t answer emails, they can still reach you by text or direct message. Even, theoretically, by actually calling you, although obviously that won’t happen because that’s another thing that no one does in 2025. Tweak your out of office message as much as you like – you might as well stick your fingers in your ears.No, the best way to set your brain to holiday mode is by signing out of your Work Bag. Swapping the bag you take on your daily commute for a free-and-easy alternative is more effective as a psychological gear change than logging out of your emails. In day-to-day life, I change handbags as rarely as possible, the potential for leaving keys in an inside pocket and getting locked out being just too real. But when you get home after work and you aren’t going back for a week or two, there is something very pleasing about marking that moment by throwing away leaky pens, marvelling at how you managed to accumulate 14 hairbands, and then shaking the bag over the bin and feeling disproportionately thrilled when a pound coin falls out. Stashing the bag – with your office pass inside – is very out of sight and out of mind. Continue reading...",

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Rixo x Billie BhatiaGet ready to discover your new go-to summer dress in the Rixo x Billie Bhatia capsule collection. The British writer and Spill podcast co-host has brought her cool and vibrant sense of style to the print-forward fashion brand with a 16-piece line full of breezy dresses that will look just as at home at a vacation resort as they will running errands in your hometown. Think little black dresses with embroidered floral details, tiered maxi dresses with pretty frills, and long-sleeve halter-neck gowns in hand-painted prints inspired by Ibiza. “Creating a collection of pieces that I know every woman in my life would look and feel their absolute best in is more than I could have imagined,” Bhatia said in a press release. “This collection is sartorial serotonin, it is freeing and fun and created to enable good vibes only.” Shop now at RixoRixo x Billie Bhatia Alina Midi Dress, $, available at RixoPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup.

Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer.

If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available now at Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil, $, available at Charlotte TilburyDior x Louis Hamilton Superstar Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has teamed up with heritage fashion house Dior for another capsule collection (their first debuted last fall), inspired by Afrofuturism. Pieces showcase tailored jackets (including a short silhouette inspired by the 1968 Miss Dior line), slouchy knitwear, and the sporty B44 Blade sneakers in new colorways. “I [was] inspired to imagine the future of Black culture. The way we tell stories through art, science and philosophy is really special. Seeing these ideas brought to life through color and movement inspired me,” he said in a press release. “For me, fashion has always been about self-expression and embracing all the different parts of yourself. Being authentic to your style and communicating yourself through clothing is such a powerful feeling.” Shop now at DiorDior x Lewis Hamilton Necklace, $, available at DiorCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaCecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand.

Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPleats Please Issey Miyake to Launch Brand New DayIssey Miyake’s Pleats Please Brand has launched a new series called Brand New Day in collaboration with illustrator Hikaru Ichijo.

If you’re in NYC, you can also see an interactive installation that brings the Brand New Day illustrations to life from July 10 TO 24. Huda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush. Huda Beauty’s new Lip Contour Stain is easy to use, delivering a long-lasting lip stain that can be worn neatly as a liner, a blurred lip blush, or even as a full matte stain. Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula.

Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available at Levi'sDyson Airwrap Co-anda 2x™ The Dyson Airwrap did to hair tools what TikTok did to the internet: it took over. The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonDyson Airwrap Co-anda2x, $, available at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-damson-madder-new-arrivals?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to New Arrivals, where R29 editors test out the latest pieces from their favorite brands and share their top looks. Whether you’re overwhelmed by the number of places to shop or trying to hone in your personal style, come along as we explore ‘fits, fabrics, styling potential, and more by sorting through the virtual and IRL shelves at our go-to shopping destinations.  Ever since Damson Madder burst onto the fashion scene, there’s been a “Damson Maddening” at Refinery29, with at least one editor wearing a piece from the brand at the office at all times. Founded by Emma Hill in 2020, with a slower and more ethical approach to fashion, the brand has since become a go-to source for dopamine dressing. After becoming disillusioned with the high-street category, Hill wanted, as she told Refinery29 last year, “to have a dress or blouse with extra things that are exciting. I wanted people to look and say, ‘Oh my God, where did you get that lovely piece?’ [but] I was disappointed by the quality of the product and the lack of responsibility taken.” Since then, the brand has gone from strength to strength, and today you can’t go to any buzzing brunch spot, weekend market, or beer garden without seeing the label’s exaggerated collar blouses, quilted vests in funky prints, or milkmaid dresses. Known for its playful and vibrant style, the brand has gained popularity among celebrities, influencer,s and fashion insiders, with Anya Taylor-Joy, Emma Roberts, and Olivia Rodrigo all regularly spotted in Damson looks. The brand’s summer 2025 collection includes plenty of Damson trademarks — denim, playful prints, bows and bold colorways — updated for the moment. You’ll find trending cherry red, fruit prints, and corset-inspired lacing on the brand’s clothing, with sizes ranging from 6 to 20. Here are our picks for the warmer months ahead. Bonus: Many of the picks are currently on sale. DashDividers_1_500x100 Damson Madder New Arrivals: Skirts Depending on your height, the effortlessly cool Charlotte could be a midi or a maxi. (As someone petite, it’s the latter on me, which I am all for; I’m a sucker for a long skirt.) The sky blue version is ultra-feminine but still laid-back (my sweet spot). Close up, you can see the embroidery-style flower details on the silky fabric, which is a lovely touch. The ruched panel at the waistline offers multiple points to adjust the fit — something all skirts should have — so you can alter the look and feel depending on the day and look. Pair with a simple white tee and sandals, and you’re Aperol-in-the-park ready.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Damson Madder New Arrivals: Pants, Shorts \u0026 Skorts The utilitarian skort that I used to sport back in high school has been given the Damson treatment. While I wasn’t at first sold on the design, the lightweight denim in a pale wash is not only extremely flattering but also fun to wear. With the appearance of a wrap skirt and practicality of hot pant shorts, the Rory is perfect for a park chill, bike rides, and balmy summer evenings. DashDividers_1_500x100 Damson Madder New Arrivals: Dresses I, like many of the brand’s fans, fell in love with Damson Madder for its dresses. I have never received so many compliments, been stopped in the street so many times, or felt as comfortable as I have in a Damson Madder dress. The Angelina midi is my new obsession. Made from 100% organic cotton, it features a fitted, laced bodice and voluminous skirt that creates a satisfying sway with every step. Feminine without feeling saccharine, it includes every girl’s favorite dress feature: pockets. Yes, yes, and yes! DashDividers_1_500x100 Damson Madder New Arrivals: Swimsuits If festival season style is anything to go by, bikini tops are now just… tops. In the sweltering heat, why opt for anything other than a swimming top and gym shorts? (We can thank Charli XCX and the Brat Pack for this one.) Made from organic and recycled materials, this bow-adorned bandeau is that kind of bikini top that can be worn as part of a matching swimsuit set or on its own. Structured for support, with a playful design, it begs to be taken to the Italian Riviera — or, in my case, to Spain.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Like what you see?

    "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" was equal parts entertaining, controversial, and anxiety-inducing. From the unforgettable spiral of Huda Mustafa and Jeremiah Brown (that lasted all of one week early on in the season), to the unexpected, yet necessary reunion of Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe. Through the season's many cringe moments and last night's monumental win for sensitive gangster Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales, there were many noteworthy elements that inspired our shopping habits, including the outfits. From the minidresses and crochet button-downs that informed fire pit chats to Ariana Madix's mastery at cutouts, cast members made dressing in Fiji look too easy. And of course, the swimwear was far from lacking. Notable moments include Carthen's affinity for crochet coverups and cowboy hats (a combination that's so \"Cowboy Carter\"-coded), Mustafa's massive thongkini collection, and Megan Thee Stallion's \"Hot Girl Summer\" gold bikini, also marking its debut on the show. Whether islanders were strutting casually through the villa enjoying downtime with their partners or going on impromptu dates to another part of the island, each bikini look left us obsessed. Ahead, check out the best \"Love Island USA\" swimsuits from season seven - and shop exact and similar pieces to inspire your next vacation's wardrobe.",

    "description": "I spend a lot of my free time online shopping, and one of the more surprising places I've found chic fashion items is Amazon. From designer shoes (yes, really) to workout clothes and affordable jewelry that could pass for luxury, I've found tons of stylish winners. Browsing the site can often feel overwhelming because there are so many great options, but luckily, I did the hard work for you and stumbled across four bodysuits that I absolutely fell in love with. When I received my bodysuits in the mail, I immediately decided to order a few more, because the quality was so good I couldn't believe how affordable they were. All of these bodysuits have a snap closure, which makes them super easy to get in and out of, and they all run true to size. To keep the pieces in the best shape possible, I typically wash them on delicate with like colors and hang them to dry. They've all held up great after numerous washes, which is an absolute must for me because I can occasionally be hard on my clothes. If you're on a budget or just looking to save a few bucks while adding some affordable pieces to your wardrobe, keep reading to check out my tried-and-true picks.",
