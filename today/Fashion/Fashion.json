    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October. To find out all the latest beauty products and fashion collections catching our attention, click through the slideshow ahead…All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Ganni x Barbour Ganni and Barbour are back with their third collaboration in as many years. The collection is made up of nine pieces that reimagine the British heritage brand’s classic outerwear with Scandi twists — think: leopard-print waxed jackets with oversized corduroy collars, patchwork barn jackets, and belted trench coats. “This collection is all about celebrating friendship, our mutual shared community, and the beautiful blend of our two worlds,” Ganni creative director Ditte Reffstrup said, in a press release. Ganni x Barbour 3.0 will be available to shop online on October 30, with prices ranging from $130 to $645.Shop on October 30 at GanniReformation Drops First-Ever Jewelry Collection with Clare Waight KellerFor the first time ever, Reformation dropped a line of jewelry — and to do so, it partnered with former Givenchy head/current Uniqlo creative director Clare Waight Keller. The launch includes a selection of 1920s-Paris-inspired earrings, bracelets, and necklaces designed to feel both contemporary and heirloom-worthy, made with materials like recycled 24-karat gold vermeil and semi-precious stones. The Clare Waight Keller for Reformation jewelry collection is available to shop now, with prices ranging from $168 to $898.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Clare Waight Keller Gertrude Cuff, $, available at ReformationReformation x Clare Waight Keller Bechet Earring, $, available at ReformationEverlane’s Western Collection The Western trend is staying strong going into the last couple of months of 2024. The proof? Everlane’s Going Western collection, which aims to elevate the saloon look via a range of denim (including a ranch jacket, culottes, and a midi skirt), barrel pants, riding boots, and more that would fit right in at a ranch (or a “Cowboy Carter” listening party).Shop now at EverlaneEverlane The Midi Quilted Liner, $, available at EverlaneEverlane The Denim Culotte, $, available at EverlaneEverlane The Outlaw Boot, $, available at EverlaneJennifer Fisher Chavez Collection For the latest jewelry launch under her eponymous brand, Jennifer Fisher looked to celebrity stylist/personal friend Nicole Chavez (who has worked with stars like Kristen Bell and Rachel Bilson) for inspiration. The six-piece line evokes Chavez’s effortless style with two-tone jewelry (a first for the brand), including rounded rings, earrings, huggies, and an ear cuff. Shop now at Jennifer FisherJennifer Fisher Chavez Huggies, $, available at Jennifer FisherFilson x Birkenstock 1774 Filson and Birkenstock 1774 are celebrating their lasting legacies in a new collaboration that blends the American heritage brand’s rugged and rustic aesthetic with the German footwear label’s comfort-focused silhouettes. There are three styles: the Lahti, a soft, collapsible boot made in part with wool; the Skykomish, a utilitarian boot with oiled-cloth, leather, and rubber components; and the London Moccasin, a suede and leather slip-on adorned with a buckle. Prices range from $375 to $625.

Now, the luxury brand is aiming to capture that sense of history and timelessness in the Le Damier de Louis Vuitton fine jewelry collection, which boasts grids of alternating polished and diamond squares wrapped around rings, tennis bracelets, and earrings. All in all, there are 12 elegant pieces available in yellow and white gold.Shop now at Louis VuittonLouis Vuitton Le Damier de Louis Vuitton Small Ring, Yellow Gold and, $, available at Louis VuittonLouis Vuitton Le Damier de Louis Vuitton Small Bracelet, $, available at Louis VuittonGlossier You Rêve and You DouxThe original Glossier You eau de parfum became a viral sensation for smelling completely different on everyone. Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity. Catch us looking cozy (and tall) in this collection throughout fall.Shop now at UGGUgg New Heights Platform Xtra, $, available at UggBebe x CiaraDespite being a nostalgic brand for many, Bebe continues to be discovered by new generations: The label is currently all over TikTok thanks to its diamanté Y2K spaghetti tops and fitted hoodies. It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn. Luckily, dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross has expanded the DermInfusions line just in time for the mercury to drop, launching a new Blur and Repair Cream that delivers serious hydration. Containing rich shea butter and skin barrier-boosting ceramides, the cream aims to improve elasticity while hydrating hyaluronic acid and skin-strengthening peptides draw in moisture, leaving a plump and glowing base for makeup application. The formula is non-comedogenic, too, so it’s less likely to cause breakouts.Shop now at SephoraDr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions™ Blur + Repair Cream, $, available at SephoraDaily Paper x ConverseDaily Paper, which started out in Amsterdam in 2012, celebrates African culture through its luxurious pieces boasting monogram prints. This October, the label is collaborating with footwear giant Converse on a range of unisex sneakers and clothing, the most eye-catching of which has to be the playful Chuck 70s featuring black logo embroidery, contrast multicolored stitching, and interchangeable laces available in red, yellow, and green. Those searching for something more stealthy might enjoy the Chuck 70 De Luxe Squared, with its all-black snub-toe silhouette and brightly colored bottoms; those wanting something more snuggly should check out the logo fleece hoodie and sweatpants.

The 16-piece collection experiments with tailoring and layering through fall-ready pieces like quilted jackets, skirts over pants, sweaters with armholes, and a combo bustier/button-front top. Gu x Rokh will be available to shop on October 18, with prices ranging from $29.90 to $99.90.Shop on October 18 at GUGu x Rokh Striped Sailor Collar Sweater, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Hoodie Scarf, $, available at GUGu x Rokh 2 Piece Skirt And Pants Set Checked, $, available at GUGu x Rokh Mary Jane Shoes, $, available at GUStarface Hydro-Star Recovery PatchThe main benefit of a pimple patch is to gently draw out gunk; generally speaking, they do very little to reduce the angry redness that often accompanies an acne breakout. That’s where Starface’s new recovery patches enter the picture. While the brand’s famous yellow stars aim to shrink spots, the new purple patches are designed to soothe inflammation after an (ill-advised) picking sesh. Containing soothing aloe vera and vitamin A to promote cell turnover, the recovery stars are all about bringing down redness fast. With the addition of licorice root to help with scarring, these patches put in the work to heal skin and get rid of the evidence.Shop now at StarfaceStarface hydro-star® recovery, $, available at StarfacePleasing x Disney Fantasia Revel in the nostalgic magic of the 1940s animated classic Fantasia with Pleasing’s latest collaboration. The Harry Styles-backed brand has partnered with Disney on a line of apparel, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Find three nail polish sets (each of which borrows cues from different segments of the movie), a new edition of the Big Lip HA Moisture Balm, hoodies, tote bags, and more. “When visiting the Disney archives, we had the opportunity to look through lots of archived and special illustrations which was very exciting — especially as a child who went to the Disney parks — getting a peek behind the curtains of how these beautiful movies and moments are made felt truly inspiring,” Pleasing creative director Harry Lambert said, in a press release. “From very early on, Fantasia was always in the front of our minds at Pleasing; the aesthetics, the mood, the bold illustrations, the colors, and, ultimately, the epic world that Disney has created, were very much a world that resonated with Pleasing.” Prices range from $25 to $289.Shop now at PleasingPleasing x Disney Fantasia L’Apprenti Sorcier Tote in Blue, $, available at PleasingREFY Plum Lip CollectionThe onset of autumn might have some people thinking of sunset-colored trees, cinnamon drinks, and baked pumpkin goods; for us, it’s all about the arrival of vampy makeup. A wine-stained lip is arguably the most sophisticated makeup trend for this time of year and REFY is joining the party with a brand-new, plum-hued lip combo. Comprising a dome-shaped Blur Liner and tinted lip gloss, the kit lends a plummy ombre effect that can be diffused by day and built up for a statement look come cocktail hour. Shop now at REFYREFY Plum Lip Collection, $, available at REFYCharlotte Simone Winter DropBritish designer Charlotte Simone has been known for her It-girl coats for quite some time. Taking inspiration from 1970s silhouettes, her Penny Lane-style jackets with flamboyant fluffy collars and larger-than-life shearling cuffs have been seen on everyone from Dua Lipa to Charli XCX to Florence Pugh. This autumn, the label is offering a sleeveless faux-suede vest, leather bomber and leopard-print Mongolian lambswool coat. If you aren’t ready to go full Almost Famous, the latest drop also includes some shaggy ombre scarves to liven up just about any layer.Shop now at Charlotte SimoneCharlotte Simone Naomi, $, available at Charlotte SimoneLike what you see?
