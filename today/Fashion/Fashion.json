Can a new global ‘upcycling’ scheme change not only the industry, but how we think about dressing?In 1942, the British government’s Board of Trade launched a Make Do and Mend scheme. It was one of several campaigns encouraging the public to save resources during the second world war by learning basic sewing skills alongside taking on bigger projects such as remodelling men’s clothing into womenswear. Today, Fashion Revolution, a non-profit social enterprise founded in the wake of the 2013 Rana Plaza factory disaster in Bangladesh, is gearing up to launch its own Mend in Public Day. This weekend participants from all over the world will be able to join free local community classes to learn how to mend and stitch.However, this scheme is aimed at addressing not scarcity, but overconsumption.

    "description": "H\u0026M has been releasing exciting and showstopping designer collaborations for just over 20 years — the most recent collections being with Mugler, Paco Rabanne, and Rokh. The latest, however, marks a first for the brand: Partnering with a Polish designer, Magda Butrym, whom H\u0026M creative advisor Ann-Sofie Johansson calls an “emerging icon.”The Silesia-born designer and 2018 LVMH-prize finalist — known for her “signature blend of femininity, boldness, and intricate craftsmanship” — is celebrating her brand’s 10-year anniversary with an H\u0026M collection reinterpreting bestsellers like delicate 3D floral dresses and oversized structured coats, according to a press release. “It was great for me, as a designer, and my team to look back and see all the pieces that were loved by clients,” said Butrym at an H\u0026M conference.Roses are at the heart of this collection, as Butrym sees them as a “symbol of womanhood: both soft and confident, delicate and independent, arresting and ever-growing.” How poetic. It’s also intended to be a “celebration of femininity in bloom,” which couldn’t be any more apparent through the blooming catsuits, headscarves, and mini dresses (which model Vittoria Cerreti gave us a taste of), as well as the rosette-covered bodysuits, gowns, and heels.   “I really see this collection as a chance to invite people into our world — and to celebrate femininity, and the flower,” said Butrym in the release.  “When I design, I always think about these three words: Dreamy, romantic, Slavic,” she added at the conference.While the collection has a classic and timeless appeal, it also maintains Butrym’s modern edge — aka the thing that’ll make you stand out (err, bloom) from the crowd. Think: rosette denim corsets, rose-printed tights, and hat-headscarf hybrids. So, whether you’re looking for meticulously tailored outerwear, a sweeping sequin gown, or cozy matching sets, the H\u0026M x Magda Butrym collaboration has a mix of statement-making and casual styles that promise to elevate your spring outfit rotation. Click on to preview the H\u0026M x Magda Butrym collection.
