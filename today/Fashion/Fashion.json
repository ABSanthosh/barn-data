    "description": "Nightdresses are set to follow pyjamas out of the bedroom as daywear, with sales up on the UK high streetIn the first episode of Lena Dunham’s new Netflix sitcom Too Much, viewers might be taken with cameos from Dunham, Jessica Alba and the model Emily Ratajkowski, or the burgeoning romance between Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe. But – as far as fashion is concerned – it’s nighties that have a starring role.Early in the episode, Stalter wears a short frilled red nightie, with her dog in a matching design. Later, she wears a white frilled floor-length design, and it’s clear the item is something of a signature. If it’s a cute quirk for a character, it’s also in line with wider trends.

    "description": "Time to sign out of your Work Bag, sling a straw basket bag over your shoulder and feel your pulse slow downIs there any point putting an out of office on your emails when you go on holiday any more? “I won’t have access to emails.” Yeah, right. Sorry, you aren’t fooling anyone: no one goes on holiday without their phone in 2025. Your office know perfectly well that if you don’t answer emails, they can still reach you by text or direct message. Even, theoretically, by actually calling you, although obviously that won’t happen because that’s another thing that no one does in 2025. Tweak your out of office message as much as you like – you might as well stick your fingers in your ears.No, the best way to set your brain to holiday mode is by signing out of your Work Bag. Swapping the bag you take on your daily commute for a free-and-easy alternative is more effective as a psychological gear change than logging out of your emails. In day-to-day life, I change handbags as rarely as possible, the potential for leaving keys in an inside pocket and getting locked out being just too real. But when you get home after work and you aren’t going back for a week or two, there is something very pleasing about marking that moment by throwing away leaky pens, marvelling at how you managed to accumulate 14 hairbands, and then shaking the bag over the bin and feeling disproportionately thrilled when a pound coin falls out. Stashing the bag – with your office pass inside – is very out of sight and out of mind. Continue reading...",

    "description": "If there's any celebrity you can count on to nail any and every aesthetic, trend, or fad, it's Lady Gaga. The Grammy-winning singer is completely unabashed when it comes to taking risks in her artistry as a whole, but her style, perhaps most of all, knows no bounds. Of course, we all remember her iconic outfit for the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards - a dress, hat, boots, and purse made entirely out of raw beef, designed by Franc Fernandez. The look garnered so much attention that it was listed by Time as the top fashion statement of that year (and it has its own Wikipedia page!). Fast-forward to present day, and the artist born Stefani Germanotta is still crafting her own lane of style as she promotes her latest album, \"Mayhem,\" which she'll be taking on the road starting in July. Apart from the otherworldly visuals, surrealist dance routines, and captivating vocals, you can expect Lady Gaga's tour outfits to deliver just as much drama for us to be inspired by for years to come. In true Gaga fashion, she's created mind-blowing visuals to accompany the album's most major hits, like \"Abracadabra.\" In the video, we see the singer's limitless sartorial abilities even more, namely a custom Samuel Lewis x Suman Gurung x Ilona lace ensemble accompanied by a stiffened, dramatic collar and tiered train - giving us firsthand inspiration for the tour. In case Elizabethan-inspired clothing isn't exactly your style, you can take notes from Gaga's previous eras while planning your concert look. Think exaggerated denim and embellished accessories inspired by her \"Marry the Night\" video, or loud, leopard looks like the jumpsuit she wore in her and Beyoncé's boundary-pushing anthem \"Telephone.\" And if you can't make a strict decision on which Gaga-approved aesthetic to channel, we've done the legwork and rounded up the best concert outfit ideas for you to shop. From gaudy jewelry to dramatic denim from favorites like Nordstrom and Revolve, these are the best Lady Gaga-inspired fashion finds to get for The \"Mayhem\" Ball.",

    "description": "Season seven of \"Love Island USA\" was equal parts entertaining, controversial, and anxiety-inducing. From the unforgettable spiral of Huda Mustafa and Jeremiah Brown (that lasted all of one week early on in the season), to the unexpected, yet necessary reunion of Olandria Carthen and Nic Vansteenberghe. Through the season's many cringe moments and last night's monumental win for sensitive gangster Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales, there were many noteworthy elements that inspired our shopping habits, including the outfits. From the minidresses and crochet button-downs that informed fire pit chats to Ariana Madix's mastery at cutouts, cast members made dressing in Fiji look too easy. And of course, the swimwear was far from lacking. Notable moments include Carthen's affinity for crochet coverups and cowboy hats (a combination that's so \"Cowboy Carter\"-coded), Mustafa's massive thongkini collection, and Megan Thee Stallion's \"Hot Girl Summer\" gold bikini, also marking its debut on the show. Whether islanders were strutting casually through the villa enjoying downtime with their partners or going on impromptu dates to another part of the island, each bikini look left us obsessed. Ahead, check out the best \"Love Island USA\" swimsuits from season seven - and shop exact and similar pieces to inspire your next vacation's wardrobe.",

    "description": "In anticipation of the 2025 ESPY Awards on July 16 — which looks back at the 2024 accomplishments of world-class athletes — track and field star Gabby Thomas is looking forward to a brighter future. “I think we’re in such a great era for women’s sports, and I’m just so proud to be a part of that and to be having that impact on not just the people watching but especially the younger generation,” she tells Refinery29. The five-time Olympic medalist is nominated for Best Athlete in the Women’s Sports category, following the most recent 2024 Paris Olympics, where she won three gold medals. Thomas’ ESPY category is being sponsored by TJ Maxx, who is also dressing her for the evening. “I’m thrilled to be partnering with TJ Maxx because they’re so committed to celebrating women like me who are redefining the game and owning who they are,” Thomas says, hinting she’ll be wearing an all-white “bridal-era” look following her recent engagement to Spencer McManes. “I went with something white with some fluffy, feathery finishes.” When speaking about fashion’s recent embracing of athletes, Thomas — who has since the Olympics appeared on the cover of Vogue’s Winter Issue and attended the 2025 Met Gala — says that “this moment for women in sports and fashion is long overdue and very well deserved.” She adds: “Historically, women in sport have been using self-expression and fashion in their sports. We’ve seen it in track and field for so long. Think about Flo-Jo [Florence Griffith Joyner] and the impact that she’s had, and her style and fashion.”Today, Thomas uses personal style to set her up for success on the track. “One of my favorite parts about race day is dressing up and kind of tapping into that alter-ego version of myself. And just tapping into that energy through what I’m wearing, through how I’m doing my hair, and just the whole look,” Thomas says. “One thing about being in the track community is that when you look good, you feel good, you run good.” At the ESPYs, Thomas will be in good company, nominated alongside gymnast Simone Biles, basketball player A’ja Wilson, and fellow track and field athlete Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. “I’m really proud to stand alongside them in showing the world how impactful and powerful women’s sports are,” says Thomas. “It just feels really good to be up there representing our sport. It’s something that I’ve always dreamed of when I was a little girl.”While she can’t control the outcome of who will go on to win the award, Thomas is taking the future of track and field into her own hands. Together with fellow Olympians Sha’Carri Richardson and Tara Davis-Woodhall, she has come on as an adviser-owner of Athlos League, a team-based, women-centric track and field competition set to debut in 2026. “I’ve always wanted to leave the sport better than I found it. And the fact that we were able to do that, and also celebrate powerful women and uplift female athletes in the process, it means everything to me,” she says. “It’s going to be such a great opportunity for us athletes in the sport in terms of having competition, in terms of being paid, and just shaking things up a little bit with the new format… [and] to inspire the next generation and show what we can do in sports.”The 2025 ESPY Awards will be broadcast on ABC at 8 p.m. EST on June 16 and streamed on Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+.  Like what you see?
