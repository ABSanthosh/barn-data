    "description": "Argyle knits and plaid coats, tweeds and wool… This season the heritage look is back. The aim? Off-duty royal at BalmoralFashion’s longstanding love of heritage and dressing up in the style of those attending country-house weekends has dominated the runways this season, from Chloé’s cape silhouette plaid coat to Wales Bonner’s check barn jacket styled over a dark tweed two piece. Meanwhile labels such as Margaret Howell and Stefan Cooke have adopted hardwearing tweed, styled with denim or paired with a knit, and heavy-duty wool trousers in a palette of autumn hues, from mustard, olive green and russet to rich chestnut brown. It’s a look suitable for long walks in the countryside, with textured wool coats layered over quilted and canvas barn jackets, such as Mango’s contrasting collar version (6, below) or Sezane’s flap pocket design in camel, £285.Knitwear is the foundation to this look, an argyle cardigan or jumper that’s reminiscent of Brideshead Revisited, the Mitford sisters and off-duty royals at Balmoral. The argyle knit is a great entry-point to this trend, and \u0026Daughter’s Ava sweater (£395), made in Hawick, Scotland, is the real deal, made with responsible Wool Standard-certified wool. On the high street, M\u0026S (10) has a simplified graphic take on the design (£35). There are also plenty of pre-loved iterations to be found, for example at Beyond Retro and eBay. For day, keep things practical with flat boots: Whistles lugsole knee-high pair (£259) have an equestrian vibe that works for the trend. Alternatively, Blundstone’s ankle boots (£190) come in a variety of colours and weather-appropriate finishes. Mixing textures and pattern is key, try checks with wool and throw in some embellishment to stay on the right side of cosplay. Continue reading...",

Sweat sets are an MVP for curling up on chilly flights. Bonus: you can break up a set and wear each piece separately, unlocking endless mix-and-match potential for those moments when you actually want to plan an outfit.If you’re ready to retire those ratty, holey sweats that have seen you through college and countless days under your duvet (no judgment — we’ve all got that pair), consider yourself covered.

I wore it everywhere on a recent work trip to LA, but I know it will be in good rotation under blazers, jackets, overalls, and more during chilly East Coast days. If you're looking for a full set, it also comes with a matching skirt.” — Carli Whitwell, Senior Director of EditorialShop ZaraZara Soft High Collar Top, $, available at ZaraPhoto Courtesy of Carli Whitwell.Hey Harper Squiggle Hoop Earrings“I wear hoop earrings all the time, but my usual pairs are more simple. I like wearing these on the weekends to make a switch from my work look, and friends always compliment them and notice how unique the shape is! They’re one of my favorite purchases of late. Extra points for the fact they aren’t heavy and comfortable to wear all day long.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Hey HarperHey Harper Squiggle Hoop Earrings, $, available at Hey HarperPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Aligne George Padded Wrap Coat“Come autumn, you’ll always find me in a trench coat. Not only is it the ideal style for transitional dressing, but it’s an investment staple, too. Aligne’s padded iteration is made for fall walks and trips to the pub for a Sunday roast (that London life!). It has the sleek cut of a trench but the warmth of a puffer, and to me, that’s cold-weather dressing done right.” — Susan Devaney, Life Director Shop AligneAligne George Padded Wrap Coat, $, available at AlignePhoto Courtesy of Susan Devaney.Square-Toe Water-Repellent Heeled Boots“These square-toe booties are one of my favorite shoes for the fall and winter, especially since the knitted fabric is cozy and water-repellent. The sock-like boots are so chic — I have them in Bordeaux Red and in the black-and-red colorway pictured here. If you want to experiment with red clothing and accessories (a big trend this fall), these are super wearable.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop VivaiaVivaia Square-Toe Water-Repellent Heeled Boots, $, available at VivaiaPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Damson Madder Persephone Midi Dress“There’s a reason that at least one Refinery29 editor is wearing a Damson Madder item in the office at all times. We’re obsessed. The reason being that the quality is always top-notch, the fit is true to size, and the patterns and colorways are always on trend. You can wear this black gingham midi dress practically anywhere — the office, drinks, lunch, or on a date. It’s so elegant and easy to style, I want one for each day of the week.” — Kelly Washington, Senior Social EditorShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Persephone Midi Dress, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto Courtesy of Kelly Washington.Little Liffner Pillow Shoulder Bag“Although suede is trending, it’s a material that never goes out of style. I’ve been on the hunt for a suede bag to add some texture to my fall wardrobe, and this black shoulder bag from Little Liffner has fit the bill. It’s super comfy to carry, can be dressed up or down, and is just the right medium size to fit all of my necessities.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnerships ManagerShop Little LiffnerLittle Liffner Pillow Shoulder Bag, $, available at Little LiffnerPhoto Courtesy of Kate Spencer.LilySilk Majus Blouse“This ruffled blouse may look a bit over the top and give pirate vibes, but it’s also so fabulous. I love pairing it with a black skirt on a night out or a nice pair of jeans for a more casual vibe. While I usually hate shirts that are tight  around my neck, the tie on this one is comfortable and adds to the drama factor.” — Becca Sax Affiliate Coordinator Shop LilySilkLilySilk Majus Blouse, $, available at LilySilkPhoto Courtesy of Becca Sax.Sol Kyst Leo Blue Light Glasses“I’ve used blue light glasses on and off for years, but hadn’t found a pair that I absolutely loved. I have a feeling that these Sol Kyst glasses are going to be a long-time staple, though: Made specifically for wide faces (which are typical of, but not limited to, Black and Asian features), I love how this frame compliments my high cheekbones and wider nose bridge, and doesn't slide off my face like other glasses do.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop Sol KystSol Kyst Leo Blue Light Glasses, $, available at Sol KystPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Saint Art Talia Charmeuse Midi Skirt“Despite the black colorway, this midi skirt was my must-pack on every trip this summer, thanks for the way it barely wrinkles in the suitcase and can be styled with everything from a T-shirt and sneakers for a day sightseeing to a silky cami and heels for a night out or dinner. I’ve similarly relied on it all fall, pairing it with black blazers, oversized fuzzy sweaters, and knee-high boots for that monochrome look that I tend to come back to when the weather gets cold.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Saint ArtSaint Art Talia Charmeuse Midi Skirt, $, available at Saint ArtPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Vagabond Jolin Shoes“These silver-toned flats from Vagabond are a fun addition to my fall wardrobe. I’ve been loving them with a simple top and barrel-leg jeans — there’s something about a wider-cut trouser with a more narrow, dainty shoe that just works. I’m also a big fan of the darker, almost gunmetal silver color that makes them a bit more muted and timeless to style. I plan on wearing them on repeat while it’s still warm enough for a bit of foot to be exposed.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop VagabondVagabond Jolin Shoes, $, available at VagabondPhoto Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch Mid Trench Coat“I’m sure other short girlies will agree that it’s incredibly difficult to find a trench coat that fits our frame without making us look like a kid playing dress-up. I’ve given up on brands that don’t offer petite sizing for outerwear, as some full-length ones will literally drag on the floor for me. I was elated to find this midi trench coat, which hits just above the knee and comes with all the classic trench coat features, such as a back flap (which shields you from the elements) and sleeve buckles (which you can tighten to prevent water from getting in). The nylon fabric is water and wind-resistant, and can be machine washed, which makes this a winner in terms of easy upkeep.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop Abercrombie \u0026 FitchAbercrombie and Fitch Mid Trench Coat, $, available at Abercrombie and FitchPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.We The Free Emerson Tote Bag“It’s big boho bag fall, folks, and, unsurprisingly, Free People is nailing it. I was inspired by the Olsen twins and Jane Birkin in picking this one out — I wanted something cool and slouchy. It carries everything I could need for work, running errands, or last-minute book shop visits.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Free PeopleFree People Emerson Tote Bag, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Alo Yoga Pinstripe Daylight Button Down Long Sleeve“I wouldn’t normally look to an activewear brand for everydaywear, but I’ve worn this shirt to work events tucked into trousers, and on casual days untucked over jeans. It gives a different impression depending on how you style it, which is exactly what I want from my wardrobe pieces. It’s also comfortable, has a stretch to it, and washes well. It’s an all-year-round staple that I’ll layer under sweaters going into winter.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Alo YogaAlo Yoga Pinstripe Daylight Button Down Long Sleeve, $, available at Alo YogaPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Harley-Davidson Korsen Tall Waterproof Riding Boot“Finding a vintage gem has to be one of life's purest experiences, and it truly felt that way coming across these secondhand Harley-Davidson biker boots just in time for fall. I’m usually pretty bad at checking resale sites, but when I saw someone wearing similar boots in public and they told me they got them on Depop, I was scouring the site like my life depended on it. These boots are already worn in (a major plus for those of us who regularly get blisters), and make me look like I could easily jump on a motorcycle at a moment's notice (despite not having a driver's license). I can’t wait to wear them for years to come.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop Harley-Davidsonharley-davidson Korsen Tall Waterproof Riding Boot, $, available at Harley DavidsonPhoto Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.Lake Pajamas Relax Pants Set“I’m a big proponent of ‘inside clothes’ and love nothing more than adding a new set to my loungewear drawer come fall. This matching sweatsuit from Lake Pajamas is one of the softest I've ever touched, thanks to its modal blend. In addition to being impossibly cozy and silky, I love that it’s lightweight, which will come in use once the heaters start dialing up.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Lake PajamasLAKE Pajamas Relax Pants Set, $, available at LAKE PajamasPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.This Story Sterling Silver Ribbon Letter Charm“I’m such a fan of This Story — I’ve slowly been building up a collection of its beautiful bow pieces. The latest addition is this delicate initial pendant which I’ve strung up with a butterfly charm from my childhood. These designs aren’t just whimsical and magical, they’re totally individual, each made with the intricate lost-wax casting method.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop This StoryThis Story Sterling Silver Ribbon Letters A-Z, $, available at This StoryPhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Loie Black Winter Boots“I struggle to find knee-high boots because I’m petite (5’2”) with size 5 feet. That was until I came across Loie’s black winter leather boots with delicate red stitching, and instantly fell in love. They’re slightly pricier than my usual budget, but I’d argue they’re worth the investment because they’re versatile, durable, and wearable. Compared to my beloved Docs (which ruin my heels on a regular basis), these are unbelievably comfy. I like to pair them with playful skorts or long flowy dresses for a sophisticated twist.” — Kelly Washington, Senior Social EditorShop LoieLoie Black Winter Boots, $, available at LoiePhoto Courtesy of Kelly Washington.Mother Petite Spitfire Nerdy Cuff High-Rise Relaxed-Leg Jeans “I’ve gotten the opportunity to test tons of jeans from different brands, most recently a range of Mother wide-leg and flared jeans. While I enjoyed every style, this cuffed pair was a surprising favorite. Although they’re baggy and oversized, the petite fit isn’t overbearing on my 5’3” frame. I really like how relaxed these jeans and their faded wash are, and am excited to continue wearing them out for casual fall activities.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Mother DenimMOTHER Petite The Lil' Spitfire Nerdy Cuff Jeans, $, available at Mother DenimPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.American Vintage BYMI Jumper“Sweater weather is upon us, and what better way to kick it off than with this cozy striped number from American Vintage. I don’t usually gravitate towards pink, but I absolutely love it in this color combo, and can definitely see myself wearing it throughout the seasons. Not only is this sweater warm, but it’s also the perfect length for me, which often feels like a rarity as someone with quite a short torso…” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop EvereveAmerican Vintage Bymi Pullover, $, available at EverevePhoto Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Joanie Rouen Patent Leather Mary Jane Shoes“Believe it or not, these are the only pair of heeled closed-toe shoes that I own. Usually, I find closed-toe shoes too tight on my toes, but not these! I love how comfortable they are, while still adding a touch of dressiness to an outfit. These will be great for holiday parties, but will also carry through to summer weddings next year. I also love the detailing of the bright blue lining. No one else can see it except for me, but sometimes fashion choices are about the joy we privately get from our clothes, as well as the public view of them.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop JoanieJoanie Rouen Patent Leather Mary Jane Shoes, $, available at JoaniePhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Vespertine The Everyone Shirt“Okay, listen up because my new favorite brand has arrived: Vespertine. The brainchild of Katy Close (previously designer of Raey — RIP) and model Lili Sumner, the label effortlessly oozes the insouciant attitude of ‘70s rock stars. The Everyone Shirt in polka dot is made from 100% silk, and I haven't been able to take it off yet. It’s a little bit low-key glamor, a little bit tomboy, and a little bit brilliant.” — Susan Devaney, Life Director Shop VespertineVespertine The Everyone Shirt, $, available at VespertinePhoto Courtesy of Susan Devaney.Haveli Yumi Satin Kaftan“Kaftan-style dresses were all over Copenhagen Fashion Week’s spring runways, and I’m so here for them. This frock from Jamaican-British label Haveli somehow manages to be glam and ultra-comfy at the same time. I love the bright, almost metallic green, and how the silk flows elegantly whether I’m walking or standing still. I wore this to London Fashion Week’s closing party, and it would be perfect for a fall wedding, too.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop HaveliHaveli Yumi Satin Kaftan, $, available at HaveliPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Away Large Featherlight Backpack“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of a commuter backpack that’s both nondescript and featherlight. I carry my MacBook Air with me everywhere, so I really need a bag that won’t weigh me down any further. (Sadly, no more leather satchels for me!) When Away released its Featherlight Collection, I knew it would be right up my street. The bags are meant to be clever travel accessories that can assist your travels while occupying as little of the weight limit as possible. I’ve been using the Large Backpack, and it comes with a slew of smart organization features that have made my life so much easier. I love the double side pockets for my water bottle and umbrella, a separate compartment for my work laptop, and a bunch of zip pockets and dividers for my essentials, from my keys to my passport. It weighs just 1.2 lbs, and the nylon fabric is water-resistant and easy to clean. No notes from this busy commuter who loves to lug all her stuff around town.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop AwayAway Featherlight Backpack, $, available at AwayPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.DL1961 Short-Sleeve Instasculpt Tee“While I love the look of tight-fitting baby tees, I hate that most of the options on the market are too cropped, no matter how high-waisted the pants or skirts are that I wear them with. This style from one of my favorite denim brands, DL1961, is not only the perfect length (aka stomach-covering while not being too long) but has the ideal opaqueness thanks to the wool-blend fabric that also makes it a perfect fall staple. I love this T-shirt so much, I get sad when I have to throw it in the hamper to be washed.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Neiman MarcusDL1961 Short-Sleeve Instasculpt Tee, $, available at Neiman MarcusPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Jack Erwin Paz Satin Mules“Normally, I hate the idea of my foot being out in the elements, but for this mule, I'll do anything. Thanks to their sleek shape and satin fabric, they add just a little bit of oomph to any look. They're perfect for a more casual outfit as well as for more dressed-up occasions when I don’t want to wear heels.” — Becca Sax, Affiliate Coordinator  Shop Jack ErwinJack Erwin Paz Satin Mule, $, available at Jack ErwinPhoto Courtesy of Becca Sax.Left On Friday Shoreline Playsuit“Fall weather inspires us to put together pieces that channel Princess Diana’s famous athleisure looks. Lady Di was the queen of pairing bike shorts with oversized crewnecks, and this compressive, fast-wicking playsuit may just be the perfect modern base layer to recreate her off-duty outfits. I can see myself wearing this one-shoulder style on its own to the gym, or with a cozy sweatshirt for hot girl walks and running errands.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Left On FridayLeft on Friday Shoreline Playsuit, $, available at Left on FridayPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Karen Millen Leather Trench Belted Mac Midi Coat“I’ve been after a leather burgundy trench coat for years now. I wanted to buy a vintage piece, but have struggled to find anything in this belted silhouette in my size. (I’m in between a UK 14 and 16.) Vintage resellers seem to prioritize smaller sizes, and I’m often left with big, boxy menswear-style coats. So, this year, just after I admitted defeat, this beautiful piece ended up in my Google search recommendations. Sure, it’s not vintage, but it’s just so beautifully cut, and the color is so rich (not too purple, not too red, not too brown) — I just know that I’ll be wearing and loving it for years to come.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Karen MillenPhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Free People Roma Suede Tote Bag “This is my new favorite bag, and it’s my first-ever suede one — a timeless fabric I’m excited to now have in my collection. It fits a lot inside (including a laptop), but doesn’t look bulky; the red color sings against any neutral coat; the straps are long enough to wear it slung over my body. It really is a joy to use.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Free PeopleFree People Roma Suede Tote Bag, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Damson Madder Dakota Blouse Check“I have Damson Madder’s dress in this style, with the elasticated waist and bows down the middle, and it’s one of my favorite pieces. I always get compliments on it, but, because I’m more of a jeans-and-top person, so every time I’ve worn it I’ve thought: ‘I wish they did this style as a top.’ Then, the brand launched its Fall/Winter 2024 collection, and, bam — there it was. The colors are perfection, the velvet bows add a little something special, and, best of all, it looks incredible with my wide-leg jeans. Add a necklace, and I’m good to go for the office, dinner, drinks, or just about any social occasion in my calendar right now.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Dakota Blouse - Blue Check, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Uniqlo Cashmere Short Cardigan“I’ve regularly avoided styling cardigans over the years for fear of the outfit looking more Mrs. Doubtfire than Olsen twin. But this cashmere one from Uniqlo has changed all of that. The material is so soft, it feels like I’m being hugged when I wear it. The lightness of the cashmere means that I’m not overheating the minute I jump on the train to the office. I’m learning that cardigans are that perfect ‘it isn’t actually cold, but there’s definitely a chill in the air’ item of clothing. I’m ready for my new era of embracing this wonderful feat of fashion engineering.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop UniqloUniqlo Cashmere Short Cardigan, $, available at UniqloPhoto Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.Quince 100% European Linen Smocked Mini Dress“I’ve long been a big fan of Quince’s affordable, high-quality linen clothing, and this breezy mini is one of the most frequently sold-out pieces in its collection. (The terracotta colorway I have is out of stock, but the navy option is still available.) This linen dress has been the perfect chic and carefree number to slip on whenever I have trouble coming up with an outfit. The fabric is soft and breathable, and looks good even with a few wrinkles — plus, I love how form-fitting the smocked bodice is. Bonus: This style is perfect for petite girlies since it’s quite short. (For reference, I’m 5 feet tall.)” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop QuinceQuince 100% European Linen Smocked Mini Dress, $, available at QuincePhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.Skies Are Blue Faux Leather Boyfriend Blazer“I recently tried Stitch Fix for the first time, and this blazer was in my first ‘fix'. It has become an instant go-to in my fall wardrobe, especially for the office and industry events. While the silhouette is classic and versatile, the burgundy faux leather is a bit more unique and edgy. I really like pairing it with dark denim and a range of tops, from suede vests and lightweight sweaters to glittery high-neck styles.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Stitch FixSkies Are Blue Faux Leather Boyfriend Blazer, $, available at Stitch FixPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.*using Alicia's Uniqlo cardigan instead Karen Millen Leather Trench Belted Mac Midi Coat, $, available at KAREN MILLENPhoto Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Asos Design Button Front Crew Neck Cardigan with Frill“Cardigans are sexy again and they’re the perfect summer-to-fall layer. This red cardigan is equal parts coquette and grandma-core, thanks to the slinky fit and frilly knit. Aside from this pairing with my Cos mini skirt, I have also styled it with baggy jeans and yoga pants, and on top of tank tops and bodysuits. I love its versatility and that I can easily pack it into a tote bag or purse for cooler nights. Oh, and cardigans were a major trend on Copenhagen Fashion Week runways, too.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop AsosASOS DESIGN Button Front Crew Neck Cardigan, $, available at ASOSPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Damson Madder Peplum Blouse“I never thought I’d be saying this but I’m in my peplum era! I’ve been especially loving the silhouette of this striped one from Damson Madder as the peplum is on the more subtle side. Paired with bike shorts and tall boots — this is a simple and easy outfit combination I’ll be wearing all season long.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Philly Peplum Blouse, $, available at Damson MadderDamson Madder Jennifer Check Puffer “Part of Damson Madder’s fall collection, this puffer immediately caught my eye. I love a check pattern, but even more so, I love a multi-purpose item. The sleeves on this style zip off, so I have a two-in-one: a vest for fall and a a warm coat for winter. It’s funny, clothing items that “convert” were something I deemed deeply uncool in my early youth. Now, I think they’re great. A sign of nearing 30, perhaps, but doing so in style.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Jennifer Check Puffer, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Moon River Shirred Cotton Midi Dress“I got this milkmaid dress at TJ Maxx for a steal, and I couldn’t be happier about it. In the summer, I’ve worn the olive-green frock with sandals and statement jewelry, and in the early fall, I plan on wearing it with a denim jacket and trendy sneakers or ballet flats.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Bloomingdale’sMoon River Shirred Cotton Midi Dress, $, available at Bloomingdale'sPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Peppermayo Stealth Mode Vest \u0026 Mini Skirt“Yes, I know everyone has been wearing vests and waistcoats this year, but I can’t help but be drawn to this beige mini-skirt set. It looks very cute together, but the matching possibilities are endless: the beige button-up vest is polished on its own or when layered over a T-shirt, and will look great with tailored trousers or jeans. On the other hand, I can’t wait to pair the pleated mini skirt with my favorite fall sweaters. The best part? The skirt comes with a versatile brown belt, which I’ve already been wearing with all my pants and culottes. We love a multitasking outfit for fall.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop PeppermayoPeppermayo Stealth Mode Vest, $, available at PeppermayoPeppermayo Stealth Mode Mini Skirt, $, available at PeppermayoPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.Gap x Madhappy Mad Full-Zip Cropped Hoodie“I was so excited when I got a sneak peek of the Gap x Madhappy collaboration because of the pieces’ nostalgic feel. And I was even more excited when I received this cropped sweat jacket (and matching sweatpants). The denim-blue color is perfectly faded; the oversized-yet-cropped shape is effortlessly relaxed; and the unexpected details like a double zipper, stitched hood, and “MAD” logo make my Y2k-loving heart happy. This sweatshirt is so cozy that I’ve already worn it out on breezy summer nights, but I’m looking forward to wearing it for casual fall festivities like apple picking or Halloween movie-watching.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop GapGap x Madhappy Mad Full-Zip Cropped Hoodie, $, available at GapPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Like what you see?

    "description": "When it comes to worthwhile investment pieces that can easily elevate even the most muted winter ensemble, few have proven to be more versatile (and timeless!) than a classic sweater vest. The nostalgic style left an evident mark all throughout 1980s and '90s fashion, and with the help of TikTok, it seems to be making yet another comeback this season. There's a reason sweater vests never seem to go out of style, and the answer lies in their flexibility. Whether you want to pair the piece with cargo pants and Doc Martens for a weekend brunch date or simply throw it over a long-sleeved blouse with your favorite jeans and pair of sneakers, there are so many great ways to style a sweater vest. Because we consider the layer to be a true investment piece and wardrobe essential that you'll wear over and over again, we went ahead and shopped out our selections for the 11 best sweater vests so you can achieve the ultimate on- and off-duty looks. Browse our picks below, and find your new favorite layer for fall, winter, and beyond.",
