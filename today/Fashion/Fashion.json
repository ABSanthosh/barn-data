    "description": "Bubble skirts are the bottoms to have on your radar this fall. The voluminous, hyperfeminine style that dominated summer is no fleeting trend: Its hold on fashion continues into the colder months, proving it’s more versatile than you might think. The puffy-hemmed bottoms appeared across fall/winter 2024 runways, from Simone Rocha’s demure sheer minis to Molly Goddard’s wide tulle midis. Nicolas Ghesquière doubled down on bubble skirts in Louis Vuitton’s Cruise 2025 collection — and Zendaya gave them her seal of approval at the brand’s spring 2025 show during Paris Fashion Week. Alaïa, meanwhile, introduced funnel-like versions for spring/summer 2025 and Chloé brought out light-toned, embroidered styles. We know bubble skirts have staying power — they’ve been a statement piece since the ‘80s, when Vivienne Westwood’s punk puffballs and Christian Lacroix’s extravagant, layered skirts were party wear staples. They’re still fun and festive but can also be styled down for more casual activities. Fall calls for a bubble skirt on top of jeans or trousers to channel that Y2K aesthetic, with tights or thermal leggings for extra warmth, or with a matching top for a co-ordinated look. Style with sneakers, heels, or knee-high boots and don’t be afraid to experiment with color and pattern, too. Ready to find the right bubble skirt for you?

The holiday season is fast approaching, which means we’re already thinking about what we’ll be wearing to every festive event coming up. But it looks like we can check “outfit planning” off our to-do list thanks to the new Gap x Cult Gaia collaboration.  Launching today, the 35-piece collection fuses Gap’s timeless everyday essentials with the LA-based brand’s occasion-worthy flair. The line comprises modern takes on pieces that can be worn to parties and out, or on the other end of the style spectrum, while running errands or cozying up at home. Find a denim bustier, a matching chocolate brown leather pants and jacket set, a backless white button-up, cropped knit cardigans, a vegan suede coat, and crewneck sweatshirts with “GAIA” adorned on the front in the classic Gap font.  Of course, as should be expected from the It Girl brand that rose to popularity for celeb-beloved styles like Cult Gaia’s Serita, the collection also features dresses, like the mini slip with chain-link shoulder straps and a long-sleeve maxi with hip cut-outs. Alongside the womenswear pieces, the collection also includes kids’ apparel.  562821012 WOMENS WOMENS KNITS ACT TOPS GAP X CG LOGO CREWNECK ONLINE , 562951012 WOMENS WOMENS BOTTOMS LONG PAN GAP X CG CARGO PANT ONLINE , 646752002 WOMENS WOMENS OUTRWR/ITEMS LTHR/SDE GAP X CG FAUX SEUDE COAT ONLINE “Reimagining Gap’s classic icons through Cult Gaia’s lens has been an amazing journey.

This year alone, the American brand has teamed up with lifestyle brand Madhappy and LA label Dôen, as well as released a version of the viral shirtdress Anne Hathaway wore on a red carpet that was designed by new creative director Zac Posen.  Gap x Cult Gaia is available to shop online and in select Gap stores now.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Spooky season has finally arrived, so it’s time to decide which Halloween costume you’ll be wearing on October 31 and Halloweekend. While you can go as a tried-and-true witch or cat, with the simple addition of a hat or ears, this past year has brought us many notable pop culture moments that are too good to pass up on. The 2024 Paris Olympics captured the world’s attention with viral athlete memes and Brat green took over our Instagram feeds while a baby hippopotamus warmed our hearts.This year’s film and music releases provided plenty of costume inspo, too. From blockbuster movies like Challengers and Saltburn to the much-anticipated Wicked film adaptation to chart-topping music releases from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Beyoncé to Chappell Roan’s festival performances, there’s been no shortage of entertainment (or style).With that in mind, read on to get inspiration for your DIY Halloween costume this year, which will no doubt get you best-dressed status at your upcoming parties. Aside from the occasional kitschy prop, we’ve curated pieces that may already live in your closet, or ones you’ll be able to wear outside of spooky holiday festivities. Whether you want to dress up with your friends and relive Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour or keep it more simple (yet still recognizable) as a chef from The Bear, there are many pop culture Halloween costume ideas to be excited about ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 Love Island USA Costume: The PPG Trio You and your besties can be the new bombshells that have entered the villa this Halloween! Season 6 of Love Island USA was one of the most talked-about reality series of 2024, and fast-friends JaNa Craig, Serena Page, and Leah Kateb were a highlight. PPG (AKA Power Puff Gang) brought us heartwarming and hysterical moments, often while wearing complementary outfits. (The trio even wore matching pink, green, and blue bikinis at one point.) Decide which friend is which reality star (and Powerpuff), then pick out trendy pink, green, and blue outfits to wear together. Oh, and don’t forget to hook on a wireless microphone and to strap on a mic belt, like you’re really being filmed for television. DashDividers_1_500x100 Wicked Witch Costume: Glinda \u0026 Elphaba Duo There’s no question that Wicked will be one of the biggest moves of 2024, and a major fashion presence this fall, with Wicked collaborations already dropping. This Halloween, dress up as Ariana Grande’s Glinda or Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba solo or as a duo costume.To channel Elphaba, put together a dramatic black outfit using a satin corset, tulle skirt, and sheer cape. And don’t forget to swipe some green onto your face and arms for the full effect. For Glinda, be pretty in pink in a ruffled or puff-sleeve dress. Accessorize with a tiara, wand, and statement heels that are just as whimsical.Now, the only question is… are you a good witch or a bad witch? DashDividers_1_500x100 Beyoncé Costume: Cowboy Carter Cowgirl View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) Beyhive assemble, because Beyoncé has brought us yet another era of music (Country) and fashion identity (Western) that we’re eager to replicate. Rather than dressing up as your average cowgirl this Halloween, be Cowboy Carter herself. Take inspiration from Beyoncé’s album cover art, music videos, or new Levi’s campaign and create an ensemble full of denim and leather, accessorizing with statement cowboy boots and a customized sash. DashDividers_1_500x100 Olympian Costume: Team USA Stars The 2024 Summer Olympics brought out some of the most wholesome and inspiring moments of the year. Team USA brought home 126 medals across all the sports, but there were certain moments and athletes that made an even bigger impact than any medal could. From gymnastics superstars like Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and Stephen Nedoroscik (AKA pommel horse guy AKA Clark Kent) to the “fastest woman in the world” Sha’Carri Richardson and TikTok-viral rugby player Ilona Maher, we’re excited to channel America’s real-life superheroes this Halloween.Look out for a red-white-and-blue activewear, bedazzled leotards, rugby jerseys, or official Team USA Ralph Lauren merch. Bonus idea: Make it a group costume by dressing like the gymnastics “Golden Girls” crew. DashDividers_1_500x100 Saltburn Costume: A Midsummer Night’s Dream Party Boy Although it was released in theaters in November 2023, Saltburn blew up when it started streaming on Amazon Prime Video a month later. The conversation around the divisive thriller carried over well into 2024 — and, whether you loved or hated the culture-rattling film starring Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan, you can agree that it gave us some pretty strong indie sleaze costume inspiration. You can dress up as either Felix or Oliver at their A Midsummer Night’s Dream-themed party in a simple (off-theme) white tank top with gold angel wings or a white blazer (preferably with floral embroidery) and antlers.   DashDividers_1_500x100 Brat Green Costume: A Charli XCX-Approved Outfit View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charli (@charli_xcx) We just lived through a pretty iconic Brat Summer, defined by dance pop, carefree partying, and Brat green, of course. The viral color has become synonymous with Charli XCX and her album Brat, which will be getting a star-studded remix on October 11. Channel the vibes of Summer 2024 through quirky accessories like jewelry, handbags, and tights for a head-to-toe neon-chartreuse fall look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sabrina Carpenter “Taste” Duo Costume View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter) Carpenter knows a thing or two about dropping drool-worthy music videos and looks (from the red carpet to the stage). Her recent video, for Taste, features the performer alongside Beetlejuice star Jenna Ortega rivaling over a boy while looking drop-dead gorgeous. Dress up as Sabrina in a ‘50s-inspired gingham capri set covered in washable fake blood. And have your bestie join in on the fun, wearing a sleek tweed dress while holding an inflatable chainsaw balloon. DashDividers_1_500x100 Challengers Costume: Tashi Duncan Oh, the whirlwind experience that was watching the Challengers film… and admiring the on-theme press tour looks that came before it. When she wasn’t wearing a 2000s velour tracksuit jacket in the film, Zendaya’s tennis star Tashi Duncan sported classic activewear like tennis dresses, court sneakers, and the Loewe graphic T-shirt. If you want to turn this into a group costume, recreate the film’s love triangle with characters Art and Patrick in their striped button-downs and backwards hats. Or channel the final scene with the jaw-dropping tennis racket moment for the ultimate photo op. DashDividers_1_500x100 Moo Deng Costume A viral baby hippo wasn’t on our 2024 Bingo card, but we’re glad it happened. Moo Deng, which translates to “bouncing pig,” is a pygmy hippo in a Thailand zoo who went viral after videos of her sassiness and wet-glazed donut-meets-glass skin appearance quickly spread in September.If you want to channel the adorable Rhode-worthy ambassador, embrace blushed cheeks, glossy lips, and slicked-back hair. Then wear any gray or metallic silver dress you desire (and can wear again afterward). Accessorize with light pink jewelry, bags, or shoes, and throw on hippopotamus ears for good measure. DashDividers_1_500x100 Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour Group Costume One of the biggest cultural phenomenons of 2024 was (and still is) Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, where the star performs songs from her many original and re-recorded albums. These fashion-forward mega concerts have inspired fans to dress up like the singer’s different “eras,” from Lover and Red to Reputation and Folklore (or 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department).Relive your concert by re-wearing your concert outfit and commemorating the magic that was the Eras Tour. Or if you didn’t get a ticket, take Halloween as your chance to finally dress up with your besties in styles that symbolize your favorite Taylor Swift album, or replicate the costumes the singer wore on stage herself. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Bear Costume: Season 3 Chefs Everyone’s favorite stress-inducing “comedy” series made another splash this year with a third season. We’re talking about the award-winning dramedy The Bear. Channel any of the loveably flawed characters by wearing a dark blue apron and a white top (fashion props if it’s from Thom Browne). Draw on faux tattoos with an eyeliner pencil like Carmi, or throw on a colorful headscarf like Sydney. Complete your look with chef-approved on-trend clogs, some beat-up dish towels, and go on your way shouting “Yes, chef!” to everyone you cross paths with. DashDividers_1_500x100 Chappell Roan Costume: “Pink Pony Club” View this post on Instagram A post shared by ･ﾟ: *✧ Chappell Roan ✧*:･ﾟ (@chappellroan) Although The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess album debuted in 2023, it wasn’t until 2024 that Roan exploded on the mainstream music scene. Now, the pop diva’s campy songs, high-energy performances, maximalist stage costumes, and drag queen-inspired makeup are ubiquitous.While the singer’s costumes and color palettes constantly shift and evolve from performance to performance, many of her signature looks include cowboy hats, bedazzled bodysuits, fringe, and lots of pink. Join the “Pink Pony Club” this Halloween by wearing pink-everything and donning a red curly wig. Or if you want to switch it up, replicate other iconic Chappell looks, like the Statue of Liberty at Governor’s Ball. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bridgerton Costume: The Season 3 Featherington Reign Season 3 of Bridgerton put Penelope Featherington (AKA Lady Whistledown) into the spotlight as she unwillingly searched for a husband. At first a wallflower dressed in cutsey florals, Penelope’s confidence and style evolved into more mature, deep gem tones. This Halloween, dress up like Lady Whistledown (or her comical sisters) in a bright citrus-hued dress and lots of feathers (from a hairpiece to a quill pen for writing the town’s gossip column).However, if you connect more with the Bridgerton sisters, instead wear pink, purple, and blue pastels and delicate lace. Better yet, make it a group costume, and dress up as this season’s frenemy duo Penelope and Eloise. Like what you see?

If you’ve ever stood in front of your wardrobe and thought, I have nothing to wear, Net-A-Porter’s fashion director Kay Barron has some advice for you. Her new book, How To Wear Everything, is a no-nonsense guide to dressing, designed to help us worry less about our clothes. Filled with her practical and professional tips alongside advice from people like Sofia Richie Grainge, Law Roach, and Sarah Jessica Parker (no big deal), Barron’s book is helping us to connect with our personal style.  The idea for the book came six years ago: She wanted it to be a “bible” for getting dressed. “Clothes should never be intimidating, they should always make you feel good about yourself,” she tells Refinery29. “I wanted everyone to understand what they want to wear, how they want to wear it and where they want to wear it.” In the book, Barron shares item-by-item tips for every kind of occasion, from heading to the office to going on a first date (which obviously differs from the second and third one). “The thing to remember about making use of everything in your wardrobe is that you don’t have to love everything all the time, and instead you have to know what you will love again in future, so you don’t part with it and regret it later,” Barron says. How To Wear Everything reminds us that clothes play a huge role in our lives, no matter how we feel about fashion. So instead of starting wars with our wardrobes — and our social media feeds, which can make us feel ultra unstylish — we can follow simple style strategies to make our clothing work for us. Below, find a taster of Barron’s sage advice including five wardrobe staples she highlights in the book, along with how to wear them. How To Wear A Black Maxi Coat Don’t underestimate the satisfaction of putting on a long coat that a) goes with pretty much everything and b) makes you feel like you’re in The Matrix. Barron suggests a coat that’s slightly below mid-calf length, straight-cut and single-breasted — and black because it can make you feel however you want. Outerwear is one of Barron’s favorite staple categories. “I will often build an outfit around the jacket I am going to wear with it,” she says. “The complete look is the first impression, and that is important.” How To Wear A Bralette While you might overlook undergarments when auditing your wardrobe staples, Barron’s hawk eye for detail gives tighty-whities more importance. “A good bra or bralette, even if you just see a flash of it, can revolutionize the most basic of outfits, and can even replace a top altogether with the right jacket buttoned over it,” Barron writes.  How To Wear A Hoodie “Off-duty style should be as aspirational as any sort of dressing,” Barron writes. “These are the clothes that we spend our personal time in, and we owe it to ourselves to make even the smallest efforts.” Barron highlights the humble hoodie as a staple of off-duty and on-duty style. Wear a cropped hoodie with high-waisted trousers, an oversized one under a duster coat, or a soft hoodie French-tucked into wide-leg trousers. “Some earrings or a stack of bracelets further serve to take the hoodie off the sofa, out of the gym and into the office.” How To Wear Long Evening Boots For Barron, “long evening boots” means a fitted boot that hits just below or over the knee, has a higher heel and a pointed or round toe. It’s the type of boot you’ll wear to a party or a dinner date or a formal work event. Boots are another of Barron’s favorite staples. “Over-the-knee, stiletto, block heel, flat and probably every other style you can think of are sat in a cupboard in my house just waiting for autumn,” Barron says. “Boots suit about 80% of the weather, and almost every single occasion. I can’t get enough.” How To Wear A Tote Bag Like capsule wardrobes, Barron believes in handbag capsules — and a tote bag should be your hardest working one. Since you’ll use it for work, travel and day-to-day living, she suggests finding a tote bag that goes with everything you wear. “Ensure the handles fit comfortably over your shoulder, even when wearing a large coat, and that they aren’t flimsy. An inner pocket is always useful to keep the essentials.” She also gives practical albeit controversial advice: “Please take time to regularly clean it out — I’d suggest once a week.” To read more of Barron’s no-nonsense clothing advice, How To Wear Everything is available to buy now.  Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In the 1990s and early 2000s, few retail brands were as ubiquitous as Victoria’s Secret. Elevated yet accessible, “Victoria” was in thousands of malls globally, her catalogs in every mailbox, and, most importantly, her bras in every top drawer. In 2001, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show starring “Angels” Tyra Banks, Heidi Klum, and Gisele Bundchen — the first broadcast on CBS primetime — was seen by 12.4 million. But there was no real Victoria. There never was. She was a myth, a fairy tale, not unlike the fantasy the Angels created with their airbrushed bodies and hyper-sexualized personas.  What began as a specialty store in the Bay Area became a household name out of Columbus, Ohio, when retail magnate Les Wexner acquired it in 1982. Lingerie — namely, bras — was always the bread and butter, but clothing and a beauty line helped make VS a true powerhouse in the ‘90s and ‘00s. In the 2010s, though, Victoria started to lose her grip. Brands like Aerie and Skims were gaining market share, the idealized body type was no longer in public favor, and the #MeToo movement was uncovering longtime misconduct within the organization from top executives, including Ed Razek, considered the architect of the VSFS as we knew it. Then came the biggest bombshell of them all: Jeffrey Epstein had been Wexner’s close confidant and financial adviser for years — and posed as a model recruiter to prey on women. In the wake of the news, Wexner resigned as CEO in February 2020, and was out completely the following year. The rise and fall of Victoria’s Secret has been documented in many ways: a podcast, a docuseries, and, now, a book. In Selling Sexy: Victoria’s Secret and the Unraveling of an American Icon, out on October 8, journalists Lauren Sherman and Chantal Fernandez detail the history of the brand, drawn to it because of its massive role not only in retail history but also pop culture. “To us, Victoria’s Secret was something that tells the story of American culture, because American culture is consumer culture,” Sherman says. As they peeled back the layers of Victoria’s Secret, they learned there was more than met the lace-trimmed facade.  “The story is more interesting and more complicated than just that the [campaigns around the] Angels were out of touch and misogynistic,” adds Fernandez. “It goes deeper than that.” Amid Victoria’s Secret’s most recent attempt to rebrand (see: the return of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show next week), Sherman and Fernandez discuss what they think of how the brand engages with nostalgia, what surprised them most when writing the book, and how Taylor Swift fits into the story. What were each of your personal relationships to Victoria’s Secret growing up?Lauren Sherman: I first interacted with it when I was super young. There was an era when, probably 10 years after Les Wexner bought it and it was already a billion-dollar business, that he was really focused on refining the aesthetic. I think we might’ve even used this term “class up the joint.” And he was really into using the narrative that Victoria was part British and married to a barrister. It was all burgundy and florals and just very elegant.  My uncle’s fiancée was from New York, and she was very sophisticated. She bought everyone in my family Victoria’s Secret gifts for Christmas one year — I probably was eight, and she bought me pajamas or something. The first runway show happened when I was 14, I think, so I really was of the era that this really did impact my views and the people around me’s views of what was beautiful. Les Wexner bought Victoria’s Secret the year I was born, so it’s a very similar trajectory.  Chantel Fernandez: I was part of the Pink generation, so that arrived perfectly on time for me and a lot of girls born in the late ‘80s, early ‘90s. I got my first real big-girl bra from there. I don’t remember a time before this brand. It was really dominant in culture, and represented something about beauty and beauty standards. But I thought Pink was fun. I thought the Victoria’s Secret side of the store was really intimidating, and I never really graduated into it. You describe the Pink era really well in the book. I still have one of those little pink dogs somewhere.CF: Those dogs are genius. And the store in general — that’s such a big part of the Victoria’s Secret experience: their retail theater, how much care they put into how it was decorated, just being in there and sampling the lotion with your friends. You didn’t even buy anything. It was an experience to be in there. That’s a huge part of the success of the store and the innovation of that brand. A lot of that came out of Leslie Wexner, who at one point owned Abercrombie. He was thinking really innovatively about store design and how that was a form of marketing in and of itself.  What surprised you most when researching the book?LS: There’s a big narrative around this company that it was run by men — misogynists — who were just kind of doing what they wanted. And, in some ways, that’s true, but also every generation of this business had really strong female executives who were trying to do the right thing, empower women to buy lingerie and to be comfortable in their sexuality. I’d say that what we really tried to do with this book is show the whole story. It’s never just as easy as bad actors. There’s always another side to it. And this company accomplished a lot, and also employed a lot of really remarkable women who changed the consumer culture, the way we shop. It’s not really a revelation, but it’s more of a reminder that no story is so simple.  I’ll share mine: It was surprising just how young these models were. You talk about how Adriana Lima was just 15 when she started, and the model Danita Angell was just 14. LS: That’s super common. That was industry standard at that time in high fashion. There’s a model who’s going to become really famous soon, who just did her first magazine cover — she’s 15 and technically not allowed to work in Paris. Everybody’s talking about her under the radar, but it’s still a thing.  CF:  [The models’] career was sort of meant to end when they’re 22, especially back then. Now, there’s not as much of an age cap. These supermodels are still walking the runway and doing these incredible things, but, when they started, they probably were under the impression that, even if they’re extremely successful, this is done pretty soon. This is an industry where you can be 20 and be geriatric, basically.  Victoria’s Secret attempted to rebrand in 2021. With so many mall brands like Abercrombie and J.Crew having a resurgence, where do you think Victoria’s Secret stands? Do you think the rebrand was successful? LS: Oh, the rebrand definitely hasn’t been successful. [The stock price] might be relatively flat right now, but, if you look at the business, the profits have shrunk. They’ve had a couple good quarters here and there, but they haven’t gained anything yet.  The success of Abercrombie and Fitch and the restructuring of that business is really not focused on nostalgia, but on product and what the consumer wants. The positive momentum Gap has right now is an indicator that these brands can return. The other thing is that consumers are penny-pinching right now, so mall brands have a place.  Also, there’s backlash to things like Shein bras. In some ways, that’s benefitted Victoria’s Secret, because people will just keep going back. But in some ways, it has hurt them, because they can’t apply the exact same playbook that these other businesses have applied. But I do think they still have so much market share, if they’re able to turn around the marketing and create product that gets people excited, there’s a chance that they can have a comeback. Even though, as we know, they never really left.  CF: I don’t think that it’s impossible for them to have a really interesting resurgence. Maybe not to the same degree that Abercrombie has had, which has been so unusually successful. But it’s not like everyone isn’t aware of this brand. They know it. It has the most stores for lingerie. If you still need a bra in a pinch and you fit their size range, that’s a huge advantage they have over the online brands. And a lot of people still want to try on their bras in person. And I think there is a nostalgia factor that they clearly want to play with, and they could, but it’s really tough. A big shadow over the legacy of Victoria’s Secret is Jeffrey Epstein’s business relationship with Les Wexner. How did you approach that piece of the book?LS: I think the hardest thing was deciding how much of it we wanted to devote to that, because we could have pitched this book as a book about the relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Les Wexner. That book would’ve sold very easily, but we didn’t want to do that because the reality is Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t involved in the day-to-day Victoria’s Secret business. And so we decided, as business reporters who cover the fashion industry, that we needed to write a corporate history — and he’s not a giant part of it. So, instead of weaving him through the narrative — which I think the documentary tried to do — we decided, Let’s put that in its own chapter. We could have probably spent five more years reporting this book and maybe would’ve come up with even more revelations around that. But, it’s interesting: If you look at the trajectory of Victoria’s Secret, the trajectory of Jeffrey Epstein, and the trajectory of American culture, the three things really align. Les Wexner severed ties with him in 2007, Victoria’s Secret was on the rise until then. There was foreshadowing in the early 2000s that something might be awry with the business. It peaked in 2016, right around the time of the height of the #MeToo movement, and then it really started to have its downfall around the time that Epstein was jailed.  CF: We put it where we did in the book, which was sort of as the revelations of Epstein were becoming public, because that was really the biggest impact it had. Victoria’s Secret was already in a weakened position, and it just further created problems for them. But it had a reputational impact more than anything else.  Shifting gears, in the book you write that Ed Razek gave Taylor Swift an angel wings ring. That was so interesting because I feel like the rules around who got to wear angel wings were very strict. CF: What I thought was so interesting about that was exactly what you’re saying — these really arbitrary rules about who gets to be an Angel. Like, “Oh, if you walk first in a segment or you close a segment,” and it was all these ways of creating hierarchies that, in retrospect, are kind of depressing. But it was an effective way to create storylines and narratives, and, within this world of the models, it was a reality show that we were watching. Like, “Oh, Taylor’s hanging out with Martha Hunt.” It shows how intertwined the brand was with culture at that time. Taylor Swift doesn’t really do brand work anymore. She really hadn’t played in the fashion or fashion-adjacent space. So it was really unusual and very effective. It was great for Victoria’s Secret while it lasted. LS: I think it’s a real indication of the passing of time. That would never happen today. She’s much more in control of her image and, at the time, felt like she was so in control of it, but now she would’ve never — and forget about all the controversy. It’s just not something that you would imagine. Selling Sexy: Victoria’s Secret and the Unraveling of an American Icon is out now.   Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I don’t know if this is universally true, but, in my experience, therapists love the color burgundy.  I’ve sat in many different therapists’ offices over the decades, and, as a design writer, I often find myself wondering about their decor. How did they choose that menacing Venetian mask? Why would they plop so many plastic plants on their carpet? Why do they seem to gravitate towards heavy furniture? Why do so many of them have maroon couches and rugs? I blame Sigmund Freud, of course.  Freud began his practice in the late 19th century in the opulent city of Vienna. At the time, he was just a humble doctor — no one special. He would go on to become one of the most influential (and controversial) men of the century, his ideas about the human mind making him famous worldwide. But then, his fame rippled outwards, touching everything he touched, from his iconic round lenses to his equally iconic couch. (You can still visit this divan in London, which is the last place Freud lived.) While the latter is beige and rather plain, Freud turned it into something maximalist, piling it with rugs and cushions, all of them red, red, red. But no red is just red. Maybe more so than any other color, red asks for specificity. Orange-red is very different from pinkish-red, which is, again, totally, tonally unlike brown-red. “The varied powers of red are very striking,” wrote painter Wassily Kandinsky in On The Spiritual in Art (1910). “By a skillful use of it in its different shades, its fundamental tone may be made warm or cold.” Our current red, the one making the rounds on social media and hopping off runways and clothing racks, isn’t a hot color. It’s decidedly not a Matisse red, which has more yellow in it and better fits the tomato-girl vibes of summer. It’s not a sporty red, either, nor is it a sexy red. It’s much quieter than that. This burgundy — or bordeaux, to use the currently favored name for the hue — is cool. It speaks not of flame or flowers, but rather of blood and pomegranates. One does not choose bordeaux for a sports car or a sexy strapless dress; you do so for a sumptuous velvet drape or a pair of subtle statement boots.  There’s never any one reason for why a color begins to trend. It’s always a snowball effect: Someone cool wears it, some cool designer features it in their show, some cool marketing executive picks it for a cool new campaign, some cool product designer slaps it on a cool new product or an old (but, again, cool) standby. (A KitchenAid has, of course, never looked cooler.) Then, once the ball is rolling, it begins to grow.  Sometimes, the color is exciting, because we haven’t seen it in a while (see: Peach Fuzz). Sometimes, it’s appealing because we already have it in our closets (hello, Brat Green). Usually, it’s a combination. In oxblood, dark academia meets Freudcore meets standard fall dressing — throw in a dash of The Substance, and you’ve got a fully-fledged color moment.  I happen to love this color. I’m currently seated in a coffee shop in Santa Fe, typing on a laptop I pulled out of my beat-up Madewell leather tote. It’s burgundy — almost purple, but not quite — with a black stripe down the middle. I bought it years ago, seeking a work bag that would look more polished than my nylon backpack. After I splurged for this unremarkable thing, something funny happened: I began buying more pieces, from sweaters to boots to corduroys, in a similar hue. See, burgundy’s always available, because it’s almost (but again, not quite) a neutral tone, easy to match with the other colors that dominate my wardrobe: black, blue, brown, olive. Lately, I find myself reaching for burgundy because it feels homey. It reminds me of the old brick buildings of New York and New England, and the emphasis placed on scholastic endeavors. It reminds me of being young and going off to college in the Hudson Valley, where maroon banners hung from European-style facades and kids went to class in red fleece sweatpants with the school’s logo emblazoned on the side. It reminds me of tradition and transitions — of both becoming and pretending. In many cultures, dark reds are associated with pomp, circumstance, and displays of power. This has been true for hundreds of years, possibly even dating back to the ancients. If you’re a color fiend, you may have already heard of Tyrian purple, a famed dye harvested from carnivorous snails on the Mediterranean shores — what you might not realize that this hue skewed more red than blue in practice: Like many natural dyes, the results changed depending on the underlying color of the cloth and the conditions under which it was steeped, but, while many tend to fade with time, Tyrian purple only gets more vivid. (BBC historian Kelly Grovier notes that this is the “miraculous quality that commanded [its] exorbitant price, exceeding the pigment’s weight in precious metals.”) In ancient Greece, only the richest and most elevated members of society were allowed to don Tyrian purple. Supposedly, Emperor Caligula once killed a visiting guest for daring to wear it, interpreting their outfit as a direct insult to his power.  Over the centuries, it became a little less dangerous to wear reddish-purple, though it was still a favored color for men at the top of the hierarchy. Cardinals wore red, kings loved it, and the pope still famously walks around in little red loafers. Some of these are true crimsons, but others feel more Tyrian in spirit. Writer Jude Stewart argues that burgundy came to “epitomize officialdom,” showing up in Catholic school uniforms and on institutional carpets around the western hemisphere. For Stewart, there’s one often-overlooked reason for this choice: dirt-proofing. (Deep red carpets hide a little schmutz, while burgundy cloaks can undergo plenty of wear-and-tear.) You no longer have to milk a snail to get a durable merlot hue. Today, it’s a perfect cross-over color, fitting equally well into the Mob Wife aesthetic, the Quiet Luxury trend, and even the pop-punk revival. It was big in both the ‘90s and the ‘60s, equally popular with mods and grunges and housewives. It can be ladylike and prim, or neurotic and messy. It looks equally good on a thrashed velvet slip dress as a wool suit. A more contemporary way of wearing burgundy can be found on the 2024 runways, where houses including Gucci, Hermès, Tom Ford, and Miu Miu used dark red leather (real and faux) to create tailored skirts, scoop-neck bra tops, and nostalgia-nodding suiting. While there’s nothing truly groundbreaking about wearing deep, cool reds during the colder months, there is something gratifying about dressing so seasonally, particularly when you can throw in a little spice. A formerly conservative color, burgundy feels newly wild when worn as a leather bustier or in frothy layers of tulle. Maybe Caligula would object, but your therapist (probably) will not.  Like what you see?

The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October.

Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity.

It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn.

Containing rich shea butter and skin barrier-boosting ceramides, the cream aims to improve elasticity while hydrating hyaluronic acid and skin-strengthening peptides draw in moisture, leaving a plump and glowing base for makeup application. The formula is non-comedogenic, too, so it’s less likely to cause breakouts.Shop now at SephoraDr. Dennis Gross DermInfusions™ Blur + Repair Cream, $, available at SephoraDaily Paper x ConverseDaily Paper, which started out in Amsterdam in 2012, celebrates African culture through its luxurious pieces boasting monogram prints.

That’s where Starface’s new recovery patches enter the picture. While the brand’s famous yellow stars aim to shrink spots, the new purple patches are designed to soothe inflammation after an (ill-advised) picking sesh. Containing soothing aloe vera and vitamin A to promote cell turnover, the recovery stars are all about bringing down redness fast. With the addition of licorice root to help with scarring, these patches put in the work to heal skin and get rid of the evidence.Shop now at StarfaceStarface hydro-star® recovery, $, available at StarfacePleasing x Disney Fantasia Revel in the nostalgic magic of the 1940s animated classic Fantasia with Pleasing’s latest collaboration. The Harry Styles-backed brand has partnered with Disney on a line of apparel, accessories, and beauty products inspired by the film. Find three nail polish sets (each of which borrows cues from different segments of the movie), a new edition of the Big Lip HA Moisture Balm, hoodies, tote bags, and more. “When visiting the Disney archives, we had the opportunity to look through lots of archived and special illustrations which was very exciting — especially as a child who went to the Disney parks — getting a peek behind the curtains of how these beautiful movies and moments are made felt truly inspiring,” Pleasing creative director Harry Lambert said, in a press release. “From very early on, Fantasia was always in the front of our minds at Pleasing; the aesthetics, the mood, the bold illustrations, the colors, and, ultimately, the epic world that Disney has created, were very much a world that resonated with Pleasing.” Prices range from $25 to $289.Shop now at PleasingPleasing x Disney Fantasia L’Apprenti Sorcier Tote in Blue, $, available at PleasingREFY Plum Lip CollectionThe onset of autumn might have some people thinking of sunset-colored trees, cinnamon drinks, and baked pumpkin goods; for us, it’s all about the arrival of vampy makeup. A wine-stained lip is arguably the most sophisticated makeup trend for this time of year and REFY is joining the party with a brand-new, plum-hued lip combo. Comprising a dome-shaped Blur Liner and tinted lip gloss, the kit lends a plummy ombre effect that can be diffused by day and built up for a statement look come cocktail hour.

Here’s how to find durable jeans, boots with welly and more• Don’t get Fashion Statement delivered to your inbox? Sign up hereThis week more than most, we have been hearing a certain word uttered in fashion circles. Alongside “janties”, “Hedi Slimane” and “kilts”, a perhaps less expected – or, at least, less glitzy – word has been taking up airtime: durability. It comes off the back of Primark’s new Durability Framework, which the fast-fashion giant says is “designed to set the bar for how retailers can extend the life of their clothing – meaning our customers will ultimately be able to love and wear their clothes for longer”.“Durability shouldn’t be a luxury,” the retailer continued. But while the importance of extending the life of clothes is in no doubt – figures from environmental NGO WRAP show that using an item for nine months can reduce carbon, waste, and water footprints by up to 30% – Primark’s business model is designed to sell masses of clothes at extremely low prices, arguably fuelling a “buy once, wear once” mentality. So it comes as little surprise that Patrick Duffy, founder of the Global Fashion Exchange, describes the announcement as “a textbook example of greenwashing” and “nothing more than a marketing tactic to polish their image”.

And he of all people should know. Wainwright spent his life charting every nook and cranny of the notoriously wet and windy Lake District. But he never let a bit of bad weather get between himself and the great outdoors. And nor should you.Autumn is a surprisingly pleasant time to venture outside. Yes, it can be damp and cold. But let’s focus on the positives: there are fewer people to share the trails with, and the golden-brown leaves create stunning scenery to be enjoyed exclusively by those bold enough to brave the elements. Besides, that crisp autumn air is far more pleasant to hike in than the suffocating summer heat. Continue reading...",

This week, Alex is after skincare tipsThere is so much confusing information on social media about skincare, but it’s crucial to get advice from experts. When puberty starts, hormone levels shift and the skin sometimes becomes oilier and more acne-prone. “The oil can mix with dead skin cells and bacteria which can clog pores, leading to pimples, blackheads, inflammation and acne,” says dermatologist Dr Anna Protasova at Evolution Aesthetics Clinic.The ideal is to balance your skin’s oil production, so using a gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturiser and sunscreen of SPF30 or above is key. “Choose a cleanser that is mild and right for your skin type. Use it morning, evening and after strenuous exercise,” Protasova adds. Applying acne products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can be helpful. Follow this with a light moisturiser with SPF.

So many questions!) often riddled with frustration. It is a reminder that our hair isn’t simply this thing that sprouts from our scalps. It is much more complex than that. It’s about the right products, people and places that help you achieve something that makes you feel amazing. Which we all want. Post summer, when we see our hair in a different (autumnal) light, makes us consider what we can do to make it thicker, shiner, stronger, fuller, healthier… And sometimes we simply want hair that looks less basic. The industry understands this all too well, which is why so many brands launch a ton of product and treatments at this time.We have sifted through many of their offerings and pulled together a hair special to tackle not every single question, but some of the key ones around hair that I hear time and time again. Why is the Dyson so expensive? How do I combat hair loss? What shampoos will give me thicker hair? Do supplements actually work? Who on social media might just inspire me to have a new style or simply embrace the one I already have? I can’t promise you we have all the answers you want, but hopefully it’s an inspiring start.

Or the Britney and Christina years, when music videos and magazines were a montage of hipbones, out and proud above low-rise waistbands, like shark fins poking out of an ocean. There were seasons of Sex and the City that were love letters to toe cleavage. Not to mention the years, too many to mention, that have been in thrall to cleavage itself.Well, now we have a new one. Right now, the erogenous zone of the catwalk is your neck. Don’t stress about what hemline to wear. Don’t waste time worrying whether black opaque tights are in or out.

Why is the industry so slow to reform?In just over a fortnight, some of the UK’s biggest fashion brands will showcase their new collections at London fashion week. Organised by the British Fashion Council (BFC), it’s always an exciting moment, bringing together some of the country’s top creative talent. But it also highlights entrenched problems in fashion. Only 3.4% of BFC members have published public targets to reduce their emissions aligned with the Paris Agreement, according to a new report by ethical fashion not-for-profit Collective Fashion Justice.The BFC is a body of organisations from the industry who are responsible for overseeing, supporting and advising on the key issues facing the British designer industry, with members including publishing houses, high street brands and retail destinations, including household names like Yoox, Net-a-Porter and Savile Row. Of these members, only five brands – Burberry, Mulberry, Margaret Howell, Rixo and Kyle Ho – have published science-based targets aligned with the Paris agreement, which would, according to CFJ, “make them effective targets worth working towards”. By stark contrast, 44% of all UK companies have a structured plan to reduce their carbon footprint and climate impact, according to recent data from the Climate Ready Index. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Every year at this time, we find ourselves craving new sweaters - you just can't beat that thrill of finding a new knit or sweatsuit sets to cozy up in all season long. And while we're firm believers that you can never have too many sweaters in your clothing stock (especially if you live somewhere cold), dishing out the money to spend on a variety of styles is often a burden on our wallets. Fortunately, there are plenty of stylish sweaters out there that are equal parts cozy and affordable, and we've recently discovered a few of our favorites from Amazon. It's no secret that the retailer is a hub for deals across pretty much every major category. But when it comes to fashion, the retailer delivers in more ways than one with a massive selection of knits and other top-rated clothing, all at unbelievably low prices - we're talking so affordable, you won't have to spend a penny over $21. Whether you want an elevated yet comfortable sweatshirt or a fitted turtleneck for layering, we've got choices that'll impress you. Take a look at our favorite Amazon sweater options for $21 and under, and score a few before they sell out. With deals like this, we have no doubt they'll be gone in the blink of an eye.

    "description": "Dressing everyone from Lady Gaga to Kerry Washington, Brandon Maxwell is a name synonymous with luxury celebrity fashion. Met Gala red carpets, runway shows, state dinners, and daytime talk shows - his designs have graced the most iconic carpets and venues, and now everyone can have a piece of Maxwell's midas design touch. Since 2021, Maxwell has been applying his high-fashion flair to Walmart as creative director for Walmart's Free Assembly and Scoop brands, designing elegant yet accessible clothing for everyday wear. \"My job as creative director for Scoop and Free Assembly allows me to combine all of my favorite creative endeavors, and I feel incredibly grateful to be making this work for our customers,\" Maxwell tells PS. For his latest Free Assembly Fall 2024 collection, Maxwell embraces the essence of modern Americana with high-waisted jeans, quilted jackets, ruffled blouses, and a color palette that includes olive, navy, mustard, and, of course, red, white, and blue. The collection, available in sizes XS-XXXL / 0-20, features a range of chic wardrobe essentials, from denim midi dresses and chevron knit cardigans to classic staples like white tees and trench coats. \"Free Assembly is all about individuality, and the variety of products allows you to freely assemble a look that represents who you want to be on any given day,\" says Maxwell. This spirit of freedom and diversity is reflected in the star-studded campaign, which features Danielle Brooks, Jeremy Pope, Lana Condor, and Max Greenfield. \"They have strong individual personalities and styles with a point of view, and I think they perfectly represent what the brand is about,\" Maxwell shares about the campaign stars. \"Beyond that, they were just incredibly kind and fun to work with.\" Each model speaks to this theme of freedom with the message: \"I'm free to open up, I'm free to go with the flow, I'm free to show my stripes.\" Image Source: Walmart The self-taught designer has envisioned this collaboration with Walmart \"for many, many years.\" He explains, \"I always wanted to work with Walmart because I have always believed that everyone should have access to fashion that helps them feel their best, no matter the price. For years, I would tell anyone who would listen how much I wanted to collaborate with Walmart, so it is quite literally a dream come true to be doing what I am doing now, and I am thrilled with the experience thus far.\" He adds, \"Building these Walmart brands together with the talented, best-in-class design teams I work with every day has been such a joy. Putting my years of experience into creating images, campaigns, and fashion experiences has been a big highlight for me.\" The designer's runway shows are a staple of the New York Fashion Week schedule (his Fall 2023 show on Valentine's Day featured individualized boxes of chocolate for guests) - but how does he unwind after? Maxwell says spending time at home reading the newspaper with his dog on his lap and setting a beautiful table for dinner are \"big hallmarks of a perfect weekend.\" Sure fans of both his eponymous line and Walmart collaboration would agree. Ahead, discover some of Maxwell's favorite pieces from his latest Free Assembly collection. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kacey-musgraves-reformation-bunny-dress-review-49397411",
    "description": "I won't lie to you, the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection does not align with my typical aesthetic. But the 36-year-old singer, who is currently on tour promoting \"Deeper Well\" - which was just nominated for CMA's album of the year - wears it well. The 17-piece capsule collection aims to showcase Musgraves's personal style and music evolution. It has an English countryside feeling, composed of rich plaids, delicate lace, Victorian bows, equestrian boots, and vintage denim corsets. In a word, it's romantic - which is not how you'd describe even a small chunk of my wardrobe. While I love avant-garde shapes and bold colors, and would even describe my fashion sensibility as ever-changing, I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress ($248). Since the collaboration was dropped in stores and online on Sept. 16, this dress has quickly become one of the most popular silhouettes, largely thanks to Musgraves's appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" The Bunny was the first item she wore from the line she helped design, teamed with a pair of simple black heeled mules. I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress. \"I got to curate every single detail of this whole line,\" she told Meyers. \"There's denim, there's headscarves, there's boots, dresses - it's very romantic and I'm really proud of it.\" She continued, \"It wasn't something I just slapped my name on. I really wanted to bring the 'Deeper Well' aesthetic into a different dimension.\" Musgraves went on to reveal that she worked with Reformation for a full year on production, and then shot the campaign in the Cotswolds in England, with her little sister Kelly Christine Sutton behind the camera. \"I keep saying this is the perfect line for you to just frolic around in,\" Musgraves said. And while I've never bought a dress that made me think of frolicking in the meadow (what meadow?), Musgraves's on-screen look was so appealing, I knew I wanted to put my personal touch on it and try to make it my own. What happened when I actually got my hands on the Bunny mini and tried it on surprised me even more. Not only did I feel comfortable enough to embrace my girlier, dare I say demure-leaning, side, I also accessorized with frilly socks and Mary-Janes, a nod to Musgraves's iconic campaign. Scroll to learn a bit more about the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collaboration ahead, then read my full review of the Bunny Dress. Related: Taylor Swift Rehearses in a Denim Workout Dress - Here's How It Holds Up in the Gym What Are the Most Popular Pieces in the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Collection? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection is comprised of 17 pieces that range in price from $28 to $498. The Bunny dress is definitely one of the most popular pieces, likely because it was the first style Musgraves debuted when she paid a visit to Seth Meyers. The exact version she wore is still in stock in every size, except for in petite, where most sizes are currently waitlist only. According to Reformation, the collection sold very quickly, with the Deeper Well Denim Shirt and Dallas Denim Corset being first to sell through - although most sizes are currently restocked at this time. The Silver Lining Cashmere Two Piece also gets plenty of search, and it's currently available in both gray, and almost every size in camel. Is the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Collection Sustainable? Like all of Reformation's clothing, Kacey Musgraves x Ref prioritizes sustainability. You can read about the brand's commitment to sustainable production methods here, but the 17-piece collection does incorporate deadstock fabrics, regenerative wool, and recycled cashmere, minimizing every shopper's carbon footprint. About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress It comes in three different shades: Brown Plaid, Black, and Chianti (a wine red). It's available in sizes 0-12 and is designed to be fitted at the bodice with an A-line skirt that slightly fans out at the hemline. It's available in petite sizing in all three colorways. You can visit any US Reformation store that offers hemming to have the dress altered for free. The dress material is crafted from deadstock fabric that consists of polyester, rayon, wool, and spandex, and it is dry clean only. Shipping is free, and you can finance your purchase in $62 increments. What I Like About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection comes with a signature tag that suggests exclusivity, which is especially appealing for fans. Like most of Reformation's clothing, the Bunny Dress feels well-made and isn't too flimsy or thin. It comes lined and the scoop-neck is comfortable. Neither the elastic at the sleeves or the lace trim felt itchy against my skin during wear. But I think I discovered my favorite element of this dress before I even left the house: It's actually very versatile. We saw Musgraves wear it with mules on the aforementioned talk show; I liked how it looked in the mirror with knee-high boots, my Steve Madden loafers, and the cranberry Mary-Janes and socks combination that Musgraves and I both successfully pulled off; and podcast host and author Tinx even wore it with the Franklin Boots that are part of the collection. Finally, the dress definitely fits true to size. I'm wearing a 0, which is my typical size, and it fit like a glove. What to Consider Before Buying the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress If you love a dress that's machine washable, unfortunately, the Bunny is dry clean only to preserve all the delicate details. However, in my opinion, this is a year-round investment piece that works with tights and boots in the winter and bare legs and flats in the summer, so I think it's worth the trip to the cleaners. Price-wise, this dress does err on the expensive side when it comes to a minidress, but, again, it can be dressed up or down and works for many different occasions. If you're considered petite like me (I'm 5'1\"), I would recommend trying out the shorter iteration, but I actually felt satisfied with the length of the regular size, which suggests a petite cut might have been too short for my liking. Where Can You Buy the Kacey Musgraves Bunny Dress From Reformation? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Bunny Dress is currently only available on the brand's website.

    "title": "Confirmed: This Free People Jacket Is the Perfect All-Seasons Style",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/free-people-chloe-jacket-review-49396350",
    "description": "In my world, some things are inevitable come fall: cooler temperatures, pumpkin spice products consuming my local Trader Joe's, my mom playing Christmas music in her car as early as September, and - perhaps most predictable of all - me buying a new Free People jacket that I'll wear through the new year. While some people might kickstart their autumnal festivities with an apple-picking excursion, my fall doesn't really begin until I've added a cozy, new Free People style to my closet. Last year's elected favorite was none other than the Pippa Packable Puffer Jacket - which is still my go-to travel jacket. My style of choice this season, however, is the Free People Chloe Jacket ($198). I'm far from the first person to fall in love with the comfy jacket; not only has it been bubbling up on TikTok, but the topper is also regarded as one of Free People's bestselling styles. With its flattering fit, quilted composition, and wide array of pattern options, it's not hard to see why this statement piece has garnered so much attention - along with a permanent spot in my wardrobe. Ahead, I break down what makes this Free People jacket one of fall 2024's best coats. What I Like About Free People's Chloe Jacket First and foremost, I love just how endlessly comfortable this jacket is. It's made from a lightweight cotton and rayon material, with a polyester filling that's plush and squishy; it's like getting all the benefits of a cozy down jacket rolled into the structure of a chunky cardigan. The material isn't so heavy that I feel overwhelmed or constricted, but it's also just thick enough to where I can comfortably wear it in lower winter temperatures. This jacket's styling versatility is also endless - whether I want to layer it with a basic T-shirt or team it with a bulky sweater, the product's oversize fit makes it functional enough to work with so many different clothing types. And I appreciate that despite having a steeper price tag, I feel like I'm getting the most for my money with this Free People jacket. I've been wearing it nonstop already this fall (even in 70-degree temperatures) and I know that I'll have no issue wearing it throughout the colder winter months, too. With its floral design, I could probably even get away with donning it throughout the spring season! Its lightweight build is so unique, I honestly forget that I'm often wearing a jacket at all. Plus, the style's packable design makes it a great option for travel. Whether I'm embarking on a road trip or jet setting to another country, it's a style that doesn't take up too much packing space in my carry-on suitcase. What's Worth Noting Unlike traditional zippered or button-down jackets, this style is fitted with hook closure accents, which keep both sides of the jacket pulled together for a more closed-in look. On occasion, the hooks will unlatch and I'll have to reattach them; overall, I find myself fidgeting with this jacket more as opposed to standard zippered styles. Additionally, because of its dolman silhouette, the layer also has a boxier design. The looser fit gives the jacket a lived-in feel that I enjoy, but other reviewers noted it was a bit too oversize for their preferences. I recommend referencing Free People's style guide to source your perfect size, and consider sizing down if you're concerned about it being too large on you. Who Is Free People's Chloe Jacket Best For? If you're in the market for a style that you can comfortably wear through even the most confusing transitional weather - from chilled mornings to warm afternoons and cold nights - this Free People jacket will be your new go-to. It's breathable enough that you won't feel bogged down by heavy material, but its quilted design also ensures ample warmth and insulation in lower temperatures. With a wide variety of pattern and color options, you won't have any trouble finding your dream style - or even stocking up on the jacket in multiple variations (because the more, the merrier!). Additional Details The jacket is available in US women's sizes XS through XL. It comes in 12 different pattern and color options, including a checkered black and white style, striped red and brown variation, and a floral maroon combo (my print of choice). This jacket is crafted from a quilted fabrication that's plush and surprisingly warm, with an insulated design that'll help users stay warm in brisk seasonal temperatures.

    "description": "For us, we think the key to nailing fall fashion is all in the layering. Sure, it's important to have a few staple sweaters and coats incorporated into your closet, but the real trick is figuring out how to style all of those pieces together. Enter the cardigan - aka one of fashion's most timeless and trusted wardrobe essentials that you could argue is a basic worth having on hand in any season (though it's especially great for fall and winter). Cardigans have long had a reputation for being more of an understated, even boring, layer, but our latest online shopping spree proves that they're actually anything but. We've fallen back in love with the classic cardigan style, not only because of all the modern silhouettes you can shop, but also because there are so many creative ways to wear them. So long as you've got a white tank top, a great pair of jeans, and a cute cardigan, you have an outfit that can take you pretty much anywhere you need to go. Our shopping experts narrowed down our picks for the best cardigans for women that we think are worth adding to your fall wardrobe ASAP. Whether you want an editor-loved cashmere piece, something vibrant and colorful, or a cropped cardigan that's cut in all the right ways, the options are endless. Keep reading to shop our selects!

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/ugg-tasman-slippers-review-49308616",
    "description": "If celebrity street style is any sort of indicator on what's cool and trendy in the world of fashion, then UGG platform slippers might be the most popular style this season. The cozy shoes certainly aren't new to mainstream fashion, but with celebrities like Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, and Hailey Bieber constantly donning the slippers - whether it be while trotting around New York or in between red carpet events and Pilates classes - the comfy shoes have definitely ascended into a new realm of popularity (and I'm not the least bit mad about it). In fact, I've been so mesmerized by the overwhelming love that celebrities have for the UGG Tasman Slippers ($110) in particular, I decided to purchase a pair for myself and lucked out that they just happened to be in stock (the slippers are seemingly always sold out). Could I get away with wearing them to the grocery store? Are they durable enough to hold up on my evening walks? Do they truly look good on everyone, or are they just cute on Hadid? (This is actually a recurring thought in my day-to-day life.) These were just a few of the questions I sought to answer when testing out UGG's bestselling slippers. Now that they're back in stock (and likely only for a limited time), ahead, I break down my full experience with the shoe - including how they fit, where they're available to shop, and whether they're truly worth the splurge (spoiler alert: they totally are). What I Like About These UGG Slippers The obvious appeal of these shoes is just how comfy they are - and yes, they're as irresistibly soft and cushiony as you'd imagine. The style boasts a durable leather composition that's sturdy but not too firm to the point where it feels uncomfortable to wear them. Dyed sheep fur lines the inside of the style, and while it certainly creates a cozier feel, I appreciate that the material isn't too thick or overbearing to the point that my feet start to feel sweaty. Unlike other everyday slippers, this style has a rubber sole base that's thick and designed to last, so I don't have to worry about whether it can withstand being worn on surfaces like concrete, tile, or grass - it holds up well and has just enough of a platform that the slipper's material doesn't dirty when being worn beyond my apartment. I love that these shoes seamlessly blend comfort with functionality and the fact that they're versatile enough to be worn in a number of environments, such as running errands, grabbing brunch, going to and from the gym, or even just around my home. What's Worth Noting I've had these slippers for almost eight months now, so I've had plenty of time to break them in. Because I work from home and generally only wear them inside or whenever I need to run a quick errand outside of my apartment, I'm not wearing them super extensively, which is why I've been pretty surprised by how worn down the inside of the shoe feels, particularly around the toe area. I've definitely noticed a change in the cushioning of the shoe, as the inside lining feels more worn down (almost like it's disintegrating or caving into itself), and several knots have even started forming toward the upper sole of the slipper, making it feel bumpy when I walk. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this, especially considering I've owned a handful of UGG boots in the past and never had any issue with them before. Perhaps this is simply the nature of what happens when you wear a pair of slippers as frequently as I do - things do eventually have to wear down, after all. However, it's worth noting that if you want these slippers to be a mainstay in your closet, you'll likely have to factor in buying a new pair every year - at least if you plan on wearing them as regularly as I do. Who Are These UGG Slippers Best For? If you want a pair of shoes you can comfortably wear around the house, out to run errands, or even for a quick walk through the neighborhood, these UGG slippers are a worthwhile investment. I appreciate their versatility and the fact that besides being a great everyday shoe, they're also incredibly comfortable and easy to slip into - even if I'm in a rush or literally running out the door. Additional Details These everyday slippers are crafted in a dyed sheep fur material and feature a rubbed sole base that's designed to be worn outdoors. The shoes are available to shop in a handful of colors, including chestnut brown (my coloring of choice), dark gray, samba red, burnt olive, and more. The UGG slippers come in US women's sizes 5 through 11. Where Are These UGG Slippers Available to Shop? The UGG Tasman Slippers are available to shop at Amazon, Anthropologie, and Zappos.

    "description": "It sounds sort of funny, but there are so many reasons to stand all day, whether you prefer a raised desk at the office; are constantly on the go, taking meetings all over your city; or traveling often, and for long periods of time. The need for stylish and comfortable walking shoes to get you from point A to point B is crucial, which is why we've curated a list of comfy heels and work shoes that provide support and durability. Of course, this all comes down to footwear construction - no matter how much we can appreciate an eye-catching upper. Many of the shoe brands on this list are well-known for their science-backed insole designs, including Marion Parke, started by a podiatrist and foot surgeon-turned-designer; and Vivaia, a sustainable label turning recycled plastic water bottles into machine washable shoes with a honeycomb cushioned footbed. We kept a wide range of styles, budgets, and needs in mind when building this shopping list, so whether you're more of a demure-leaning ballet flats person or a '90s grunge connoisseur, there will be a pair of shoes here for you.

    "description": "Printed dresses are arguably one of the most essential styles to have on hand for transitional weather. From a morning brunch to a happy hour date, a printed dress really is the ultimate frock - perfect for helping you to create a lightweight, hassle-free outfit that will still keep you looking fresh through even the busiest schedules. When it comes to playful fall fashion, we're convinced that perhaps the only thing better than a printed dress is a halter, cutout, and maxi printed dress. We love a good pattern as much as the next fashionista - especially if it helps to elevate an otherwise breezy or minimalistic style with a more statement-making touch. So it's no surprise that we're equally as taken with the bold elegance provided by a chic, printed dress. Spend a few minutes browsing the internet for one of these styles and you'll find, evidently, that there are a lot of printed dress options to shop at the moment - with gowns that feature everything from geometric designs and floral-adorned prints to so many other eye-catching styles that are perfect for nailing all your fall weddings and events, no matter the dress code. We've shopped out a few of our favorite printed dresses below, with styles from Amazon, Nordstrom, Asos, Anthropologie, and more. Read on to browse our picks.

For us, that means hunting down everything from seasonal shoes to handbags, and although we might not be experiencing sun-soaked days anymore, fall is also a great time to pick out a new pair of sunglasses.

    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style snapshots. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. After several seasons of digital-only or hybrid-presentation models due to the pandemic, New York Fashion Week has officially returned back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. From Sept. 6-10, Fashion Week brought together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the spring/summer 2025 season. They stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts (especially coming off the US Open), texture play, co-ord sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites, when necessary given the humidity in New York, were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS senior content director Jessica Andrews, PS associate director of Shopping Sarah Wasilak, and PS assistant editor of Shopping Kyley Warren attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.
