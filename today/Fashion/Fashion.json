If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s not quite sandal weather, but we’re more than ready to ditch our winter boots. Enter: a fresh pair of spring sneakers — the perfect way to manifest warmer days and embrace new beginnings.While fall’s back-to-school season brought us bold sneaker trends like Mary Janes and ballerinas (which Refinery29 readers devoured), spring is ushering in loads of new statement-making pairs. Some, like leopard prints and platform soles, have endured, while others — think hiking sneakers and shoe charms — are stepping into the spotlight and earning their place in your rotation. Read on for the spring sneaker trends that’ll be everywhere over the next few months plus, the best styles to shop now. DashDividers_1_500x100 Silver Sneakers Metallic sneakers have been trending for a while, but this spring, it’s all about silver. From slim, sporty silhouettes to cushy, chunky soles, brands are embracing chromatic finishes in every form. Need more convincing? Cecilie Bahnsen just debuted a new Asics silver sneaker collab at Paris Fashion Week, proving just how versatile this metallic can be, dressed up or down with any outfit. DashDividers_1_500x100 High-Top Sneakers Queue the Rocky theme music — boxing-style sneakers are officially in the ring. And yes, you can wear them whether you’re training for a match or just making a statement. This might be the boldest take on the retro-meets-sporty sneaker resurgence. Whether you score a pair from an athletic brand or a high-fashion house, there’s no shortage of standout styles — especially in spring-ready shades like pink and yellow. You can also lean into the high-top trend with basketball-inspired kicks (chock-full of March Madness energy). Style them with classic athleisure or spring dresses for a knockout look. DashDividers_1_500x100 Sneaker Charms Bag charms have been stealing the spotlight — think beaded keychains, mini plushies, and coin purses — but now it’s time to give shoe charms their moment. Your sneakers deserve a little razzle-dazzle, too! From jewelry-inspired accents to quirky baubles and statement laces, these decorative add-ons usually come in sets, so you can mix, match, and customize to your heart’s content. Options abound, from beaded bows and vintage-y trinkets to shoelace clips and more. DashDividers_1_500x100 Animal Print Sneakers Yes, animal print — especially leopard spots — is still going strong in 2025. But to stay ahead of the trend curve, there are a few more patterns to keep on your radar this spring. Our prediction? Going all-in on cow print with sneakers as part of the equation. Zebra stripes and snakeskin are also making waves across both lifestyle and athletic sneakers, including fun pops of color for a truly wild approach. DashDividers_1_500x100 Hiking Sneakers Hiking sneakers aren’t just for the trails — they’ve been hitting the streets, especially during Fashion Month. Translation: you don’t have to be an avid nature enthusiast to embrace their rugged aesthetic. Features like supportive and cushioned insoles, grippy outsoles, and durable waterproof materials make them an all-around win for days you’re clocking 10K steps or more.  And thankfully, the era of clunky, not-so-cute hiking shoes is long gone. Vibrant, retro-inspired color combos and versatile neutrals lean into the “dad sneaker” vibe with a fashion-forward twist. DashDividers_1_500x100 Platform Sneakers Okay, platform sneakers never really went out, but right now, they’re majorly in. While suede Isabel Marant wedge sneakers made a comeback in fall 2024, we’re betting on souped-up classics this season, especially tried-and-true white versions as the look. Whether you go for a sleek, minimalist pair or a chunky, futuristic take, consider it the perfect way to dodge spring puddles in style. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Whether you’re hauling your laptop, gym gear, and makeup bag on a marathon commute or strolling to your neighborhood coffee shop with your tablet and a dream, one thing’s clear: a great work bag is a must. And let’s be real — that flimsy canvas tote doubling as your grocery hauler just isn’t cutting it anymore. Ready to upgrade? We’ve got you. From sleek leather totes to ultra-functional backpacks — and even business-trip-ready options with luggage sleeves — these picks will keep your essentials safe, stylish, and organized. Want extra fashion cred? Look for suede textures, belted designs, and geometric shapes inspired by 2025’s biggest handbag trends.Whether you’re shopping on a budget or looking to splurge, you’ll find top picks from R29 reader-favorite brands like Calpak, Quince, and Lululemon, alongside fashionable finds from Coach, MZ Wallace, Polène, and more.  Laptops Bags With Compartments Laptop bags with compartments mean business. Think padded sleeves, triple-section interiors, and clever details like customizable inserts. These designs keep your tech secure and your essentials perfectly organized — all while looking sharp on the go.  Business-Trip Ready Travel Bags When it comes to business trips, bags with luggage sleeves are a must. Options like the Béis Work Tote combine sleek, organized interiors with travel-smart features like secure laptop compartments and built-in luggage sleeves. Ideal for navigating terminals or heading straight to meetings, they’re the perfect blend of style and functionality. Bags In Modern Shapes  Modern shapes are the secret to elevating your workwear game. Whether structured and architectural or soft and sculptural, these unique silhouettes add instant interest to your blazers and work pants. Pro tip: carry one to your next interview — it’s a guaranteed way to stand out as a top candidate. Puffy Tote Bags A puffy tote bag or quilted tote bag doesn’t just protect your office essentials — it also brings major winter vibes with its plush, cozy feel. Think of them as the chicest way to keep your stuff safe while looking effortlessly cool (and seasonally on point). Suede Bags Suede is the perfect mix of iconic and on-trend, with a timeless appeal that feels endlessly polished — whether it’s a slouchy or a sculptural take on the classic suede tote bag. This luxe fabric truly shines in rich earthy tones, from olive green to chocolate brown, cementing its status as a standout choice for work bags. Structured \u0026 Ladylike Bags The ladylike trend is here to stay in 2025. Channel the sophistication of the ’30s to ’60s with a structured top-handle, timeless shoulder bag, or trendy belted tote for a polished touch that blends vintage charm with modern refinement.  Work Backpacks Backpacks are our top pick for city commuters, but they don’t have to feel blah or grade-school-inspired. Go for a fun pattern like Rothy’s checkerboard print, water-resistant matte neoprene like the Alo backpack, or sleek leather — something Coach has perfected (see the Coach Lana Bag and Coach City Tote, two forever-favorite work bags). For travelers, a backpack with a laptop sleeve is the ideal blend of function and style.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-cameltoe-proof-thong-editor-review-48661732",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Renee Rodriguez I'm just going to come right out and say it: it's time to talk about cameltoes. We've all been there at one point or another - we slip on our favorite pair of workout leggings and running shoes, only to look in the mirror and see that we can see much more than we bargained for. Namely, the outline of our labia majora. While some of us may have no problem with the idea of showing a little extra, others might not feel so comfortable. I am firmly stationed in the latter camp, which is why when I first heard about the Jiv Athletic Cameltoe Proof High Rise Thong ($35), I knew I had to get my hands on a pair immediately. Like most good things in my life, I discovered the existence of cameltoe-proof underwear while scrolling through my TikTok feed late one night. After seeing one video where a woman was praising how amazing the thongs were, I started seeing more and more videos of women calling out Jiv Athletics for their amazing underwear. (Thank you, TikTok algorithm.) While I eagerly awaited the arrival of my own pair, I decided to read up on what made this underwear so different from everything else I had tried in the past. What I Like About the Jiv Athletics Cameltoe-Proof Thong After receiving them in the mail, I washed them in a delicates bag, hung them to dry, and patiently waited for my turn to finally be free of my dreaded cameltoe. The first time I wore them I decided to try them on with a pair of leggings I purchased a few months ago. In all honesty, I hadn't worn my leggings even once since I purchased them, because no matter how many different pairs of underwear I tried on with them, I was always left with bunching in the crotch area. (I run into this issue a lot with leggings that have a seam down the center.) After I put on my new panties, I immediately noticed how lightweight the fabric was. It honestly felt like butter, and I loved the fact that they were seamless, so I wouldn't run into any issues with panty lines. The underwear is also tag-less, which already made them more comfortable than half of the options in my panty drawer. I wore them all day, and with the exception of when I had to use the restroom, I honestly forgot I was wearing underwear at all – they were that comfortable. And as for my cameltoe? I'll spare you the before photo, but let's just say I would not be wearing these leggings without the assistance of my new favorite underwear. Who Is the Jiv Athletics Cameltoe-Proof Thong Best For If you wear tight-fitting clothing, including workout shorts or leggings, this is the underwear to grab. I'm excited to know that I can now purchase any leggings without needing to worry about bunching, readjusting, or feeling self-conscious. If you're like me, and have been searching for the answer to your cameltoe woes, pick up a pair to add to your underwear collection. Additional Details These underwear are made with recycled fabrics and environmentally friendly dyes. They're also made from 82/18% recycled micro-polyester spandex, and they have an anti-microbial cotton gusset as well as a moisture-wicking outer shell and breathable cotton liner, which helps promote airflow *down there*. The real magic is in the 3D knitted molded spacer fabric, which provides an extra layer of coverage that makes cameltoes a thing of the past. Where Is the Jiv Athletics Cameltoe-Proof Thong Available? The Jiv Athletics Cameltoe-Proof Thong is available to shop on the brand's website and on Amazon.

    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. New York Fashion Week is back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. It brings together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the coming season. This year, they stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts, coordinating sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS Shopping's senior content director Jessica Andrews and associate director Sarah Wasilak attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.",
