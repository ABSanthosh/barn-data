As the Philadelphia Eagles led 24-0 over the Kansas City Chiefs, a pair of jeans worn by the American rapper and Pulitzer prize winner Kendrick Lamar for his half-time performance commanded their own crowd online.Variously identified as bootcut, flared and bell-bottomed, the pair of blue-wash jeans were the object of derision and lust. “Kendrick wearing bootcut jeans was so special,” said the writer and comedian Sophia Benoit on social media. “I could not take my eyes off his hems,” said another user.

    "description": "In all the hype leading up to the 2025 Super Bowl, who could have predicted that the biggest winner of last night's game would be... Kendrick Lamar's jeans? That's right: fresh off the heels of his five Grammy wins at the 67th Grammy Awards, Lamar took the stage for Apple's Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday, Feb. 9, with a headlining performance that included hit songs from the rapper's expansive catalog - including everything from \"Humble\" to \"All the Stars\" featuring SZA and yes, even his infamous Drake diss track, \"Not Like Us\" (currently on repeat today). While the musician's Halftime performance was legendary in its own right (we're still not over that Serena Williams cameo!), Lamar's outfit choice for the spectacle proved to inspire just as much discourse online - specifically his oversize flare jeans. The washed denim pants - which I was able to identify as a now sold-out $1,300 Celine style - weren't quite as flamboyant as a '70s-esque bell bottom, nor were they as tame as a classic bootcut style; but the throwback jeans still felt quintessentially Y2K, with a light wash coloring and exaggerated silhouette that flared at the knees. As a self-proclaimed jean girlie, I love how Lamar's Super Bowl outfit felt like a casual departure from the glitzy performance looks of year's past, and one that signaled the return of retro denim - because of course Kendrick Lamar would be the one to make bell bottoms cool again. Whether you're looking to replicate Lamar's Super Bowl ensemble or simply want a way to tap into the quiet-luxury trend, I scoured the internet and rounded up a few of the best flare jeans for women - with styles inspired by the star's viral denim.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/taylor-swift-thigh-chain-trend-49426008",
    "description": "Taylor Swift is no stranger to initial jewelry, but the pop star's latest take on the trend is helping to usher in a new era for the accessory. Swift attended the 2025 Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 9, wearing a \"T\" thigh chain as a necklace. She paired the jewelry with a white blazer and tank top, matching knee-high boots, and her signature red lip. The necklace features ruby heart stones and a glittery \"T\" initial that could stand for Taylor or her boyfriend Travis Kelce. According to People, the accessory was custom-designed by Swift in collaboration with the star's stylist Joseph Cassell and famed jeweler Lorraine Schwartz. Image Source: Getty Images / Jamie Squire Earlier, at the 2025 Grammys on Sunday, Feb. 2, the musician donned the same initial necklace hanging on her thigh. The beaded chain was situated on Swift's upper left leg, peeking out ever-so-slightly beneath her Vivienne Westwood dress's sky-high slit. Swift's micro frock was adorned with sequin embellishments and featured a statement \"Chiefs red\" color that fans speculated was also a nod to Kelce's team. During the Grammys, Swifties - ever the internet sleuths - immediately drew comparisons between the thigh necklace and lyrics from Swift's Grammy-nominated album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" In the song \"Guilty As Sin?\" she sings, \"What if he's written 'mine' on my upper thigh, only in my mind?\" Admittedly, the whole thing felt very Troy-Gabriella-coded from \"High School Musical 2\" - which the internet reliably depicted in memes. But for fashion girlies (like myself), Swift's thigh chain inspired a different kind of speculation beyond just her boyfriend - including whether or not the star might've just soft-launched a new category of personalized jewelry, and by extension, spring's biggest fashion trend? Image Source: Getty Images / Jamie Squire Body chains and initial jewelry certainly aren't new, but when reimagined together, they offer a whole new approach: you can don the initials of your own name or pay homage to your partner, all while concealing the jewelry beneath your everyday clothes, choosing to playfully tease the accessory like Swift did at the Grammys, or reworking it later as a necklace like she did at the Super Bowl. While the pop star's necklace is custom-made, there are ways to recreate her look before the thigh-chain trend takes off on TikTok. Ahead, I rounded up similar variations of Swift's body chain, with everything from chain belts to lengthy belly chains, initial hand chains, and more. Keep reading to shop the pop-star-approved jewelry trend.",
