    "description": "For Muslims, Jummah has always been a time to dress your best, and a new exhibition documents just what that means for the older and younger generationsEvery Friday, for eight months, people attending Jummah at one of four mosques in Tower Hamlets became familiar with the same sight: a man with a camera and a woman with a clipboard, chatting to men as they entered and left the mosque, as part of a special project.Jummah, or Friday prayer, is a spiritual highlight of the week that brings the spectrum of Muslim communities together. And ever since it was established by the prophet Muhammad – who described Friday prayers as an “Eid” or celebration – there has been an idea of wearing your “Friday best”. What comprises this uniform is wide-ranging, from monochrome ankle-length Arab thobes to colourful south Asian kurtas, easy tracksuits to stylish blazers. The project set out to document the whole range, and forms the basis of a new exhibition in London’s Bethnal Green called Jummah Aesthetics: British Muslim Men and Their Sartorial Choices.

    "title": "How This Entrepreneur Turned Her Biggest Insecurity Into A Clothing Brand",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/perfectdd-clothing-brand-alice-kim?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Before Alice Kim left her corporate job to venture into the world of entrepreneurship, before she launched PerfectDD, her clothing brand that caters to women with large cup sizes and smaller to mid-size frames, before she learned to accept her body after years of loathing that had followed her from childhood well into adulthood, she was known as the “Asian girl with a fuller bust.”  “Kids can be cruel, and that was [my identifier] before anyone even knew my name,” recalls Kim, who always felt like “the other” as the only Asian at her Catholic school. “I was ostracized for being different, and then it was even harder because I started to develop at a really young age. I thought something was wrong with me… it brought insecurities and shame.” The daughter of Korean immigrants, Kim grew up in a traditionally conservative household in Queens, New York. Her mother upheld a modest outlook, which extended to how Kim dressed. It wasn’t just her mom. In high school, she remembers wearing a V-neck for her yearbook picture, only to discover that it was later retouched so that it looked like a full-coverage top. Those feelings of shame followed her into post-grad life at a corporate job, where the expected dress was a button-down shirt and suit jacket. “I’m 115 pounds, a size zero or two, but what fit my frame would always pop open at my chest. If I sized up, I looked frumpy,” Kim tells Refinery29. “I would go to the bathroom, and [find that] the button across my chest had popped open. I was mortified.” I thought something was wrong with me, and I had to change my body. That brought insecurities and shame. For Kim, fashion had always been her escape, nurtured through weekend shopping trips, and hours spent flipping through magazines. She soon pivoted to a career in fashion – starting from the bottom as an assistant buyer and working her way up – but still struggled to find clothes that fit her properly. She relied on tailoring, safety pins and double-stick tape. “After so many years in fashion, I still thought something was wrong with my body,” she says. “Up until my early 30s, I wanted to get a breast reduction.” But when Kim did more research and spoke to other women, she realized that the average bra size in the U.S. is a 34DD. She thought, Wait a minute, this is a huge market opportunity. This realization became the catalyst for PerfectDD. After working her way up to leadership roles like vice president and divisional merchandise manager, Kim started pitching her idea — only to be met with resistance. “People thought it was niche,” she says, recalling the frustrating feedback. Approaching her 40th birthday, Kim knew that if she didn’t take the leap, then she never would. So, she quit her job, and four years later, in December 2020, she launched her brand. “I had a corporate job for 20 years; I didn’t have a founder community. This is my first start-up, and the challenges of navigating and doing everything as a solopreneur were overwhelming.” says Kim. She shouts out the Chase® Ink Business Cash® Credit Card, which boasts robust small business programs that cater to self-starters, for providing her with invaluable resources to not only help her build a network, but also offer support. “[Chase Ink] grew with me as my business grew,” she reflects. With a design approach that’s meticulous and innovative, PerfectDD isn’t just about making clothes — it’s about solving a problem that Kim had faced her entire life. “What differentiates [PerfectDD from other brands is that] I create different patterns for every size,” says Kim. Instead of scaling up or down from a single pattern, she takes the average of real women’s sizes, including her own. This approach is unique and expensive, but necessary to create clothing that truly fits. “I’m willing to take the time and invest in that. Inches, centimeters, even millimeters matter.” One of Kim’s biggest breakthroughs was securing two patents for her designs, including a hidden button technology that addresses the common problem of gaping in button-down shirts. It’s a big deal because around 10% of U.S. patent holders are women, and even fewer are women of color. Kim believes PerfectDD is the most inclusive brand out there, because she takes size and shape into account. “We fit up to size 20, and our cup sizes for shirts fit up to an M cup,” says Kim, who likens her form-flattering tops to curvy jeans that are designed for women with fuller hips and thighs. “We shouldn’t have to change our bodies to fit into clothes that the mainstream media says our bodies should. Fashion brands need to do a better job of creating clothes that fit various shapes and sizes. I think I’m doing my part in filling those gaps.” PerfectDD started with better-fitting T-shirts and sweatshirts made from high-quality Pima and Supima cotton, and the brand quickly gained traction, expanding into capsule wardrobe pieces. And customer reactions have been incredibly moving. “I had a customer who canceled her breast reduction surgery after finding my brand because she finally found clothes that fit; she bought eight more T-shirts and told me it was like finding her uniform,” Kim shares, her voice cracking slightly as she recalls the emotional moment. “[Another customer] said she felt worthy and seen and that she is enough. It keeps me going. I finally feel working hard pays off.” And because she exclusively wears her own designs, she’s something like a walking advertisement for her brand, radiating the confidence she hopes all her customers feel. Her favorite piece? A corset bodysuit that can often be a challenging fit. “For women with a fuller bust, so many times the corset cup is way too small, but mine is full coverage. The last thing I want is to feel self-conscious,” says Kim, who wears hers with a blazer over it for dinner or a cocktail party. We shouldn’t have to change our bodies to fit into clothes that the mainstream media says our bodies should. Fashion brands need to do a better job of creating clothes that fit various shapes and sizes. As a self-funded small business owner, Kim is quite candid about the realities of entrepreneurial life. “I live and breathe work,” she says, gesturing around her small, 650-square-foot West Village apartment that doubles as her workspace. “I don’t just have one role in the company; I’m wearing so many different hats.” And that’s why it’s so important for her to foster a community — support from other female entrepreneurs, and also family and friends. She honors them by naming each piece in her collection after a woman who has inspired her, like Charisse, a friend who volunteered her time to model for free during the pandemic; or Carol, her sister who’s also her therapist and best friend; or Rachel, who was her first patternmaker; or Katie, a loyal customer-turned-model. She credits her Chase Ink Business Cash Credit Card, a dedicated business card that’s separate from her personal credit, for easing some of the financial burdens of entrepreneurship. A cash back card is beneficial, because it helps small business owners accumulate funds on what they’re already spending — Kim, for one, uses those benefits to book flights and buy tickets for her team, or to purchase essential business equipment, like her laptop and printers. In other words, she’s able to use those rewards and invest back into her business. “It’s an added benefit, and I don’t have to stress [about] setting aside a budget because my spending automatically gives me this pool [of cash back] that I know is almost discretionary,” she says. “[Chase Ink] has amazing rewards and perks, so if I’m spending the money anyway, why not reap the benefits?” As Kim looks to the future, she’s focused on expanding PerfectDD and partnering with other brands to bring her patented button-down technology to a wider audience. Kim sees it as a way to bring her innovation to the general public without disrupting anyone’s design — it’s just an added feature that improves the fit. And she hopes to one day lower prices to increase affordability without jeopardizing the quality — something that’s important to her, along with ensuring fair wages, insurance, and worker’s compensation for her factory employees. “I want to reach as many women as possible; it’s a solution and an essential need. It’s not a nice-to-have. I want every woman, every person, to fall in love with their bodies,” she says. “For so much of my life, I wanted to fit in for multiple reasons: race, my body. I always felt different. So I think my story is interesting because it took this long, four-decade journey, but finally, I’m proud of who I am.” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "title": "Is Lululemon's Viral Wristlet Better Than Its Famous Belt Bag? I Investigate",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/lululemon-dual-pouch-wristlet-review-49335470",
    "description": "These days, I'm adamant about removing as much baggage from my life as possible - both metaphorically and literally. I've long been a fan of Lululemon's cult-favorite Belt Bag because of its compact yet functional design, but I've recently been coveting something even smaller for my day-to-day activities - like gym-trips, running errands, or basically any other scenario where I'd prefer to carry as little as possible. Lo and behold, Lululemon is actually the genius behind yet another viral accessory that pairs the brand's signature, sporty aesthetic with a lightweight and easy-to-carry bag design. Enter: the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet ($49, originally $78). Chronically online folks (like myself) are likely all too familiar with this compact accessory, as it's become a mainstay on TikTok's \"For You\" page (and a go-to personal travel bag) for dozens of fashion editors and influencers alike. With all the hype surrounding this stylish pouch, I couldn't help but wonder if the accessory was really worth all of the internet craze, especially in light of the obsession surrounding its mid-size predecessor. Curious - and frankly looking for an excuse to spend my Lululemon gift card - I bought and tested the Dual Pouch Wristlet and sought to answer the many questions surrounding the accessory. Why is everyone so obsessed with Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet? How much can you actually fit in the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Is there a better Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet dupe to shop online? I answer all of that, and more, ahead. How Was I Influenced to Buy the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet? Similar to most of my product buys these days, TikTok introduced and ultimately influenced me to purchase the Dual Pouch Wristlet. For months, I've seen users tout the accessory in videos and Instagram reels, all showing off the different ways that they use the pouch in their day-to-day lives. Some rave that it's their go-to gym bag because it holds their keys, Apple AirPods, and credit cards, all in one convenient place. Others swear it's the perfect bag alternative for travel because it eliminates the fear of pickpocketing thanks to its handheld design. @gabilemoine What should i put in the grey pouch?! Currently i havent put anything in there yet so maybe ill take that piece off for now but if theres something you think i should put in it let me know! #lululemon #lululemoncreator #lululemondualpouchwristlet @lululemon ♬ If It's Lovin That You Want (Sped Up) - Tazzy What I Like About the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet For me, the wristlet's customizable design is a huge part of its appeal. Both of the pouches are detachable from the product's main hook, meaning you can add or remove them as you like. I can also attach other items to the main hook, like my car keys or mace, so it's a great modular accessory for those who prefer something that they can easily make their own. The wristlet is also made from a 100 percent recycled nylon material that's sleek to the touch and relatively easy to keep clean; per the brand, you can simply spot clean it to remove any stains or dirt. Despite its compact design, the pouches can also hold quite a bit - including several credit cards, cash, a small lipstick, and anything else you'd like to keep handy. The actual wristlet is pretty open and stretchy, so you can comfortably wear it around your wrist without fear of skin irritation. And with a wide variety of tones and colorways (including new ones for fall), there are so many fun options to shop that feel totally unique to the traditional cardholder or wallet. What's Worth Noting My biggest qualm with this accessory is the lack of cardholder slots on the inside of the pouch. Prior to purchasing one of my own, I'd always assumed that the accessory would at least have one or two slots to keep items like credit cards or my driver's license secure, similar to the design of a traditional cardholder. While this doesn't affect the security of the piece - I still feel comfortable carrying around the accessory with items that I'd normally store in my wallet - I do think that having an extra interior slot or compartment would make all the difference in keeping items separated and thus easier to pull out whenever needed. Reviewers on Lululemon's site also noted that the light-colored variations tend to dirty faster than dark-colored ones, while others noted that the accessory's material frayed sooner than they expected. One reviewer wrote: \"Fabric frayed and hardware tarnished within first few months.\" I've had my pouch for a little less than a month and haven't noticed any significant wear and tear yet, but it's certainly something to be mindful of, given this product's higher price tag. Because several reviews cited issues with discoloration on shades like the white opal and flush pink colorway, I also chose to order mine in the classic black and traverse gray tones. If you want to avoid dirtying your bag too quickly, I recommend opting for one of the darker shades. Who Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Best For? This wristlet is perfect for anyone who wants to cut back on their carrying capacity each day - without having to sacrifice on style in the process. The accessory has just enough space to hold the essentials, giving you the freedom to carry what you need and nothing more. Unlike traditional cardholders or clutches, it also has a durable design that'll hold up regardless of the weather or circumstance. It's the perfect embodiment of stylish functionality, and it's a great alternative for those who are tired of lugging around large accessories to the gym, while traveling, or even just running errands. Additional Details: Lululemon's Dual Pouch Wristlet is made from a durable, water-repellent fabric that's designed for on-the-go wear. Thanks to its hook design, the pouches are completely detachable, so you can customize the look and functionality of the accessory. It comes in eight different colorways, including black and traverse gray (my shades of choice), grey eucalyptus and bone, flush pink and bone, and nightfall and lilac ether, among others. Where Is the Lululemon Dual Pouch Wristlet Available to Shop? This accessory is available to shop exclusively at Lululemon.

    "title": "12 Skims Bestsellers With Major Cyber Monday Markdowns",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian as well as Emma and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And many of those items are on sale for Cyber Monday. The Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and these 12 are it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, many of which are on sale for Cyber Monday, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
