It’s a vibe, not just a trend, meaning it takes tectonic rumblings in culture and gives them expression in what we wear and say and drink and watch on TV.Boom boom is a new weather system that is sweeping away pretty much everything we thought we knew about modern fashion (gender fluidity, quiet luxury, elevated basics, ethical brands) and replacing it with ambitious power dressing for day, and traditional tropes of feminine and masculine sexual allure for evening. It is fur (real or fake), gold watches, big hair, wearing ties, sexy dancing. It is a silhouette that has inflection points at the shoulders (big), the breasts (important) and the waist (tiny) instead of worshipping a peachy bum or flat abs. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Whether we’re traveling by plane, train, or car, the goal is simple: get from point A to B safely, and ideally in comfort. While the former isn’t always up to us, the latter is — and it starts with the right clothes. The ideal travel outfit checks a few key boxes. It should be loose enough to move in (or offer supportive compression), and made from breathable, durable fabric — especially on flights where cabin temps can fluctuate. Think travel pants, compression socks, and the like. And perhaps most importantly, a great travel outfit should make you feel confident while looking put-together. So if you are in the market for stylish, affordable pieces for your next getaway, you’ve arrived at your shopping destination.We’ve rounded up the best travel outfits on Amazon — chic, budget-friendly, and ready to pair with your go-to travel shoes. Read on for top-rated picks to help you arrive in style. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Travel Pants There’s a lot of movement while in transit, so wear something that can handle walking, running, or even squatting. A wide-leg silhouette offers freedom to move without sacrificing polish. When in doubt, go for denim joggers with a stretchy waistband. Bonus points for pockets — ideally zippered or with flaps to keep valuables secure. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Travel Shorts If you’re wearing shorts for summer travel, skip fitted waistbands and fussy buttons. Elastic styles are ideal for long stretches of sitting. Classic cotton works, but cargo and biker shorts with longer inseams and extra pockets are even better. A skort with hidden storage, like the one above, adds a stylish, functional twist. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Matching Sweatsuits For Travel A matching sweatsuit is the next best thing to PJs when traveling — a more polished sibling of sleepwear that’s easy to style on the go. This relaxed set can be worn together or mixed and matched, making it a versatile staple for any travel capsule wardrobe. Best Travel Jackets Packing light is key for longer trips, which is why a “shacket” — the heroic shirt-jacket hybrid — makes an ideal travel layer. Wear it as a top or outerwear, and stash it easily when not in use. It’s lightweight enough to tie around your waist or drape over your shoulders, adding just the right touch in transit. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Sweatshirts For Travel Few things match the ease and versatility of a great sweatshirt. Pair it with leggings or bike shorts for a low-key look, or dress it up slightly with jeans and sneakers. Half-zips are especially travel-friendly — zip up when it’s cold, unzip to cool down. DashDividers_1_500x100 Best Compression Socks For Travel Long trips can take a toll on your legs and feet, especially in the air. Compression socks help reduce swelling and muscle cramps by promoting circulation. This three-pack is a favorite among Amazon shoppers, with hundreds of 5-star reviews praising the ankle support and easy-on fit. Shop more compression socks: Like what you see?

    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I'll admit it: low-rise jeans don't exactly inspire excitement. In fact, most people still associate them with the early 2000s - when Britney Spears' butt crack was practically a pop culture mascot. Not exactly a golden era for denim (especially for those of us who tried to pull it off). But here's the thing: the low-rise trend is back, and this time, it's different. Today's version isn't about skin-tight jeans paired with baby tees. It's more laid-back - think beachy, baggy jeans that feel effortlessly cool rather than constricting. That shift alone was enough to get me curious. And eventually, it got me to buy a pair. Enter: Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans ($148). The only low-rise jeans I own - and honestly, the reason I'm about to own more. There's something about the cut, the fit, the vibe . . . they just work. I reach for them constantly, and I'm not looking back. What I Like About the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans You know the look the second you see them: the relaxed straight leg, frayed hems, a little distressing - these jeans are a total 2000s throwback, but in the best way. They've got that effortless style, but with a looser fit that feels way more current (and way less scary to wear). I throw them on all the time, not just because they're cool, but because they go with literally everything. Blazer and boots? Done. Tank top and Birks? Easy. They somehow manage to feel put-together without trying too hard. And the best part? They're made from 100% Japanese cotton, so they actually hold their shape. No weird bagging, no stretching out. Just great jeans that I can always count on. Not to mention they wash like a dream - I just air dry them, and they're back to looking brand new (but still retro). What to Consider Before Buying the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans 100% cotton denim definitely isn't for everyone. Personally, I prefer it because it holds its shape for as long as I own the jeans - no sagging, no stretching out in weird places. And over time, the Madewell Dean Easy Straight jeans mold to your body and feel more natural. Still, no stretch means no (immediate) give, so if stretchy jeans are your preference, I'd recommend Madewell Tapered Denim Trousers ($50, originally $148) instead. Who Are the Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Best For? If you prefer structure over stretch and appreciate jeans that hold their shape over time, these are for you. They're especially great if you're into relaxed styling - think oversized button-downs, boxy tees, and effortless layers - but still want to look put-together. The low-rise fit and straight leg give off major early 2000s energy, but with a more modern, wearable update. Bonus: they're available in multiple washes and lengths, making them a solid option for a range of body types and personal styles. If you're someone who leans minimalist, likes a no-fuss fit, and doesn't mind a little break-in time, you'll probably live in these. Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes Are Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Worth the Splurge? For the price, Madewell is competing with other premium denim brands, and I'd say they've earned their place. These jeans truly deliver on the \"premium\" label. Not only do they offer a relaxed, timeless style, but they're also made from high-quality Regenagri-certified cotton, meaning they're produced with regenerative farming practices that support environmental sustainability. Beyond that, they hold up beautifully over time. With proper care, these jeans will last for years, both in terms of fit and appearance. Additional Details Made with Regenagri-certified cotton, produced using regenerative farming practices that promote environmental sustainability. Low-slung fit, sitting comfortably on the hips Available in two washes: Monessen and Shibori. Sizing ranges from 23 to 33 in standard, petite, and tall options. Features a button fly and is machine washable for easy care. Where Are Madewell Dean Easy Straight Jeans Available? You can shop these jeans directly from Madewell or at Nordstrom. Rating: PS - Shop Something Related A few other bestsellers from Madewell include Madewell Darted Barrel Leg Jeans ($138) and Madewell Perfect Vintage Wide Leg Crop Jeans ($138) which are worth giving a try for trendy styles you'll find just as comfortable.
