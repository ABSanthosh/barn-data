Three months later, the launch of an online bookseller called Amazon fired the starting pistol for a race toward internet shopping that would leave high streets half-empty and shopping centres boarded up.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/straw-raffia-rattan-summer-accessories?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Straw accessories always make a comeback once summer hits — especially when it comes to toting around basket bags for picnics and wearing hats to the beach. And this year, they’ve got the luxury seal of approval — from raffia clutches at Bottega Veneta’s spring/summer 2025 show to straw boater hats at Chanel’s cruise collection, proving that coastal materials are key to nailing the fisherman aesthetic.But straw (and raffia, rattan, and jute) is far more versatile than it gets credit for. We’ve previously made the case for wearing raffia accessories year-round — not just at the beach — by pairing them with everything from cocktail dresses to tried-and-true denim.Now, we’re spotlighting all the ways to work these natural textures into your summer wardrobe — from the office (juxtaposed with tailored pieces) to weddings to actual vacations (styled with breezy linen dresses, cute coordinating sets, and playful bubble hems). Think colorful raffia slides or woven platform sandals that add texture to minimal looks, and statement earrings wrapped in raffia or rattan that channel tropical ease. And don’t overlook straw bucket and cowboy hats made for festival season.Read on for warm-weather outfit inspiration and to shop some of our favorite raffia bags, hats, shoes, and jewelry on the market. DashDividers_1_500x100 Raffia \u0026 Straw Bags We know them, we love them — the woven bags that signal summer’s arrival. While roomy straw totes are the classic beach companion, there are far more wearable (and whimsical) takes on the raffia bag worth trying. Consider a structured shoulder bag, a mini top handle for al fresco dinners, or a crossbody in a boxy or basket shape that works just as well in the city as it does on vacation. Straw Hats Picture yourself on vacation, lounging in a dramatic straw hat that shields your face from the blazing sun. Now imagine wearing it to a music festival, a tennis match, or the park. A wide-brimmed style might feel like a stretch in those settings — but if you’re still into the summer trend, try a straw cowboy hat, a raffia bucket hat, or even a rattan visor for an elevated yet unfussy look. Raffia \u0026 Straw Sandals It’s officially sandal season, and a straw pair is the easiest way to channel your inner White Lotus character. Right now, we’re especially into raffia slides and trending platform sandals that can take you from day to night without missing a step. Classic beige and tan styles are always a solid bet, but this season also brings playful options in saturated hues like butter yellow and turquoise. Straw Jewelry Whether you’re into tightly woven rattan or playful raffia tassels, there’s a place for them in your jewelry collection, too. Statement earrings are our go-to — an easy way to elevate any look with a hint of texture. Try dramatic drop styles for vacations or warm-weather weddings, or opt for chunky woven hoops to wear on repeat all summer long. Like what you see?

The designer brands have released prominent collabs since — with the likes of Dolly Parton and Hunter Boots — but shoppers continue to want more from this partnership. It offers bow accessories (which have shown no sign of slowing down), hearts, florals, and coquette chokers. Last year, it quickly sold out within hours — as expected.The contemporary jewelry brand, founded by Kendra Scott, and the vintage-inspired fashion label, helmed by Rebecca Hessel Cohen, collaborated on an unabashedly feminine gold jewelry collection. If you weren’t one of the lucky shoppers to cart up the coveted pieces, you can pre-order them between 10 a.m. EST today and 10 a.m. on May 14 — while supplies last — on kendrascott.com. Pre-orders are expected to ship in August. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kendra Scott (@kendrascott) From gold-plated pendant necklaces and charm bracelets to statement earrings, each piece is as intricate and whimsical as the next. The collab includes limited-edition versions of Kendra Scott’s best-selling Elisa necklace. Rather than classic gemstones, this style features bow-adorned and LoveShackFancy-inspired floral-patterned pendants. You’ll also find a few bow studs and drop styles in the mix.

    "description": "If you have a love/hate relationship with shorts, take comfort in the fact that you're not alone; they're a notoriously tricky wardrobe essential to pull off, but come summertime, when the temperatures warm up and you want to be wearing as little fabric as possible, they're also kind of a lifesaver. Even if you aren't totally convinced that you can pull them off, with so many different types of shorts that are available to shop online, you're bound to find at least one style that's worthy of a spot in your wardrobe. Between the mix of viral TikTok fashion trends that have been bubbling up this year and the resurgence of so many old style fads, shorts of all kinds are in for summer - from baggy mom shorts and lengthy Bermuda styles to breezy linen shorts and even a few frayed denim shorts that you can wear to the beach, brunch, and beyond. Today's hottest pieces come in all different kinds of lengths and fabrics, with silhouettes that are actually flattering and comfortable - shocking, we know. As you begin to prep your closet for the new season, we curated a guide to the best shorts for women, with styles that come from some of our favorite brands like American Eagle, Farm Rio, Reformation, Levi's, Amazon, and more. These pieces are designed to look great with everything from strappy sandals to cool everyday sneakers and, if you're feeling risqué for your next night out, even a pair of over-the-knee boots with some cheeky short shorts. Whatever your personal style is, you're sure to find your new favorite summer essential ahead.",
