    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/revenge-dress-celebrities-49136376",
    "description": "Princess Diana in an off-shoulder minidress when Prince Charles went public with his affair. Mariah Carey in a hip-high slit after leaving a tumultuous marriage. Ariana Madix in a fiery-red cutout set in the wake of #Scandoval. And most recently, Huda Mustafa in a black mini lace cutout frock after being dumped by Jeremiah Brown on \"Love Island USA.\" The revenge dress isn't a new phenomenon, but it remains at the forefront of everyone's minds. Inspired by the black mini worn by the Princess of Wales in the 1990s, the modern revenge dress is fashion at its most communicative. It's bold, fitted in silhouette, and red or black in color. It boasts plunging necklines and conspicuous cutouts, high splits and open backs. It's a comeback story, rendered sartorially. Despite the revenge dress's enduring legacy, I always felt uneasy about it. How vengeful is a sultry dress anyway? A better act of revenge would be, well, cheating back, as Chloe Bailey sings. What's more, the concept of \"revenge dressing\" frames a woman's wardrobe and appearance as her primary weapons of power. What about revenge accomplishments? Revenge art? Revenge careers? Why is it that - after a woman's been wronged - the statement that really makes an impact revolves around how she looks? I also wasn't sold on the idea of dressing with the offending party in mind. Fashion is such a personal, intimate act for me; I get dressed based on my mood, my desires, my social calendar for the week. I don't want that process to be hijacked by someone else, let alone someone who caused me harm. [T]here's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. But I learned - through experience - that there's something empowering about the revenge dress. It speaks to the confidence of a woman who knows that her value goes far beyond how she was treated. My revenge dress story is pretty typical. Three years ago, pre-pandemic, I found myself on the verge of a break up. We had been so in sync; we had amazing chemistry; we saw a future together with kids, pets, and even a few business ventures. But when I signed into his Netflix account, of all things, I saw a newly-created profile bearing another woman's name - someone he'd visited once to help her fix a broken water pipe, allegedly. I inquired about it, and our relationship quickly unraveled from there. He was belligerent and I was crushed. And the New Year's Eve party invite I had accepted a few days prior hung in the balance. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jessica C. Andrews (@dressupwithjess) I was not in the mood to dress up and be around people. But then I reconsidered; after all, I usually enjoy a night of revelry and I refused to let him take that away from me. I landed on a dress that encapsulated that mood perfectly. A sequin micro mini with exaggerated sleeves and a plunging neckline. It was just the boost I needed to feel like myself again. It's the same energy Tina Turner emanated when she stepped out in 1986 after leaving her abusive marriage. She donned a skin-tight leather Azzedine Alaïa gown with four cutouts down the side, her hair in a blonde spiky mullet. Becky G had a similar air of confidence as she posed in a black lace dress at the iHeartRadio Music Awards - on the same day her fiancé addressed cheating rumors. And even more recently, Mustafa wore a series of curve-hugging dresses after her match (Brown) traded her for a new bombshell on national television. Dressing for revenge is less about retaliation, and more a bold declaration of self-love. It's putting on a brave face and a tight cutout dress - and letting the world know that what happened to you didn't break you and will not define you. Keep scrolling to glean your own confidence from the best celebrity revenge moments of all time, from Princess Diana to Ariana Madix - and shop similar dresses to Mustafa's ensembles from the cult-favorite series.",

    "description": "Leave it to Kylie Jenner to have all eyes on her at a wedding that's not hers. Most recently, the Khy founder joined her sisters (Kendall Jenner and Kim Kardashian) and mom Kris Jenner at one of the most anticipated matrimonies of the year: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding in Venice, Italy. Naturally, Kylie Jenner didn't hold back when it came to her looks for the three-day extravaganza - from a white-silver lingerie dress to a cleavage-baring black string bikini. As if showing up in a white dress to someone else's nuptials wasn't already an indicator, Jenner further cemented her role as the main character wedding guest with a classic yet commanding accessory - black sunglasses from Otra Eyewear. It was the perfect example of a fashion faux pas that paid off. The Gen Z entrepreneur wore the Kenny sunglasses from the Australian brand, which is set to be available as part of an upcoming collaboration with the Grandquist sisters launching later this summer on the label's site and Revolve. Of course Jenner gets first dibs on the unreleased item, but that doesn't mean you can't get the same vibe. The site offers other budget-friendly picks like the Otra Hazel Black Sunglasses ($65) and the Otra Ivy Black Sunglasses ($65) - both cat-eye frames that are ideal for everyday wear (or a wedding if you're a Jenner/Kardashian). Since I'm a shopping-obsessed editor and self-proclaimed sunglasses connoisseur, Jenner's accessory of choice piqued my interest. I found these similar options that are Kylie Jenner coded, and even more affordable. For the committed minimalist, consider these black frames that are sure to elevate your summer looks: the Aire Fornax 53mm Oval Sunglasses ($44) and the Le Specs Dream Lover 50mm Cat Eye Sunglasses ($85). And of course, Amazon has pieces that are just as chic and Bezos wedding-worthy, like the YMFRW Retro Cat Eye Sunglasses ($8, originally $15) and the Vanlinker Small Polarized Cat Eye Sunglasses ($14). Naomi Parris is the assistant shopping editor at PS, based in New York. With over eight years of experience and previous roles held on the brand's Beauty and Operations teams, she enjoys telling stories that merge fashion, beauty, and Black culture.

    "description": "We have our linen dresses, our milkmaid dresses, and our playful sardine-girl summer-ready takes to pair with sneakers, sandals, and thong kitten heels. But one of the key summer dress trends this season? The halterneck dress — retro in the best way, with a distinctly feminine feel that’s suddenly everywhere again.From vacation-ready open backs to sleek tie-necks and sculptural twists, this summer’s halters are fresher than ever. They frame the neckline beautifully, show off the shoulders, and add just the right amount of throwback charm (without veering costume-y). Whether you go for a crisp cotton mini or a breezy crochet maxi, the silhouette feels distinctive — a subtle switch-up we love alongside our go-to spaghetti straps, puff sleeves, and scooped tanks.From voluminous bubble hems to slinky slips, butter yellow to pistachio green, and petite to plus-size options, these halter styles check every summer-dressing box. They’re made for vacation, summer weddings, and every city, weekend, and getaway moment in between.Shop the edit ahead from reader-favorite brands and retailers like Hill House Home, Anthropologie, Free People, Zara, Nordstrom, and more. Mini Halterneck Dresses Great for petites and fans of a leg moment alike, halter minis keep things light and playful. From fitted bodices to tiered hems, these sweet styles are ideal for dinner dates, brunch plans, and every steamy sidewalk stroll in between. Midi Halterneck Dresses A midi halter strikes that just-right balance: slightly elevated, but still easy enough for everyday wear. Look for fluid skirts, subtle cut-outs, and sculpted necklines that move seamlessly from day to night with just a switch-up of accessories. Maxi Halterneck Dresses A halter maxi brings the drama while keeping things ultra-summery and airy. With open backs and floaty fabrics, these full-length styles are made for beachfront weddings, European getaways, and spur-of-the-moment drinks that linger past golden hour. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Back in 2018, Bella Hadid, Hailey Bieber (then Baldwin), and Tracey Ellis Ross all appeared in the year’s hottest sneaker: the Balenciaga Triple S. The raised-platform design, which first debuted in 2017, had signaled the rise of a new era — that of the “ugly sneaker,” chunky styles with an athletic look and a more-is-more aesthetic. Think: Louis Vuitton’s Archlight sneaker (worn by Jaden Smith) and Gucci’s Rhyton. But, as the pendulum of fashion trends swings between extremes, it’s reversed course. It’s been seven years, and Hadid is now in $150 Vivaia ballet sneakers, Bieber is in Onitsuka Tigers, and plenty of other trendsetters are co-signing the rise of something more minimalist… and familiar.   When it comes to 2025 trends, the scales have tipped as shoppers (whether famous or not) are in search of a slimmer silhouette, drawing inspiration from ‘70s running shoes, ‘90s racing boots, and ‘00s ballet flats. Starting in 2022, the rise of the soccer-adjacent Adidas Samba was a bellwether that things were moving in a more low-profile direction. Today, a whole new class of styles, from designer runners from Loewe and The Row to revived athletic styles like the Puma Speedcat, Adidas Taekwondo, and the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 are driving the return of the retro-leaning sneaker trend. The irony of “ugly” shoes has run its course, and what has replaced it is a desire for something simple and comfortably nostalgic.   The Return of Y2K Aesthetics For a generation of Gen Z shoppers, embracing thrift shopping and nostalgic trends has sparked interest in sneaker silhouettes that last dominated the culture in the early aughts. There are hundreds of listings for styles like the Puma Speedcat (which launched in 1999) on Grailed. As resale popularity spikes, the brand is simultaneously relaunching its OG silhouettes, riding the wave of nostalgia and introducing iconic Puma silhouettes to a new generation of shoppers.  “Consumers are leaning more than ever into the rising Y2K aesthetic, which is why slimmer silhouettes are having such a powerful moment with a demand that just continues to grow,” says Christina Mirabelli, Puma’s director of sportstyle marketing. “Consumers have a true passion for ‘what’s old is new again,’ which is how so many of these archival slim styles are coming to the forefront.”  The Move Towards Minimalism In the last two years, several minimalist designer styles have dominated the conversation: Most notably, Miu Miu X New Balance’s 530 SL, Louis Vuitton’s Sneakerina, Dries Van Noten’s sneaker, and Loewe’s Ballet Runner 2.0 (which followed the success of the first iteration released in 2019). The rise of these luxury label offerings — defined by streamlined silhouettes and a slim fit through the foot — has mirrored the rise of quiet luxury across the board. Despite price tags that range from just under $550 to over $1,000, Miu Miu and Dries Van Noten sneakers both made the Lyst Index’s hottest products last year alongside more affordable counterparts like the Speedcat and the Adidas SL72.  While these sneakers often come with a color palette that fits their minimalist silhouette, a slew of playful colors, patterns, and materialities are popping up as well. Dries Van Noten’s sneakers — which are almost entirely sold out in both the New York and L.A. stores — in addition to black, white, and tan colorways, are available in a bold green suede, red snakeskin leather, and a metallic pink leather. You can expect to see this juxtaposition evolve according to Ashley Ahwah, VP Adidas Originals North America: “Metallics, ponyhair, patent, and bold colors are dominating,” she explains. For 2025, it’s about “understated silhouettes with the juxtaposition of bold colors and materials.”  The Power of Sportfluence  Whether it’s via professional athletes, dancers, or race car drivers, the influence of sports on fashion is an enduring trend. Though a far cry from the satin pointe shoes worn by professional dancers, a sneaker-ballet flat hybrid has popped up as one of this year’s biggest sneaker trends. In terms of styles, Miu Miu’s Gymnasium Ballerinas, along with collaborations between Solomon and Sandy Liang and Bad Bunny and Adidas, have come to embody the look that can be tied back to nostalgia for the ‘90s and early ‘00s when styles like the Nike Air Rift first hit their stride. Often designed with a slipper silhouette and ribbon laces or straps that criss-cross the top of the foot, they couldn’t be more different from the “dad sneakers” that dominated the trend cycle for so long. The Lyst Q1 Index Report indicates that the Puma Speedcat ballet is the third buzziest product so far of 2025, with searches for ballet sneakers in general up 1300% year over year.  It’s also worth noting the rising cultural influence of other sport-inspired styles. Adidas credits the comeback of the Samba, a soccer sneaker, with helping launch a revival in other sports-adjacent trainers. “The success of Samba and soccer… has opened the appetite from our consumer to seek iterations and looks that are more low-profile,” says Ahwah.  See: the Taekwondo, which the brand relaunched last year after it first debuted in the early 2000s for sparring on the mat. As well as: Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66, today worn by stars like Bieber and Kaia Gerber, but originally a silhouette for athletes to wear during the 1966 Olympics. Puma’s Speedcat, which was first designed in 1999 as a Formula One racing shoe, has returned with a vengeance as fandom for the sport has reached astronomical heights — securing its spot as one of the hottest products on multiple Lyst reports over the last year. Most recently, this design was spotted on Ferrari drivers Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc.  While technological advances mean that these sport-inspired styles may no longer be used by professional sportspeople, their snug fit and simple profile make them ideal for off-duty outfits on days that we’re craving more than just old-school aesthetics, but also the familiarity and comfort that comes from nostalgia.  Like what you see?
