    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/cozy-earth-bamboo-pajama-set-review-49281580",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy In order to make my sleep environment feel comfortable and luxurious, I went on a hunt for the most comfortable mattress, a supportive pillow wrapped in a silky pillowcase, and sheets that feel like a cloud. But the cornerstone of my sleep setup is always my pajamas. In fact, I've made it a habit to wear matching pajama sets to get my mind and body ready for bed. I've searched high and low for the most comfortable pair, but with my high standards, it took me so long to find the perfect PJs. I needed them to feel like butter on my skin, but also lightweight and breathable so that I could wear them all year long. And of course, they had to look cute. When I came across Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set ($156, originally $195), I was curious to see what the hype was about, especially since it was an item on Oprah's Favorite Things list two years in a row. My fellow editors raved endlessly about the brand's cashmere cardigan and bamboo sheets, so I had high hopes for these pajamas. Believe me when I say they did not disappoint. And right now, they're 20 percent off, so there's no better time to treat yourself and stock up on these luxe PJs. What I Like About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Cozy Earth's Bamboo Pajama Set is by far the best pair of pajamas I have ever owned. From the feel to the look, these exude luxury. But let's start with the texture and the fabric, since these are the standout details. The brand says the pajamas are made from viscose from bamboo, but the material might as well be described as \"slices of heaven.\" It's silky and smooth with cloudlike softness, with the ideal amount of slip that allows you to move around without friction. The fabric offers a bit of stretch and flexibility, too. The PJs are warm and cozy yet lightweight and breathable, meaning I can wear them through all seasons of the year. While a matching set will always appear polished, these PJs embody quiet luxury. The collar and contrast piping deliver a tailored look, while the flattering yet relaxed fit is perfect for achieving comfort. The fabric also drapes beautifully with minimal wrinkles, so you'll look elevated - even if your hair is disheveled and you're hungover. The long-sleeved button-down top is equipped with an elegant pocket that adds sophisticated flair. The bottoms have an adjustable-tie waistband, so you have a secure fit no matter how much you toss and turn at night. The Bamboo Pajama Set makes me excited to go to bed, so although it's an investment, it's one that you'll actually enjoy. Needless to say, it's really difficult to change out of these in the morning. What's Worth Noting About the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set: The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set has a relaxed, slightly oversize fit, so you don't have to worry about sizing up. As someone who is 5'1\", an extra small fit just right, leaving me with some room. The brand offers both regular and tall sizing, too, especially if you need extra length for your arms and legs. The brand also recommends sizing down if you're in-between sizes. Although these pajamas have proven themselves to be quite durable, proper care and maintenance are never a bad idea to extend shelf life. The brand recommends machine washing on cold with a normal detergent and no fabric softener or bleach and to machine dry normally. I like to put them in the delicates or gentle cycle, just to be extra cautious. Who's the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Best For? Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy The Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set is best for everyone and anyone who wants to truly invest in their sleepwear. The luxuriously soft fabric is so gentle on your skin, and it is breathable and stretchy, so it's great for those who sleep hot or want something lightweight for bed. Whether you're a homebody who loves to indulge and takes their sleep pretty seriously, or you're shopping for a luxe gift for your loved one, these pajamas are a purchase you won't regret. Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Worth the Splurge? These pajamas are no doubt a luxury, treat-yourself type of purchase and are in no way a true necessity. However, if you're like me and you enjoy splurging on sleep must haves, these Cozy Earth pajamas are worth every penny. I have tried cheaper alternatives that have the same feel, but they simply aren't as long-lasting. In fact, most of the alternatives lose their softness after several washes and they start to pill, if not rip and tear. I've had pairs of Cozy Earth pajamas that I put through the wash at least 15 to 20 times, and they still look and feel brand-spanking new. Plus, the brand is so confident in the quality of these pajamas that they offer a 10-year warranty and a 100-night sleep trial. Additional Details: Cozy Earth's Stretch-Knit Bamboo Pajama Set is made from 95 percent bamboo-based viscose and five percent spandex. These Cozy Earth Pajamas come in four colors. The pajamas are available in sizes XS–XXXL, in regular and tall lengths. They have a slightly relaxed fit. The brand offers a 10-year warranty, a 100-night sleep trial, and free shipping. Where Is the Cozy Earth Bamboo Pajama Set Available? The Bamboo Pajama Set is available on cozyearth.com, and a select few colors and sizes are available on Amazon.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/madewell-darted-barrel-leg-jeans-review-49406303",
    "description": "Shopping for jeans can involve a lot of trial and error, especially when you're experimenting with a new silhouette. If you've been tempted to try the polarizing yet inescapable trend of barrel leg jeans, you're not alone. As a shopping editor, I've been obsessively seeking the perfect pair - one that boasts a subtle, flattering shape; feels fresh, but classic enough to have a smidge of longevity. As a Madewell denim fan (the brand's Emmett Patch-Pocket Wide-Leg Jeans are my favorite), I was thrilled to see that the label released its own interpretation of a barrel leg cut. Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans ($148) are the pair I landed on and have been wearing non-stop. What I Love About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans These jeans have a fitted waist, bow out around the middle of the leg, and have a tapered ankle. While there's enough mid-leg volume to capture the barrel leg look, it isn't as exaggerated as Free People's version, or a lot of others on the market. To help emphasize the curved leg shape, this pair has darts at the knees to create a sort of optical illusion, instead of tacking on more volume. The result is subtle and surprisingly flattering. These jeans don't have any stretch, but they're ridiculously comfortable. They sit low at the waist and sort of dangle - the legs are structured but not stiff. I love that they feel like a baggy pair of jeans but have enough structure to still look polished. They also have a cropped ankle, so they don't overwhelm my frame, and look great with everything from ballet flats to sneakers. What's Worth Noting About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans These jeans are definitely oversize, so finding the right size can be tricky. I would suggest going one or two sizes down from your normal size. I'm usually a size 28 in Madewell jeans and am wearing a size 27, but I think I could have gotten away with a size 26 since they sit low on the waist. They also have a button fly instead of a zip fly, which is a bit of a pain when putting them on and taking them off. Who Are Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans Best For? These jeans are perfect for anyone looking to test the barrel leg jean waters. If you're ambivalent about the cut, these are a great entryway pair to experimenting with the trend. Since the cut is fairly subtle, they also feel a bit more classic than more exaggerated silhouettes. Additional Details About Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans 26.5\" inseam; 16\" leg opening; 10.75\" front rise; 13.5\" back rise (size 25) Button fly Five-pocket style 100 percent cotton Machine wash, tumble dry Where Are Madewell's Darted Barrel Leg Jeans Available? These jeans are available at Nordstrom with limited sizes in the Dobbins wash and more sizes in the Driftwood Brown color, and at Madewell.

As far as controversial shoe trends go, this year has seen plenty, from the boat shoe revival to the clog’s definitive fashionification. Now, another love-to-hate-it shoe has won over the most stylish — and influential — tastemakers: Clarks Originals’ Wallabees. In October, fashion search engine Lyst ranked the shoe as the ninth “hottest product” of the last three months in its quarterly report (which filters millions of items including social media mentions, searches, and sales) and noted it as a “key shoe style” among Gen Z shoppers.  The Wallabee is a simple yet distinct moccasin-style shoe crafted out of leather and suede. After launching in the 1960s, the style’s popularity has traversed from its UK origins to Jamaica’s streetwear scene, where the brand was a mainstay as a result of colonization and emigration between the countries. After a wave of Jamaican immigrants moved to the U.S. in the ’80s, Wallabees became popular within New York City’s hip-hop set, with endorsements from the likes of Notorious BIG and the Wu-Tang Clan. While its popularity cooled off in the last few decades, the shoe never really left the mainstream’s consciousness. Today, Wallabees come in tons of silhouettes — the classic ankle-high boot and a high-top version, a loafer, Mary-Jane, and a platform iteration — and colors.  Depop noted a 39% global increase in searches for Clarks Wallabees this year, plus 46% more queries for the brand in general. The site credits Clarks’ buzzy designer collaboration with Martine Rose for the uptick in interest. (Searches for the capsule rose by 233% since August.) Rachel Makar, senior director of merchandising at StockX, also points to last spring’s Supreme x Clarks collaboration — which features patent leather Wallabees and is currently selling at a 23% price premium on the site — as another reason for the recent resurgence in popularity. “The collaboration with Supreme demonstrates the power of partnerships to resonate with a new generation,” Makar tells Refinery29.  @victoria.martn who’s next ??? #clarks #clarkswallabees @Clarks Originals #footwear #shoes ♬ original sound – Skye It has indeed been a busy few years for Clarks collaborations. In 2022, Clarks and Moncler launched limited-edition Wallabees that incorporated the latter’s signature shearling and padded nylons. In August, Tyler the Creator’s label Golf Wang released pastel Wallabees with heart prints. For its spring/summer 2025 showcase, London brand Ancuta Sarca reworked Wallabees into custom heels.  “Clarks Originals has repositioned itself to cater to its Gen Z audience,” Brittany Nichol, a 25-year-old TikTok creator who has posted outfit videos in her maple suede Wallabees, says. “They’re collaborating with cool brands and adapting its image to be more of a lifestyle and aesthetic, rather than just a product.” (While these collaborations are successfully luring in a new generation of customers and solidifying Clarks’ continued place in the fashion world for those already familiar with the brand, these efforts are likely part of a larger turnaround strategy for the brand, which reported losses of almost £40 million last year.) “I first came across Clarks when I was younger because my dad had a pair. Then as I got older, I rediscovered them through Breaking Bad. I thought they were pretty cool,” twenty-two-year-old TikTok creator Victoria Martin tells Refinery29, referring to the Wallabees often worn by Bryan Cranston’s character, Walter White. Martin has posted several videos featuring her Clarks, including a recent unboxing of leopard print Wallabees, and a collage of her six-pair collection (which has 433,000 views and counting). Aside from its buzzy collabs and nostalgia factor, there is also the construction of the shoe. “At the moment I haven’t found any shoes that are more comfortable than Wallabees,” Martin says. “That’s really the reason why the majority of my shoes are Clarks.” Similar to other Gorpcore styles that have come back in popularity over the last few years (see: Birkenstock, Ugg, Crocs), Clarks has also developed a so ugly-it’s-cool, cult status on social media — thriving off its practical brand, tongue-in-cheek reputation for producing school- and work-regulated shoes (thanks to its prevalent use of padded footbeds, nondescript branding and a healthy dose of Gore-Tex). “I’ve been a customer of Clarks ever since I started school because they’re one of the most popular school shoe brands here in Australia,” Nichol says. @bippabibby always matching 🌷#ootd #outfitinspo #fitcheck #winterfashion #clarkswallabees ♬ Hell N Back – Bakar With the style continuing to go viral on TikTok, the Lyst findings are probably just the beginning of Wallabee’s upward swing. Nichol only has one pair of maple suedes, although she’s eager to share her extensive wish list. “I’m currently deciding between the Wallabee Gore-Tex in black, the Wallabee T Bar in maple suede, or the Wallabee in blush pink suede,” she says.  At the same time, Nichol admits the style isn’t always a hit. “When I wear my Clarks there, I do get some funny looks. But it’s mostly from old men who are probably confused about why we have matching shoes.” Like what you see?
