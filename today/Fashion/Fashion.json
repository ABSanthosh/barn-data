Think a cocktail dress covered in roses to mimic a bouquet, clear sandals with floral heels, and a rose-print turtleneck-and-leggings set. As Magda Butrym is celebrating its 10-year anniversary this year, the H\u0026M collab includes archival pieces which fans of the luxury brand will recognize. The beloved halter top, for example, is here with its iconic ruching and rose emblems featured on the bodice. \"Each piece brings its own sense of Slavic romance, while paying homage to the history of our brand,\" the designer said in a press release. \"I really see this collection as a chance to invite people into our world – and to celebrate femininity, and the flower.\" In the past, H\u0026M collaborations have included such iconic brands as Mugler, Rabanne, and Brock Collection. Notably, this partnership marks the first time the retail behemoth has collaborated with a Polish designer. And while most of the products are sold out, you can check your local H\u0026M for further shopping. Ahead, read our editors' honest thoughts about the new collection - and keep scrolling to shop our favorite pieces from the Magda Butrym x H\u0026M collab.",
