    "description": "Kendrick Lamar’s 2025 Super Bowl halftime show was a big moment for a lot of things — bootcut jeans especially. The rapper’s lightwash Celine pair made many of us fall in love with the silhouette all over again, perhaps for the first time since the early aughts.It was already on our radars as a 2025 denim trend, especially in spring collections. While dramatic flares, baggy cargos, and barrel-leg jeans continue to trend, bootcut jeans present a more subtle option for those of us who want a sleek pair of everyday denim. They’re ideal for fitting over your cowboy boots or pooling around your on-trend clogs — and most don’t have a $1,200 Celine price tag. We found the best women’s bootcut jeans (in a range of standard, petite, tall, and plus sizes) from some of Refinery29 readers’ favorite brands.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown. Find your favorites and shop this season's best comfortable work shoes for standing all day.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/bestselling-skims-products-49378788",
    "description": "Skims went from an idea to an award-winning intimates and loungewear brand. Founded by Kim Kardashian and Jens Grede in 2019, the company was valued at $4 billion in July 2023, according to Forbes. Whether or not shoppers are Kardashian fans, the brand still seems to have go-to collections that continuously sell out. And the latest iteration is \"The Ultimate Butt\" drop featuring shorts, leggings, and bodysuits with built-in butt pads. Almost as soon as Kardashian announced the new collection on Instagram, fans responded with strong opinions, some praising the campaign rollout (\"The marketing is simply genius,\" one commenter wrote) and others questioning how the shapewear will fare IRL (\"and then you take it off to hook up and then what,\" one critic posted). No matter where you fall on the butt-padding debate, you can't ignore the numbers: most of the drop is already sold out. Some other favorites from Skims? The Skims Fits Everybody line is made with a signature stretch fabric that truly is butter-soft (in fact, I'm wearing the classic thong right now and I describe it as feeling like \"nothing.\" In other words, it's a second skin). The Soft Lounge launch gave way to everyone's favorite long slip dress, which most people attest to be the most flattering body-conscious piece they own. And the Seamless Sculpt range provides every piece of shapewear you could possibly imagine layering underneath that slightly skin-revealing look you've been trying to figure out how to style. And then there's the nipple push-up bra that turns heads whenever I wear it and is a major bestseller. It should come as no surprise that you can now shop these pieces in person. Of course, Skims has been most notably praised for its sizing (XXS-4X) and incredible assortment of nude shades to complement skin tones. Its adaptive products feature added hook and eye closures and front clasps for accessibility, though the brand is overdue for introducing more styles. Nevertheless, if you're new to shopping Skims, we highly recommend you start with the top-rated picks that most folks rave about on social - and the below assortment is it. Ahead, read up on the Skims bestsellers, and decide where to shop based on your color and size preferences. Skims is available online at skims.com, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Net-a-Porter, Ssense, and more.",
