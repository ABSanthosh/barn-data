    "description": "Having recently lost their designer, the house presented a greatest hits package at Milan fashion weekThe arithmetic of fashion goes like this: take a status brand, such as Gucci, and multiply it to the power of X by putting it in the hands of a zeitgeist-hitting designer. Pair the right label with the right person at the right moment, and you hit the jackpot.At this Milan fashion week, Gucci’s numbers were never quite going to add up. Despite having the illustrious, high-value brand name, there is a big fat zero where the designer should be. Sales fell 24% in the last quarter of 2024, and designer Sabato de Sarno exited the brand a fortnight ago. The departure was expected, but the timing spoke of a brand rattled by the failure of recent collections to connect with shoppers. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Fashion Month is finally here to save us from the cold, dark winter nights. Just kidding, it’s still going to be cold and dark, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy watching some outrageous beauty and fashion moments while firmly wrapped up inside in our blankets. Of course, we’ve already had a little taste of what’s to come thanks to Men’s Fashion Week and Couture Week taking over Paris, as well as Copenhagen Fashion Week landing in Denmark’s capital. Tyla took on sub-zero temperatures by turning heads in a navy side slit dress at the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2025 show and Jenna Ortega proved that black is the new black with her ultra-chic goth girl ensemble at Christian Dior. There were plenty of eye-catching looks on the runways, too, with Willy Chavarria making the case for barely there brows and red hot lips and Schiaparelli proving that sometimes it’s about not overtaking the outfit by embracing a minimalistic slick-back bun. Plus, Copenhagen has been serving us all the street style inspo, with colored faux fur jackets, knitted hoods, and office-appropriate neck ties going straight on our mood boards.As we head into the marathon of women’s shows lined up across New York, London, Milan, and Paris we’re still keeping one eye on all of the major fashion and beauty drops happening across February. From a designer luggage collaboration to a new bouncy mascara, click through to discover all the new launches heading your way this month. Beyoncé and Levi’s Launch Chapter 2When Beyoncé dropped “Levi’s Jeans” on her Grammy-winning album, Cowboy Carter, it was all but inevitable that the superstar would team up with the iconic denim brand in some way. After reimagining a 1985 laundromat-set ad last year, Beyoncé is back with Chapter 2 of her Levi’s Campaign, this time reimagining a 1991 ad. Set to the backdrop of the musician’s country-tinged track, the video (directed by Melina Matsoukas) stars Beyoncé clad in a bedazzled denim outfit at a pool hall, where she takes on Justified actor Timothy Olyphant in a game. Highlighted pieces include Levi’s Ribcage Wide Leg Jeans, Braided Vest, and Spade Trench. “There isn’t another wardrobe piece that evokes comfort, modern elegance, classic Americana attire, and nostalgia the way denim does,” Beyoncé said in a press release.  “And when I think of all those things, I think of Levi’s. For the second chapter in our collaboration we had even more fun in reimagining the denim on denim narrative, through the lens of a woman, who can be sexy, bold and a fierce competitor, all at once. We wanted to celebrate the duality of grace and power.” J.Crew Partners with Barbour to Create the Perfect Barn Jacket J.Crew is teaming up with UK heritage brand Barbour for the first time since 2019, combining creative forces to make the perfect barn jacket. The pair’s answer to the on-trend outerwear piece is made with transitional-weather-friendly waxed cotton, lined with Barbour’s signature tartan, and features a corduroy collar. The limited-edition unisex jacket is available for $425. Shop now at J.Crew. J.Crew x Barbour Limited-Edition Barn Jacket, $, available at J.CrewVictoria's Secret Launches Designer Collaboration With AltuzarraVictoria’s Secret has unveiled a new designer series: Atelier Victoria’s Secret x Alturzarra. The collaboration names New York-based designer Joseph Altuzarra as the lingerie brand’s first-ever designer in residence, a title under which he will create a number of limited-edition collections throughout the year. The debut spring 2025 collection features 11 pieces focused on closet basics, such as a bodysuit in the style of a classic white button-up shirt, a satin trench coat, tailored black trousers, a knit cropped cardigan, and a fitted wool blazer. “With this partnership, I wanted to bring my perspective to a brand known for celebrating femininity and sensuality,” Altuzarra said in a press release. “I focused on pieces that felt effortless and sensual, and imbued them with subtle elements of discovery — classic wardrobe styles, but always with a twist.” Prices range from $95 to $500.Shop now at Victoria’s Secret Atelier Victoria's Secret x Altuzarra Satin Bias-Cut Dress, $, available at Victoria's SecretMango Launches Selection Collection Mango has dropped a new edition of its Selection Collection — a premium line that emphasizes high-level tailoring and luxe fabrics — for warm weather.

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose. Enter the new Rowen Rose x Casalina collection, which was inspired by the Amalfi Coast and the image Mize and McKinley held dear. The limited-edition capsule features five styles — all of which are red — that can be mixed and matched: a one-piece swimsuit with a keyhole cut-out, a bikini, a maxi skirt, and two vacation-ready dresses. Prices range from $230 to $525. Shop now at Casalina.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase. The high-end suitcase brand has teamed up with the Lord of Darkness himself, aka legendary designer Rick Owens. The collaboration infuses Owens’ minimalist edge with Rimowa’s sleek and minimalist design and sees the Original Cabin Bronze suitcase transformed using a manual pigmentation process. The result is a dark aged effect on the suitcases’ aluminum exterior, with each case having its own distinct finish. Plus, the interior has been upgraded to all-black leather and the suitcase is finished off with a cowhide luggage tag for a subtle touch of texture.Shop now at RIMOWARimowa x Rick Owens Cabin, $, available at RimowaCalvin Klein Returns to New York Fashion WeekCalvin Klein returned to New York Fashion Week for the first time in six and a half years!

Klein himself was in attendance at the show, which really leaned into the brand’s signature minimalist style.Megan Trainor x e.l.f.

Following New York, on the second stop of the Fashion Month tour, designers took to the venues of London to showcase their fall/winter 2025 offerings. Bookended by Harris Reed and Burberry (which both took place at Tate Britain), London Fashion Week saw a whole spectrum of aesthetics, ranging from ladylike — at brands like Emilia Wickstead, who was inspired by Alfred Hitchcock’s 1963 classic The Birds, and Richard Quinn, where models modeled exquisite gowns as snow cascaded down them — to punk-cool — at Dilara Findikoglu and Sinead Gorey, who took over a club venue and an underground parking lot, respectively, to present their cooler-than-cool collections. While London’s most established designers like Simone Rocha always deliver a standout show (this season saw Alexa Chung, Bel Powley, Fiona Shaw, and Andrea Riseborough walking the runway!), the city’s NewGen (emerging fashion talent) designers were not be missed, either. Following this year’s LVMH Prize nominations, Sinead O’Dwyer once again enlisted the most inclusive lineup of models seen all season while Tolu Coker brought attendees inside the brand’s atelier using an immersive studio presentation format in lieu of a runway show. With over 50 runway shows and presentations on the official British Fashion Council schedule, there were plenty of looks to note. We parsed through them all to present the standouts. Ahead, the trends that will be everywhere come fall, according to London Fashion Week. London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Nostalgic Pants Retro-leaning pant silhouettes were all over the fall/winter 2025 runways — re-imagined in more elegant ways than those from our youth. S.S.Daley (one of the season’s highlight collections!) doubled down on the popularity of the capri pants, with minimal over-the-knee pairs (seen on both women and men) worn with outerwear. (Conner Ives and Keburia showed more cutesy frilly and ruffle-adorned styles.) The brand also made a case for Bermuda shorts that look fit for the workplace, a style that was also seen at Mithridate where they were matched with collared shirts and shirts. The trifecta was established when the most elegant version of stirrups appeared at Toga where they were shown worn over sheer tights and bow-adorned flats. London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Corpcore Call it the Severance effect, but officewear silhouettes marked this season, with several designers showing tailored suits, tuxedo-inspired detailing, and accessories like ties. While there were plenty of literal workwear designs, we loved the more rebellious takes on dress codes. Shown at the TB Tower, “a space synonymous with communication and hyper-connectivity,” SRVC’s collection looked at “how we navigate a world that constantly demands too much,” the show notes read: “Menswear tropes are once again dismantled and reconstructed into something entirely new.” This translated to office sirens walking in knits with cut-outs, slashed shirting, and slacks that had boxers peeking over the waistline, proving that business will not be as usual come autumn — and that’s a good thing. London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Pastels While the runways saw plenty of crimson reds, moody grays, and chocolate browns, the appearance of Easter-approved pastels like pink, blues, greens, and yellows added a touch of unexpected lightness to the usual gamut of fall-appropriate shades. Inspired by The Birds actor Tippi Hedren, Emilia Wickstead showed a matching set, complete with a pillbox hat, in a shade of green that referenced Hedren’s character in the film. Meanwhile, Richard Quinn sent out yellow frocks that looked made for Bridgerton in an indoor London winter wonderland set that the hit Netflix show should consider borrowing for their next season, and Erdem commissioned artist Kaye Donachie to adorn its feminine dresses with aura-like portraits of women.  London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Statement Skirts The reign of the bubble skirt will continue, if we are to believe the London designers. The frilly silhouette, last popular in the 2010s before its recent resurgence, got a dramatic couture update at the hands of Harris Reed with a larger-than-life asymmetrical ballgown skirt. S.S.Daley also presented a more-is-more approach, with equally voluminous midi versions of the silhouette that wouldn’t look out of place on a red carpet. On the other end of the hemline spectrum, Toga and Keburia showed architectural minis, and Sinead O’Dwyer and Chopova Lowena (who didn’t host a runway show this season but presented a lookbook instead) offered more wearable versions of the look. London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Brooches Following in the footsteps of the runways of New York, London’s accessory of the moment was a brooch. The retro ornament, which ranged from florals and bows to more surrealist motifs, added a touch of whimsy to plenty of outerwear and monochrome looks. For those who don’t love the idea of an additional accessory, many designers showed shirting with embellished and graphic designs, numerals, and insignias on the chest for a slightly younger take on the grandmother-chic look.

They appeared in the form of traditional belts wrapped around the waist or embellishing leather jackets — but also adorned handbags and made up one covetable harness at Simone Rocha. Buckle detailing also added edge to pant legs at SRVC and held together a strapless dress that conjured the costumes of Clueless at Sinead Gorey. London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Double Bottoms If you don’t believe that the 2010s are back, look no further than the last few seasons that saw the resurgence of the pants-over-skirts look. While this hybrid remained popular this season, you would think you were seeing double at Jawara Alleyne and Charlie Constantinou, who showed shirts and pants layered over… more pants, and Bora Aksu and Toga, who sent out models wearing two tiers of skirts.

While the boxer shorts trend and bras-as-tops look were plenty prevalent (as in seasons past), the more unexpected look came via hosiery. Sinead O’Dwyer’s perforated stockings (held together by a visible garter belt) complemented the short looks shown on the runway, DiPetsa’s intricate lace-detailed stockings sweetly contrasted the sexiness of the collection, and patterned tights were as statement-making as the bra-and-coat look that they were paired with at Sinead Gorey, whose collection was inspired by “a way of dressing that only surfaces during the wee hours — a time when the club has closed, the sun is rising and the first train back awaits.” London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2025 Trend: Lacing Delicate strands of fabric and ties added beautiful detailing to the runways of London. Bow-adorned arm wraps provided an ultra-feminine alternative to the popular opera gloves look at Pauline Dujancourt, silky red ribbon beautifully contrasted a midi black dress at Simone Rocha that will be on my must-buy list in the fall, and front lacing shoes — created in collaboration with Grounds and nodding to traditional Irish dancing — completed the looks at Sinead O’ Dwyer. Meanwhile, lacing in the form of corsetry added a sweet touch to shirting at Tolu Coker and a tough edge to the tied-up looks at Dilara Findikoglu. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "title": "Does the Viral Skims Nipple Bra Look and Feel Realistic? Here's My Take",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/skims-nipple-bra-review-49371344",
    "description": "You've probably already caught \"The Kardashians\" clip of Scott Disick recognizing Kim Kardashian's Skims nipple bra on Khloé and immediately inquiring, \"Do you have the new nipple bra on?\" \"Of course,\" Khloé replies. \"These are Kim's nipples on my body.\" Naturally, I adopted that very same phrase when I headed out the door with my partner for brunch wearing the one and only Skims Ultimate Nipple Push-Up Bra ($64) in Clay. \"These are Kim Kardashian's nipples on my body!\" I shouted with glee as I stood on the sidewalk requesting a Lyft. I should preface the rest of this review by explaining that I'm not a bra person. I have a small bust (30B/32A) and I tend to let my chest breathe most of the time, or employ boob tape and covers when necessary (i.e. when my shirt is see-through). For that reason, wearing a padded push-up bra equipped with built-in raised nipples was a full-blown experience for me. I chose a fitted white T-shirt to achieve optimal effect of this innovative look, styling it with a slip skirt and white sneakers to keep my outfit minimal. Not only was I trying on the nipple bra for comfortability and quality, I was quizzically observing passersby - specifically those I came in contact with - to determine whether they caught wind of my Kardashian nipples on full display. Ahead, check out my thorough review of the bra (which I own in both Clay and Onyx), and read directly quoted feedback from my boyfriend, which I simply had to seek upon reading customer reviews such as, \"My husband cannot look into my eyes when I'm wearing this bra\" and \"My husband asked me if I got a boob job overnight.\" @ps.feelgood If anyone's going to test out the viral Skims Ultimate Nipple Push-Up Bra, it's PS editor Sarah Wasilak. The bra was featured on the latest episode of \"The Kardashians\" on Hulu, where Khloé Kardashian wears it while talking to Scott Disick and Kris Jenner. Tap the link in bio as our editor gives us the lowdown after wearing the bra while out for brunch. #Skims #KimKardashian #Bra #TikTokFashion ♬ original sound - PS About the Skims Nipple Push-Up Bra The bra is modeled after Skims co-founder Kim Kardashian's own bust, which she confirmed on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\" The material is 84 percent nylon, 16 percent spandex and feels like super-soft microfiber with a sheen against your skin. It's available in Skims's popular neutral colorways including Sand, Clay, Sienna, Bronze, Jasper, Cocoa, and Onyx. The band size range is 30-44 and the cup size range is A-F. The lightweight foam pads, which classify the bra as a push-up, are tapered for natural-looking lift and support, according to the site. The design is equipped with smoothing wings on the side and hidden underwire with a soft casing. The straps are adjustable and there's a hook and eye closure at the back. The bra should be hand washed and should not be placed in the dryer or dry cleaned. What I Like About the Skims Nipple Push-Up Bra This bra, which has over 200 reviews and a 4.7-star rating, is first and foremost an original. There aren't many other models like it on the market, and it absolutely serves its purpose. Although I mentioned I'm not much of a bra-wearer, I've worn a push-up bra or two in my day and can confirm this design absolutely lifts my bust and rounds out the shape of my breasts with extra padding. The nipples are also easy to discern under clothing (yes, even if you're wearing black or dark tops). Fit-wise, the bra runs true to size. (Note: The site suggests sizing up if you're in-between band widths after taking your measurements.) As Kardashian mentioned during her \"Kimmel\" segment, many breast cancer survivors have expressed appreciation for the bra as an option for women who have undergone mastectomies and may have not been able to keep their nipples. In my opinion, a product that helps women feel more confident in any way is an obvious win. If a perky bust is what you're after, the Skims Nipple Bra more than meets expectations. Is the Skims Nipple Push-Up Bra Comfortable? As I've mentioned, I'm most comfortable going braless. But I would compare the comfortability of the Skims Nipple Bra to any other push-up bra I've worn in the past (my other go-to for years has been the Victoria's Secret Very Sexy Bombshell). That being said, it's important to note that in order for the nipples to appear prominent through layers, the foam pads in each cup must be highly structured, so you're going to feel less of a forgiving cushion and more of a thick and firm filling. Skims also recommends going up a band size if you're worried about digging or pinching at the sides - and while I didn't experience either, I would describe the fit in this area to be \"extra-snug,\" which is a smidge above \"snug\" but not quite \"tight\" in my book. Does the Skims Nipple Push-Up Bra Look Natural? This is where opinions become particularly subjective. Let's start with my personal stance: when I look at myself in the mirror while wearing the Skims Nipple Bra, I do not feel like my bust looks natural. As a braless advocate, my nipples have gotten hard before where I've been able to make them out through my shirt, and my own pair aren't nearly as perky as the Kardashian set. That being said, from afar, I do think the bra provides a realistic illusion. While going about my day, I believe I witnessed a handful of prolonged stares at my chest, but then again, I am one paranoid individual. If these viewers were scoping out the area, I'm inclined to think they were more curious about the bra itself while equally aware that I was not experiencing a chill on a sweltering hot, 85-degree day while sipping my Aperol spritz. While going about my day, I believe I witnessed a handful of prolonged stares at my chest, but then again, I am one paranoid individual. My boyfriend's take? After spending a full 24-hours with me, myself, and Kardashian's nipples, he declared: \"The nipples are not round enough and they seem to be misplaced.\" (We tried to fix this by adjusting the straps, but he ultimately felt like the placement of the nipples was not proportional to the would-be cleavage area on my shirt.) \"Also, no two nipples are alike, just like no two fingerprints are alike,\" he continued, \"So the fact that both nipples look the same raises alarms as to the authenticity of the bra.\" Given his career in tech and his interest in the development of products, he also suggested that he would like to see some sort of dynamic model, where the nipples can be adjusted to both hard and soft settings to mimic the natural body. All of this being said, if the lifelike quality of the bra is preventing you from purchasing it, Kardashian did tease that the brand is working on a \"softer\" version during her \"Kimmel\" appearance. What to Consider Before Buying the Skims Nipple Push-Up Bra Skims allows for 30-day free returns for store credit (see the store locator list if you prefer to shop in person). However, the brand's policy also states that for a refund back to the original payment method (if you purchased the bra online), a $6 return shipping fee will apply. For that reason, I highly recommend seeking a location that has the bra in stock to try it on before purchasing it. If you do decide you want to return the bra, it must be unworn, unwashed, and in the original condition with all tags - so be careful during your try-on process. Finally, don't forget to go up a band size if you're in-between sizes and hate the feeling of restriction around your abs, chest, and bust line.
