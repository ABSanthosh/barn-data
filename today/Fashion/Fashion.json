    "description": "Apps like Depop and Vinted are hugely popular, but an online culture of scams, rage and suspicion is now the default between buyers and sellers, with communications quickly descending into hurling abuse at a strangerHere is a real-life conversation on a secondhand shopping app: a buyer of two items asks if a seller could combine postage costs. The petulant seller refuses. After a grating plea from the buyer, the seller retorts, “Fine, I’ll refund you, but I’m doing it my way.” Eventually, the buyer receives a large piece of card with a load of grubby coppers stuck to it with Sellotape. On the back it says, “Enjoy the refund!”And there’s nothing odd about this – these sorts of exchanges between Brits on marketplace apps are so commonplace they have become part of the texture of the shopping experience. Maybe even part of the fun. But why do we communicate like this? What is happening that we can’t be remotely polite and normal? Where have our famous manners gone? Continue reading...",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Reflecting on the top color trends of 2024, a few contenders swiftly come to mind. Charli xcx’s Brat Green was the loud, abrasive color no one could escape, Pantone deemed Peach Fuzz the must-have color of the year, and at a certain point in time, it was impossible to leave the house and not see someone trotting around in siren red socks or tights. It was a year that embraced a diverse range of expressive hues, cementing the truth that there’s always room for color in your wardrobe, no matter your personal style.  In 2025, there are a few standout colors that are likely to gain traction. The spring/summer 2025 runways offer a peek at what’s to come, as does the street style and influencer circuit, which is already embracing powdery pastels (icy blue and petal pink, to name a couple), saturated tones of green and red, and a certain shade of brown that we predict will be everywhere in no time flat. If you’re keen to begin incorporating these into your outfits now, read on for our predictions of the colors that’ll define 2025 fashion. 2025 Color Trend: 24K Gold While butter yellow is surely on your radar already, a richer tone — 24k gold — is popping up on the runways of labels like Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Gabriela Hearst, emphasizing the impact of a confident hue. Similar to 24k jewelry, with its lustrous, gold nugget-like appearance, this yellow can be incorporated as an accent, contrasted with muted neutrals or layered with a vibrant pattern to punctuate the look. 2025 Color Trend: Tea Rose The impact of Barbiecore can’t be overstated and while hot pink may be shimmying out of the spotlight for now, an onslaught of designers are embracing a gentle tea rose hue in 2025. From Khaite’s dreamy dresses crafted in powdery pink swaths of silk gazar to Simone Rocha’s and Ferragamo’s ballet-adjacent, petal pink separates, all signs point toward another year of pink. 2025 Color Trend: Icy Blue Ethereal, elegant and effortless to style, icy shades of blue are one of 2025’s most covetable color trends. Countless runways have endorsed the delicate hue, from rich-in-detail separates at Cecilie Bahnsen to floaty dresses at Prabal Gurung and Chloé. Wear it head-to-toe or as an accent — it’s among the most versatile colors around. 2025 Color Trend: Marigold A brand-new year often calls for a zippy color to perk up your wardrobe. 2025’s answer to this? Marigold. This cheery yellow-orange is cropping up as an oh-so covetable skirt at Prada, a gorgeous asymmetrical ruffled skirt at Bottega Veneta, and a head-to-toe pleated dress at Simkhai (among several others) for spring. 2025 Color Trend: Cardinal Red Siren red has been a staple color for the last few seasons — who can forget Tibi’s red socks paired with red ballet flats? Though the fiery hue will likely continue on its trajectory (it’s pretty timeless, after all), the 2025 runways have been pointing to cardinal red as a sultry alternative. Gucci’s purplish-red lace dress will be hard to resist once it hits shelves, as will Louise Trotter’s expertly crafted separates for Carven, which could be worn just as easily to the office as on a dinner date. 2025 Color Trend: Periwinkle Every few years, periwinkle prances its way back into the trend cycle, reminding us just how striking this color really is. Stella McCartney’s a proponent of the fanciful hue, translating it into a dramatic sheer gown that would look impeccable on the red carpet. A subtler alternative can be found at Tod’s by way of a structural top (best paired with slouchy slacks and sandals). And for the ultimate party dress moment, Brandon Maxwell takes the cake with his eye-popping halter neck frock. 2025 Color Trend: Chocolate Brown Rich, chocolate brown will play a starring role in 2025. This timeless neutral is among the easiest to style and manages to feel a bit more refined than a simple black or charcoal gray. Look to runways like Max Mara for inspiration on how to wear it: For spring, the brand weaves the elegant hue into a smattering of chic looks, from tailoring and evening attire to an oversized jacket and coordinated mini skirt that nods perfectly to ‘70s style.  2025 Color Trend: Frog Green Brat Green took the fashion world by storm this year, but the hue is pivoting in a slightly quieter direction in the new year by way of frog green. These grassy hues have become a favorite on runways that often have a hand in setting trends — think Sandy Liang’s cool-girl separates and Victoria Beckham’s memorable green gown worn by Gigi Hadid.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s been a few seasons since Allison Bornstein’s wrong shoe theory — the idea that a surprising shoe choice can anchor a look — entered the social zeitgeist and took the fashion world by storm. While its intention was to encourage experimentation with footwear when the impetus strikes, there’s something about the upcoming crop of shoe trends that might have us calling on this nugget of sartorial wisdom on the regular.  As we look forward, the top styles emerging for 2025 offer an exciting look back on silhouettes we’d never thought would see a comeback. Case in point: the clunky-but-chic clogs revival (as seen at Chloé’s spring/summer 2025 show, as well as Hermès and Burberry runways), plus the improbable resurgence of the peep toe (ushered in by labels like Tory Burch, Miu Miu and Acne) and the low-profile sneaker silhouette that’s finally unseated the Gazelle at Stella McCartney, Dior and Loewe. So far, we have a healthy mix of polarizing, surprising and delightful, all at once. At the core of the styles that will define 2025, though, is function — after all, it’s reasonable to expect you’ll be able to walk in them, albeit not always comfortably. Ready to dig your heels into another year? Ahead, 2025’s top shoe trends, plus the exact styles we’re eyeing to get ahead of the game.  2025 Shoe Trend: Peep Toe One of the more divisive shoes on the rise, the peep-toe heel is making its triumphant return. It almost feels inevitable: After years of an early-aughts revival with low-rise pants, baby tees and butterfly clips, the footwear silhouette is the banner style at Tory Burch, Miu Miu, Prada, Acne Studios and Copenhagen Fashion Week darling Remain; it’s also been worn by the likes of Addison Rae and Amal Clooney. One thing’s for sure: We’ll be seeing a lot more of it soon. 2025 Shoe Trend: Transparency Coming on the heels of quiet luxury, see-through shoes of all kinds are no longer just a Disney princess’ dream. Glass, lucite and otherwise transparent footwear is taking hold at Rabanne, Victoria Beckham, Giambattista Valli and Gucci, the latter of which debuted a curved lucite wedge heel alongside its range of sneakers and loafers. Meanwhile, Brandon Maxwell’s iteration — a netted-upper flat — feels like a natural progression of the mesh shoe trend. 2025 Shoe Trend: Back-To-School Loafers How long does a style have to be relevant for its trend status to be revoked? Whatever it is, loafers are about a season away from cementing their status as a permanent, all-season favorite. This year’s take on the ever-chic shoe came in the form of platform brogues at Chanel, a cut-out iteration at Simone Rocha and two-tone Oxfords at Loewe. Willy Chavarria’s take boasts a knee-high sock, and there are still plenty of hosiery-and-loafer combinations that have yet to be seen. 2025 Shoe Trend: Boxing-Style Sneakers Some seasons tend to play to the fantastical, while others veer more practical. Adidas Gazelles have had more than a few seasons as the pragmatic sneaker du jour; now it’s time for something even more low-profile: the boxing sneaker.  The telltale marker of the tall sports shoe isn’t its lace-up ankle protection but rather its hyper-thin sole that allows for quick, agile feet. Labels like Miu Miu, Stella McCartney, Dior, Ann Demeulemeester and Loewe all debuted similar, performance-minded styles. While those have yet to hit stores, Adidas reissued its Japan VH shoe, which also showed up at Caroline Hu’s spring 2025 presentation complete with floral embroidery and bow embellishments. Expect to see more and more similar styles crop up over the coming months. 2025 Shoe Trend: Reimagined Thong Sandals Brat summer ushered in many an unlikely trend but it also welcomed the resurgence of old favorites, like the ‘90s-era thong sandal. While Havaianas’ stock steadily rose, so did fashion’s interest in the easy-wearing, minimalist shoe. Designers like Tibi, Alaïa, Carven and Sportmax reimagine the faithful silhouette — once marked by a foam sole and plastic upper — with a platform and triangle upper, each begging to find a home next to loose-fit suiting separates, pedal pushers or tiered maxi skirts. 2025 Shoe Trend: Nouveau Heel This trend lands right in the sweet spot between fantastical and practical. We’ve seen our fair share of nontraditional heels in seasons past but this year’s bunch feels even more creative. A bulbous, rock-hard clementine or a sleek, undulating wedge may seem like a bizarre (and squarely artful) thing to walk on but this new crop of heels often boasts a larger surface area, thereby increasing walkability. Tory Burch’s sculptural, curved heel made its way down the runway with ease, while Victoria Beckham’s chunky lucite heel is as sturdy as it is divine. 2025 Shoe Trend: Clogs A token of the bohemian aesthetic that took off in the early aughts around the same time Coachella became a household name, the lowly clog — which originated in 13th-century Amsterdam to protect the feet of farmers and workers — often gets a bad rap. These days, clogs take on a more towering, aesthetically grounded shape that, well, isn’t for everyone. Still, Chloé’s front-row stunt proved successful: Liya Kebede, Sienna Miller, Kiernan Shipka, Georgia May Jagger and even Pat Cleveland showed up wearing the brand’s signature platform wedge clogs. Meanwhile, other labels like Burberry and Miu Miu put their own spin on the shoe. Resist the urge to wear them with a romantic, sweeping maxi and a wide-brimmed hat, and instead style them as you would a slingback for a truly modern take. 2025 Shoe Trend: All Tied Up Balletcore may be cooling off but something more romantic — and, dare we say, sexy — is bidding for its prime placement. Unapologetically chic, the tie-up shoe has its origins in the delicate trends that came before it. At Proenza Schouler, a round-toe sandal has strings that crisscross and gather at the ankle, while Ferragamo’s thong sandal-ballerina hybrid features true-to-form grosgrain ribbon up to the calf. Meanwhile, Ann Demeulemeester is holding onto the shoe’s ballet roots with a square-toe style laced up a thin-ribbed sock for a more performance-minded take. Like what you see?
