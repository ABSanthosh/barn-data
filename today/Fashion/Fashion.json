    "description": "From the sisters in Nobody Wants to Ashley Jensen’s detective in Shetland, one hairstyle dominated ambient TV this yearThe 2024 Netflix series Nobody Wants This was widely adored for many reasons – not least the concept of the Hot Rabbi, the renaissance of its star, former The OC geek-hearthrob Adam Brody, and the soothing LA lifestyle porn. But, for many of us, through Brody’s co-stars Kristen Bell and Justine Lupe, it was simply another 2024 example of what has become known in some quarters as “TV hair”.Throughout the series, Bell and Lupe, playing two very LA sisters who co-host a podcast about sex and relationships, sport a very specific brand of subtly waved hair. Neither ringlets nor straight, it’s glossy and well-styled, done but not too “done”. And it’s in any TV series where white women are the main characters – see Meghann Fahey in The Perfect Couple; Rose Byrne in Platonic; or even, back in 2021, Anna Kendrick in Love Life. It’s arrived in the UK too – Ashley Jensen has TV hair in Shetland, which crucially remains immaculate even on the windswept isle. Far away from the ultra-glam tresses seen on Love Island, this look may be subtly “done”, but – make no mistake – it is definitely “done”. Continue reading...",

    "description": "Apps like Depop and Vinted are hugely popular, but an online culture of scams, rage and suspicion is now the default between buyers and sellers, with communications quickly descending into hurling abuse at a strangerHere is a real-life conversation on a secondhand shopping app: a buyer of two items asks if a seller could combine postage costs. The petulant seller refuses. After a grating plea from the buyer, the seller retorts, “Fine, I’ll refund you, but I’m doing it my way.” Eventually, the buyer receives a large piece of card with a load of grubby coppers stuck to it with Sellotape. On the back it says, “Enjoy the refund!”And there’s nothing odd about this – these sorts of exchanges between Brits on marketplace apps are so commonplace they have become part of the texture of the shopping experience. Maybe even part of the fun. But why do we communicate like this? What is happening that we can’t be remotely polite and normal? Where have our famous manners gone? Continue reading...",

This winter staple is as essential as your trusty sherpa, faux fur, or classic wool coat. However, too many puffers look cute but barely survive a snowflake. This season, it’s all about jackets that deliver on both warmth and style, such as the sold-out-in-seconds neutral puffer from the Skims x North Face collab, Aritzia’s The Super Puff in a rainbow of colors, and the iconic DKNY long coat (a fail-safe for full-body warmth).But the lineup doesn’t stop at these viral favorites. Levi’s denim puffer is rewriting winter cool. Hollister’s pink puffer might be sold out, but the black is just as cute — and possibly even more versatile. Athleta’s makes transitioning from Pilates to errands seamless, and Khy’s is flying off shelves in every cut and color.This season’s puffers prove that your wardrobe needs more than just one. Ahead, shop the styles we’ve crowned the best. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Classic Neutrals  Whether white, green, or beige, these neutral puffers go with everything — your winter wardrobe’s best friend, no questions asked. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Black  A black puffer? Versatile, sleek, and peak functional. When in doubt, this is the one that gets it done. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Long  Long puffers = maximum coverage, minimal effort. Perfect for when it’s freezing and you still want to feel wrapped up in your duvet. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Glossy \u0026 Iridescent   Shiny, bold, and kinda-sorts extra: With their playful sheen, these puffers make bundling feel anything but painful. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Cropped  Short on length, big on impact — cropped puffers are it for nailing that frigid-but-make-it-fashion vibe. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Cozy Textures  Fleece, teddy, and soft-to-the-touch textures take cozy to the next level — the ultimate travel puffer that doubles as a pillow en route.  Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Printed  If intense splashes of color aren’t your preferred way to make a statement, go for a print. Take your pick from charming gingham, bold leopard, girlhood bows, and florals. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Quilted  Tailored fits and timeless quilting offer a clean, classic, and warm look without the bulk. It’s winter’s answer to fall’s must-have barn jacket.  Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Winter Blues  From icy pastels to rich navy, blue is one of the season’s top-trending colors. When your trusty neutral puffer feels overplayed, these shades bring a crisp refresh. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Adventure-Ready Built for the slopes, but equally great for your morning coffee run, these puffers are designed to brace the elements and stylish enough for everywhere else. Best Puffer Jackets \u0026 Coats: Colorblock  Unexpected color combos and graphic blocking give these puffers serious personality. They’re the winter coat equivalent of a power clash — bold, playful, and eye-catching. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Perhaps you’re partial to a voluminous, wide-leg look or have never said goodbye to skinny jeans of yore (hey, no judgment here). Maybe a utilitarian-looking cargo style is more your sartorial speed. Regardless of your tried-and-true fit, 2025 could be the year you expand your denim horizons, as the up-and-coming true blues trends are decidedly a breath of fresh air. According to Shopbop’s senior fashion director, Caroline Maguire, next year’s frontrunning denim looks will be all about reinvention — specifically, classic silhouettes with unexpected twists. “We’re seeing a blend of nostalgia and innovation,” she tells Refinery29. “While some trends nod to the past with vintage-inspired washes and silhouettes, others embrace modern, statement-making details that feel entirely fresh.” She adds that the masses are seeking denim that stands out, be it by way of bold treatments, intriguing distressing, or unique fabrics.  Meanwhile, Erin Meehan, creative director of women’s denim at Frame, says there will be an emphasis on slim, sleek, and tailored silhouettes in 2025. “There will still be the presence of a play on proportion,” she says. “Women need multiple shapes in their wardrobes now to give them unlimited styling options and levels of comfort,  from super casual to more dressed up.” Without further ado, read up on eight denim trends poised to take off in 2025, according to the pros.  Denim Trend 2025: ‘70s-Inspired Flares Transport your closet back to the ‘70s with a pair of flares inspired by the bygone era.  “Nostalgia is driving the push towards the ‘70s flare that we’re going to see across both genders in the seasons ahead,” explains AG’s in-house stylist, Ashley Catuzzi. The groovy trend’s alive and well in the Spring/Summer 2025 collections. At Chloé, creative director Chemena Kamali serves up a high-waisted look, which resembles a pair designed by Phoebe Philo in 2004. (Fashion is cyclical, after all.) Contemporary brands like AG of course, as well as Anthropologie and Torrid are now offering the dramatic look — choose your fighter. Denim Trend 2025: Barrel-Leg Jeans Picking up where 2024 left off, barrel jeans are set to make an even bigger splash in 2025. According to Pistola’s founder, Grace Na, it’s the latest hero silhouette: “The barrel leg gives emphasis to the bottom half of an outfit, allowing for the top portion to be more fitted and paired down. When you find the right fit, this silhouette can be very flattering.” Celebrities like Blake Lively and Julianne Moore have also co-signed the billowy jeans — a testament to the style’s cool flair. Denim Trend 2025: Jorts  Sun’s out, legs out: Jorts will bubble up next year, confirms AG’s Catuzzi. In Copenhagen, Scandi-cool labels like Skall Studio and Caro Editions presented their takes on look, the former giving jorts a polished touch with its clean knee-length style, and the latter offering up a pair enlivened with bright red lip motifs and a cigarette hanging out of the mouth. Diesel, too, reimagines the classic bottoms for spring, showcasing a style with captivating long fringe details that go from the upper thigh all the way down to the calf. As for styling your jorts, Catuzzi is keen on strappy sandals, mules, or knee-high boots — go with what makes the most sense for the forecast.  Denim Trend 2025: Distressed Jeans “Distressed denim is making a major comeback, with shoppers drawn to its effortless, lived-in look,” says Maguire. “From subtle abrasions to bold, shredded finishes, this trend appeals to those seeking a relaxed yet edgy aesthetic.” The fashion director also notes that the edgy look is a surefire way to add texture and personality to any outfit. On the runways, designers like MM6 Maison Margiela and Diesel have made a compelling case for the early aughts-inspired denim silhouette. Denim Trend 2025: Bootcut Jeans Ready or not, low-rise bootcut jeans are predicated to emerge in 2025 — just ask Still Here’s founder Sonia Mosseri. “This has been a trend I’ve seen slowly brewing,” the expert notes. Designers, including Mosseri, are breathing new life into the Y2K-inspired look by way of cropped silhouettes, intriguing stitching, and more fresh details. Meehan is on the same page, noting how modern bootcuts with a more gradual, smooth transition from the knee to the leg opening are on course to reign. So, no, you won’t be mistaken for The O.C.’s Marissa Cooper. Denim Trend 2025: Baggy Cargo Jeans “On the other end of the spectrum, super baggy cargo will be back, too,” says Mosseri, referring to the aforementioned bootcut trend. The slouchy look is also the antithesis of the skinny jeans that have been unearthed as of late. With functional pockets and a feel-good roomy fit, it’s no wonder style mavens like Katie Holmes have welcomed the fit with open arms. Denim Trend 2025: Dark Wash Jeans Elena Bonvicini, the founder of celebrity-loved brand EB Denim, points to dark wash jeans as a look to watch out for over the next few months. “It’s coming with the minimal chic look we’re seeing right now,” she says about the up-and-coming trend. And she’s absolutely right: There’s something about a deeper denim shade that feels a smidge more polished than, say, an ultra-light wash. Denim Trend 2025: Double Denim Why wear one denim look when you can sport two? This seems to be the mindset of the industry’s leading designers, as the denim-on-denim look dominated runways a few months ago —  at Coach, by way of a jean jacket and coordinating roomy jeans, at Cinq à Sept in a floral print-heavy two-piece set, and elsewhere. The beauty of the look is it’s a breeze to throw on when you’re rushing to get out of the door. Like what you see?
