The retailer is gearing up to release what it calls “the most luxurious pyjamas the high street has ever seen”. It has teamed up with Olivia von Halle, a British designer known for her fancy silk PJs that sell for upwards of £600. From Tuesday, at M\u0026S you’ll be able to pick up a similar set for £55.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. Following the last six months of industry musical chairs, another wave took place in March when it was announced that three major fashion houses were undergoing changes: Demna leaving Balenciaga to become Gucci’s new artistic director, Donatella Versace stepping down as creative director of her namesake legacy brand and Jonathan Anderson leaving Loewe after 11 years at its helm. But career changes weren’t the only headline-worthy fashion moments in March, with Paris Fashion Week providing plenty of moments that stopped the internet. Chappell Roan stepped straight from the 2025 Grammy Awards into the Rick Owens show wearing an alien-inspired, dotted face paint look complete with white contacts. Doechii made her fashion week debut with a gravity-defying blowdry at Schiaparelli, not to mention a frosted green eyeshadow look and black-lined lips for the Acne FROW. Plus, Gigi Hadid made a case for the “silver tequila” bob at the Le Grand Dîner du Louvre. For those on the hunt for even more fashion and beauty inspiration, you’ll be glad to know that April has a slew of exciting releases, launches, and products heading your way. Read ahead to take a look at all the best fashion and beauty bits coming this month.All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Reformation x Devon Lee CarlsonFollowing drops with Laura Harrier and Camille Rowe, Reformation is back with another It Girl collaboration. This time, the brand tapped Devon Lee Carlson to design the new collection. The standout looks of the 20-piece collection include a chocolate polka dot mini dress, a '90s-inspired sky blue co-ord complete with a matching neck scarf, and a backless black lace knit dress — all made using materials like organic cotton and deadstock fabrics.Shop now at ReformationReformation x Devon Lee Carlson Cher Dress, $, available at ReformationJones Road Just Enough Tinted MoisturizerSummer is coming, and that means switching up our coverage in favor of something more warm-weather-appropriate. Jones Road (created by makeup artist Bobbi Brown) is on the case with the launch of the new Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer. Designed to conceal redness and even out the skin tone with light coverage, this product is ideal for those who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup. The silky formula minimizes the appearance of redness and hyperpigmentation without a mask-like finish and provides just enough tint for minimal makeup days. Shop now at Jones Road BeautyJones Road Just Enough Tinted Moisturizer, $, available at Jones Road\u0026 Other Stories’ Heart-filled Savoir CollectionWhen it comes to \u0026 Other Stories’ spring 2025 Savoir Collection, it’s all about love. The latest edition of the brand’s more luxurious, atelier-focused line is made up of cherry reds, blossom pinks, and pieces covered in whimsical heart, lip, and bow motifs. Find a cropped white button-front shirt with beaded detailing on the collar, wide-leg pleated trousers with delicate ties on the leg, a warm-weather-ready maxi dress with sequinned embellishments, and so much more. Shop on April 10 at \u0026 Other Stories The Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance SerumAntioxidants (think vitamin C) can offer a neutralizing and protective effect against free radicals like UV and pollution, keeping skin bright, bouncy, and smooth. But while one antioxidant is a great start, The Ordinary is now bringing eight key antioxidant ingredients together in its new Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum. Here’s why it’s beneficial: Our skin is consistently exposed to the aforementioned environmental aggressors, and these free radicals build up and lead to fine lines, dullness, and uneven skin tone. This serum works hard to prevent that from happening — and our beauty director is already a big fan.Shop now at The Ordinary and SephoraThe Ordinary Multi-Antioxidant Radiance Serum, $, available at SephoraBarbour x CrocsBarbour might be best known for being a favorite of the British Royal Family, but this spring, the heritage label is stepping into a more casual territory, announcing a collaboration with functional footwear brand Crocs. The limited-edition collection contains a wax jacket, two footwear styles in a tartan graphic print, and nine Jibbitz charms, bringing together the playfulness of Crocs and the practicality of Barbour. Festival season, here we come.Shop now at BarbourBarbour x Crocs Oversized Bedale Waxed Jacket, $, available at Barbour​​Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer in Ceramic PinkThe beauty world stood still in 2016 when Dyson brought out its first ergonomic hair dryer. Since then, the tech giant has dominated the hair space with the Coralle straightener and the highly coveted Airwrap multi-styler. Recently, the company announced that its professional Supersonic r™ hair dryer will soon be available to the public, having previously only been exclusive to salons and hairstylists. To mark the occasion, you can buy the curve-nozzled dryer in a pearly pink colorway (with a purple gemstone shade available in the summer). The Supersonic r™ is Dyson’s lightest and most powerful hairdryer, offering easier maneuverability in comparison to the original model, as well as specific attachments for straight, wavy, curly and coily hair types.Shop now at Dyson Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer, $, available at DysonNomasei Debuts First Stiletto HeelsParis-based footwear brand Nomasei is the label behind the fashion crowd’s favorite stylish (and comfy!) loafer, but it’s not stopping there. For the first time ever, the brand debuted stiletto heels: the Gattaca ($595), a streamlined slingback pump available in embossed white and black patent leathers, and the Before Sunrise ($651), an open-toed sandal with ankle straps also available in embossed black and white leather. According to the press release, Nomasei co-founder Paule Tenaillon was inspired by her years designing classic tango heels in Buenos Aires, where comfort and wearability were all-important. As a result, both styles (which were named for the cult ’90s films) also emphasize arch support and memory foam. Shop now at Nomasei Nomasei Gattaca Pumps, $, available at NomaseiSol de Janeiro Limited-Edition Perfume Mist CollectionIf you ask us, a new season calls for a new scent. Luckily, Sol de Janeiro is launching three fragrances this month, each with its own distinct Powerpuff Girl-esque personality. Flor Mística is spring in a bottle, thanks to notes of orange blossom, flamingo flower, and Brazilian gardenia. Água Mística is for fans of something fresh, with notes of neroli water, salty skin, and tangerine, while Dança Mística is made for the dance floor, with hints of purple fig, warm vanilla, sandalwood, and lily of the valley. Plus, the set comes with a Scent Menu —  tips on how to layer the fragrances to create your own unique combination. Shop now at Sol de JaneiroSol de Janeiro Limited Edition Perfume Mist Trio, $, available at Sol de JaneiroSANDRO x Louise BourgeoisFor the artistic among us, the announcement of Sandro’s latest collection will be joyous news to the ears. Taking inspiration from French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, the spring collection features geometric patterns. In particular, spirals feature heavily in the collection, inspired in part by the artist’s famous “Spider” sculpture. Boasting Mediterranean blues and oat milk neutrals, the collection features linen dresses, silky trousers, and cotton poplin pants — a perfect spring wardrobe.Shop on April 9 at SandroColorwow Texas Hold’em Big Hold Hairspray Colorwow's Texas Hold'em Hairspray is a perfect paradox — it delivers a strong hold yet feels like the lightest hairspray you've ever tried. It kept our beauty director’s waves intact throughout an entire day, an eight-hour night flight, and a lengthy layover in an airport, making it feel almost a shame to wash out. Even better? It offers additional heat and UV protection, shields against frizz-inducing humidity, and brushes out with ease, leaving hair feeling soft and silky, not crispy or chalky. Shop now at SephoraColorWow Texas Hold 'Em Big Hold Hairspray, $, available at SephoraMagda Butrym x H\u0026MEach H\u0026M designer collaboration is an anticipated event. Whether you’ve previously recurred a pair of Simone Rocha beaded drop earrings or a corseted Mugler dress, the collaborations offer a chance to enter the world of luxury at a much sweeter price point. For the latest collection, the Swedish giant has turned to Polish designer Magda Butrym, who has dubbed the 19-piece collection a “celebration of femininity in bloom.” From denim bustiers with 3D rose adornments to shimmering gowns with glittering floral embellishments, this collection is made for spring soirees.Shop on April 24 at H\u0026MLike what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If you’re in the midst of spring cleaning and swapping out your closet and drawers with warm-weather pieces, don’t forget to refresh your shoe rack, too. And, as you step into spring, there’s one place where you can do all of your spring shoe shopping: DSW. The footwear and accessories retailer has every style you could possibly desire, and its new Spring Lookbook is full of inspiration and major warm-weather shoe trends that you can cart up.Whether you’re looking for a festival shoe, to take on the fisherman aesthetic, or party like it’s the ’90s, DSW has a broad range of designs to help you accomplish all your goals in style. Refresh your shoe stand with a new pair of gladiator sandals, boat shoes, and slingback heels. Or all of the above. And, of course, you can also find trendy ballet flats and sporty sneakers to round out your everyday footwear collection.Read on to explore DSW’s new arrivals and bestsellers to find the perfect pair (or pairs) for you to stroll around in this spring. DashDividers_1_500x100 Prim \u0026 Preppy: Ballet Flats \u0026 Loafers Upgrade your spring work outfits (or bring the preppy aesthetic into your day-to-day looks) with a new pair of ballet flats or loafers. Flats made their comeback in 2024, with Mary Jane styles and mesh designs going viral. If you don’t already own a pair, DSW has a ton of new arrivals to bring some prep to your step. Similarly loafers are trending after making several recent runway appearances. Swap out chunky back-to-school styles, for lightweight loafers (like penny loafers and driving shoes) for spring. DashDividers_1_500x100 Festival-Ready: Gladiator Sandals, Platforms \u0026 Clogs Heading to Coachella this weekend, or have other festivals lined up this spring and summer? We found a range of gladiator sandals (for chilled out vibes), platform sandals (for avoiding the mud and peeking over tall concert goers, and clogs (for extra comfort). Of course you could wear sneakers or boots, but these skin-baring spring styles promise to elevate your festival look. They’re also versatile enough to wear out for casual spring outings and parties for when you’re back from the desert. DashDividers_1_500x100 Casual Retro Vibes: Sporty Sneakers Retro-inspired, sporty sneakers (in all their slim-silhouette and vibrant-hued glory) aren’t going out of style anytime soon. And thankfully, you don’t have to take up a sport to wear these styles — they just add an effortlessly cool and casual athletic look to any outfit. Look to DSW’s selection of tried-and-true sneaker brands for soccer cleat- and basketball high-top-inspired styles in neutrals and spring-ready colors such as bubblegum pink and corn yellow. DashDividers_1_500x100 Seaside Strolls: Boat Shoes \u0026 Fisherman Sandals If 2024 brought us “European Summer,” then 2025 is bringing us “Fisherman Spring.” And the easiest way to hop on the TikTok-viral trend is via shoes and accessories. Luckily, DSW has a ton of trendy boat shoes and fisherman sandals to pick from. You can opt for a classic leather boat shoe… or a colorful canvas one. You can also choose from sturdy leather fisherman sandals… or playful jelly styles, because the world is your oyster. Style them with your favorite cargo pants or jorts, and go chic-fisherman mode. DashDividers_1_500x100 ’90s Throwback: Slingback Heels \u0026 Thong Sandals Indulge in some ‘90s nostalgia in a pair of kitten heels. (The short heels are more practical for cobblestones and grass than a pair of stilettos anyway.) We’re currently vibing on on-trend thong sandals or slingback heels for a retro vibe. Look out for neutrals that complement any spring outfit, pastels for a sweet touch in trending colors such butter yellow and pale pink, or bold colors and metallics for a party look.

Our eyes were glued to HBO's \"The White Lotus\" throughout Season 3 and the much-anticipated finale didn't disappoint.

    "description": "Ever since Beyoncé's critically acclaimed - and now, Grammy award-winning - \"Cowboy Carter\" album debuted, social media has been abuzz about Queen Bey's potential return to the stage. Now, we can officially prepare for the tour as the music legend announced on Feb. 1 that she is indeed taking the \"Cowboy Carter\" show on the road in 2025. Of course with any Beyoncé concert, attendees are guaranteed a couple things: an otherworldly performance filled with stadium-shaking vocals, high-energy dance routines, and an electric setlist of back-to-back hits that only one of the world's greatest entertainers could nail nightly. While Beyoncé's concert outfits are always a topic of conversation, the visuals for her \"Cowboy Carter\" album have provided a whole new category of style inspiration for BeyHive members looking to mirror the star's inimitable aesthetic. Stylistically, fans' \"Cowboy Carter\" outfits are bound to pay homage to the star's most beloved eras - think lots of glitzy, latex bodysuit looks á la \"Renaissance\" mixed with \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\"-inspired metallics and \"Cowboy Carter\"-esque country vibes. Much like her previous tours, we predict a sea of rhinestone-embellished ensembles teamed with cowgirl hats and statement pieces that play into the superstar's looks both on and off the red carpet - like over-the-knee boots, curve-defining dresses, denim jumpers, and bold jewelry. Whether you want to channel the magic of a Beyoncé concert or immerse yourself in it for the first time, we've rounded up the best concert outfit ideas that are all inspired by the star herself - and perfect to wear to any upcoming stops on her \"Cowboy Carter\" tour. From Levi's jeans and crystal Betsey Johnson boots to rhinestone-tassel cowgirl hats, these are looks you'll be excited to dance and scream-sing in all night long. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best Beyoncé-inspired outfits, with selects from Amazon, Revolve, Free People, and more.",
