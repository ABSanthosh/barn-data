    "description": "This holiday season, we’ve found the gifts that feel great to get and even better to give. Shop Well-Received, our collection of editor-approved holiday gift guides, here and shop this gift guide on Pinterest here.After a long year, your favorite people deserve the best holiday presents — you know, the type of luxury gifts that even the hard-to-shop-for people will appreciate.But luxe doesn't have to mean expensive. In fact, many of the picks on this list are under $100. Instead of price, it's about opulent-feeling (read: cozy, plush, soft) fabrics, thoughtful gifts, personalized touches, elevated versions of wardrobe essentials that your giftee would never get for themselves, and, most importantly, pampering presents that will help them indulge in some self-care to start 2025 in a more relaxed state.With that in mind, ahead, find the best luxury gifts for the most deserving people on your list. At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team. If you buy something we link to on our site, Refinery29 may earn commission. Ssense Beauty BagWhile at $215, this beauty set isn't the cheapest option in this roundup, it is the ultimate pick for the luxury beauty lover. Featuring 26 products, it includes cult favorites like Augustinus Bader Eye Cream, Dr. Barbara Sturm Super Anti-Aging Serum, and La Mer Concentrate, as well as fragrances by Byredo, Frédéric Malle, and D.S. \u0026 Durga. What's more, it all comes housed in an adorable drawstring pouch designed by Simone Rocha.Ssense Holiday 2024 Beauty Bag, $, available at SSENSEPajamasI received these pajamas as a gift earlier this year and love how light and soft they are. Plus: They come in a bunch of different colorways and at a great price point.Nordstrom Moonlight Eco Short Pajamas, $, available at NordstromJewelry BoxThis decadent heart-shaped jewelry box (which can double as a bag) is for the youngest luxe-loving giftee on your list — unless you want to borrow it, that is. If your recipient’s jewelry collection isn’t big enough yet to fill the box (or if you're looking for a gift under $50), look to Super Smalls' Disney collection which includes necklace and earring sets for the Frozen and Moana repeat viewers.Super Smalls Traveling Heart Purse and Jewelry Box, $, available at Super SmallsLeather Makeup BagA heart-shaped case for the grown-ups. Since launching last year, Cuyana's travel roll has become my go-to makeup bag for the way it keeps my beauty essentials organized. This case offers a more affordable — and adorable — alternative.Cuyana Mini Heart Case, $, available at CuyanaHoop EarringsYou can never go wrong with a good-quality hoop earring. For proof, see this mixed-metal pair from Jennifer Fisher, a brand known for its hoop styles, named after stylist Nicole Chavez who counts Kristen Bell and Rachel Bilson as clients. Another favorite: Hailey Huggies, a go-to for, yes, Hailey Bieber.Jennifer Fisher Chavez Huggies, $, available at Jennifer FisherQuality RobeColorful and cozy, this terry cloth robe comes courtesy of one of my favorite homewares brands Dusen Dusen (I’ve used their duvet set for the last few years), and is a perfect upgrade to your recipient’s years-old robe.Dusen Dusen Stripe Bathrobe, $, available at ShopbopFlannel SheetsThere is nothing more luxurious than the feeling of new sheets. These cozy flannel ones would make a perfect winter gift for the homebody who treats their bed like their temple. If you have a higher budget, check out these heathered cashmere sheets, too.Brooklinen Brushed Flannel Core Sheet Set, $, available at BrooklinenOlive Oil SetFor the at-home cook, the first delivery from the subscription set from premium olive oil brand Graza includes a Sizzle (cooking oil) and a Drizzle (an oil for salad dressings, bread, etc.) bottle, two refill cans, and a funnel. Subsequent deliveries — which you can arrange to be delivered monthly or every two or three months — will include the refill cans. You can also opt for a one-off purchase of the gift set, as well as other items like olive oil-flavored granola.Graza The Starter Kit Subscription, $, available at GrazaSweaterNo artist has exploded more into the mainstream’s consciousness in 2024 than Chappell Roan. Mark the Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess era with a sweater from Lingua Franca, the brand known for its high-quality sweaters with witty sayings. For the ultimate luxe pick, consider using Lingua Franca's custom service, which can transform your photos or hand-drawn pictures into embroidered designs. Think: cashmere crewnecks featuring your pet, your children's drawings, or an outline of your childhood home.Lingua Franca Midwest Princess Sweatshirt, $, available at Lingua FrancaQuality SocksFor those who like to receive socks in their stocking, this trendy burgundy pair is from the brand that makes some of the best. Comme Si also offers options in cashmere and wool, as well as gift box sets, if you’re looking to get even more fancy.Comme Si The Yves Sock, $, available at RevolveLuxe Body SetAnother gift I loved receiving this year was this body wash-and-lotion set, which features the same scent as my go-to perfume. It made my everyday shower routine feel like a spa treatment. I was genuinely sad when I used the shower gel to the last drop.Byredo Le Corps Mojave Ghost Body Wash and Body Lotion Gift Se, $, available at Bergdorf GoodmanCarry-all ToteSurprise your most on-the-go friend with this luxe pick from New York-based designer brand LaPointe. Crafted in a gorgeous fuchsia colorway and featuring snake-embossed detailing, it’s far from your basic tote bag.Lapointe Clear Tote, $, available at LaPointeBotanical SerumI’ve long been a fan of this magic potion botanical-infused serum for the way it nourishes and hydrates my skin during the harshest winter months, and will save up to buy it (or happily receive it as a gift) come cold-weather season. If your wallet allows, consider splurging on the Ultimate Set — in addition to the serum, it features a cleanser and an essence — which has visibly improved my parched skin and made it radiant after a few weeks of use alone.Vintner's Daughter Active Botanical Serum, $, available at RevolveQuirky HomewaresAll of the homewares from Gohar World can double as quirky decor. These fanciful mitts would make a perfect gift for a bougie host, as would the fried chicken candles, baguette bag, and a hand-adorned apron.Gohar World Yellow Host Gloves, $, available at SSENSESneakersAfter being introduced to APL’s Zipline sneakers a few years ago, they are now the only shoe I work out in. Not only is the silhouette incredibly comfortable regardless of whether you’re running or doing a HIIT workout, but it also looks sleek thanks to the knit upper and comes in many different colors (which might explain why I frequently wear them out when I am not exercising, too).APL Zipline Sneaker, $, available at RevolvePersonalized Lip BalmWhile these lip balms have gone viral, and for a good reason — they are fun to personalize, they are great at hydrating the lips, and they make for a thoughtful gift — you don’t have to fly to Paris and wait in line to get your hands on one.Officine Universelle Buly Baume des Muses Lip Balm, $, available at Officine Universelle BulyCandleDon’t have the financial means to take your jet-setting bestie to Greece? Transport them to Mykonos — or Ibiza, Marrakech, or Tulum — mentally via this candle.

Alternatively, you can get the brand’s Glow Stick Sunscreen, which can fit in any stocking and purse and be used for on-the-go applications.Supergoop! SPF Bestsellers Starter Set, $, available at SephoraStocking Stuffer MaskAnother great stocking stuffer idea, this Summer Fridays product (which also comes in a mini version) is a travel must-have for the way it quickly rehydrates the skin.

    "description": "Is there anything better than finding (read: falling in love with) a new handbag or trendy pair of sneakers, then discovering that the same product is also on sale at a fraction of its usual cost? Even after years of working as a shopping editor, I know firsthand that the \"stars aligned\" feeling of finding a dream style at the right price never really goes away - especially come Black Friday, when the season's most coveted wardrobe essentials are often marked down at their lowest prices of the year. While we're still a little over a week out from 2024's biggest shopping day, many retailers are getting in the holiday spirit early, with Black Friday sales that span the entire month of November and encompass a range of products. J.Crew is offering up to 50 percent off styles sitewide, including cozy sweaters and cardigans. Forever 21's early Black Friday sale is live, where shoppers can take 30 percent off trendy fashion staples - like faux-leather coats and evening bags. And even Amazon unveiled a bevy of new fashion markdowns on its bestselling clothing - including editor-loved bodysuits and Levi's jeans. Regardless of what you're in the market for, you can save big on it right now. Keep reading to shop our picks for the best early Black Friday fashion deals. Looking for something specific?
