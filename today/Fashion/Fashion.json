    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/reformation-cary-jeans-review-49428110",
    "description": "I first laid my eyes on the Reformation Cary jeans at the Soho store in New York City. It was the Chesapeake Studded pair, which is currently the second most popular iteration of the perfectly baggy denim. I tried them on alongside my best friend, and we both popped out of our dressing rooms (which are decidedly luxe and technologically advanced, just in case you've never been to a Ref shop before) equally delighted and shocked. We have completely different body types, but we loved the subtle slouch, give, and swingy feel of the jeans just the same. One thing led to another, and I ended up enlisting three fellow PS editors to test them via our Vetted series. Could these jeans be universally flattering? I wondered. We have completely different body types, but we loved the subtle slouch, give, and swingy feel of the jeans just the same. Alexandra Avdey, Vice President of Buying at Reformation, shared that the Cary was first launched around the time customers started shifting away from a skinny fit, and the silhouette was loosely inspired by the bestselling Mason, a pooling trouser with a similar leg opening. After the high-rise Cary was launched in the brand's signature Colorado wash, it exploded in popularity and naturally progressed to a low-rise version in September 2024. Today, the low-rise in Ondine - which one of our editors tested! - is Reformation's top-selling denim style. The low-rise in Cleary (the pair I personally own) comes in at number three. \"The Cary is designed to fit like your favorite pair of well-loved vintage jeans, fitted through the waist, and relaxed at the hips and thigh with a wide leg. Go for your true size or even size up for an ultra slouchy fit. These aren't meant to be super tailored so if you don't want a slightly oversized fit, opt for a straighter style,\" Avdey says. Like most of the eco-conscious retailer's denim, the Cary is made with regeneratively grown cotton and TENCEL™ lyocell, with the fiber makeup varying slightly across SKUs; can be recycled via RefRecycling when customers wish to retire them; and should be washed on cold and left to air dry to preserve fit and color. The Cary has a 32-inch inseam, which wasn't exactly ideal for our more petite editors; however, Reformation conveniently offers free in-store alterations to solve that problem. Keep scrolling for reviews from our editors who tested four different cuts and colors.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/valentine-day-underwear-color-meaning-49081982",
    "description": "While some call it superstition, the color of your underwear on Valentine's Day can at least usher in the type of romantic luck you hope to cultivate in the year ahead. Renowned fashion psychologist Dr. Dawnn Karen, Professor at FIT, conducted a study on the power of red, surveying 115 people who were viewed differently based on their backgrounds and where on their body (or in their outfit) they wore the shade. While Dr. Karen didn't incorporate underwear specifically, she found the effect of red to be astounding, significantly impacting how passersby interpret someone's levels of promiscuity and attractiveness. When asked about applying her findings to popular Valentine's Day lingerie colors - including red, pink, black, and white - Dr. Karen calls it a twofold street. \"Wearing your underwear as an individual can have the same effects generating self-love as it can generating outwards love towards another,\" she says. Since choosing your bra, briefs, or bodysuit is a personal decision, we asked Dr. Karen to weigh in on the meaning behind all four hues so you can determine your mindset while selecting your underthings on Feb. 14, whether you wish to send a message to yourself or to a partner. To put it simply, red is the most stimulating and seductive choice, pink is a reflection of kindness, black errs on the side of mystery, and white symbolizes purity in your relationships. But Dr. Karen breaks it down even further, unpacking the rationale behind carefully curating your intimates for the hallmark holiday. Ahead, we've applied her outlook to a shopping roundup of lingerie sets, arranged by color. Whether you're seeking a sporty boy short and bralette combination, a delicate lace teddy, a strappy garter and tights, or a whimsical, floor-length nightgown, there's sure to be a silhouette that speaks to both your intention and plans this Valentine's Day. Experts Featured in This Article Dr. Dawnn Karen is a professor at FIT and fashion psychologist.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Perhaps you’re partial to a voluminous, wide-leg look or have never said goodbye to skinny jeans of yore (hey, no judgment here). Maybe a utilitarian-looking cargo style is more your sartorial speed. Regardless of your tried-and-true fit, 2025 could be the year you expand your denim horizons, as the up-and-coming true blues trends are decidedly a breath of fresh air. According to Shopbop’s senior fashion director, Caroline Maguire, the year’s front-running denim looks will be all about reinvention — specifically, classic silhouettes with unexpected twists. “We’re seeing a blend of nostalgia and innovation,” she tells Refinery29. “While some trends nod to the past with vintage-inspired washes and silhouettes, others embrace modern, statement-making details that feel entirely fresh.” She adds that the masses are seeking denim that stands out, be it by way of bold treatments, intriguing distressing, or unique fabrics.  Meanwhile, Erin Meehan, creative director of women’s denim at Frame, says there will be an emphasis on slim, sleek, and tailored silhouettes in 2025. “There will still be the presence of a play on proportion,” she says. “Women need multiple shapes in their wardrobes now to give them unlimited styling options and levels of comfort,  from super casual to more dressed up.” Without further ado, read up on eight denim trends poised to take off in 2025, according to the pros.  Denim Trend 2025: ‘70s-Inspired Flares Transport your closet back to the ‘70s with a pair of flares inspired by the bygone era.  “Nostalgia is driving the push towards the ‘70s flare that we’re going to see across both genders in the seasons ahead,” explains AG’s in-house stylist, Ashley Catuzzi. The groovy trend’s alive and well in the Spring/Summer 2025 collections. At Chloé, creative director Chemena Kamali serves up a high-waisted look, which resembles a pair designed by Phoebe Philo in 2004. (Fashion is cyclical, after all.) Contemporary brands like AG of course, as well as Anthropologie and Torrid are now offering the dramatic look — choose your fighter. Denim Trend 2025: Barrel-Leg Jeans Picking up where 2024 left off, barrel jeans are set to make an even bigger splash in 2025. According to Pistola’s founder, Grace Na, it’s the latest hero silhouette: “The barrel leg gives emphasis to the bottom half of an outfit, allowing for the top portion to be more fitted and paired down. When you find the right fit, this silhouette can be very flattering.” Celebrities like Blake Lively and Julianne Moore have also co-signed the billowy jeans — a testament to the style’s cool flair. Denim Trend 2025: Jorts  Sun’s out, legs out: Jorts will bubble up next year, confirms AG’s Catuzzi. In Copenhagen, Scandi-cool labels like Skall Studio and Caro Editions presented their takes on look, the former giving jorts a polished touch with its clean knee-length style, and the latter offering up a pair enlivened with bright red lip motifs and a cigarette hanging out of the mouth. Diesel, too, reimagines the classic bottoms for spring, showcasing a style with captivating long fringe details that go from the upper thigh all the way down to the calf. As for styling your jorts, Catuzzi is keen on strappy sandals, mules, or knee-high boots — go with what makes the most sense for the forecast.  Denim Trend 2025: Distressed Jeans “Distressed denim is making a major comeback, with shoppers drawn to its effortless, lived-in look,” says Maguire. “From subtle abrasions to bold, shredded finishes, this trend appeals to those seeking a relaxed yet edgy aesthetic.” The fashion director also notes that the edgy look is a surefire way to add texture and personality to any outfit. On the runways, designers like MM6 Maison Margiela and Diesel have made a compelling case for the early aughts-inspired denim silhouette. Denim Trend 2025: Bootcut Jeans Ready or not, low-rise bootcut jeans are predicated to emerge in 2025 — just ask Still Here’s founder Sonia Mosseri. “This has been a trend I’ve seen slowly brewing,” the expert notes. Designers, including Mosseri, are breathing new life into the Y2K-inspired look by way of cropped silhouettes, intriguing stitching, and more fresh details. Meehan is on the same page, noting how modern bootcuts with a more gradual, smooth transition from the knee to the leg opening are on course to reign. So, no, you won’t be mistaken for The O.C.’s Marissa Cooper. Denim Trend 2025: Baggy Cargo Jeans “On the other end of the spectrum, super baggy cargo will be back, too,” says Mosseri, referring to the aforementioned bootcut trend. The slouchy look is also the antithesis of the skinny jeans that have been unearthed as of late. With functional pockets and a feel-good roomy fit, it’s no wonder style mavens like Katie Holmes have welcomed the fit with open arms. Denim Trend 2025: Dark Wash Jeans Elena Bonvicini, the founder of celebrity-loved brand EB Denim, points to dark wash jeans as a look to watch out for over the next few months. “It’s coming with the minimal chic look we’re seeing right now,” she says about the up-and-coming trend.
