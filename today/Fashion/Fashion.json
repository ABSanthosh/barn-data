    "description": "Heading off on a trip and don’t know what to wear? Whether you’re venturing to the airport, the train station, or in the car, one thing’s for sure: Comfort is non-negotiable. Sure, trusty leggings and cozy sweats are MVPs, but, sometimes, you want to look a little more “effortless jet-setter” and a little less “just rolled out of bed.” Enter: travel pants. When curating our list of the best travel pants, we held them to sky-high standards: They needed to be versatile enough to wear straight off the plane and into whatever adventure awaits, comfy enough for the bizarre yoga-esque positions you’ll find yourself in while attempting to sleep on a long-haul flight, and stylish enough to pair seamlessly with the rest of your wardrobe (and avoid the dreaded overpacking guilt). Bonus points to pants with practical perks like wrinkle resistance, technical fabrics, and — the holy grail — pockets.Meet our 29 favorite travel pants below.

    "description": "Despite what some people may think, the return of sneaker heels - largely attributed to Sara Blakely, the inventor of world-renowned Spanx, and now Sneex - happened by accident. \"Our founder did not set out to create a sneaker heel. She set out to create the world's most comfortable high heel and this is where the innovation led her,\" a brand rep says. Not only are they supportive, they add noticeable bounce to my steps, which actually makes walking in high heels sort of . . . fun? Nevertheless, merely one year in, the company can report that The Tepper in Silver ($595) sold out in just 24 hours after launch and accrued an 11,000-person waitlist. One-third of the brand's customers have already invested in a second pair. And celebrities from Jane Fonda and Sofía Vergara to Reese Witherspoon and Suki Waterhouse have already been spotted wearing them. \"The Sneex customer is responding to sneaker heels because they want height and wearability,\" the Sneex rep says. \"Women want comfort, but they also want style. We don't believe they have to be mutually exclusive. This trend validates that women want shoes that combine fashion and functionality. As we head into 2025, we expect this demand to grow.\" On that note, Sneex has released two new colorways for spring - The Blake in Lavender ($545) and the The Icon in Sand ($395) - the latter being the pair I stepped into on a lovely spring day when - spoiler - I discovered the most comfortable (heeled!) walking shoes I'd ever worn. Blakely sheds light on her meticulous design process, which effectively masters equal weight distribution, a wider toe box, and a smaller gap between the bottom of the foot and the sole of the shoe. The next question was: how would I style them? Ahead, you can read my full review of Sneex, which details what it's like to walk in them and touches on their versatility within anyone's wardrobe. About Sneex It took eight years to create Sneex, which launched in August 2024 and are the product of Sara Blakely's mission to create the world's most comfortable high heel for women. The difference between Sneex and classic heels is a wider toe box; a 50/50 weight distribution between the ball and heel; and a smaller gap between the heel and toe for stability. Sneex are available in full sizes 5-11 and retail from $395-$595. They are currently offered in three different styles: The Icon, with a wide band at the upper and five colorways; The Blake, with two suede velcro straps and four colorways; and The Tepper, with a single velcro strap and three colorways. The heel is 78mm or just over three inches. Sneex have a rubber-like sole with tracking at the toe, are lined with 100 percent napa leather, and are made in Spain. You can purchase silk ankle socks or silk no-show socks on the site for lightweight options with the right grip to prevent sliding. You can finance your Sneex purchase with four interest-free installments. Sneex offers free ground shipping for orders over $50. Returns and exchanges are accepted within 14 days of receipt, with a $15 shipping fee on returns. What I Like About Sneex Sneex are without a doubt the most comfortable heels I've ever slipped my feet into, so rest assured founder Sara Blakely delivered on her mission. Not only are they supportive, they add noticeable bounce to my steps, which actually makes walking in high heels sort of . . . fun? And while I was first blanking on styling options, I found that these shoes actually work seamlessly with plenty of outfits in my wardrobe - at least on the casual end of the spectrum. They added both a sporty twist to a casual Friday look with jeans for the office and provided an unexpected touch of eccentricity to a retro-leaning weekend brunch look. What's more, I tried wearing them both with and without my own socks and experienced zero slippage, discomfort, or - the worst - blisters. What to Consider Before Buying Sneex Regrettably, Sneex only go up to a size 11. They also do not come in half sizes. However there is a helpful sizing guide on the site where the brand recommends sizing down to the next whole size if in-between sizes. That being said, I'm typically a 6.5 and tried on both the 6 and 7, and actually preferred the size 7 overall. Perhaps I need not mention that the aesthetic of these heels are more sporty-casual than fancy-elegant, so they likely wouldn't work for events such as black tie weddings, upscale dinners, and the like - unless you're a particularly adventurous dresser. In that regard, the price point is on the higher end for a casual shoe - especially compared to some similar models on the market - but I will remind you that these heels proved much more versatile than I originally thought, and the quality/comfortability really does speak for itself. Where Are Sneex Available to Shop? Sneex are available to shop on the brand's website. Similar shoe silhouettes currently on the market include the Steve Madden Model ($130), Untitlab Black Lace Up Heel Sneakers ($345), Bershka High-Heel Slingback Soccer Shoes ($70), and Jeffrey Campbell Rally Up Statement Pump ($100, originally $185).

    "description": "When it comes to shopping for that \"perfect\" swimsuit, it can seem like a daunting challenge to browse every brand and site across the internet. But thankfully, we've done the hard work for you and have rounded up a few of our favorites ahead. Firstly, you'll want to think about your personal swimsuit requirements. While you want something that's flattering, stylish, and comfortable (we love a one-piece for this reason), you also want one that will make you feel your very best. Most of the time, that comes down to fit, and not all suits are made the same. To help you find a style that you'll be excited to pack for your next vacation, or any time you find yourself relaxing by the water, we enlisted Kalani Miller, swimwear expert and cofounder of Mikoh, for expert recommendations on the year's biggest swimwear trends, along with what shoppers should consider when scoping out the best swimsuit for their body type.

A romantic getaway? Or a family vacay with your in-laws? From there, I let it guide what styles and coverage I gravitate to,\" she explains. As far as finding the best swimsuit for your body type or frame, Miller believes that confidence is key and recommends that shoppers experiment with as many different types of silhouettes and structures as possible. \"Make sure to try on lots of different cuts - skimpy, full-coverage, high-waisted. You never know what will look best until you give it a go, and you may be surprised to find a new silhouette can quickly become your favorite,\" she says. What Types of Swimsuits Are Trending For 2025? If you're looking to find a more seasonally relevant style that'll tap into the year's biggest swimwear trends, Miller also notes that there are plenty of fun options to play around with this year. \"Earthy neutrals, pops of blue, and poppy orange prints are here to stay. This season, we're seeing silhouettes with sleeves and multi-use pieces,\" she explains.
