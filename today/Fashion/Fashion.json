    "description": "Artistic director collects award at Paris fashion week while rumour mill suggests Gucci, Burberry or Margiela moveFriday afternoon in Paris was a big one for the British designer Kim Jones. The artistic director not only presented his latest menswear collection for Dior, he also collected the prestigious Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur, a rarity for someone from outside France. In a fashion moment par excellence, the award was presented to him by Anna Wintour, becoming a knight in the process.Jones has been at Dior for six years, designing the brand’s menswear collections. During that time, he has explored the brand’s rich archive and also personal interests, including TS Eliot’s The Waste Land and Vanessa Bell’s house Charleston in east Sussex. This show was no different. It took Christian Dior’s mid-50s Ligne H collection as its jump-off, but made Casanova – the 18th-century Italian author known for his multiple relationships with women – its muse.

Anyway, I do now and I am obsessed. And you will be, too. So listen up.The rule of thirds is a simple trick that makes you look better, by tweaking your proportions. It is failsafe, it is free, it works on everybody. If you are average height, it makes you look taller. I always wanted to be taller. In fact, in my heart, I believe that I am 5ft 10, like Cindy Crawford, although on the outside I am only 5ft 5½. I’ve never got to the bottom of this mystifying mix-up, but the rule of thirds is a more effective solution than high heels. And it doesn’t just make you look taller, it makes you look better. If you are already tall it makes you look leggier, and whatever height you are it enhances your silhouette, giving you a more supple, fluid line. Continue reading...",

The much-anticipated third season of HBO’s The White Lotus — starring Parker Posey, Walton Goggins, and more — premieres on February 16. Ahead of the launch, several fashion brands are releasing collaborations inspired by the fictional resort which is set in Thailand this season. This week, Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch joined the list with a loungey, resort-inspired capsule.  The limited-edition unisex collection features graphic crewnecks, relaxed T-shirts, textured short-sleeve button-ups, and a baseball cap. While some styles feature a cheeky “do not disturb” plea, others nod to the show’s newest locale. “Our customers love to travel and live for the luxury of a long weekend,” Abercrombie chief marketing officer, Carey Collins Krug, said in a press statement. “We loved the idea of combining our customer’s favorite styles with graphics inspired by the iconic and beachside luxury of The White Lotus.”  Alongside the collaboration, Abercrombie also released its new linen-cotton blend Breezy Shirts and Baggy Breezy Pull-On Pants to pair with the limited-edition styles and to round out your vacationwear. Whether you’re actually traveling to a luxe seaside getaway, or are planning to lounge luxuriously on your couch while watching the series, these styles deserve a spot in your weekender bag (or dresser drawer). All you have to do is click “add to bag” and wait for your dose of dopamine to arrive in the mail.

Spring may be months away, but that doesn’t mean we can’t start curating our warm-weather wardrobe — especially now that Free People dropped its latest campaign, which is a feminine, boho daydream come to life. This new collection offers a fresh, modern take on the retailer’s signature look, featuring lace-trimmed and floral-print tees paired with utilitarian staples like barn jackets (still a thing!) and cargo-pocketed carpenter shorts. There’s also a prep-school charm woven in via cardigans and polos, styled with loafers and knee-high socks, as well as perfectly slouchy denim and ’90s-inspired baby tees. Then, of course, there are vacation-ready pieces with an artisanal feel for those spring break escapes to somewhere sun-soaked.With standout looks from in-house labels like We The Free and free-est, Free People’s spring collection nails every vibe worth pinning to your mood board. Take a closer look at the campaign and shop the six key trends for the season ahead.

The lace-trimmed tanks and embroidered tees in so-soft fabrics are essentials for laid-back spring days. Prep Classics Prep-school polish gets a Free People twist — think cardigans and polos with more exaggerated fits and distinctive details (hello, eyelet collar), styled back to loafers and knee-high socks. It’s a nod to timeless collegiate charm, only with a fresh edge. Big, Bold Denim  The whispers of a skinny jeans resurgence won’t have us parting with baggy jeans just yet. Slouchy, oversized silhouettes still have our hearts, whether paired with baby tees or bikini tops. Utility From cargo-pocketed vests to barn jackets that add structure to breezy spring ‘fits, these staples blend practicality with low-key cool — perfect for grounding those floral-print, lace-trimmed tops. Vacation Ready These pieces are made for your next passport stamp. Featuring global-inspired prints and embroideries with an artisanal feel, these will be your spring break go-tos. Just add sun, SPF, and a woven tote. ‘90s Minimalism  Channel your inner Gwyneth or Jen with ’90s-inspired staples like baby tees and lace-trimmed slip skirts.

    "description": "When it comes to fashion, whether you're minimalist, maximalist, or something entirely in between, there's one staple item you need in your wardrobe: a leather jacket. It's truly the Swiss army knife of clothing. There are plenty of different styles to choose from, including oversize, cropped, and motorcycle - just to name a few. You can dress it up or down, and whether you're wearing it for a date or throwing it on for a quick grocery store run, there's nothing like a well-worn leather jacket that is perfectly you. However, finding a high-quality leather jacket at a price that won't break the bank is no easy feat. Luckily, we think we found a brand that checks all of our boxes and has something for everyone, no matter what style you're seeking. Allow us to introduce you to Quince. Quince is all about offering high-quality items made with premium materials at an affordable price. How do they do it? The direct-to-consumer brand uses a factory-direct model and keeps costs low by cutting out the supply-chain middlemen. They make home and travel products, but right now, our editors couldn't be more obsessed with their leather jackets. Ahead, three editors put three different styles of Quince's 100-percent leather jackets to the test. You can check us out modeling different options, read about how they worked for us, and then use our tips to help you make your own purchase - we promise you won't regret it.
