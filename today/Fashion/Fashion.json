    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/levis-501-original-cropped-jeans-review-49435747",
    "description": "Roomier denim styles have helped coax me out of my winter sweatsuit addiction, but I realized that living in barrel jeans also has its limitations. While oversize pants are a vibe, it turns out that teaming them with my other oversize closet favorites wasn't particularly flattering. I needed a pair of jeans that would look great with anything, whether it was just sneakers and a T-shirt for school pick-up or heels and a bodysuit for date night. They needed to be comfortable - obviously - and timeless enough to transcend seasonal trends. I decided to finally try an iconic denim brand and style I had somehow overlooked all of my life, the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans ($98). What I Like About the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans This pair of Levi's jeans nails the popular mom-jean aesthetic: high-rise for tummy support and absolutely no crack-baring potential; fitted in the waist and hips but loose and straight throughout the legs. They are slightly cropped (I'm 5'6\" and chose the 28 inseam length), which gives them a modern feel and shows off cute shoe details. I chose the no-stretch option in the Worn In Medium Indigo for a truly classic look. The no-stretch material helps them to keep their shape, even when I'm kneeling and running around with my kids and dog throughout the day. The color is that perfect medium wash - the kind you instantly envision when you think of a classic pair of jeans. They're dark enough that they can be dressed up easily but also look right at home with warm-weather blouses and casual T-shirts. Did I mention that they also make your butt look good? Well, they do. What's Worth Noting About the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans If you're used to stretchy jeans, the no-stretch transition might take a beat to get used to. After being a stretchy-jean person for years, I've recently converted to team no-stretch and am loving the change. The material gets softer the more you wear them and unlike stretchy jeans, they don't cling to you. It's also worth noting that these have a button fly, which is another lifestyle jump from a zipper. Initially, un-buttoning and buttoning each time you use the bathroom can feel like a pain, but I got used to it and came to appreciate the security I feel with all of the buttons. Who Are the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans Best For? If you're looking for jeans that you'll reach for year after year, these are a fantastic pick. They're perfect for anyone craving a truly classic pair of denim that is versatile, flattering, and comfortable. Where Are the Levi's 501 Original Cropped Jeans Available? You can pick these jeans up at Levi's.

    "description": "With April showers approaching, it’s time for the return of the trench coat, the quintessential spring must-have. Not too heavy, not too light (dare we say, just right?), and typically made from water-repellant and wind-resistant fabrics, trenches are the outerwear of choice for transitional weather. While knee- and calf-length jackets are always a wise wardrobe investment, this season, a new crop of, well, cropped styles are trending.  Rather than a traditional, longline trench coat, cropped styles are a bit boxier and often more casual, offering a modern twist on a classic staple. From chic khaki and green options to unique silhouettes and fabrics, like cape jackets and denim iterations, there are plenty of styles to peruse.Read on to pluck out a sporty design for long walks, a lady-like style for work and al fresco dinners, or a versatile jacket that can do it all.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.
