Now Mark Zuckerberg is shifting the styling focus to his left wrist.

It joins Zuckerberg’s growing horological collection including a $1.2m rose gold timepiece from Patek Philippe and the thinnest watch ever made.But while an accessory with upwards of a six-figure price tag may be something only tech billionaires can afford, Zuckerberg is tapping in to a growing trend: the return of the mechanical wristwatch and old school digital timepiece. The trend is being fuelled by gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012), many of whom have never worn a wristwatch before, typically using their smartphone to keep track of the time.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. It’s officially a new year, which means many of us are setting new goals for fitness and joyful movement. As a body-positive plus-size woman, it has been so freeing to me to exercise for how it makes me feel — that reframe means I no longer think of workouts as penance for my fat body or a way to shrink myself, but rather self-care time that always leaves me feeling happy and energized after (kind of like adult recess.) Whatever your motivation, it always helps to have some good workout wear on hand, so I put some plus-size and size-inclusive options to the test.  Plus-Size Activewear: Livi (Sizes 10-40) This label from plus-size fashion pioneer Lane Bryant is a longtime favorite of mine, and one that holds a special place in my heart for making the first (and, for a long time, the only) sports bra that actually provided enough support for running with a very full bust. Before I found Livi sports bras, I was never able to comfortably run without painful bouncing, and usually had to resort to wearing two sports bras at once to find even a semblance of support. Its High Impact styles were a true game-changer for me, containing my chest and keeping movement to a minimum even when jumping and jogging. To this day, Livi’s High and Max Impact Support sports bras remain my go-to for any intense cardio. Livi is not just great for sports bras: The brand has a variety of workout wear and cozy athleisure, all made specifically for plus sizes. In my experience, that can make all the difference when it comes to fit and comfort, and I appreciate that its activewear comes in numerical sizes (i.e. 14/16) instead of just 1X, 2X, 3X, and so on. I find Livi items to be true to size: I wore my typical size (18/20) in the zip-up hoodie and wide-leg sweatpants, which are warm without being too heavy, so you could wear them to and at the gym with no issue. I planned on doing an outside workout in this outfit, but the winter weather was uncooperative — I did a quick weights and cardio routine inside instead, and I didn’t feel like I was overheating while I worked up a sweat (the ideal balance for these types of pieces, in my opinion).  Plus-Size Activewear: Universal Standard (00-40) With a size range from 00-40, Universal Standard is one of the most inclusive brands on the market, and that’s true for its growing athleisure line as well. I’ve been a fan since it introduced activewear with a five-piece capsule in 2018, and I can personally attest to the quality and longevity of these products: I still have (and wear) the same pair of leggings from then.  The “Next to Naked” collection is Universal Standard’s most classically athletic line, with a proprietary “sweat-wicking, antimicrobial fabric” that has the stretch and soft feel that I appreciate in activewear. This catsuit is one of its core styles in the fabric, which is both very lightweight and completely opaque. (I put it to the test to be sure, trying stretches that have rendered lesser leggings see-through.) I wear a sports bra with a firmer hold under it for full-on cardio workouts, but the built-in shelf bra seaming is sufficient for low-impact classes like yoga. I got this bodysuit in a medium (Universal Standard’s 18/20 equivalent), and I found it to be comfortable, easy to put on, and true to size. My only fit note is that it seems to be made for someone with a longer torso than me, so, if you’re on the shorter torso end as well, you might want to size down. (There’s definitely enough stretch.)  Plus-Size Activewear: Beyond Yoga (XXS-4X) Given the name, it’s somewhat ironic that Beyond Yoga has become one of my go-tos for… yoga. It just works so well for the needs of a regular practice: The super-soft Spacedye fabric feels like a comforting hug and, unlike most ultra-soft fabrics, it does not pill with wear. (I’ve had a pair of Beyond Yoga bike shorts in the fabric for almost five years now, and they still look and feel new.)  This bra top was surprisingly supportive. As someone with a very full bust, I don’t expect much from anything less than a full coverage, maximum support sports bra. I put this one to the test at a recent yoga class, and everything stayed in place, even with lots of bending and inverted asanas. I loved the look of the matching set, and I wore a thin long-sleeve top from the brand as well because the studio was a little chilly when I arrived. The space warmed up throughout the class, and I got to see the sweat-wicking functionality of this shirt in action by the end. It has since become a go-to top layer for me for yoga — perfect for a little light coverage, not too heavy or clingy.  One important fit note: Do not size up in Beyond Yoga’s leggings if you want to use them for workouts beyond yoga. I got a 2X, and was surprised to find that they were falling at the waist once I started moving at a pace faster than a power walk. This wasn’t an issue for my older pair of Beyond Yoga bike shorts in the same fabric, so I initially wondered if there had been a change in the construction; when I went back and checked the tag of my older pieces, I realized I had sized up this time. After wear-testing another new pair of these same leggings in my prior size (1X), the issue was resolved, and the waistband stayed in place, even during cardio. So, although I usually recommend erring on the side of sizing up, that’s not the move for Beyond Yoga’s Spacedye products — and, in the right size, these leggings will likely become a go-to for you, too.  Plus-Size Activewear: Knix (XS-4XL) When I was researching activewear brands to test out, I was surprised to see Knix pop up as an option. I’d only known them as a period panty company, and I had no idea that it offered anything beyond that, let alone a full line of workout wear. With sizes up to 4XL and unique products like leakproof leggings, it piqued my interest — and, apparently, Mother Nature agreed, as I started my period early on the day I was already planning on wearing Knix to the gym. Per the size chart, I got the XXL and XXXL in Knix’s leakproof leggings. The XXXL fit perfectly on me in everything I tried, whereas the XXL was snug and a bit hard to get on the first time, though still wearable. I’d say go by the sizing chart when ordering for the best fit and comfort. The Pursuit Leakproof Training Short stayed in place comfortably through a cardio workout, both on the waist and the thigh  — no slipping down or riding up. Knowing that the bottom layer of the short had a built-in leakproof panel also gave me the confidence to wear light gray on a heavy flow day (something I wouldn’t even consider without that feature). The coordinating lightweight jacket was perfect, in my opinion: breathable and not at all clingy. I’ll be wearing this set for outdoor workouts when it gets warmer outside, as it would be ideal for running.  The Zip Front sports bra was not easy to get on the first time — I needed my husband’s help to wrangle everything in place! — but after an initial adjustment of the straps and a tiny bit of stretching, it wasn’t a problem. It provided good coverage and solid support for a cycling workout, but there was a bit too much movement for my comfort on the treadmill. I’d recommend this for anything lower impact than running if you’re on the larger end of cup size.  Plus-Size Activewear: PopFlex (XXS-3X) I like everything I’ve tried from this brand, from its Taylor Swift-approved ballet skort to its thoughtfully designed hoodies, but I LOVE PopFlex’s pet hair-resistant cargo leggings. They’re completely opaque, stay put on the waist even through intense cardio, and — crucially for all pet owners — repel pet fur.  We have a light-color dog and a dark-furred tabby cat in our little NYC apartment, and they both shed a lot, so I’m constantly finding fur on my workout wear (even fresh from the dryer). It always seems especially prominent on black leggings, so these ones from PopFlex feel like an actual godsend. I rave about them whenever I get a chance, because I know my fellow pet parents understand just how incredible this feature is. P.S. If you’re just discovering this brand but it’s outside of your current budget, Cassey Ho just launched a Blogilates collab with Target with affordable takes on a lot of PopFlex’s signature styles in a good size range (XS-3X). There’s even a dupe for the famous ballet skort! Plus-Size Activewear: Glowmode (XS-4XL) If you’re looking for an affordable option that doesn’t feel cheap, online fast-fashion brand Glowmode is worth a look. For the price point, I didn’t know what to expect, but I was impressed with the feel and functionality of its fabrics. Its trademarked FeatherFit material is meant to be breathable and “buttery soft,” and it delivered.  I wore this set to a yoga class and felt comfortable and supported. The cropped sports bra tank stayed in place through the different poses, with only a bit of adjusting required after certain bendy asanas — impressive for a low-impact tank style on a full bust, in my experience. I also appreciated the thoughtful details in the design of the leggings, like the phone-sized hidden inner pocket and the contoured back waistband and seaming (it made my butt look great!). My only criticism is that the color on the top and bottom wasn’t an exact match — it wasn’t super noticeable from afar, but if you want a perfect pair, it’s something to be aware of.  One last sizing note: Though the brand’s pieces go up to a 4XL, it is supposedly the equivalent of a size 20 (not the standard 26/28). That said, as a size 20, I wore a 3XL in this set. So, while the sizing runs smaller than the standard, it’s not quite as small as listed! Based on what I tried, I’d estimate the 4XL could comfortably work for sizes up to 24.  Honorable Plus-Size Activewear Mentions Adanola (XXS-XXXL): This label has a luxe aesthetic and sizes up to XXXL, so I was excited to try it out. I enjoyed the foldover yoga pants, which fit comfortably on me in the XXXL with plenty of stretch. But some styles, like this cute short-sleeve unitard, unfortunately, ran smaller. (While I could put it on, this jumpsuit was too tight to be comfortable.) I’d recommend this line for anyone looking for sleek “midsize” (sizes 18+) workout wear — though check out the brand’s size chart and look at the material before ordering. (The recycled polyamide-elastane blend in these yoga pants had a great amount of stretch, but the nylon blend in the unitard didn’t have as much give.)  Strawberry Western (XS-3XL): If you’re looking for something less minimalist and more alternative, this NYC label is a great option. Strawberry Western is mostly sold out of activewear tops at the moment, but the leggings and bike shorts stay put and are great quality — and, importantly, don’t look like anything else on the market! Free Label (XS-5X): If you want natural fibers and ethical practices, this inclusive Canadian label should be on your radar. I get endless compliments every time I wear my favorite Free Label sports bra and bike short set, and the bamboo blend is very breathable (especially important for hot NYC summers).  Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/how-to-style-mocha-mousse-color-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If we had to predict what this year has in store, Mocha Mousse gives us the feeling that 2025 will be a wild card. Many of us were shocked when, back in December, Pantone crowned this soft neutral as its Color of the Year. The unexpected shade sits between a chocolate brown and a foamy beige — a far cry from its predecessors, the pastel Peach Fuzz and the bold Viva Magenta. Critics will say it’s less exciting. But one thing Mocha Mousse is not is random.  Pantone chooses its annual hue based on cultural resonance, global moods, and trends across creative industries like fashion, decor and design. The anointed color is meant to reflect the world we’re living in — and right now, between the climate crisis and a recession, Mocha Mousse is the warm hug or comforting pint of ice cream that we all need. It’s also a signal that quiet luxury’s muted tones and minimalist styles in fashion still resonate, over a year later. With that in mind, Mocha Mousse is the perfect opportunity to pare back your wardrobe for a restart — a personal style cleanser of sorts. Whether you’re partial to a dark chestnut, rich taupe or fresh espresso, Mocha Mousse’s milky presence is a fresh take — the cool younger sibling, perhaps — on your favorite chocolate brown hue. Plus, it’s a shoo-in for winter fashion, from easily layerable knits to creamy coats that integrate seamlessly with your existing wardrobe.  In order to test its wearability, I styled Mocha Mousse-colored clothes for a week. Keep reading for tips on styling the Color of the Year, as well as some editor-picked pieces you can shop now. How To Style Mocha Mousse: A Midi Dress \u0026 Cardigan Take your neutrals out on the town with a midi dress you can layer with a cozy cardigan and weather-appropriate boots. This ultra light cashmere cardigan gives off refined rather than frumpy vibes thanks to its understated shape and warm oatmeal tone. (My Nobody’s Child cardigan is sold out, but we’ve included some alternatives below.)  How To Style Mocha Mousse: A Wool Coat A Mocha Mousse coat will stand out among the season’s usual sea of black outerwear without making too much of a statement. Bonus: Many brands offer toppers in this delectable color, from tailored wool styles (this one is almost sold out!) to leather jackets and winter puffers. Let this hue be the star of the show, or the counterpart to a bigger statement underneath.   How To Style Mocha Mousse: A Blazer Louder for the people in the back: Mocha Mousse is a neutral. A blazer (or a full suit) can feel like a blanket or a cup of tea, especially during the cold winter months, thanks to the rich hue. This blazer is a perfect staple and pairs well with everything from a black maxi skirt to blue jeans. How To Style Mocha Mousse: Monochrome Why not bring the drama with a monochromatic ‘fit? Wearing Mocha Mousse from head to toe —  whether you’re styling an oversized sweater with trousers for the office, or a dress with matching shoes for a night out — is like dipping yourself in a vat of caramel. It allows you to be as bold as you want to be, which makes the look well suited to minimalists and maximalists alike. Like what you see?

    "description": "If you're like me and you couldn't find a pair of Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs in your preferred size and color a couple of seasons ago, it may have been for the best. Turns out, the shearling-lined fall- and winter-friendly iteration of the brand's popular clog is softer, cozier, and more comfortable than the Boston Soft Footbed Clogs. I pounced on buying Birkenstock's Boston Genuine Shearling Lined Clogs ($175) as soon as they appeared in Nordstrom's new arrivals section, and I've been wearing them nonstop. What I Love About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs They feel like a fuzzy slipper but have the ergonomic design and comfortable yet sturdy footbed that Birkenstock's Boston clogs are known for. I was initially worried that the shearling lining might make my feet sweat, but unlike synthetic versions, genuine shearling is naturally temperature-regulating. On warmer days or when I quickly need to slip into something, I've worn them barefoot, but they also manage to look cool with a quarter sock on chillier days. When our editor reviewed the version without shearling, she was expecting them to be comfortable but was surprised by how versatile they are as well. I've been thrilled to discover the same thing as I've thrown these shearling-lined mules on with everything from leggings and sweats to barrel jeans and even a jumpsuit. As far as convenience goes, I love that I can put them on hands-free. As a mom of two little ones and a brand-new puppy, they've become my go-to for 6 a.m. potty breaks when I'm half-asleep and my hands are occupied with a leash, treats, and a squirming pup. What's Worth Noting About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs At $175, they're an investment and pricier than Birkenstock's Boston Soft Footbed Clogs, but the shearling is a worthy upgrade. I opted for the taupe color which has a tonal aesthetic with the matching suede and shearling. I like that the color isn't too light or dark, but I was concerned about getting them stained with dirt and water. Amazingly enough, they still look practically new despite how much I've been wearing them. I've gotten clumps of dirt on them but have been able to easily brush the dirt off. I've even gotten caught in an unexpected sprinkle and the raindrops didn't stain the suede either. Who Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Best For? Whether you want a pair of shoes that are comfortable and easy or are more concerned with crafting an effortless aesthetic, you'll be equally pleased. If you have sheepskins draped over furniture or a favorite pair of shearling-lined boots, these versatile shoes are a no-brainer. Additional Details About Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs If you're between sizes, order the next size up. These are built on a unisex shoe construction, but the sizes reflect women's shoe sizes. They have an adjustable strap with a buckle closure. They have a contoured footbed with arch support. Where Are Birkenstock's Shearling-Lined Clogs Available? You can buy these clogs at Nordstrom, Amazon, and Birkenstock. Rating: Angela Elias (she/her) is a contributing editor for PS Shopping.
