    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/and-just-like-that-outfits-fashion-49192011",
    "description": "Plenty of \"And Just Like That\" spoilers are lurking below, FYI. You can't tell the story of \"Sex and the City\" and its revival/sequel \"And Just Like That\" without spending an inordinate amount of time discussing the fashion. Over the course of the original show's six seasons, Carrie Bradshaw became a universal style icon. She inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. Styled by the inimitable Patricia Field, Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) delighted in getting dressed. Her style was quirky, vibrant, romantic: she'd stop by McDonald's in a pink Oscar de la Renta frock or go wedding-dress shopping with a belt tied around her bare stomach. Throughout the series, as well as in the three \"Sex and the City\" movies that followed, Field and Parker set trends, launched design careers into the stratosphere, and created an endless stream of iconic looks. Now, the \"And Just Like That\" outfits aim to carry on that legacy. Image Source: HBO [Carrie Bradshaw] inspired generations of women to waltz around New York City in tulle dresses, all while carefully dodging potholes in their Manolo Blahnik pumps. With costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago on board, Carrie still enjoys fashion on \"And Just Like That,\" but the writers also use it as a mechanism to communicate her state of mind. When she wore a tulle skirt and black headpiece to Big's funeral in season one, it was to make her late husband proud. Later, as she started to date and feel like herself again, she was back in a Norma Kamali ruched blue dress that fit impeccably well; it's so quintessentially her that fans dubbed it the \"Carrie dress.\" Likewise, in season three, she steps out in a quirky Strawberry Shortcake-style hat that has the internet divided, much like that time she almost got married with a bird on her head. The message? Bradshaw is officially back and in her element (we hope). Image Source: HBO Fashion is obviously sacred to Bradshaw, but other characters have memorable style moments as well. Miranda Hobbes's colorful halter dress and Seema Patel's leopard look from season one could've been right at home in the original series. In season two, the characters dressed up to attend the fictitious, \"Veiled Beauty\"-themed Met Gala: Lisa Todd Wexley in a breathtaking red Valentino gown and Charlotte York Goldenblatt in a bold corset top and skirt. At times, their looks carry a greater significance. Think of Rock Goldenblatt's unconventional styling of their Oscar de la Renta dress as they prepared to share their gender identity with their parents in season one. Or Miranda's uncharacteristically sexy halter jumpsuit as she stepped outside a stale marriage to flirt with Che Diaz at the bar. In season three, Patel's impossibly chic white fringe dress proved she had no business scouting movie locations all day while Todd Wexley's quirky, oversize ball necklace is a nod to her penchant for thinking outside-the-box, a trait that clashes with her unimaginative documentary producers. Ahead, check out the best \"And Just Like That\" outfits so far - and shop the best fashion from season three.",

    "description": "Rihanna's groundbreaking pregnancy style is second to none. As if her first two pregnancy announcements weren't monumental enough, the Fenty empress debuted her third pregnancy at the 2025 Met Gala (before gracing the carpet), wearing a gray Miu Miu skirt set fresh off the runway. While making history as the first Barbadian entertainer, billionaire, and expectant mom to rock the Super Bowl halftime stage in 2023, she wore a red Loewe utility jumpsuit and vinyl bra plate - making for one of her most iconic fashion moments to date. \"I'm not gonna buy maternity pants, jeans, dresses, or [do] whatever society told me to do before.\" Having worked with stylist Jahleel Weaver, she's produced many trendsetting street looks and jaw-dropping red carpet moments, including that vintage pink Chanel puffer coat and low-rise jeans combo that broke the internet as she unveiled her first baby bump with partner A$AP Rocky. The entrepreneur also established an unconventional pregnancy wardrobe that changed the narrative of what to wear while expecting. \"It's been me personally saying, I'm not going to buy maternity clothes. I'm not gonna buy maternity pants, jeans, dresses, or [do] whatever society told me to do before,\" she told Bustle. \"So, I challenged myself to push it further and really just have fun with [maternity style]. Because there's nothing more fun than a challenge for me.\" At this point, Rihanna has more than succeeded at rewriting dress codes, trading in loose-fitting maxi dresses and leggings for bump-baring silhouettes like crop tops, leather dresses, and shredded sets, inspiring stars such as Shay Mitchell to do the same. Ahead, shop Rihanna's maternity fashion essentials then keep scrolling to bask in her all-time, unfailing pregnancy style - starting with her iconic pregnancy announcement at the Met Gala.",
