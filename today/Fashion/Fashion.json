If Crocs were the “ugly” shoe of 2023, and Clarks Wallabees were the comeback queen of 2024, then boat shoes are the unexpected shoe trend of 2025 — and they’re already reeling us in. The nautical-meets-collegiate shoe was created in 1935 (yep, 90 years ago!) by Paul Sperry after he slipped off his boat but noticed his dog, whose paws were naturally non-slip, didn’t. Inspired, Sperry cut patterned grooves into blank rubber shoe soles, developing the world’s first non-slip boat shoe, according to the brand. Typically defined by grippy rubber soles, sturdy leather laces, water-repellant and stain-proof materials (apart from the trendy suede styles), and a sleek silhouette reminiscent of a loafer-moccasin-driver hybrid, boat shoes are functional but also surprisingly… fashionable?A few years later, they became the official shoe of the U.S. Navy. Then when President John F. Kennedy casually sported them in the 1960s, they cemented their place as a preppy wardrobe staple. In 1980, The Official Preppy Handbook, written by Lisa Birnbach, even featured Sperry Top-Siders on the cover, calling them a preppy essential. Since then, brands like G.H. Bass, Sebago, and Tod’s have also become synonymous with the style.  While they may have stepped out of the spotlight for a while, boat shoes are officially back and approved by the fashion set. During the spring/summer 2024 season, Miu Miu showcased models sporting preppy-inspired outfits, many complete with worn-in, brown leather boat shoes. (And at the brand’s recent fall/winter 2025 show, actor Emma Corrin was spotted wearing a pair.) Meanwhile, Bally’s spring/summer 2024 collection incorporated boat shoes into an edgier look, styling them with a leather blazer and hot pants. Fast forward to the spring/summer 2025 shows, and even more designers embraced the trend — from Loewe and Monse to Collina Strada, where Refinery29 Powerhouse Ella Emhoff rocked the look from the front row. Now that we’re actually in spring 2025, boat shoe mania is in full force. From tried-and-true footwear brands like Rothy’s and Stuart Weitzman to elevated labels like Massimo Dutti, Vince, and Sandro.And with The White Lotus’ Ratliff family giving Southern preppy style a pop culture boost and the TikTok-viral fisherman aesthetic making nautical stripes and netted bags mainstream, it’s officially boat shoes’ time to shine again. Whether you’re into leather lug-soles or thinner suede options, there’s a pair for everyone looking to dip their toes into this formerly “ugly” shoe trend. Like what you see?

    "description": "When it comes to shopping for that \"perfect\" swimsuit, it can seem like a daunting challenge to browse every brand and site across the internet. But thankfully, we've done the hard work for you and have rounded up a few of our favorites ahead. Firstly, you'll want to think about your personal swimsuit requirements. While you want something that's flattering, stylish, and comfortable (we love a one-piece for this reason), you also want one that will make you feel your very best. Most of the time, that comes down to fit, and not all suits are made the same. To help you find a style that you'll be excited to pack for your next vacation, or any time you find yourself relaxing by the water, we enlisted Kalani Miller, swimwear expert and cofounder of Mikoh, for expert recommendations on the year's biggest swimwear trends, along with what shoppers should consider when scoping out the best swimsuit for their body type. What to Consider When Shopping Out the Best Swimsuit For Your Body Type For Miller, finding the perfect swimsuit starts with honing in on the exact occasion she's shopping for. \"When I'm shopping for a new suit, I always like to think of where I am wearing it the most - is it a girls' trip? A romantic getaway? Or a family vacay with your in-laws? From there, I let it guide what styles and coverage I gravitate to,\" she explains. As far as finding the best swimsuit for your body type or frame, Miller believes that confidence is key and recommends that shoppers experiment with as many different types of silhouettes and structures as possible. \"Make sure to try on lots of different cuts - skimpy, full-coverage, high-waisted. You never know what will look best until you give it a go, and you may be surprised to find a new silhouette can quickly become your favorite,\" she says. What Types of Swimsuits Are Trending For 2025? If you're looking to find a more seasonally relevant style that'll tap into the year's biggest swimwear trends, Miller also notes that there are plenty of fun options to play around with this year. \"Earthy neutrals, pops of blue, and poppy orange prints are here to stay. This season, we're seeing silhouettes with sleeves and multi-use pieces,\" she explains. With all of Miller's expert recommendations in mind, we curated a guide to the perfect swimsuits for every type of frame and build, including the best swimsuits for curvy women, the best one-piece bathing suits, and a variety of other choices that range from sultry bikinis to fun monokinis.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists but, naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers. If your workplace is more casual and you drive, you can probably get away with wearing a pair of heels to spice things up. And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown.
