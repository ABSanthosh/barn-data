The communications minister said the government has “been working diligently in this space” but action “should have been taken on this some 10 years ago”.We’re working very closely with the states and territories because the vast majority of recommendations in our late colleague Peta Murphy’s report go to issues that go across commonwealth and state jurisdictions.We’re also working very closely to ensure that there are no unintended consequences here and it’s actually effective.We have every anticipation that we will be able to respond comprehensively this year and that’s what we’re working towards as a government.We will be taking advice on the appropriate form in which that can be done.
