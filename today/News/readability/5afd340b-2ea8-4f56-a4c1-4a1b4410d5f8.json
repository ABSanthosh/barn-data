  "text": "BRUSSELS — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday moderated a key piece of his dramatic remarks here at NATO headquarters a day earlier, leaving open a possibility of Ukraine joining the military alliance after previously saying the United States does not believe membership for Kyiv is a “realistic outcome” in any peace deal with Russia.Hegseth’s clarification appeared designed to assuage the backlash, both in Europe and in Washington, ignited by his remarks ahead of President Donald Trump’s announcement that his administration had jump-started negotiations to end the three-year war. Yet a short time later on Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he didn’t see any way “that a country in Russia’s position” could allow Ukraine to join NATO.“I don’t see that happening,” the president said.The remarks from the president and his defense secretary added to sense of the anxiety arising from Trump’s announcement on Wednesday that he’d spoken separately to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with the aim of securing a deal to end the fighting. Trump indicated his plans would be part of discussions held next week in Saudi Arabia. “Not with myself or with President Putin, but with top officials,” he said without elaboration.Hegseth, in his remarks to media on Thursday, said he wanted to make clear that “these negotiations are led by President Trump. Everything is on the table in his conversations with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky. What he decides to allow or not allow is at the purview of the leader of the free world — of President Trump.”Hegseth added that he is “not going to stand at this podium and declare what President Trump will do or won’t do, what will be in or what will be out, what concessions will be made or what concessions are not made.” He cast his previous assessment ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine as “what’s likely” and a recognition of “hard-power realities on the ground.”“I just reject on its face the premise that somehow President Trump isn’t dealing with a full set of cards when he’s the one that can determine ultimately what cards he holds,” Hegseth added.Trump, whose remarks came in the Oval Office as he signed a new executive order on tariffs, hewed to Putin’s insistence, long predating the Ukraine war, that Kyiv’s membership in NATO would be a direct national security threat to Russia. Trump then said, falsely, that the Ukraine war started because his predecessor, President Joe Biden went out and said that [Ukraine] could join NATO.”That assertion repeated comments Trump made to reporters last month, when he said that prior to the war, Ukraine and Russia “had a deal and then Biden broke it … Biden said no, you have to be able to join NATO.”During a campaign rally two years ago, Trump offered a different version of Biden’s culpability, saying that Putin decided to invade Ukraine because of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Putin “saw this incredible weakness and that’s when he decided to invade Ukraine,” Trump said.NATO first said in 2008 that Ukraine would someday be a member, an alliance-wide position that was reaffirmed after the 2014 Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine and Crimea. In 2018, Ukraine’s Parliament approved amendments to its constitution making NATO and the European Union the country’s principal foreign policy goal.In December 2021, Russia demanded that NATO end all military activity in eastern European NATO member states and ban Ukraine forever from joining the alliance. NATO’s refusal to accept that demand were among the reasons Putin cited for the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.One month later, at a meeting in Brussels, alliance heads of government issued a statement reaffirming “our commitment to NATO’s Open Door Policy,” which allows other countries to join by unanimous consent.But NATO, and Biden, continued to slow-roll actions that would have led to Ukrainian membership, saying that it could only be discussed after the war ended and that Ukraine would have to address long-standing concerns about its governance and corruption. NATO was far from unanimous on inviting Ukraine to join.As the war dragged on, the alliance agreed at its July 2023 summit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, to short-circuit Ukraine’s steps to membership. It said that individual countries would establish bilateral security pacts with Kyiv, a move that would avoid NATO’s Article 5 mutual defense pact.Biden said that Ukraine was not yet ready to join and that “I don’t think there is unanimity in NATO … in the middle of the war.”At the next summit, last July in Washington, members pledged new steps to assist Ukraine’s defenses with additional weaponry. They declared Ukraine on an “irreversible” path to membership in both NATO and the E.U., but took no new steps to get it there.In his Thursday comments, Trump added another rationale for the Russian invasion, saying it was “very possible” that it resulted from Russia’s suspension from the Group of Eight highly industrialized countries after it invaded Crimea in 2014. “I’d love to have them back,” Trump said. “I think it was a mistake.” he said.In January 2017, Moscow announced it was permanently withdrawing from the group.Hegseth’s remarks in Brussels capped a meeting of NATO defense ministers, who spent the day contemplating a response to efforts by Trump to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table. Hegseth’s declaration on Wednesday was widely perceived as weakening Ukraine’s position, even though Ukraine joining the alliance was highly unlikely any time soon, with each NATO member capable of torpedoing the idea.NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, asked if Hegseth’s comments Wednesday were harmful, said there were clearly “big announcements” made by U.S. officials, but he nonetheless sought to present a unified front.“We are an alliance of democracies,” he said. “We need to debate. And also, I see a clear convergence, as I said, that we want peace, that the peace has to be enduring, that we have to make sure that Ukraine is in the best possible position, and for the Europeans to step up in defense spending and collectively, to step up the defense industrial production. So here, there is a clear convergence.”Hegseth repeated his calls Thursday for NATO to do more for Europe’s collective security, pressing for increased defense spending by allies.“We can talk all we want about values. Values are important,” Hegseth said. “But you can’t shoot values, you can’t shoot flags, and you can’t shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power. As much as we may not want to like the world we live in, in some cases, there’s nothing like hard power.”He complimented the alliance as “great” and the “most successful defense alliance in history,” but said changes are necessary to make “NATO great again,” borrowing from Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign motto. He cited past comments from President Dwight D. Eisenhower to emphasize his point, noting that the retired general was one of the alliance’s biggest backers but eventually grew concerned about European nations not doing enough to protect themselves and others.“By the end of Eisenhower’s presidency, even he was concerned that Europe was not shouldering enough of its own defense — merely making, in Eisenhower’s words, quote, ‘a sucker out of Uncle Sam,’” Hegseth said. “Well, like President Eisenhower, this administration believes in alliances, deeply believes in alliances. But make no mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into ‘Uncle Sucker.’”DeYoung reported from Washington.
