  "text": "Elon Musk says he is launching a new political party, weeks after a dramatic falling out with US President Donald Trump.The billionaire announced on his social media platform X that he had set up the America Party and billed it as a challenge to the Republican and Democratic two-party system.However, it is unclear whether the party has been formally registered with US election authorities, and Musk has not provided details about who will lead it or what form it will take.He first raised the prospect of launching a party during his public feud with Trump, which saw him leave his role in the administration and engage in a vicious public spat with his former ally.During that row, Musk posted a poll on X asking users if there should be a new political party in the US.Referencing that poll in his post on Saturday, Musk wrote: \"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste \u0026 graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"As of Saturday, the Federal Electoral Commission had not published documents indicating the party had been formally registered. Musk was a key Trump advocate during the 2024 election and spent $250m (£187m) to help him regain office.After the election, he was appointed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which was tasked with identifying swingeing cuts in the federal budget.His fallout with Trump began when he left the administration in May and publicly criticised Trump's tax and spending plans. The legislation - which Trump has called his \"big, beautiful bill\" - was narrowly passed by Congress and signed into law by the president this week. The massive law includes huge spending commitments and tax cuts, and is estimated to add more than $3tn to the US deficit over the next decade.",
