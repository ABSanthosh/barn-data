They are labeled with establishment numbers 51205 or P-51205. The USDA points out that these products may also be on store shelves or in home refrigerators or freezers.The recall was reported under a Class I certification, the highest USDA recall certification, which means “there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.\"According to the USDA, there have so far been no confirmed reports of negative reactions from people who have eaten any of these products.What To Do If You Have the Recalled Products at HomeThe recall includes 75 chicken and meat products including breasts, strips, patties, and diced chicken.
