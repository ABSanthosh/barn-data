  "text": "20-year-old OnlyFans content creator and influencer Sophie Rain celebrated Thanksgiving by showing off how much money she's made in the past year.In a tweet shared on Thursday, Nov. 28, Rain shared a screenshot of her earnings from OnlyFans for 2024. While the screenshot is cropped, it shows gross earnings of $43,477,695.01. \"Thankful for one year on here,\" she wrote alongside the screenshot, which has since gone viral with over 73,000 likes and over 5,000 replies.Rain runs an OnlyFans page that users can subscribe to for $10 a month, although she's currently running an offer for first-time subscribers to see her content for $5. Like a lot of other creators, however, she likely earns the majority of her income from OnlyFans through premium or personalized content sold to subscribers. The figure is still hard to believe, though.She made similar claims during a recent appearance on a podcast, showing a fellow content creator that she was making as much as $4 million a month.Last month, OnlyFans model Corinna Kopf announced she would be retiring from the platform after reportedly earning $67 million in three years. She later clarified her statements and indicated that she wants to \"try and separate from it slowly,\" rather than immediately retire. Bhad Bhabie, meanwhile, claims she's made over $71 million in gross earnings in three years.Regardless of whether Rain's earnings are legitimate, or an attempt to garner viral attention, OnlyFans has proved to be a huge money maker. In September, the company announced that creator payments in 2023 hit $6.63 billion. The number of people on OnlyFans also increased from the previous year, rising 29 percent from 2022 with over 4.12 million creators on the platform.",
