Their call on Wednesday came at a moment when U.S. national security officials believe the Middle East is on a knife’s edge. Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesOct. 9, 2024For the first time in two months, President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Wednesday in a phone conversation that focused on Israel’s plans to retaliate against Iran for a missile attack.When the meeting ended, American officials said nothing about Israel’s plans, or whether Mr. Netanyahu indicated he would heed Mr. Biden’s warnings not to hit nuclear or energy sites, which the White House fears could lead to an escalating cycle of Iranian missile strikes and Israeli responses.Instead, a terse account of the conversation issued by the White House hours later said Mr. Biden “condemned unequivocally Iran’s ballistic missile attack against Israel on Oct. 1,” but made no reference to discussions on how to respond — which was the purpose of the call.Looming over the conversation was the reality that, for all the declarations of unified purpose, the past few months have been burdened by the weight of the worst relationship between the United States and Israel in years.The conversation on a secure line, which also included Vice President Kamala Harris, began shortly after 10:30 a.m., the Israeli news media reported.The call came at a moment when U.S. national security officials believe the Middle East is on a knife’s edge. They have told Mr. Biden that after the missile attack by Iran on Oct. 1, which did relatively little damage in Israel, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not looking to enter a broader war.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
