Analysts say those words could prove hollow, but the deal still may not last beyond early March.A shelter amid the rubble in Jabaliya, northern Gaza, on Monday.Credit...Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesFeb. 11, 2025Updated 4:51 p.m. ETThe future of the cease-fire in Gaza, along with the territory’s long-term fate, hung in the balance on Tuesday as President Trump prepared to meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan amid a public spat between the American leader and Hamas.Mr. Trump envisions taking over Gaza and expelling Palestinians to nearby countries, including Jordan. He has threatened to end American financial support for Jordan if the king refuses to accept that vision.The dispute is one of several that imperil the fragile truce between Hamas and Israel. Hamas threatened to derail the agreement on Monday night, warning that it would delay the release of some hostages on Saturday if Israel did not send more aid to Gaza.In response, Mr. Trump threatened “all hell” if every hostage was not released by the weekend. Hamas later softened its position, before the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned on Tuesday night that Israel would resume fighting if hostages were not released on Saturday. He did not immediately clarify how many hostages had to be released, leaving himself with room to maneuver.While the immediate crisis is still likely to be resolved soon, analysts said, another hurdle looms in March, when the cease-fire is set to elapse unless Hamas and Israel negotiate an extension.“It’s likely that they will reach a compromise before Saturday,” said Ibrahim Dalalsha, director of the Horizon Center, a political research group in Ramallah, in the West Bank. “But this crisis is a prelude for a much bigger crisis that is coming in early March.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
