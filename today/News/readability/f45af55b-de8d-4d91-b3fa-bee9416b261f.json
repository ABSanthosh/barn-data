  "text": "The United States on Wednesday exercised its veto power against a UN Security Council resolution calling for an \"immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\" between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, alongside unrestricted humanitarian aid access. The remaining 14 council members supported the draft as Gaza's population faces severe humanitarian challenges.\"The United States has been clear: We would not support any measure that fails to condemn Hamas and does not call for Hamas to disarm and leave Gaza,\" acting US ambassador Dorothy Shea said, suggesting it would compromise American-led ceasefire negotiations.As Israel's primary ally and weapons provider, Washington's position remains significant. The vote occurred amidst continued Israeli operations in Gaza following a March truce termination. Gaza health officials reported 45 casualties from Israeli strikes, whilst Israel confirmed one military casualty.British UN ambassador Barbara Woodward criticised Israel's expanded military actions and aid restrictions as \"unjustifiable, disproportionate and counterproductive.\" Israel maintains its opposition to permanent ceasefire terms.Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon addressed supporting members: \"You chose appeasement and submission. You chose a road that does not lead to peace. Only to more terror.\"Hamas criticised the American veto as demonstrating \"the US administration's blind bias\" towards Israel. The resolution had also demanded immediate hostage release from Hamas.The conflict intensified after Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, resulting in 1,200 Israeli casualties and 250 hostages. Israel's response has caused over 54,000 Palestinian deaths, predominantly civilians, according to Gaza authorities.Limited UN aid resumed May 19, followed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's distribution system. Israel alleges Hamas diverts aid, which Hamas denies. The US and Israel encourage UN cooperation with GHF, which employs private American security firms.\"No one wants to see Palestinian civilians in Gaza go hungry or thirsty,\" Shea stated, noting the resolution ignored previous aid delivery shortcomings. UN organisations reject GHF collaboration, citing neutrality concerns.GHF operations paused Wednesday following Tuesday's incident, requesting enhanced Israeli military support for civilian safety. The foundation reported distributing over seven million meals since inception.UN aid chief Tom Fletcher advocated for unrestricted humanitarian access. Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar expressed frustration with civilian suffering. A similar resolution may proceed to the UN General Assembly, where passage appears likely without veto powers.Danon concluded: \"Don't waste more of your time, because no resolution, no vote, no moral failure, will stand in our way.\"",
