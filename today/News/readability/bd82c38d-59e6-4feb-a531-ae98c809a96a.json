He called Gabbard a \"proud Republican\" and expressed hope that she would bring her \"fearless spirit\" to the intelligence community.Trump, through his official campaign account, Trump War Room, shared the announcement on social media platform X:\"I am pleased to announce that former Congresswoman, Lieutenant Colonel Tulsi Gabbard, will serve as Director of National Intelligence (DNI). For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans. As a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she has broad support in both parties. She is now a proud Republican! I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our constitutional rights and securing peace through strength. Tulsi will make us all proud!\"Who is Tulsi Gabbard?Tulsi Gabbard served as the Democratic representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021, before leaving the Democratic Party in 2022. She cited disagreements over war and military intervention as the primary reasons for her departure, and denounced the party as an “elitist cabal of warmongers.”In 2019, she launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, challenging candidates such as Kamala Harris.Tulsi Gabbard is often mistakenly assumed to be of Indian origin because of her first name. While her first name is of Hindu origin, Gabbard does not have direct ties to India. Her mother converted to Hinduism and gave all her children Hindu names. Gabbard also identifies as a Hindu.",
