  "text": "The man suspected of an attack on pro-Israeli protesters in Colorado, who is facing federal hate crime charges, had planned the attack for a year, according to the the official. Mohammed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national staying in the US even after his visa expired, has allegedly thrown the fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, injuring 12 people. J Bishop Grewell, acting US Attorney for the District of Colorado, told reporters the 45-year-old suspect had been planning the attack for a year.Soliman attacked a group of elderly protesters with \"Molotov cocktails at a group of men and women, some of them in their late 80s, burning them as they peacefully walked on a Sunday to draw attention to Israeli hostages held in Gaza.\"\"When he was interviewed about the attack, he said he wanted them all to die. He had no regrets, and he would go back and do it again.\"During questioning, Soliman revealed his unsuccessful attempt to purchase a firearm, which was prevented due to his non-US citizenship status.'Responding officers discovered 16 unused Molotov cocktails at the scene, along with a backpack weed sprayer containing petrol, which authorities believe was intended as an improvised flamethrower.The accused faces potential life imprisonment under federal hate crime charges, alongside state attempted murder charges that could result in centuries of incarceration.US President Trump criticised Joe Biden regarding the incident. \"Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,\" Trump posted on Truth Social, describing it as a \"terrible tragedy.\"He attributed the incident to \"Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy\" for Soliman's entry. \"This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,\" he stated.Marco Rubio, his Secretary of State, issued a stern warning.\"All terrorists, their family members, and terrorist sympathizers here on a visa should know that under the Trump Administration we will find you, revoke your visa, and deport you,\" he posted on social media.The incident took place on Sunday afternoon during a demonstration supporting hostages captured during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Footage shows a bare-chested individual clutching bottles, walking back and forth near burning grass. The individual was heard shouting \"End Zionists!\" and \"They are killers!\" at several people wearing red T-shirts who were attending to someone on the ground.Additional footage captured dark smoke rising into the air.Recently, the attacks against Israel have increased in the US. Few weeks back, a fatal shooting took place outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old arrested suspect, who shouted \"Free Palestine,\" killed two Israeli embassy staffers.",
