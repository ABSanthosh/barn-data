  "text": "File photo: US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Picture credit: AP)US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Saturday that he remains wary of Russia’s intentions in the Ukraine peace process, warning that Moscow could be “tapping us along” after the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in three years failed to produce a ceasefire.In an interview with CBS News’ Face the Nation airing Sunday, Rubio confirmed he spoke by phone with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to get a readout on Friday’s talks in Istanbul. “They were not a complete waste of time,” he said, but added, “Are they tapping us along? Well, that’s what we’re trying to find out.”The Istanbul meeting ended in under two hours without agreement on a ceasefire, though both sides consented to a prisoner exchange involving 1,000 captives each. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s offer for a face-to-face meeting in Turkey, instead sending a lower-level delegation.Rubio acknowledged the delicate balance between patience and urgency. “On the one hand, we’re trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war… On the other hand, we don’t have time to waste,” he said, stressing that broader global issues also demand attention.He also indicated that progress would likely hinge on a direct Trump-Putin meeting. “The president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible,” he said, noting that preparations for such a summit, including the choice of location and timing, had yet to be finalised. Rubio said the Vatican, which has offered to host peace talks, could be a “comfortable” setting for all parties.The remarks come ahead of a high-stakes Monday, when US President Donald Trump is expected to speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy by phone. “Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,” Trump wrote on social media.While Trump has continued to project confidence in his ability to broker peace, recent escalations on the ground raise doubts about any imminent breakthrough. On Saturday, a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in Ukraine’s Sumy region killed nine people and wounded several others, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a “deliberate attack on civilians.”Zelenskyy has agreed to Trump’s demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, but Ukrainian officials remain sceptical about the US administration’s shifting approach. “Such inconsistency, illogical steps and lack of strategy undermine US credibility,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, chair of Ukraine’s parliamentary foreign affairs committee, according to the New York Times.Critics argue Trump’s posture risks rewarding Russia’s hardline position while cornering Ukraine into concessions. Mick Ryan, a defence analyst quoted by New York Times, said, “Putin’s primary goal is snuffing out Ukraine’s democracy and culture, denying it agency in its own affairs.”As world leaders gathered in Rome for Pope Leo XIV’s inaugural Mass, Rubio, attending the ceremony, said the new pope had made a “very generous offer” to host peace talks. In his first blessing, Pope Leo urged all parties to strive for “an authentic, just and lasting peace.”",
