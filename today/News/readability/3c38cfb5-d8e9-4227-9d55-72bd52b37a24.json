  "text": "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Thursday hit back at US President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, saying Brazil would not bow to foreign pressure and warning of reciprocal action.Lula expressed his disapproval, saying, “No gringo is going to give orders to this president,” according to news agency Reuters. He made the remarks during an event with leftist student activists in the state of Goias, wearing a red shirt and defending Brazil’s sovereignty.His comments followed a letter from Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, in which the US leader blamed the tariffs on Brazil’s treatment of right-wing ex-president Jair Bolsonaro and accused the country of unfair trade practices against American companies. The tariffs are due to take effect from August 1.Speaking to anchor Christiane Amanpour in an interview, Lula called Trump’s comments a break from diplomatic protocol and argued that the judicial process involving Bolsonaro had nothing to do with trade policy, CNN reported. “The judiciary branch of power in Brazil is independent. The president of the Republic has no influence whatsoever,” he said.Lula also said that Trump was elected as the leader of the United States and “not to be the emperor of the world,\" reports CNN.Bolsonaro is currently on trial in Brazil for allegedly attempting to stage a coup following Lula’s 2022 electoral win. He could face more than 40 years in prison if convicted. Lula even compared the situation to Trump’s own legal troubles, saying, “If Trump was Brazilian and if he did what happened at Capitol Hill, he’d also be on trial in Brazil. And possibly he would have violated the Constitution. According to justice, he would also be arrested if he had done that here in Brazil.”Initially, Lula said he believed Trump’s post was fake. “It was very unpleasant,” he told CNN. “I thought it was fake news.”The Brazilian government has vowed to respond with reciprocal tariffs if Trump follows through. “Brazil is to take care of Brazil and take care of the Brazilian people, and not to take care of the interests of the others,” Lula said. “Brazil will not accept anything imposed on it. We accept negotiation and not imposition.”The situation marks one of the first strong pushbacks to Trump’s recent wave of tariff threats. Over 20 other countries have received similar letters this month, but Brazil stands out due to its significant trade relationship with the US. Lula, who is in his third non-consecutive term as president, also reiterated his government’s intention to regulate and tax foreign tech companies. “We are going to regulate and tax US tech firms,” he said, blaming them for promoting violence and misinformation “under the argument of freedom of expression.”Brazil’s foreign relations minister Mauro Vieira said there had been no direct communication between Lula and Trump so far, but confirmed Lula was open to talks. “If the circumstances are given, they will speak,” Vieira said, as reported by CNN Brasil.Furthermore, Lula indicated a willingness to find common ground. “The best thing in the world is for us to sit around a table and talk,” he told CNN. “If President Trump is willing to take seriously the negotiations underway between Brazil and the US, then I’ll be open-minded to negotiate whatever may be necessary.”Meanwhile, tensions escalated further as the US announced an investigation into what it called “unfair” trade practices by Brazil. According to the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the probe will focus on issues including digital trade, electronic payments, tariffs, corruption, and intellectual property rights.Lula is expected to deliver a televised address to the nation later on Thursday, in which he is likely to elaborate on Brazil’s stance and outline possible next steps in the growing trade dispute.At home, the political tension seems to be working in Lula’s favour. His approval ratings have recently seen an uptick as many Brazilians support his firm stand in defending national interests.",
