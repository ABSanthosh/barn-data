Modeling by the United States Geological Survey estimated that the death toll was likely to surpass 10,000, and that there was a strong possibility of a much higher toll.A preliminary count from Myanmar’s military government said that at least 144 people had been killed and 732 injured in just three cities — but that did not include Mandalay.The quake, measured by the U.S.G.S. at magnitude 7.7, was strong enough that it leveled a 33-story building that was under construction more than 600 miles away in Bangkok, in neighboring Thailand. At least eight people were confirmed dead there, and dozens more were missing, according to the authorities. They were all presumed to be members of the 320-person crew of workers who were putting up the new building for the Thai government.VideoThe moment when a 33-story building that was under construction collapsed in Bangkok, Thailand.CreditCredit...@Khon Su Cheevit Adeet Mai Suay Rok Na/Facebook AFPThe earthquake, which struck at about 12:50 p.m. local time, was only the third of its size to hit the region in the past century, and the U.S.G.S. analysis placed the epicenter just 10 miles from the heart of Mandalay, a city of about 1.5 million people. An aftershock of magnitude 6.7 was recorded about 11 minutes later, the first of several sizable tremors that followed the first one.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
