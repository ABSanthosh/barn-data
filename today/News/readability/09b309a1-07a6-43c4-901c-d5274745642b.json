They are expected to hold a press conference Monday afternoon, according to a Google translation of the report in Japanese.Shares of Honda were 1.46% up, while Nissan shares were marginally higher at 0.2%.Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.68%, while the Topix was 0.51% higher.South Korea's Kospi gained 0.72%, and the small-cap Kosdaq rose 0.96%.Australia's S\u0026P/ASX 200 started the day up 0.71%.Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng index stood at 19,886, pointing to a stronger open compared to the HSI's close of 19,720.7.Last Friday in the U.S., all three major indexes climbed, helped by cooler-than-expected inflation data.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.18%, while the S\u0026P 500 added 1.09% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.03%.The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, accelerated to 2.4% in November from 2.3% the previous month, but was still lower than the 2.5% estimate from Dow Jones.
