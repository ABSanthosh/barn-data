  "text": "Hamas said Friday that it was ready to begin negotiations with Israel “immediately” over the implementation of a ceasefire proposal intended to pause the fighting in Gaza for 60 days — a window during which negotiators could work to secure an end to the conflict.The statement from Hamas did not include details about what provisions it might seek to amend, or the extent of such proposals.Almost 21 months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel killed approximately 1,200 people, Israel’s military campaign to dislodge the militant group from Gaza has razed large parts of the enclave and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, as Hamas fights on.“The movement has submitted its positive response to the mediator brothers,” the group said in a statement released late Friday, saying that it was “fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations.”President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Israel had agreed to conditions for a ceasefire, and he urged Hamas to do the same.The State Department said Friday evening that it had nothing to add on the response from Hamas, beyond Trump’s comments. Hamas did not respond to a request for details on its position.Negotiations have broken down repeatedly over a fundamental disagreement: Israel has pushed for a temporary truce to bring home its hostages, but not an end to the war, while Hamas has called for a permanent cessation of hostilities and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops.The terms of a new deal for a 60-day ceasefire, dated June 30 and put to Hamas in recent days by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, contained guarantees of Trump’s commitment to the agreement and to continuing negotiations to reach a permanent cessation of hostilities that would see the release of all hostages, according to a summary. It was unclear Friday whether Hamas’s statement regarding a return to talks came in response to that version of the deal, or whether the militant group had since requested or secured other changes.Under the June 30 text, Hamas would be required to release 28 Israeli hostages — 10 alive, and 18 bodies — in five stages over the course of the two month ceasefire. In return, aid would immediately enter Gaza “in sufficient amounts,” with the involvement of the United Nations and the Palestine Red Crescent Society.The International Committee of the Red Cross said Wednesday that what remains of Gaza’s hospital network was struggling to absorb a “relentless surge in critical cases.” Medical facilities were overwhelmed and running out of body bags, it said. According to the United Nations, mass casualties have been reported daily over the past five weeks, as Palestinian civilians have been fired upon as they approach or gather near militarized aid distribution points run by the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or wait on routes designated by the Israeli authorities for the U.N. to collect trucks carrying aid.“Today, Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” a coalition of more than 200 humanitarian and human rights groups said in a statement Tuesday.Israeli military and defense officials informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year that the army’s first war aim — to weaken Hamas’s ability to threaten Israel — has been accomplished, and that the return of Israel’s hostages — a principal concern of much of the Israeli public — will be possible only as part of a deal.Netanyahu has for months resisted signing a deal that would withdraw Israeli troops and release many of the remaining 50 hostages, of which about 20 are thought to be alive, partly to satisfy his far-right coalition partners who have threatened to quit the government if Gaza is not fully occupied.While Netanyahu theoretically has more leverage to agree to a peace deal now, after a boost in domestic popularity after the joint U.S.-Israel strikes on Iran, some Israeli officials continue to signal that they do not view any potential ceasefire as a path to ending the war entirely.Hazem Balousha contributed to this report.",
