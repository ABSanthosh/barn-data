Mauritius is one of the few countries in the region that has refused to take part in China’s belt and road initiative.Ministers have also argued that the UK has to give up the territory due to international legal rulings in favour of Mauritius, and that legal uncertainty over the legitimacy of the military base could compromise its security.The UK government revealed it would spare China from facing stronger rules as part of its register of foreign lobbyists coming into force on 1 July.Russia and Iran would both be included in the enhanced tier of the foreign influence registration scheme once it was launched this summer, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, told the Commons.The enhanced tier of the scheme is reserved for countries that pose a risk to UK national security. Anyone who is directed by Russia or Iran to carry out activities in the UK must declare it or face five years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionJarvis declined to comment on China’s status in the scheme or to speculate on “which countries may or may not be specified in the future”. Should ministers decide to impose stricter rules on China or any other countries such as North Korea, they will need to give three months’ notice of the change.Announcing greater restrictions on Russian activity, Jarvis said Moscow “presents an acute threat to UK national security” and that its “hostile acts have ranged from the use of a deadly nerve agent in Salisbury, espionage, arson and cyber-attacks, including the targeting of UK parliamentarians through spear-phishing campaigns”.In response Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described China as the “elephant in the room” and said the country “engages in industrial-scale espionage, seeking to steal technology from government, universities and from industries. They repress Chinese citizens here and have sought to infiltrate our political system.”The foreign influence registration scheme was expected to come into force last year but the new Labour government delayed its implementation.Ministers said on Tuesday that they would work with business and academia to help them prepare for the scheme’s launch, and that there would be a three-month grace period to register existing ties with foreign states.",
