As first reported by The Street, the emergency code “Mr. M.O.B.” (man overboard) rang out over the ship’s intercom, signaling an urgent response.\"The Crew aboard the Disney Dream swiftly rescued two guests from the water,\" a Disney Cruise Line spokesperson told USA TODAY in a statement. \"We commend our Crew Members for their exceptional skills and prompt actions, which ensured the safe return of both guests to the ship within minutes. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our guests, and this incident highlights the effectiveness of our safety protocols.\"Social media posts from cruisers described the rapid reaction from crew members, who launched life preservers and deployed a rescue boat within minutes. In a Facebook post, passenger Kevin Furuta said, “A girl fell overboard from the 4th deck \u0026 her dad went in after her ...
