  "text": "US House Speaker Mike Johnson has called on the Justice Department to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in federal custody in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges.In an interview on Tuesday with podcaster Benny Johnson, Mike said: “It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.”Johnson’s remarks marked a rare public disagreement with US President Donald Trump, his close ally in Congress, over an issue that has angered many in Trump’s conservative base, as reported by The Guardian.Trump has faced criticism from his supporters for failing to make public all information about Epstein, who allegedly had ties to many powerful figures. Last week, the justice department concluded that Epstein’s death was a suicide and announced that no list of clients would be released, rejecting conspiracy theories.Conservative allies of Trump have accused him and US attorney general Pam Bondi of handling the case poorly.During the interview, Speaker John also referred to Bondi’s earlier claim on Fox News that she had Epstein’s client list on her desk to review: “She needs to come forward and explain that to everybody. We need the DOJ focusing on major priorities. So let’s get this thing resolved.”Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans voted down a proposal from Democrats. The proposal would have added a rule to a new law that would require the justice department to release Epstein-related files.Despite this setback, Democrats say they will keep pushing the issue. Members of the House Judiciary Committee have called on its Republican chair, Representative Jim Jordan, a Trump ally, to hold hearings with Bondi, her deputy and FBI leaders to answer questions about Epstein.Speaking to reporters before leaving the White House for Pittsburgh on Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but suggested she could choose to release more documents: “She’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release.”When NBC News asked Bondi about Trump's MAGA allies' frustration with how she has handled the case, she shifted the focus to other issues: “We’re going to fight to keep America safe again. We’ve got a war on drugs. We’ve got a war on human trafficking. We’ve got cartels in this country … we have foreign adversaries around this world as well, and we’re all going to work together as a team.”",
