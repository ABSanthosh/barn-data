  "text": "Mayor Eric Adams backs deportation of criminal migrants, seeks collaboration with Trump administration (Picture credit: AP)New York City Mayor Eric Adams has expressed his willingness to deport migrants charged with crimes, signalling a departure from his earlier stance of waiting for convictions. Adams also announced plans to collaborate with President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, including a meeting with incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan, to discuss strategies for addressing criminal activities involving migrants.\"My position is simple: people who commit crimes in our city have abdicated their right to remain here,\" Adams said during a Tuesday press briefing, according to the New York Post. He referred specifically to cases like that of Bernardo Castro Mata, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant accused of shooting two NYPD officers, saying, \"I don’t want that guy in my city, plain and simple.\" Adams stands firm despite backlashThe mayor emphasised the need to act against individuals who pose a threat to public safety, stating, \"Those committing crimes—robberies, shootings, or rapes—have been a harm to our country. Cancel me if you want, but I’m going to protect the people of this city.\" He criticised what he described as the reluctance of progressive leaders to address such issues, asserting that his stance aligns with earlier positions held by prominent Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, who supported the deportation of criminals during their time.Adams also defended his selective approach, clarifying that law-abiding undocumented immigrants, including \"Dreamers\" like his commissioner of immigrant affairs Manuel Castro, should not face deportation. \"These are people who love our country and contribute positively,\" he said, as per Daily Caller.Trump administration prepares for \"largest deportation operation\"Tom Homan, the incoming border czar and former ICE director, has pledged to implement what he described as the \"largest deportation operation in US history.\" Homan emphasised that the focus will initially be on individuals who pose a risk to public safety.In a recent interview, he warned that resistance from Democratic governors and mayors could lead to legal consequences, even jail time. \"We’re going to do the job with or without their cooperation,\" Homan told Fox News last month.New York City, a sanctuary city, faces particular challenges. According to ICE data cited by The New York Post, over 58,000 migrants in the city are either convicted felons or facing pending criminal charges. This influx, combined with rising crime rates, has strained city resources. Adams has previously criticised the Biden administration for its lack of support, stating last year that the migrant crisis \"will destroy\" New York City.Adams' willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration reflects a broader shift in immigration policy discourse, following a presidential election that highlighted border security concerns. \"The American people voted for change on immigration,\" Adams remarked, urging a collaborative approach with federal authorities.Despite his calls for deporting criminals, Adams reaffirmed his commitment to supporting law-abiding migrants.",
