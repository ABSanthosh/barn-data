Musk and Ramaswamy have already begun working to right-size the incoming govt. \"Vivek's base plan remains (the) same: to get accomplishments at DOGE and then announce a run for governor shortly,\" an Ohio operative, one of the two sources, was quoted as saying by WaPo. Trump has said DOGE's work must be completed by July 4, 2026. Ohio's gubernatorial election to replace Republican governor Mike DeWine - who is term-limited - will take place in Nov 2026.Ramaswamy intends to make his plan public after DeWine announces his pick to replace veep-elect JD Vance in the Senate, the other source - a person inside Ramaswamy's political apparatus - said. Trump was reportedly backing his Indian-American acolyte to succeed Vance, but on Friday DeWine appointed his Lt Guv Jon Husted for the Senate role.",
