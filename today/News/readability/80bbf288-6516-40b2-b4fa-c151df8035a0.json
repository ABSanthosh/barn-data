  "text": "US President-elect Donald Trump on Monday picked Florida representative Mike Waltz as his national security adviser, according to various reports citing sources.Waltz, a former Army Green Beret, has established himself as a prominent critic of China.A Trump supporter and former National Guard colonel, Waltz has expressed concerns about Chinese activities in the Asia-Pacific region and emphasised the importance of American preparedness for potential regional conflicts.The position of national security adviser, which doesn't require Senate approval, carries significant influence. In this role, Waltz will brief Trump on crucial national security matters and facilitate inter-agency coordination.Waltz has openly supported Trump's foreign policy approach whilst criticising the Biden administration's 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. He said, \"Disruptors are often not nice ... frankly our national security establishment and certainly a lot of people that are dug into bad old habits in the Pentagon need that disruption,\" adding \"Donald Trump is that disruptor.\"His Washington experience includes serving as defence policy director under secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. Elected to Congress in 2018, he chairs the House Armed Services subcommittee on military logistics and serves on the intelligence select committee.As a member of the Republican's China Task Force, Waltz has highlighted concerns about US military readiness for potential Indo-Pacific conflicts. His recent book, \"Hard Truths: Think and Lead Like a Green Beret,\" outlines strategies for preventing conflict with China.Regarding Ukraine, Waltz's position has changed over time. Initially advocating for increased weapons support following Russia's 2022 invasion, he recently questioned American priorities, \"Is it in America's interest, are we going to put in the time, the treasure, the resources that we need in the Pacific right now badly?\"Whilst supporting Trump's push for increased Nato defence spending, Waltz differs from the president-elect by maintaining support for US involvement in the alliance. He recently noted, \"Look we can be allies and friends and have tough conversations.\"",
