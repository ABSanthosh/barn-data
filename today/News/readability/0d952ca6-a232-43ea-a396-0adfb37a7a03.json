But the U.S. consumer, ironically, could be the real victim of tariffs.During the weekend, Temu, a Chinese e-tailer known for offering wallet-friendly items, hiked prices, citing \"import charges.\" Analysis by CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge and Annie Palmer found that those fees can cost more than the items themselves and eventually double the price of a typical order.Something worse than price increases is when daily necessities are unavailable for purchase. Some U.S. stores could see empty shelves in a few weeks as the impact of tariffs on China begins filtering into the economy, according to asset management firm Apollo.It's true that China exports far more to the U.S. than it imports from the country, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out. But the implication of that trade relationship is that the U.S. consumer has more to lose when China's exports slow to a trickle.What you need to know todayEuropean stocks outperform U.S.U.S. stocks traded mixed Monday. The S\u0026P 500 was up a marginal 0.06% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.28%. The Nasdaq Composite, however, slipped 0.1%. Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 index added 0.53%.

Deliveroo shares popped 16.5% after the company announced a takeover proposal from DoorDash.China-U.S. trade war still simmeringChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference Monday that Beijing isn't in talks with the U.S. over a tariff deal, and he isn't aware of Chinese President Xi Jinping speaking with U.S. President Donald Trump, contrary to what the latter has claimed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday told CNBC that \"it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them.\"Tariffs drive Temu to hikes pricesChinese e-tailer Temu has started adding \"import charges\" of about 145% in response to Trump tariffs. The fees, which apply to U.S. customers and kicked in the weekend after price hikes went into effect on Friday, could be higher than a product's cost. \"Items imported into the U.S. may be subject to import charges,\" Temu wrote on its website. $150 billion investment by IBMIBM on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers.
