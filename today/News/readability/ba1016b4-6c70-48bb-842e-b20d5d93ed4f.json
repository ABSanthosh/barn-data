  "text": "TEL AVIV — President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy was in Israel on Wednesday to meet with senior officials and tour Israeli military installations in and around the Gaza Strip, making his second trip to the region this month to advance a shaky ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.Steve Witkoff, a former real estate magnate who was tapped by Trump to lead Middle East diplomacy, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. According to Israeli media reports, he also visited security checkpoints in Gaza, where U.S. contractors are helping oversee the inspection of Palestinians traveling between the northern and southern parts of the territory.His reported trip to war-torn Gaza wasn’t publicized, and a spokesman for Netanyahu’s office declined to comment. Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan News, cited a security source as saying Witkoff observed a vehicle checkpoint along Gaza’s Salah al-Din Road, the main north-south highway, and that he was accompanied by Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer.If confirmed, Witkoff’s visit to Gaza would be the first by a U.S. official in more than a decade, marking a departure from long-held U.S. policy that kept American diplomats out for security and political purposes.His tour comes as mediators between Israel and militant group Hamas are preparing to return to the negotiating table to discuss the second, more substantive phase of the ceasefire agreement. In its initial stage, the ceasefire, which began Jan. 19, is supposed to last for 42 days and include the release of 33 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.The second phase will require hashing out thornier questions around Gaza’s political future, the role of the Palestinian Authority, and whether wealthy Arab monarchies in the Persian Gulf will bankroll reconstruction and under what conditions.Netanyahu also faces rifts within his coalition over the ceasefire agreement, with right-wing members pressuring the prime minister to resume the fighting and eliminate Hamas. The militant group ruled Gaza for 17 years before the war and, while battered, has reemerged in the days since the ceasefire took effect.But “Witkoff is coming to tell Bibi that the last visit wasn’t a one-time thing, that Trump expects him to adhere to what was agreed upon,” said a former senior Israeli official, using a nickname for the prime minister.On Jan. 11, before the second Trump administration began, Witkoff met with Netanyahu and made clear that Trump wanted him to agree to a deal. The former Israeli official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press.Witkoff’s visit this week has been shrouded in secrecy, but speaking to reporters in New York on Sunday, he did not mention the internal dissent in Israel over the deal. He said he hoped the ceasefire would continue, and he praised efforts by Qatar, which has represented Hamas in the talks, to keep the deal together at key moments when it threatened to fall apart.“We had some blips and managed to get through it through good dialogue and good talk,” Witkoff said at the official opening of the Altneu Synagogue on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, speaking alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog.Hamas announced Wednesday that it would release more hostages the following day, including Arbel Yehud, 29; Agam Berger, 20; and Gadi Moses, 80. Israel also plans to release more Palestinian prisoners, and another swap is scheduled for the weekend.Netanyahu is expected to travel next week to Washington, where he will meet with Trump. But before that visit, Trump wants Witkoff to make sure Netanyahu is on the same page as the administration regarding the second ceasefire phase and Gaza’s postwar future.“Witkoff is here to send a message that President Trump is taking a hands-on approach to the ‘day after’ issue, that he will be the one to comanage it,” said Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, an Israeli think tank.Public opinion polls show that a majority of Israelis support the agreement, but there are questions around what the Trump administration may have offered Netanyahu in exchange for halting the war.Diker said he believed the agreement was a “bad deal,” requiring Israel to make major concessions, including ceding control of the Netzarim Corridor, which is now run by security contractors.The corridor, including a road and fortified checkpoints that span the length of the Gaza Strip, divided the territory in two. It was designed in part to stem the flow of weapons and other materiel from southern Gaza to Hamas’s strongholds in the north, but it also separated Palestinian families for the duration of the war and led to a severe humanitarian crisis in northern parts of the enclave.At the same time, the piecemeal release of hostages each week has allowed Hamas to choreograph “ceremonies” in which they parade the captives in front of crowds of Palestinians before handing them over the International Committee of the Red Cross, Diker said.“Israel needs the resumption of fighting as leverage, to make sure it all goes through,” he added.",
