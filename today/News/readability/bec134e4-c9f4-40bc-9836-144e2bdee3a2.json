  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Secretary of State Marco Rubio is planning to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malaysia on Friday, marking their first face-to-face meeting and coming at a time of fraught tensions over issues including trade and defense.The meeting will take place on the sidelines of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. Neither the United States nor China are members, but both Washington and Beijing have been seeking to court Southeast Asian nations — even as many as the region are wary of alignment.Rubio and Wang are due to speak late Friday afternoon local time, according to the secretary of state’s public schedule. Rubio said Thursday he wanted to speak to his Chinese counterpart about Beijing’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.“The Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort. I think that, generally, they’ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,” Robio told reporters shortly after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.Rubio, who earned a reputation as a China hawk during his 14 years as a Republican senator, was blacklisted by Beijing in 2020 and remains on its sanctions list. He last spoke to Wang via phone in January, shortly after taking office as secretary of state.This is Rubio’s first trip to Asia as the U.S.’s top diplomat, and it has been made more complicated by escalating tariff threats this week from President Donald Trump and growing demands that Asian allies spend more on defense. The persistent distractions of crises in the Middle East and Europe, meanwhile, resulted in Rubio dropping Japan and South Korea from his itinerary, making his trip to the continent a brief, one-stop visit.In public remarks in front of the ASEAN foreign ministers earlier on Thursday, Rubio said that despite these difficulties, the U.S. was interested in “strong partnership” with Asian nations.“When I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible,” Rubio said, adding that it was a “reality” that “the story of the next 50 years will largely be written here in this region, in this part of the world.”Rubio originally intended to also visit Japan and South Korea on this trip but cut those stops so he could stay in Washington to attend meetings this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meetings with representatives of both Asian nations were held on the sidelines of the ASEAN conference instead.The U.S. delegation arrived in Asia just days after Trump threatened to reinstate his “Liberation Day” tariffs on numerous countries in the region unless they gave into U.S. demands — a move that analysts have said would undermine efforts to isolate China in the region.Officials from Malaysia, among those targeted with a potential 25 percent tariff, have obliquely criticized Trump’s threats at the forum. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim stated in an opening speech on Wednesday that “tariffs, export restrictions and investment barriers have now become the sharpened instruments of geopolitical rivalry.”Experts said that Rubio’s public messaging at the ASEAN meeting would be closely analyzed, not just by the 10-member nations but also rivals like China.Southeast Asian countries were looking for a “United States that is not only committed to its long-standing security role, which has underpinned regional peace and prosperity, but one that also extends a hand for genuine economic partnership, rather than wielding a fist of punitive, unilateral tariffs,” said Lynn Kuok, the Lee Kuan Yew chair at the Brookings Institution.If the primary U.S. goal is to effectively counter China, Kuok added, “the administration’s foreign policy has been counterproductive.”",
