The dog was rescued from the streets of Goa state, which gave it its name.The tycoon, who had a reputation for being modest and shy, was known for his philanthropic work, including animal welfare, health and education. ReutersTata had been fond of Goa, a rescue dog that lived with him him in MumbaiTata's death was announced on Wednesday night. He had been admitted to hospital earlier in the week.\"His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed,\" a company statement said.The Tata Group is one of India's largest companies, with annual revenues in excess of $100bn (£76.5bn), and he was one of India's most internationally-recognised business leaders.Founded 155 years ago, the group straddles a business empire ranging from Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel, to aviation and salt pans. During his 20-year tenure, the conglomerate made several high-profile acquisitions, including the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus, UK-based car brands Jaguar and Land Rover, and Tetley, the world's second-largest tea company.Some of those decisions paid off, while others - including a failed telecom venture and the Nano, which was billed as the world's cheapest car but flopped - lost money. Tata was born in a traditional Parsi family in 1937. He studied architecture and structural engineering at Cornell University in the US.In 1962, he joined Tata Industries - the promoter company of the group - as an assistant and spent six months training at a company plant in Jamshedpur.From there, he went on to work at the Tata Iron and Steel Company (now Tata Steel), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Radio and Electronics (Nelco).In 1991, JRD Tata, who had led the group for over half a century, appointed Ratan Tata as his successor. \"He [JRD Tata] was my greatest mentor... he was like a father and a brother to me - and not enough has been said about that,\" Tata later told an interviewer.In 2008, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Vibhushan, the country's second-highest civilian honour.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Tata as a \"visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being\".",
