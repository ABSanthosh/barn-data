  "text": "A Detroit-based social media influence and rapper, Dajua Blanding also known by her stage name Dank Demoss, has initiated legal proceedings against Lyft following a service denial due to her weight.Legal representatives for Blanding, who is 489 pounds, have submitted a lawsuit alleging the recent incident breached Michigan's anti-discrimination legislation, which specifically includes weight as a protected characteristic. Meanwhile, Michigan is the only state which legally safeguards weight under its anti-discrimination framework.The situation gained significant attention after Blanding shared it on TikTok on January 19. \"This Lyft driver denied me service because of my size,\" she wrote in her post.The footage shows the Lyft driver saying, \"I got no space. My car is small.\" When Blanding said she could fit, he replied, \"Believe me, you can't.\"Abraham, the driver shown in the video, explained his refusal citing tyre conditions and previous difficulties with a passenger's size. He recommended using Uber XL and assured a refund.Lyft responded with an official statement highlighting their service terms' strict prohibition of all forms of discrimination. \"Lyft unequivocally condemns all forms of discrimination—we believe in a community where everyone is treated with equal respect and mutual kindness. Our community guidelines and terms of service explicitly prohibit harassment or discrimination,\" said Lyft in a public statement.Although Blanding received a refund, she informed her followers about her emotional distress from the incident. \"I knew that it was illegal, and I knew that it was wrong,\" said Jonathan Marko, attorney for Blanding.",
