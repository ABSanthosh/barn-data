  "text": "Agnes Keleti, a Hungarian gymnast who survived the Holocaust and went on to win 10 Olympic medals, including five gold, a record that made her one of the most decorated athletes in the history of her sport, died Jan. 2 in Budapest. She was 103.Her death was announced on the website of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. According to the Associated Press, which cited the Hungarian state news agency in reporting her death, she had been hospitalized with pneumonia.Ms. Keleti was the oldest living Olympic champion, a centenarian who had begun her gymnastics training in Budapest during the years before World War II.She became a national champion in 1937, when she was 16, according to a tribute on the Olympics website, marking the beginning of a promising career. But her trajectory in elite athletics, and any semblance of life as she had known it, came to a stop when the war began in 1939.The 1940 Summer Games, originally scheduled to take place in Tokyo, were canceled because of the war, as were the 1944 Games planned for London.Under the leadership of Adm. Miklos Horthy, Hungary came increasingly under the sway of Nazi Germany. As antisemitic persecution intensified across Europe, Ms. Keleti, who was Jewish, was barred from participating in athletics.Conditions for Jews in Hungary worsened severely after German forces occupied the country in 1944 and mass deportations of Jews began.Ms. Keleti’s father, who died at Auschwitz, the Nazi killing center in occupied Poland, was among the more than half a million Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Her mother and sister were saved by Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who ran a massive rescue operation in Budapest.Ms. Keleti survived by acquiring false identification papers and working as a maid for a pro-Nazi family in the Hungarian countryside.“I was strong and I worked hard,” Ms. Keleti told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in 2019. “Nobody asked questions.”When the war ended in 1945, she returned to gymnastics, eager to resume a career that she saw as a means to travel the world.She was scheduled to compete in the 1948 London Olympics, but days before the Games began, she suffered an ankle injury that kept her from the competition. She had to wait four more years to participate in the Olympics, making her debut at Helsinki in 1952.Ms. Keleti won four medals that year, including gold in the floor exercise, silver for the team all-around, and bronze in the uneven bars and team portable apparatus.In Melbourne four years later, she achieved an even greater haul: gold in floor exercise, balance beam, uneven bars and team portable apparatus and silver for both the individual and team all-around events.Her successes were made all the more impressive by her age. At the Helsinki Games, where the average gymnast was 23, Ms. Keleti was 31. By the time she competed at Melbourne, she was 35.For Ms. Keleti, the Melbourne Games were darkened by events in Hungary, where the Soviet Union had put down an anti-Communist uprising shortly before the Olympics began. Ms. Keleti sought asylum in Australia, as did many Hungarian Olympians, and soon settled in Israel.She spent nearly six decades in Israel, where she coached the national gymnastics team for years. For her contributions to athletics, she received the Israel Prize, one of the state’s highest honors, in 2017.Agnes Klein — her surname was later changed to the more Hungarian Keleti — was born in Budapest on Jan. 9, 1921. She credited her father, whom she described as an exceptional athlete, with cultivating her interest in sports.She was also an accomplished cellist but preferred gymnastics, she told the German newspaper Die Welt, because she “couldn’t bear” to sit still.She attributed her survival during the war — including one particularly brutal winter when she helped collect corpses from the streets of Budapest every morning for burial in a mass grave — to what she described as her essential optimism.“Although everything was indescribably terrible, I never lost my positive thinking,” she told Die Welt. “I’m not afraid either, I’ve never been. I was an optimist all my life, was driven by the love of life, there is no other way. I always said to myself, the brave will be rewarded someday.”In the annals of female Olympic gymnasts, only Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union (with 18 total medals) and Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia and Simone Biles of the United States (both with 11) rank higher than Ms. Keleti. Ms. Keleti shared third place, at 10 total medals, with Soviet gymnast Polina Astakhova.Not listed on Ms. Keleti’s official Olympic count is the silver medal that she received as a member of the Hungarian team that competed in London in 1948, where her injury prevented her from competing.Ms. Keleti was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. The latter organization described her as “the most successful Jewish female athlete in Olympic history” and calculated that among Jewish Olympians, only the swimmer Mark Spitz, with 11 medals, exceeded her total count.Ms. Keleti had two sons, but a complete list of survivors was not immediately available. She had lived in Budapest in recent years to be near one of her children.Ms. Keleti took evident pleasure in demonstrating the splits for visitors until her physician advised her to give up the move around the time of her 100th birthday. But for all her pride in her career, she expressed more interest in looking ahead than she did in gazing back.“The past? Let’s talk about the future,” Ms. Keleti said in 2020. “That’s what should be beautiful. The past is past but there is still a future.”",
