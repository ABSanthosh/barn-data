(KREX) – Two people were issued summons after a road incident Wednesday morning that saw one driver allegedly attempt to hit a motorcyclist.The Grand Junction Police Department responded to the incident around 8:35 a.m., near 29 Road and Patterson Road. Officers learned a motorcyclist performed a legal lane filtering maneuver between two vehicles stopped at a red light near 27 1/2 Road and Patterson Road.Witnesses told law enforcement that the driver of the truck tried to strike the motorcyclist several times with his vehicle. The driver then made an abrupt stop in a turn lane near 29 and Patterson, causing the motorcyclist to collide with the back of the truck.The motorcyclist suffered minor injuries.The truck driver was arrested and released on a summons for reckless endangerment. The motorcyclist was issued a summons for no motorcycle endorsement and no proof of insurance.“The Grand Junction Police Department would like to remind the community that lane filtering is legal in Colorado. Lane filtering allows motorcyclists to pass between vehicles stopped on the roadway and traveling in the same direction,” GJPD said in a news release.“We urge all drivers to remain calm and avoid any actions that could endanger others. Road rage can escalate quickly and create unnecessary risks for everyone on the road.”The names of both drivers were not listed in the news release.Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
