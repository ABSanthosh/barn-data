  "text": "The family of a British couple held in Iran while traveling the world on motorcycles are seeking their safe return, describing their detention as a “distressing situation.”The couple, identified as Lindsay and Craig Foreman, are being detained in southeastern Iran, according to a family statement shared by the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO).“This unexpected turn of events has caused significant concern for our entire family, and we are deeply focused on ensuring their safety and well-being during this trying time,” the family said in the statement Saturday, adding that they are working with the British government and “relevant authorities” on the matter.Last week, Iranian state media released photos of Britain’s ambassador to Iran, Hugo Shorter, meeting with two British nationals described as being accused of “security crimes.” The meeting took place in Kerman, a city more than 600 miles from Tehran, in the presence of a prosecutor and a security official, according to the IRNA state news agency. It did not name the couple and blurred their faces.It was not clear when and where the couple was seized. “We are providing consular assistance to two British Nationals detained in Iran and are in contact with the local authorities,” an FCDO spokesperson said in an email. On Jan. 3, the couple wrote about a visit to a madrassa, or theological school, in the historic city of Isfahan in central Iran, on a Facebook page they were using to document their journey. “Shared language, shared beliefs, and even the simplest gestures can bridge worlds and foster moments of unity,” the post said. Later, the couple posted a selfie in which they were smiling. Then they stopped posting.The couple, in their 50s and residing in Spain, were on a months-long motorcycle journey crisscrossing Western and Southern Europe. They had planned to travel through Iran into South Asia and Southeast Asia before concluding their tour in Australia at the beginning of July.On social media, Lindsay described their journey as one of human connection, hope and discovering what makes life good. They shared stories about braving storms and stomach bugs, often posting selfies along the way.In mid-December, the couple said on Facebook that they had been granted Iranian visas. “We know traveling through Iran might raise eyebrows,” they wrote, adding praise for Iranian hospitality.At the end of December, the Foremans appear to have entered Iran from Armenia. In a Facebook post, they described being nervous and mentioned U.K. warnings to British and dual nationals against traveling to Iran.In early January, they posted images of themselves standing above a verdant boulevard and toasting with cups of tea. “To put your minds at rest, we are having the most amazing time in Iran,” one post said, adding that they were hoping to post more when they reached Pakistan the next day.In 2022, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was freed after six years in prison and house arrest in Iran. She was accused of plotting to overthrow the government — charges she denied. The release came after Britain settled a $524 million debt owed to Iran.",
