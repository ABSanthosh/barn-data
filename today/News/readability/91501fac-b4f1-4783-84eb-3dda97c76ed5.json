Speaking in Pennsylvania, Obama addressed the issue directly: \"You’re coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses... part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"Recent polling has shown Trump gaining support among Black men, a trend worrying to some Democrats. Clyburn, who has been campaigning for Harris in Michigan, reported having \"very frank and direct discussions\" with Black leaders in the state, noting their desire to understand what a Harris administration would offer.Senator Raphael Warnock, however, downplayed concerns during the same programme, dismissing the notion that Black men would vote for Trump in large numbers, saying, \"It’s not going to happen.\"",
