  "text": "US President Donald Trump has warned demonstrators planning to protest during the upcoming military parade in Washington that they would face “very big force.\"Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt message. “For those people that want to protest, they’re going to be met with very big force,” he said. “And I haven’t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.”The event on Saturday marks the 250th anniversary of the US Army and coincides with the MAGA chief's 79th birthday. The day will feature an Army festival on the National Mall, a military parade through the capital, and a mass enlistment and re-enlistment ceremony led by the president.Law enforcement is preparing for massive crowds. According to US Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool, thousands of personnel from federal and local agencies will be deployed. “At least nine permits have been issued for protests on that day,” he confirmed. Both the FBI and Metropolitan Police have said there are no credible threats.'Nationwide Day of Defiance'One of the major organisers of nationwide protests is a group called No Kings. On its website, the group says, “They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights and slashed our services. The corruption has gone too far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.”The group has opted not to protest in Washington itself, accusing Trump of turning the parade into “a made-for-TV display of dominance.” Instead, they are calling for a “Nationwide Day of Defiance” to draw attention to what they describe as authoritarian politics under Trump.POTUS's action regarding LA protestsThe president also defended his recent decision to deploy 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, after protests broke out over immigration raids. “Los Angeles was under siege until we got there,” Trump said, although state officials argue that the military deployment has only worsened tensions.While Trump cited violent episodes, including torched vehicles and attacks on officers, protest supporters say most demonstrations have been peaceful. Trump claimed without evidence that many protesters were “paid insurrectionists.”The president’s stance mirrors his long history of strong support for law enforcement and scepticism towards protest movements. In 2020, during nationwide unrest after George Floyd’s killing, he reportedly asked military leaders if protesters could be shot. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have strongly condemned the decision to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles. Former presidential candidate Kamala Harris has also joined in the criticism. Many other Democratic leaders have criticised Trump’s decision to deploy force without the state’s permission, calling him a “dictator.”Trump’s birthday and US Army’s 250th parade in DCA grand military parade is set to take place in Washington, DC on June 14 to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army’s founding. The day also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday, and he is expected to speak at the event. Organised by the US Army and America250 commission, the celebration will include historical and modern military displays, fireworks, a parachute show by the Golden Knights, and a concert on the National Mall. About 200,000 people are expected to attend. The main parade route runs along Constitution Avenue, with standing room only for spectators.Security will be tight, as the event has been labelled a National Special Security Event by the Department of Homeland Security. Entry will be limited to specific checkpoints, and several items like drones, chairs, and large bags are banned. Roads, flights, metro stations, and river access will face temporary disruptions. Concerns have been raised over damage from heavy tanks, prompting the Army Corps of Engineers to install steel plates to protect roads. The event is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, including possible road repairs. Trump defended the spending, calling it a valuable show of strength.",
