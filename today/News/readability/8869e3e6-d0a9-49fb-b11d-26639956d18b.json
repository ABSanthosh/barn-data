  "text": "Here are the latest developments.Lee Jae-myung of the center-left Democratic Party won the South Korean presidential election on Wednesday, riding a wave of anger against former President Yoon Suk Yeol and his People Power Party after months of political turmoil.Mr. Lee’s opponent, Kim Moon-soo of the conservative People Power Party, conceded defeat in the snap election, which was called after Mr. Yoon was ousted for his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.The country’s new leader faces daunting challenges. Mr. Lee has to find a way to fix South Korea’s sputtering economy and negotiate with President Trump on tariffs. His government will also have to navigate the tensions between the country’s main ally, the United States, and its biggest trading partner, China.He is also set to become one of the most powerful South Korean presidents in decades. The Democratic Party controls the National Assembly and analysts expect it to help Mr. Lee pursue his legislative agenda.Still, analysts have predicted that uncertainty will hang over Mr. Lee’s presidency. He has been standing trial on several criminal charges that he says are politically motivated. There is a dispute over whether the trials should be suspended until the end of his five-year term.

By Agnes Chang The contest was widely considered to be less about Mr. Lee, Mr. Kim or their policies and more about the man they had campaigned to replace. Mr. Yoon was impeached by the Assembly​ and in April was formally expelled from office by the Constitutional Court.That set the stage for Tuesday’s election, which was contested largely as a referendum on Mr. Yoon and his party.Here’s what else to know:Voter turnout: Turnout surpassed 79 percent, according to the National Election Commission, the highest since 1997. It was an intense and deeply polarizing campaign, despite all candidates calling for unity.Deep divisions: Mr. Lee will take office at a time when South ​Koreans are more divided than ever. He, like all candidates, had called for “national unity” during the campaign, recognizing the deep political polarization as one of the biggest challenges the country faces.Lee Jae-myung has won the election, according to a tally by the National Election Commission. With 94.6 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Lee won 48.8 percent against 42 percent for his rival, Kim Moon-soo. Mr. Lee’s lead has become irreversible, given the number of votes that remained to be counted.ImageCredit...Jun Michael Park for The New York TimesKim Moon-soo conceded defeat during a brief news conference. “I humbly accept the decision by the people,” he said. “I also congratulate the candidate Lee Jae-myung on his election.”ImageCredit...Jung Yeon-Je/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWinning the presidency in South Korea can be a poisoned chalice. Of the nine presidents who have come to office since 1980, two were expelled from office through impeachment. Four were convicted of criminal charges and ended up in prison after they left office. Another former president killed himself while he was under criminal investigation.South Korea’s next president will face an issue right away: the lack of a permanent office. Yoon Suk Yeol had moved the president’s office out of the Blue House, a palatial complex in Seoul, to a military compound. But all major candidates have said they dislike it, and that they would only use it temporarily until either moving back to the Blue House or finding another location.As of 12:05 a.m. Wednesday local time, half of the votes cast have been counted. Lee Jae-myung, with nearly 49 percent, is leading his main challenger, Kim Moon-soo, who has 42.6 percent, according to a tally by South Korea’s National Election Commission.Lee Jae-myung told the supporters and journalists gathered outside his home that it was still too early to say if he has won the election. But he sounded optimistic, referring to the “great decision” by the voters. “I will do my best to live up to their expectations,” Lee said in his brief remarks just before midnight local time.ImageCredit...Soo-Hyeon Kim/ReutersAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs of 11 p.m. local time, 25 percent of the votes cast have been counted. Lee Jae-myung, with nearly 48 percent, is leading his main challenger, Kim Moon-soo, who has secured just under 44 percent, according to a tally by the National Election Commission.Six months ago, the streets outside the National Assembly were filled with angry demonstrators calling for the previous president’s ouster. Tonight, that street is packed with a public election watch party with supporters of Lee Jae-myung, who exit polls predict will win. Many are holding the same the light sticks and flags that were on display during the protests.Jun Michael Park for The New York TimesJin Yu Young Reporting from SeoulPark Chan-dae, the leader of Lee Jae-myung’s Democratic Party, said in a televised interview that the exit poll was a sign that “the people have passed judgment” against former President Yoon Suk Yeol.

There is a dispute over whether the trials should continue if he wins the election or should be suspended until after his five-year term. Even if he wins the presidency, analysts say uncertainty will hang over Mr. Lee’s leadership until the dispute is resolved, probably by a decision from the Constitutional Court.Silence fell over the leaders of the right-wing People Power Party as they glumly watched the results of an exit poll that showed their candidate, Kim Moon-soo, trailing far behind the front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, according to live TV footage.VideoCreditCredit...Associated PressJin Yu Young Reporting from SeoulVoter turnout for the election was 78 percent, according to the National Election Commission.

Kim Moon-soo, who represented the right-wing People Power Party, won 39.3 percent, and Lee Jun-seok, a minor-party candidate, 7.7 percent.Jin Yu Young Reporting from SeoulPolls closed at 8 p.m. local time, marking the end of voting for the 21st South Korean presidential election. Counting will begin shortly and the process will be aired live on major television stations.It has been exactly six months since soldiers briefly stormed the National Assembly under martial law, drawing crowds of protesters to the legislature.

Stock market performance since 2024 Analysts have recently upgraded their forecasts for South Korea’s stock market and currency, regardless of which candidate prevails in Tuesday’s election. Simply electing a new leader through a popular vote, they say, will bring greater political certainty after months of turbulence.Investors in South Korea have been wary as the country has been led by a series of unelected acting presidents after former President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached in December after briefly declaring martial law. The country’s main stock market index closed last year as one of the worst performers in Asia.President Trump’s tariffs on cars, steel and other goods have since hit the country’s export industry hard, darkening the economic outlook. South Korea’s central bank, which has been cutting interest rates to shore up the economy, recently slashed its forecast for growth this year, to below 1 percent.“We believe the worst will have passed with the election and the removal of political uncertainty domestically,” Kathleen Oh, an economist at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note. The two main candidates both plan to spend more to shore up the economy. Jin Choi of HSBC estimates that such a stimulus could add a small but much-needed boost to the country’s growth rate, supporting stocks and the currency.Since 1990, “market performance is positive during the first year of a new administration on average,” analysts at Goldman Sachs noted. They raised their forecast for the benchmark Kospi index, implying a 9 percent rise over the coming year, driven by the removal of a “political overhang.” They also said that the South Korean won was likely to strengthen, regardless of the election outcome, because of “declines in policy uncertainties.”South Korea’s stock market has bounced back from its fall after Mr. Yoon imposed martial law. Still, the Kospi index is only back to where it traded at the beginning of last year, while indexes in China and Japan have posted double-digit percentage gains over the same period. Relative to other markets, Korean stocks continue to trade at a significant discount to their underlying earnings, which analysts attribute to poor corporate governance and a lack of shareholder rights.Both leading candidates have pledged to make changes to address the issues behind the “Korea discount,” the Goldman analysts added, but whoever takes over faces this and many other challenges at home and abroad, from uniting a deeply divided electorate to navigating a global trade war.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe candidates leave young voters disenchanted.ImageProtesters demonstrating against President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea in Seoul in December.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesAfter President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea briefly imposed martial law in December, many young people in the country took to the streets for the first time. They spent months calling for his removal as they sang protest anthems and attended marches in the freezing cold holding K-pop light sticks and custom-made flags.When Mr. Yoon was later impeached and removed from office, young protesters felt that their work had paid off. But as Election Day approached, some of them felt disenchanted by the candidates on the ballot.“My one thought on this election is disgust,” said An Ye-young, 20, a college student. She joined the demonstrations again Mr. Yoon in December, her first time as a protester.“It’s a feast with nothing to eat,” she said, speaking over the weekend after casting her ballot early.The race was called on Wednesday for Lee Jae-myung, a centrist with South Korea’s Democratic Party. To many Koreans, Mr. Lee’s victory was more a rebuke of Mr. Yoon than a sign of support for his own policies. Especially for many young South Koreans, neither Mr. Lee nor his opponent, Kim Moon-soo, seemed like they would address their key issues: youth unemployment, pension reform, and discrimination and abuse against women.Young people in South Korea face a tough job market. The unemployment rate among people 15 to 29 rose to a four-year high of 6.8 percent in the first quarter of this year.South Korea’s low birthrate has also fueled concerns that its $800 billion-plus national pension fund could be depleted if a growing number of people depend on it while contributions dwindle.And the country has some of highest rates of gender-based discrimination in the developed world, along with rampant online sexual abuse that domestic legislation has done little to stop. Many South Korean women want the country made safer and fairer for them, but they say their concerns take a back seat in elections, including this one.That didn’t mean young South Koreans were staying home on Tuesday, though. Several young protesters said in recent interviews that they had planned to vote against Mr. Yoon’s People Power Party in an effort to stop it from regaining power.ImageGoh Hee-sung, 24, said he refused to vote for Mr. Lee out of fear that electing him would give too much power to his party.ImageLee Suyoon, 21, who voted for Lee Jae-myung when he first ran for president in 2022, said she felt torn.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesFor months after Mr. Yoon’s failed martial law declaration, some in the party defended him by trying to block his impeachment, prevent his arrest and urge the Constitutional Court to reject a motion to end his term. Young people haven’t forgotten.Kim Yoon-ji, 24, said she wished the presidential candidates had promoted policies to protect women. She cited government data showing that most victims of violent crimes in South Korea were female.Mr. Lee, the new president, has often hesitated to directly address women’s issues. Policies that seek to help women are unpopular among many young South Korean men who view such legislation as discriminatory against them.But Ms. Kim, who attended her first political protest last year, said she saw a vote for Mr. Lee as a vote against the People Power Party.“The party that caused the martial law situation can’t regain power again,” she said.Goh Hee-sung, another new protester, said he had refused to vote for Mr. Lee out of fear that electing him would give too much power to his Democratic Party, which already controls the country’s legislature.But even though Mr. Goh, 24, voted for Mr. Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, he said that he couldn’t bring himself to support the party’s candidate in this election, Mr. Kim. He said he didn’t want to support the party that had defended Mr. Yoon after his martial law declaration.So Mr. Goh voted for a third-party candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the conservative Reform Party. He said he hoped Mr. Lee, the youngest on the ballot at 40, would bring the changes he felt were necessary.“The root of the problem is the deeply entrenched two-party politics,” Mr. Goh added.Lee Suyoon, 21, who voted for Lee Jae-myung in 2022 and joined anti-Yoon demonstrations in December, said she had felt similarly torn.“After seeing the candidates’ campaign promises and the presidential debate,” she said, “there is no candidate who perfectly satisfies what I want in a president.”A correction was made onJune 3, 2025: An earlier version of this article misstated what An Ye-young does. She is a college student, not preparing for the college entrance exam.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT",
