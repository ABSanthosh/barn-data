  "text": "SAN DIEGO (FOX 5/KUSI) — A man was fatally shot by San Diego police in the Stockton neighborhood of south central San Diego Friday morning, the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office confirmed.The events leading to the shooting began around 10:10 a.m. near the intersection of 31st and L street.According to Juan Marquez with the sheriff’s office, police had already been in the area, but additional units responded after a sergeant was flagged down by a man who said he witnessed someone point a revolver at another individual walking past.Within a minute, more than a dozen units were on scene searching for the suspect, who was described as a young man in his 20s.A short while after, the suspect was found inside a parked Ford Fusion near the Bethel AME Church. Marquez said a female companion was in the passenger seat of the vehicle when police contacted the suspect.Per the sheriff’s office, police unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate with the suspect to get him out of the stationary vehicle, although the woman safely exited.When SWAT officers arrived, multiple rounds of less-lethal, pepper balls were deployed into the vehicle in an effort to get him out, Marquez said.After 40 minutes of continued negotiations, around 10:50 a.m., Marquez said the suspect reached from inside the vehicle to point the revolver at officers. Five officers and a sergeant then fired off gunshots, striking him a number of times.The suspect was taken by paramedics to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead around 11:30 a.m.Per Marquez, the suspect did not open fire prior to police discharging their weapons.No additional information about the incident is available at this time. As the shooting involved SDPD, per the county’s protocols on officer-involved shootings, the sheriff’s office will take the lead on the investigation into the incident.Law enforcement is expected to remain in the area for several more hours as authorities continue their on-scene investigation.“No deputy or officer wants to fire their handgun. That’s the last thing they want to do,” Marquez said of the shooting. “We’re here to protect and serve, but there are times that require us to protect ourselves, our partners and the citizens we do protect.”This is a developing story.
