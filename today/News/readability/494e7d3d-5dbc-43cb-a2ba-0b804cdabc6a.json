She said it was a method often used by young men trying to reach the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in north Africa, but added it was less common among those trying to cross the wider stretch of the Alborán Sea between Morocco and Spain.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“There have been similar episodes over the past few years of young men climbing aboard toy [rubber dinghies] or staying afloat using lilos or armbands that they’ve bought in Moroccan shops,” Martín added.Sources in the Guardia Civil police force, which patrols Spain’s borders, told El País: “We didn’t think this would get so much coverage. Depending on the time of year, this can be a regular thing.”According to the International Organisation for Migration, 572 people died last year while trying to reach Spain from north Africa, while 151 people have lost their lives so far this year.",
