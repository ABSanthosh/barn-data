It was intended to give Ukraine high-level encouragement and further support, and also demonstrate President Biden’s strong backing for Ukraine and its Western aspirations a month before Americans choose his successor.The gathering, which draws more than 50 countries, was viewed as particularly important because it was the first featuring heads of state and government. But the White House said on Tuesday that Mr. Biden would remain in the United States because of the powerful hurricane that was hurtling toward Florida and expected to make landfall Wednesday night.American military officials at Ramstein confirmed in an email to reporters on Wednesday that the meeting was postponed. There was no word on when it might be rescheduled.As part of the visit, Mr. Biden was going to meet with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom. Those meetings have been canceled as well, said Steffen Hebestreit, the German government’s chief spokesman.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
