  "text": "ROME — An Israeli strike Thursday hit the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip, killing three people, injuring 10 and causing extensive damage to the religious complex, according to the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, an ecclesiastical office for Catholics in the region.The Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, the parish priest for the Holy Family Church, became well known after it was revealed that Pope Francis used to call him every evening during the war in Gaza.A man and a woman who were seriously injured in the midmorning strike died in surgery at nearby al-Ahly Hospital, according to the hospital’s director of surgery, Mostafa Naim. The patriarchate later confirmed the death of a third person, Najwa Abu Daoud.“The Latin Patriarchate strongly condemns this tragedy and this targeting of innocent civilians and of a sacred place,” it said in a statement. “However, this tragedy is not greater or more terrible than the many others that have befallen Gaza.”It added: “The time has come for leaders to raise their voices and to do all what is necessary in order to stop this tragedy which is humanly and morally unjustified.”Naim identified two of the dead as Foomya Ayad and Saad Eissa Salama. They were Orthodox Christians but were sheltering at the church, according to Kamel Ayad, a spokesman for Gaza’s Greek Orthodox Church.One of the wounded remained in critical condition and two were in serious condition as of late afternoon local time, the Latin patriarchate said. Romanelli was lightly injured.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on X that the strike was the result of a “stray ammunition.” The Israel Defense Forces said an initial inquiry “suggests that fragments from a shell fired during operational activity in the area hit the church mistakenly.”Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, told Vatican News that a tank had fired on the church directly, “the IDF says by mistake, but we are not sure about this.”Caritas, a Catholic charity that runs mental health services at the Holy Family Church, said the building’s roof was hit by a shell about 10:10 a.m., scattering shrapnel across the courtyard below and severely wounding two elderly women sitting inside a Caritas tent, along with others nearby.As shelling and Israeli military operations had picked up in the area over the past week, Romanelli had urged people sheltering at the church to stay inside. If most hadn’t heeded that warning, the casualty count Thursday could have been much higher, the Caritas statement said.Pope Leo XIV said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” to learn of the attack and that “he assures the parish priest, Father Gabriele Romanelli, and the whole parish community of his spiritual closeness.” The pope reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, according to the statement, which was signed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican secretary of state.Netanyahu’s office said in a statement Thursday that Israel “deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit Gaza’s Holy Family Church. Every innocent life lost is a tragedy. We share the grief of the families and the faithful.”An Israeli strike on the Holy Family Church in Gaza City killed at least three and injured several others, including the parish's priest on July 17. (Video: Jackson Barton/The Washington Post)The strike on the Holy Family Church also drew swift condemnation from politicians in Italy, which surrounds Vatican City. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was one of the first to confirm the strike on the church. She said in a statement in Italian: “The attacks against the civilian population that Israel has been carrying out for months are unacceptable. No military action can justify such behavior.”The Israel Defense Forces said it “directs its strikes solely at military targets and makes every feasible effort to mitigate harm to civilians and religious structures, and regrets any unintentional damage caused to them.”Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the results of the military’s investigation would be “published transparently.”The Holy Family Church, located in Gaza City in the north of the besieged enclave, has long been the center of worship for Gaza’s Catholic minority. During the war, it also became a place of refuge, sheltering hundreds of Palestinian civilians — Muslims as well as Christians.Some 450 displaced people were sheltering at the site when it came under attack, Jubran said.The Jerusalem patriarchate for the Greek Orthodox Church condemned the strike as “a flagrant violation of human dignity and a blatant violation of the sanctity of life and the sanctity of religious sites, which are supposed to provide a safe haven in times of war.”The strike “destroyed large parts of the complex” and forced some people with special needs who rely on ventilators to evacuate the area, putting their lives at risk, the statement added.An aid worker in contact with the church said they had provided the GPS coordinates for the entire church compound to the Israeli military early in the war. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Even as Israeli bombing and fighting raged around the church, priests there continued to hold services — and, for a year and a half, gave nightly updates to Francis, the leader of the world’s roughly 1.4 billion Catholics. In the regular video calls, which sometimes took several hours to get through, Francis would ask about the parishioners and would give them his blessing, Romanelli told The Washington Post this spring. Francis died in April.“He never gave up until he reached us and delivered his message” each night, Romanelli said.Video released by Vatican News showed Pope Francis on a video call with the Holy Family Catholic Parish in Gaza on Jan. 22. (Video: Vatican News via YouTube (via Reuters))The close attention from the pontiff made the church famous and drew attention to the plight of Gaza’s civilians as they tried to survive Israeli bombardment, repeated displacement and shortages of food, clean water, fuel and other basic supplies.Francis was an early and outspoken critic of the way Israel has waged its war in Gaza, which Israel launched in retaliation for the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and took about 250 hostages to Gaza. The ensuing Israeli military campaign has devastated most of the Gaza Strip, displaced nearly all of its population at least once and killed more than 58,000 people.After an Israeli sniper killed two women who had taken shelter at the Holy Family Church in December 2023, two months into the war, Francis called Israel’s actions in Gaza “terrorism.” Seven other people were injured in the shooting on the parish complex, the patriarchate in Jerusalem said at the time.Leo XIV does not appear to have kept up the tradition of the regular calls to the church in Gaza, according to a Vatican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Leo has previously called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages.Parker reported from Beersheba, Israel; El Chamaa from Beirut; and Shamalakh from Cairo. Miriam Berger in Jaffa, Israel, and Lior Soroka in Tel Aviv contributed to this report.correctionAn earlier version of this article incorrectly identified one of the deceased as a woman. Saad Salama, who was killed in the strike, is a man.",
