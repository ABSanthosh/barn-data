  "text": "A U.S. citizen who was released by the Venezuelan government last week in a prisoner exchange negotiated by the Trump administration was serving a 30-year sentence there for the murders of three people in Spain, officials familiar with the case said.Dahud Hanid Ortíz, 54, was one of 10 U.S. citizens and permanent residents released by Venezuela in the high-profile swap on Friday. In return, Venezuela received more than 250 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported by the United States to a megaprison in El Salvador.“This person, a Venezuelan and U.S. national, committed a serious crime in Spain and fled to Venezuela,” said one person with knowledge of the case, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. “The Venezuelan courts tried him and, in 2024, sentenced him to 30 years in prison for the three murders committed in Spain.”A U.S. official said the administration had declined previous opportunities to bring Hanid Ortíz home.Hanid Ortíz killed two employees and a client at a law office in the Madrid in 2016 and then set it on fire, a Venezuelan court found last year. He escaped to Germany, where he had served with the U.S. Army, and then to his native Venezuela, where he was eventually arrested.In describing last week’s prisoner exchange, the State Department emphasized the wrongful imprisonment of Americans in Venezuela. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said more Americans had been detained “under highly questionable circumstances without proper due process” in Venezuela than in any other country. Now, he said, “every wrongfully detained American” in Venezuela had been released; he thanked President Donald Trump for securing their “freedom.”The State Department has not released the prisoners’ identities or acknowledged that they included a man convicted last year of murder. Officials did not answer questions about why Hanid Ortíz was released or where he is now.“The United States had the opportunity to secure the release of all Americans detained in Venezuela, many of whom reported being subjected to torture and other harsh conditions,” said a spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the department. “For privacy reasons, I won’t get into the details of any specific case.”Spain was not involved in the prisoner swap, the first official said.When the administration brought six Americans back from Venezuela in late January, a different U.S. official said, the White House provided specific guidance that Hanid Ortíz should not be among them because he had not been wrongfully detained.“We had multiple opportunities to get him out,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. “Our guidance was always to leave him.”Hanid Ortíz was born in Venezuela, served in the U.S. Army for more than 17 years and became a U.S. citizen, U.S. court records show. He was deployed overseas multiple times and was awarded a Purple Heart for wounds suffered in Iraq.While in the Army, Hanid Ortíz was court-martialed and convicted by the U.S. military of larceny and falsifying Army physical fitness training information, medical information, and interviews and recommendations from superiors. He was found to have submitted a false New York City address to receive a New York housing allowance for his family, who were living with him in Germany.Hanid Ortíz was arrested in Venezuela in 2018 as a suspect in the killings in Spain. Authorities found him with three national identity cards, one in his name and two in other names, court records show.A Spanish request for extradition was rejected by Venezuela’s highest court in 2019. Venezuela’s constitution bars the government from sending its citizens abroad to be tried. Venezuelan authorities asked their Spanish counterparts for all evidence in his case and tried him themselves.Prosecutors alleged that Hanid Ortíz planned the 2016 attack after discovering his wife was conducting an affair with an attorney, court records show. Then living in Germany, he concealed his trip to Madrid by enlisting a friend to pose as him back home, they said, dining at a restaurant and swiping into a gym.At the law office, prosecutors said, Hanid Ortíz asked two employees, both Cuban women, to contact their boss about a million-dollar business deal. When the lawyer did not arrive, they said, he killed them with a knife and a blunt object and continued to wait for his intended target, court records show. When an Ecuadorian man arrived to pick up some documents, they said, he mistook him for the lawyer and killed him as well.Hanid Ortíz then set fire to the office to destroy evidence and fled back to Germany, they said, where his friend later revealed the plot to police, court records show.“I did horrible things without wanting to, or whatever. Believe me, people lose their minds — I did,” Hanid Ortíz wrote in an email to his sister-in-law, court records show. “I am responsible for everything, and now I am bad. I lost my mind and stopped thinking. I feel all of this with all my heart, knowing that no one will ever forgive me for what happened.”He was convicted and sentenced last year.Alfredo Romero, the executive director of Foro Penal, said Saturday that one of the prisoners released last week had not been registered with the human rights rights group as a political prisoner.Aaron Schaffer contributed to this report.",
