  "text": "BEIRUT — Israel accused Hezbollah on Sunday of failing to meet the terms of their fragile 60-day ceasefire agreement, due to expire on Jan. 26, threatening that it would be “forced to act” if the militant group’s violations continue. The warning comes days after Lebanon reported to the U.N. Security Council that Israel had launched more than 800 “ground and air attacks” after the ceasefire came into effect.Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said during a visit to troops Sunday that Hezbollah militants and weaponry had not yet moved north of the Litani River in southern Lebanon, as stipulated in the deal.Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem said Saturday that while the group is showing restraint amid Israeli forces’ continued presence and attacks, it may return to attacking Israel if its troops do not fully withdraw from southern Lebanon before the 60-day period ends.“Our patience may run out before or after the 60 days,” Qassem said in a speech. “When we decide to do something, you will see it directly.”Israeli troops have withdrawn and allowed the Lebanese army to deploy in just two of more than 60 areas of southern Lebanon it holds positions in since the deal came into effect. As the deadline draws near, it appears unlikely that the full terms of the deal will be met .Throughout the ceasefire, which has included sustained Israeli military activity in Lebanon’s border villages, the sides have traded accusations of ceasefire violations. The U.S.-led mechanism to monitor the agreement has not made any public comments on what it deems to be violations by either side.",
