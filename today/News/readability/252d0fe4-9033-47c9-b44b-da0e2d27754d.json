Trump’s View of European Allies Raises AlarmDebate is building over just how deep the Trump administration’s antagonism runs, and whether the real goal is to destroy the European Union.President Trump during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Some officials and analysts see the Trump administration as merely indifferent to Europe; others see open hostility.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesSteven ErlangerSteven Erlanger, the chief diplomatic correspondent for Europe, reported from Munich and Berlin.Feb. 27, 2025Updated 11:25 a.m. ETFollow live updates on the Trump administration here.During his first term in office, President Trump described the European Union “as a foe,” established “to hurt the United States on trade.”He repeated the charge at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, but in more vulgar terms: “The European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That’s the purpose of it, and they’ve done a good job of it.”Then he said he was preparing to hit Europe with 25 percent tariffs on cars and other goods.After Mr. Trump’s embrace of Russia and his warnings that Europe had better fend for itself, the president’s latest attack added to the increasing view of European leaders and analysts that he and his team of loyalists consider America’s traditional allies in Europe as adversaries not just on trade, but on nearly everything.Some officials and analysts see the Trump administration as merely indifferent to Europe; others see open hostility. But there is a common view that the fundamental relationship has changed and that America is a less reliable and predictable ally.Mr. Trump has rebuffed NATO and aligned himself with the longstanding, principal threat to the alliance: Russia. Vice President JD Vance has attacked European democracy while calling for the door to be opened to far-right parties. Elon Musk, the billionaire Trump aide, has heaped contempt on European leaders and openly endorsed an extremist party in Germany.Equally shocking to European leaders, the United States this week refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations. It instead broke from its allies and voted with Russia, Belarus and North Korea, all authoritarian governments.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
