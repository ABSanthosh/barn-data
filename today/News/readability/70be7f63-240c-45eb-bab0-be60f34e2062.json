  "text": "Did Elon Musk give a 'Nazi salute'?Elon Musk was seen making a weird gesture as he spoke at the inauguration ceremony at Capitol One Arena which was compared to a Nazi salute by many on social media. As he took the stage, Elon Musk thanked the crowd for Donald Trump's victory and celebrated the new mission to Mars. \"The future of civilization is assured,\" Elon Musk said. \"This is what victory feels like,\" Elon Musk said with a loud cheer. Elections come and go but this election really mattered, Elon Musk said as he also giggled on the stage. \"My heart goes out to you,\" Elon said. \"Can you imagine how awesome it would be when American astronauts take American flags to another planet,\" Elon said. \"I'm going to work my a** off for you guys,\" Elon Musk said amid 'Elon Elon' chants.As Elon Musk thanked the people, he made the questionable gesture which many called a Nazi salute though Republicans defended the gesture and said Elon Musk was just giving his heart to the crown but left-wing interpreted it as a \"Nazi salute\"\"I cant believe that @elonmusk did yhr zieg heil salute as a way of thanking Trump supporters for helping Trump win... what the actual fuck. The fucking Nazi salute. I used to overlook Musk's bs for the sake of space exploration but this, I can no longer overlook the bullshit,\" one user wrote on X.\"Elon just did a full Nazi salute, can’t help himself,\" another wrote,\"The Fake News and their minions are trying to say that Elon Musk did a \"Nazi Salute\" at Capital One Arena. They removed the audio of Elon saying thank you, and he concludes by saying \"my heart goes out to you.\" It wasn't a Nazi Salute. He was saying thank you. This is why you lost,\" one wrote defending Elon Musk's gesture. CNN anchors commented on the salute and said it's not something that can typically be seen at American political rallies. \"It's a salute. It was quick. I think our viewers are smart and they can take a look at that, but it certainly was, it's not something that you typically see at American political rallies,\" the anchors commented drawing flak from Republicans that without telling 'Nazi salute', they suggested that Elon Musk did a 'Nazi salute'.",
