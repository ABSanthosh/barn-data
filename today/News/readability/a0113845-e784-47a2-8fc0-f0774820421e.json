The Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, said the strikes had killed both civilians and fighters.Yet the rebels appeared to continue their advance through Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city, and the surrounding areas, battling pro-Assad forces to capture more territory in Hama province, in western Syria. Russian and Iranian officials stood by Mr. al-Assad in a flurry of statements, phone calls and public appearances on Monday, suggesting that they would continue to prop him up with military and diplomatic aid, as they have done since the Syrian civil war first threatened his autocratic rule in 2011.But it remains to be seen if they can back that rhetoric up by halting the rebel advance, especially since neither have committed to sending ground troops to shore up Mr. al-Assad. Just the fact that the rebels were able to seize a large expanse of government-held territory in a few days showed weaknesses in the partnership that had helped Mr. al-Assad survive years of conflict.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
