In a fiery exchange with an alleged Donald Trump supporter, the Tesla boss dropped the 'F-word' as the conversation around the immigration policy continues to divide the GOP lawmakers and Republican voters. The billionaire was responding to a clip of him shared on X (formerly Twitter), where he discussed the limits of education with the upshot being that one should not \"optimise something that shouldn't exist\".However, after a user named Steve Mackey used Mr Musk's words to push the anti-H1-B rhetoric, the X boss stepped in with a flaming response.\"The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" wrote Mr Musk.\"Take a big step back and F**K YOURSELF in the face.
