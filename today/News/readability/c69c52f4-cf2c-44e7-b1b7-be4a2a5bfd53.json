But just yes or no-is [Trump] planning to annex Canada?\"\"Sure,\" Waltz responded. \"I don't think there's any plans to invade Canada, if that's what you're talking about. But there are a lot of people that like what we have in the United States, and do not like the last 10 years of liberal, progressive governance under Trudeau.\"",
