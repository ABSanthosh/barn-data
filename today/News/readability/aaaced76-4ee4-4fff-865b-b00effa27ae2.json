  "text": "Broadway Boy and his jockey Tom Bellamy go down at the 25th fence while leading the NationalA heavy fall denied Broadway Boy a shot at glory as he led the Grand National but initial fears for his life eased later as he got to his feet and was returned to the stables.Viewers immediately expressed horror at the fall, with animal rights campaigners later criticising ITV for failing to give the incident enough coverage.AdvertisementAfter the coverage had finished, ITV confirmed via their X account that both Broadway Boy and another faller Celebre d’Allen had returned to the stables for further assessment.Broadway Boy had been among several fallers despite a host of welfare-led improvements at the course in recent years. He fell at the 25th fence having led the race throughout.Ben Newman, of Animal Rising, attacked ITV coverage in a press release, accusing the broadcaster of a “cowardly refusal to replay the 25th fence where Broadway Boy fell, while commentators gushed over racing’s welfare standards”.Concern was also immediately raised for jockey Tom Bellamy, who also initially failed to move after the awkward fall. But following extensive attention on site, officials later confirmed Bellamy had “been taken to Aintree University Hospital for further assessment” while Broadway Boy had “walked on to the horse ambulance and will return to the stables for further assessment”.AdvertisementAs a result, all 34 horses had returned to the stables. More will be known on Broadway Boy’s conditions as he undergoes further tests and observations overnight.Celebre D’Allen had also required immediate medical attention before walking on to the horse ambulance to go back to the stables. Safety measures to limit fatalities and injuries have never been greater at Aintree, which have contributed to an overall fall in deaths. But radical animal rights campaign groups seized upon Broadway Boy’s fall to express fresh dismay.Two years ago, the steeplechase was delayed by 15 minutes when animal rights protesters gained access to the course, leading to more than 100 arrests. There were no delays on Saturday and the horses set off at 4pm – an earlier start time introduced as part of the new safety measures. The race was won by Nick Rockett, ridden by jockey Patrick Mullins and trained by his father Willie.This year, the entire festival has seen one horse death, when Willy De Houelle, ridden by former Grand National winner Rachel Blackmore, fell in the second race of on Thursday.",
