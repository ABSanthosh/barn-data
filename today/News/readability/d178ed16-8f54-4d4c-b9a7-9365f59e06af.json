  "text": "President Joe Biden said Monday that a ceasefire and hostage release deal was “on the brink” of coming to fruition, following expressions of optimism from Israeli and Hamas officials over negotiations underway in Qatar.Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, during a news conference with his Danish counterpart Monday, said there is “progress in the negotiations,” adding that “we will soon know what the other side’s position is.”Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, also said that “significant progress” had been made in the talks and that the mediators — Qatar, Egypt and the United States — had presented the warring parties with a final draft agreement. “We are so close,” he said in a message to The Washington Post.Biden’s remarks came a day after he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the negotiations, with the president stressing “the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal,” the White House said.A deal could be completed “this week,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday.High-level meetings were taking place in Qatar on Monday, the government said in a statement, with Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani meeting with Khalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader. The Qatari leader also met with Brett McGurk, a National Security Council official leading Biden’s negotiations, and Steve Witkoff, President-elect Donald Trump’s designated Middle East special envoy, the statement said.Hopes for a long-awaited ceasefire deal in Gaza were renewed over the weekend after Netanyahu sent the chiefs of Israel’s domestic and external intelligence agencies, along with other senior officials, to Doha, the Qatari capital. Netanyahu also met with officials from the Biden administration and Witkoff on Saturday.The first phase of the proposed deal would involve 34 living hostages being released over a 42-day ceasefire, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, according to U.S. officials.Issues that remain unsettled include the fate of the remaining captives and the bodies of those who died in captivity, as well as any planned drawdown of Israeli troops in Gaza — a Hamas demand that has long been a sticking point for Israel.Here’s what else to knowThe Israeli military said it carried out a wave of airstrikes against Hezbollah targets across Lebanon overnight, adding to a growing list of attacks that Beirut says are violations of the 60-day ceasefire agreement. Israel says its operations are in line with the truce. The Israeli military said it alerted a U.S.-led committee that monitors the ceasefire to threats before the latest airstrikes, and attacked when the committee did not act.European Union foreign ministers will discuss easing some sanctions on Syria at the end of January, Kaja Kallas, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, said Sunday. Western governments have resisted lifting sanctions imposed on deposed President Bashar al-Assad’s government, insisting that Syria’s new Islamist leaders show a commitment to an inclusive political transition.At least 47 people were killed in the Gaza Strip on Monday, the enclave’s civil defense force said, with the death toll since Oct. 7, 2023, climbing to 46,584, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.",
