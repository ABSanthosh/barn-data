  "text": "US President Donald Trump and King Charles (AP images) US President Donald Trump will make a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19. He has formally accepted the invitation and will be hosted by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace announced on Monday.President Trump will be joined by First Lady Melania Trump during the visit. This marks the first time a US president has been invited for a second state visit. His previous state visit took place in 2019 during his first term, when he was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth II, the late mother of King Charles.The invitation was personally delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a meeting with Trump at the White House in February. Upon receiving the invitation, Trump called it a “great, great honor” and expressed his excitement about staying at Windsor Castle, saying, “That’s really something.”It is not customary for US presidents to receive a second state visit. Traditionally, presidents serving a second term are invited only for a tea or lunch meeting with the monarch, as was the case for former presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama.Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron was hosted by the King at Windsor marking the first time a state visit had been held in the Berkshire residence for more than a decade.State visits are formal occasions that recognize strong diplomatic ties between nations. Although the invitation is extended by the monarch, it is done on the advice of the UK government.The upcoming visit is seen as part of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s strategy to maintain a positive relationship with Trump and to minimize the potential impact of US policies on the UK.",
