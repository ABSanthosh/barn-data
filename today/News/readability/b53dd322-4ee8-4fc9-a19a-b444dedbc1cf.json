Mooresville Technology Park would sprout between Patterson Farm Road and Rustic Road near Cabarrus County. The park would be just off N.C. 3, also known as Dale Earnhardt Highway. The acreage is 2 1/2 miles from Dale Earnhardt Inc., Earnhardt’s longtime racing headquarters on N.C. 3 in Mooresville. Dale Earnhardt celebrates at Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 16, 1998, after winning the Daytona 500. It was the only major race Earnhardt hadn’t won. An “impeccably preserved” No. 3 Dale Earnhardt race car tops the list of memorabilia his longtime friend and NASCAR team owner Richard Childress is auctioning off to benefit COVID-19 relief efforts. Earnhardt, who was from Kannapolis, died in a last-lap crash at the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 18, 2001. Years ago, when they renamed the state route outside Earnhardt’s headquarters as N.C. 3, state highway officials denied to The Charlotte Observer that it had anything to do with Earnhardt’s famous car number.
