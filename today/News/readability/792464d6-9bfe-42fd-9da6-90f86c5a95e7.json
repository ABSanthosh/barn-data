Whilst no residents of the U.S. Navy housing area perished, eight individuals received treatment for smoke inhalation and minor injuries from the fiery incident.Audio from LiveATC.net revealed the pilot's discussion with regional FAA air traffic control, acknowledging suboptimal landing conditions and considering alternative airports. The pilot stated, \"Doesn’t sound great but we’ll give it a go.\"Despite an official FAA notice about non-functioning lights and awareness of the inoperative weather alert system, the pilot proceeded with landing at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The aircraft crashed approximately 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) from the destination.A power surge disabled the airport's weather system, though the pilot received weather updates from nearby Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, situated 4 miles (6.44 kilometers) northward.The casualties included 42-year-old music talent agent Dave Shapiro, who possessed a pilot's licence and owned the aircraft, two unnamed Sound Talent Group employees, and a former drummer from The Devil Wears Prada.The aircraft departed Teterboro, New Jersey, at 11.15 pm local time Wednesday, refuelled in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego. Unlike commercial flights, private aircraft aren't subject to federal crew rest regulations.San Diego Fire Department Assistant Chief Dan Eddy described severely limited visibility due to dense fog. Former NTSB and FAA investigator Jeff Guzzetti suggested fatigue and poor weather conditions as likely contributing factors.Guzzetti emphasised pilots' obligation to review FAA Notices to Airmen regarding facility conditions. The aircraft struck power lines before losing a wing on a nearby road. Guzzetti noted that even without the power line collision, the low approach in fog conditions could have resulted in a crash.",
