Israeli skies were streaked with a barrage of Iranian missiles yet again on Sunday amid a spiralling conflict between the two nations. \"Iran missiles incoming, sirens heard in Jerusalem,\" the Israel army said, even as several videos showed missiles over the skies of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and several of them being intercepted by Israel's air defence system. Israel launched retaliatory air strikes on Iran, activating air defence systems in the southwest region, as per local media reports.This is the latest round of attacks in the biggest ever confrontation between the longstanding enemies that have killed scores of civilians and raised fears of a wider conflict.The military has said that several sites were hit in Israel by the barrage of Iranian missiles. A huge fire was seen in the city of Haifa after Iran's strikes, as per a post by RT International. Four people injured in the barrage so far, it quoted unnamed Israeli authorities as saying.— RT (@RT_com) June 15, 2025Sirens have been ringing across Israel since 4 pm (local time) on Sunday, marking the first such daylight alert.The scene is not very different in Iran either.

Iran has vowed to \"open the gates of hell\" in retaliation. Several of Iran's more than 200 ballistic missiles fired over the past two nights breached Israel's anti-missile shield. One of its strikes also damaged residential buildings in the town of Bat Yam.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, from a balcony overlooking blown-out apartments, warned, \"Iran will pay a heavy price for the murder of civilians, women and children.\" Six people were killed in the town by the Irani strikes. Iran President Masoud Pezeshkian hit back, saying the country's responses will grow \"more decisive and severe\" if Israel's hostile actions continue.Read | Israel's Multi-Layered Defence Against Iranian MissilesThe FalloutFinancial markets are holding their breath to see whether oil prices surge further when trading resumes on Monday after the weekend, as Israel has hit the oil depot in Tehran and facilities at Iran's huge South Fars gas field, the world's largest, which produces gas for domestic consumption.Oil prices already shot up by 9% on Friday before Israel had struck any Iranian oil and gas targets.Meanwhile, Iran has said the situation at the burning Shahran oil depot in the capital was under control and it told citizens to seek shelter in mosques, schools and subways.",
