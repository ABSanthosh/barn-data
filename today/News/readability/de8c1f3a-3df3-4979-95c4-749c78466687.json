  "text": "In This Article: This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Tariffs remain the story of the stock market right now. Early Monday morning, a 90-day tariff pause between the US and China set the tone for the week in markets. The S\u0026P 500 (^GSPC) closed the week up around 5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rallied around 7%. Both major indexes are now higher than they were before Trump escalated the trade war by pushing tariffs to their highest level in a century. And as our Chart of the Week shows, the US effective tariff rate has been moving lower over the past month as stocks have rallied. At 14.4%, the effective US tariff rate is nearly back to its pre-\"Liberation Day\" level too. So perhaps, taken at that simplistic level, it makes sense that stocks have soared so much in the past month, given that the headwind that sent markets lower has eased significantly. But in markets, the news isn't just about what's said. It's also about how what was said matches investor expectations. On April 2, tariffs negatively surprised as Trump's announcements were, as we wrote at the time, \"worse than expected.\" Well, the latest round of tariff announcements brought up a counter phrase: \"Better than feared.\" In a note to clients on May 9, the day before trade negotiations between the US and China were set to begin, JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli estimated tariffs on Chinese goods could fall to \"at least near 60% for now.\" This would've lowered Feroli's estimated effective tariff rate to 17%. Instead, a 30% tariff rate pushed Feroli's overall tariff estimate down to the 14.4% seen in our chart. This was enough for Feroli to no longer call for a recession in the US this year. Since tariffs are like a tax on the consumer, Feroli reasoned the tariff rollback was equivalent to a $300 billion \"tax cut\" for Americans. \"The rolling back of this tax should provide some relief to consumer spending, and in our modeling is enough to tip the second-half growth outlook from one of modest contraction to one of modest growth,\" Feroli wrote. Goldman Sachs had expected China tariffs to land around 54%. Again, they came in better than expected. For the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs, this was a key contributing factor in boosting the year-end S\u0026P 500 target from 5,900 to 6,100. Goldman also holds a 12-month target of 6,500.",
