  "text": "Here’s what happened at Notre-Dame’s reopening.Five years after a runaway fire devoured its roof, a renovated Notre-Dame Cathedral reopened its doors on Saturday, its centuries-old bell ringing in an emotional rebirth for one of the world’s most recognized monuments and a cornerstone of European culture and faith.“Brothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre-Dame,” Laurent Ulrich, the archbishop of Paris, said before knocking on the cathedral doors. He then pushed them open and entered as a choir sang.It was a carefully crafted made-for-TV reveal at the end of an extraordinary half-decade dash to restore the structure. But it also felt like a rare, solemn and unifying event for the world, and a moment of unalloyed celebration after the widespread anguish provoked by the fire.World leaders, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and Prince William, attended the ceremony, as well as the Trump ally Elon Musk. The cathedral will officially open for the public on Sunday.The ceremony gave the embattled French leader, Emmanuel Macron, a victory at the end of a week in which France devolved into political turmoil, as a bitter fight over next year’s budget resulted in the collapse of the government led by the center-right prime minister that Mr. Macron had appointed.Mr. Macron did not waste the opportunity, delivering a stirring speech of modest length and simple language that described the bravery of firefighters who put out the blaze and the expertise of the craftspeople who painstakingly restored the church.But the French president also described the rebuilding in the grandest terms, evoking universal themes of community, the preservation and propagation of culture, and the transcendence of the human spirit.“Notre-Dame tells us that our dreams, even the most audacious, are only possible through the will of each individual and the commitment of all,” Mr. Macron said. “Our cathedral reminds us that we are the heirs of a past greater than ourselves, which can disappear every day, and the actors of an era that we have to transmit. Our cathedral tells us how much meaning, transcendence, helps us to live in this world.”The prominent faces in the crowd, particularly those of Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, were testaments to the stores of willpower and commitment that may be needed as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine and far-right politicians make waves in the West. Mr. Trump was received cordially by Mr. Macron and other world leaders, despite their concern about whether he will waver when it comes to American support for Mr. Zelensky.Shortly after Notre-Dame caught fire, Mr. Macron promised to rebuild the cathedral in just five years. Some doubted whether his audacious goal was possible, given the extensive damage and the fact that the original construction of the Gothic masterpiece, which began in 1163, took 182 years to complete. But Mr. Macron celebrated meeting the deadline, declaring the cathedral “even more beautiful than before.”Mr. Macron had been set to give the speech outside, before the doors were opened. But those plans were scrapped because of the weather. Some 2,500 people packed into the church, within walls that had gone from gray to gleaming. The cathedral’s massive organ, freshly cleaned, roared thunderously. Classical musicians and the voices of choral singers underscored the ways that a culture can carry across the ages on fingertips and lips.Notre-Dame is a place of great importance for the 29 percent of French residents who identify as Catholic, and in recent days many people were seen praying outside the cathedral and making the sign of the cross.Notably absent on Saturday in a cathedral full of world leaders was Pope Francis. His decision not to attend the reopening was viewed by some in the French press as a deliberate snub. But a message from the pope read at the ceremony said the effort to rebuild the cathedral was deeply encouraging and was a “sign that the symbolic and sacred value of such a building is still widely perceived.”Before the ceremony, Mr. Trump met with President Zelensky and Mr. Macron. Inside the cathedral, the president-elect sat in front, between Mr. Macron and the French first lady, Brigitte Macron. President Biden was not at the ceremony; the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, attended instead, sitting on the other side of Mrs. Macron.Hundreds of thousands of people — many of whom in 2019 watched on video as the fire engulfed the cathedral — contributed money for the reconstruction. In all, some 340,000 people around the world sent in more than $880 million, with Americans forming the second-largest contingent of donors after the French.Outside of the cathedral, thousands of people tried to get as close as they could to the church, located in the middle of the Seine river and considered to be the symbolic center of the French nation. They were joined by a massive deployment of French police, many of whom carried assault rifles and were on alert for the kind of episodes of terror that have struck Paris in recent years.With officers blocking numerous streets leading to the church, many people struggled to get a good look. But for Parisians, the methodical rebirth of Notre-Dame is a story they have watched unfold, day by day, for the last five years.Trump attends the Notre-Dame ceremony, his first foreign trip since the election.ImagePresident-elect Donald J. Trump was in Paris on Saturday for the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesPresident-elect Donald J. Trump made a splashy re-entry onto the global stage on Saturday as he attended the reopening ceremony of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, sitting in the front row between President Emmanuel Macron of France and the French first lady, Brigitte Macron.Mr. Trump was joined by Elon Musk, who is helping run Mr. Trump’s new government-efficiency panel. President Biden, whose international relevance wanes at the close of his term, was not present. Jill Biden, his wife and first lady, took her spot next to Mrs. Macron.Mr. Trump’s first foreign trip since winning the presidential election in November provided a diplomatic undercurrent to the celebration of the cathedral, renovated since a 2019 fire. Before the ceremony, Mr. Trump arrived at Mr. Macron’s office at Élysée Palace, where the men shook hands and briefly hugged. Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, also met with Mr. Macron and Mr. Trump there, where he lobbied for Mr. Trump’s support in the war against Russia.Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump last met in late September, when Mr. Trump was still a presidential candidate. Mr. Zelensky stood beside Mr. Trump silently that day as Mr. Trump told reporters that both sides wanted the Russia-Ukraine war to end, including its instigator, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Mr. Trump was among the last major leaders to arrive at Notre-Dame on Saturday, and when he did, he was greeted with muted applause. Mr. Zelensky had received a louder ovation.What came next was more akin to a scene on the campaign trail: Mr. Trump walked down a rope line of world leaders, shaking their hands one by one, as the largely seated audience behind them watched. Some clutched their phones to record the moment. Afterward, Mr. Trump took a seat by himself, until the Macrons sat on either side of him.Mr. Macron was eager to use the world stage to celebrate his government’s success in restoring the cathedral with a speed that critics had not expected. But the reopening arrived at an untimely moment for the government: Michel Barnier, France’s prime minister, lost a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, leaving it rudderless. Mr. Barnier was forced to resign, while Mr. Macron must pick his successor.Mr. Trump also met on Saturday with Prince William in Paris. Many nations are bracing for a second Trump administration, and some foreign leaders have already made clear their interest in working with the president-elect. Mr. Trump spoke with Mr. Macron by phone at least once as he planned his trip to Paris.In the past, Mr. Macron has showered Mr. Trump with flattery, and he invited him to attend Bastille Day ceremonies in 2017. But their relationship deteriorated in 2018 when Mr. Macron supported the idea of a true European military defense, one that could counter rivals like Russia but also the United States.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOn Sunday there will be a Mass at the cathedral attended by President Macron and about 170 bishops from France and elsewhere, to consecrate the new altar.

As I emerged from the Hôtel-de-Ville metro stop, I saw it: Notre-Dame’s spire was tumbling amid smoke and flames. For an instant I didn’t believe it. The head and the heart refused to accept what the eyes were seeing.Maddeningly it seemed to be occurring in slow motion. Then I turned and saw the vast plaza in front of Paris City Hall filled with people watching. Some were weeping. Some had their arms tightly laced on their chests. All wore grim expressions.A collective gasp arose from the crowd as the spire fell, awful proof that what I was seeing was real.The daylight lingered long enough to allow, cruelly, a full view of the quickly blackening hulk and the flames pouring out of the roof. For hours it seemed as though Notre-Dame might go down for good.Back in The New York Times bureau we waited anxiously for television bulletins from the fire chief, Jean-Claude Gallet, and President Emmanuel Macron.ImageAn aerial view of the fire. Credit...Philippe Lopez/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThere was something of the apocalypse that night.The all-clear was sounded late. Notre-Dame was saved. But the days and weeks that followed the fire confirmed what you only dimly sensed that night. Something essential in the life of the city had been snuffed out. It had been so much a part of daily living, going on nine centuries, that you noticed it only when it appeared to be, suddenly, ephemeral.This or that revelation emerged in the following weeks about lapses, precautions not taken, safety measures that were antiquated. They seemed beside the point. Notre-Dame was now, if not gone, a sad ghost of itself.I avoided looking at it when I was in the vicinity. It had been a kind of anchor all my life, since I first moved to Paris at the age of 3. It was unbearable to see it now as merely a blackened shell covered in scaffolding.Nobody quite believed Mr. Macron when he promised to bring the cathedral back in five years. It seemed one of the grandiose promises he is good at making, and not so much at fulfilling. But the skeptics like myself were proved wrong. The gleaming facade of the cathedral that Mr. Macron reopened Saturday is stunning. Witnessing this feat carried its own tinge of loss, though. The shiny new facade resembles the foreboding soot-covered exterior I remembered from my childhood — Paris still wore its pre-World War II grime into the 1960s — but only just.At a time of dire political trouble for him, Mr. Macron has pulled off a feat of distinctly French ingenuity, with thousands of artisans contributing with devotion and skill.ImageSmoke around the altar in front of the cross, in 2019.Credit...Philippe Wojazer/ReutersThe Frenchness of the moment of the cathedral’s reopening was emphasized Saturday in other less fortunate ways. The heavy police presence, and the officious minders posted at key intersections around the cathedral, all so characteristic of French public life, snuffed out any hope that the “official” reopening might be a joyous public celebration, for the people. The gloomy weather didn’t help. And the sparse crowds along the river banks seemed be largely made up of tourists.Still, my most distinctive recollection of the terrible night of the fire is the ecumenical, multiethnic, multiracial and above all Parisian nature of the crowd of spontaneous mourners who gathered in the city hall plaza. Christian, Muslim, Jew — all of those I interviewed were in shock.This was a lesson in what it means to be Parisian. You live, intimately, with beauty — buildings that, like Notre-Dame, take away the visitors’ breath yet are not taken for granted by Parisians. They are integrated into daily existence. It is only when they are excised, even partially, that the Parisian becomes fully aware of how reliant she or he has become on them.Saturday evening I strolled along the cathedral’s edges in the twilight, kept mostly at bay by the minders, all of them consumed by the importance of the grandees who were about to descend.The few Parisians I encountered expressed pride at the reconstruction. But they also shuddered at memories of the raging blaze. “People had the impression that a civilization was crumbling,” said Luc Sirop, a bookseller along the quai.“I was shocked, really hurt, seeing all that smoke,” recalled Audrey Bonn, a 21-year-old student who was attending a nearby school at the time. “But yes, I’m very, very impressed by this reconstruction,” she said. “It really is a moment of pride.”ImageA screen broadcasting TV coverage of Notre-Dame during the reopening ceremony, Saturday night.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesThe fire damage has been almost entirely been repaired — the vaults are whole, the 19th-century spire and the wooden attic are back and the interior is dazzlingly clean. But the work on Notre-Dame is not completely done, and visitors to Paris should not expect all the scaffolding to come down soon. The lead covering of the base of the spire, for instance, still needs to be finished. It will take years more to fix outside wear and tear that had nothing to do with the fire, like on the flying buttresses. And the area around the cathedral is also being redesigned to stay cooler during heatwaves and to improve the flow of visitors.People often ask me if we know what caused the fire. The answer is: not exactly. The French authorities have uncovered no evidence of arson and say that an accidental cause is most likely, like a short circuit in the electrified bells of the spire or in elevators used by workers. An investigation is expected to be closed next year, but no one has been charged, and a definitive explanation may never be reached.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSégolène Amalia Josefa Le StradicReporting from Paris“The bling-bling — with the heads of states and the guests and everything — is nice and all, but it shouldn’t take a tragic incident to celebrate our heritage.”Atika Hebri, 49, a resident of a Paris suburb.ImageCredit...Ségolène Amalia Josefa Le Stradic/The New York TimesThe archbishop is leaving down the center aisle of the cathedral at quite a clip.

The gesture was simple yet extraordinary.For over five years, the cathedral was fenced off from millions of Parisians, pilgrims and tourists as workers scurried around its scaffolding to rebuild it after the April 2019 fire. So when a small group of reporters was given the opportunity of a behind-the-scenes peek at the cathedral before its reopening this weekend, I didn’t hesitate.With Philippe Jost, the head of the reconstruction task force, leading us one afternoon, we squeezed through a small gap in the fencing onto the forecourt of the cathedral, where we were handed hard hats and shoe protectors. After stern instructions not to take pictures, we were led inside.ImageThe restored altar.Credit...Pool photo by Christophe Petit TessonOver the course of a 50-minute tour, we saw the thousands of metal tubes of the cathedral’s great organ above us; the delicately sculpted choir enclosure; and the side chapels painted in vivid tones of powder blue, crimson and green intertwined with gold.We marveled at the new reliquary for the crown of thorns, one of Notre-Dame’s most precious and venerated relics. The crown, which wasn’t there yet, will be placed at the center of a halo of nearly 400 translucent glass tiles, set in gilded cedar wood that sits on a heavy slab of marble.We gazed at the copper rooster that used to sit atop the spire — and that was miraculously found after the fire. It was on display, still slightly bent and darkened, but will later be placed in a museum.A new gilded rooster, designed by the chief architect, Philippe Villeneuve, now gazes across Paris from 300 feet above. Inside are religious relics and a scroll naming all of the workers who participated in the restoration.One of my colleagues said it was remarkable to see the old cathedral with such a lovely spit shine, particularly because the decay of Gothic architecture has, in recent centuries, been a big part of its charm. The writer Rose Macaulay memorably referred to this fascination with crumbling Gothic buildings as “ruin lust.”ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France, bottom left, speaking in the cathedral at the reopening ceremony.Credit...Pool photo by Ludovic MarinSunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, as Mr. Jost rattled off how France had managed the five-year reconstruction project: a clear objective, an outpour of donations, a widely shared determination to succeed and a gathering of unique skills.There were no visible scars from the fire, no signs, even faint, of when molten lead and charred beams fell through three gaping holes in the stone ceiling.“We ran a marathon on the rhythm of a sprint,” Rémi Fromont, one of the lead architects at Notre-Dame, told us.“It was passion that kept us going under pressure,” he added.The cathedral was rebuilt almost exclusively as it was — same oak attic, same intricate spire, same lead roofing.But Notre-Dame did not feel exactly the same.The thousands of square feet of limestone were dazzling, cleaned not just from fire damage, but also of centuries of accumulated muck. A new, automated and adjustable lighting system adds brightness, with over 1,500 projectors that can shift intensity and color. Chandeliers from the 19th century now have LED candles.It was as though the high-powered vacuums and strip-away latex coatings used by restorers had peeled away not just dirt, but some of the cathedral’s mystery, too.Before the fire, darkened walls and shadowy recesses marked the passing of time. The building felt, well, old.But now random sounds — the low drone of a trumpet as musicians rehearsed for Saturday’s ceremonies, the hurried squeaking of shoes — created a feeling of hushed anticipation, like being backstage before a show.The cathedral was stirring to life.Inside, votive candles had been placed next to credit card terminals for donations. Workers were affixing maps to guide visitors. Staff were being trained on new computers at the welcome desks.A 17th-century statue of the Virgin Mary, moved closer to the entrance to greet visitors, gazed toward the front doors.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTI just glimpsed Elon Musk among the crowd of dignitaries in the cathedral.After a Marian hymn, a psalm and the reading of a short biblical passage, the archbishop addressed the assembly with a homily. Next comes the Magnificat, a hymn of gratitude.In his message, Pope Francis waded into a French debate over whether to charge an entrance fee at Notre-Dame, saying he knew visitors would be greeted “generously and free of charge.” France’s culture minister had floated the idea of a fee to help pay for the upkeep of thousands of churches and other religious monuments. Many belong to government authorities, a legacy of the French Revolution, when the property of the Church was nationalized. Notre-Dame is owned by the French state. But the Roman Catholic Church in France is strenuously opposed to an entrance fee.Ségolène Amalia Josefa Le StradicReporting from Paris“I’ve been walking past it every day for the past three years, and I saw the evolution of the woodwork, which has gradually gone up.

The archbishop is almost in dialogue with the great instrument: he pronounces a series of invocations and the organist responds with a brief improvisation.The organ playing feels almost like heavy metal — low, clashing, emphatic notes.The organists — Olivier Latry, Vincent Dubois, Thierry Escaich and Thibault Fajoles — are showing the full range of the newly cleaned instrument, which looms above us over the entrance of the cathedral.VideoCreditCredit...France Télévisions via Associated PressPope Francis said in a message, which was just read aloud, that the drive to rebuild Notre-Dame was a sign “not only of an attachment to art and history, but even more so — and how encouraging! — that the symbolic and sacred value of such a building is still widely perceived.”There is some very obvious French diplomacy on display here: President-elect Donald J. Trump is sitting in the front row, between President Macron and his wife, Brigitte. On her other side is Jill Biden.We are reaching a key part of the ceremony — the revival of the great organ, an 8,000-pipe instrument built in the 19th century by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, an esteemed French organ builder. It was not damaged by the fire but had to be dismantled, cleaned of lead dust and reassembled.Tuning the organ took six months and was done at night, the only time the construction site was quiet enough. “It was very meticulous work,” Bertrand Cattiaux, an organ specialist who worked on it, told me.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLaurent Ulrich, the archbishop of Paris will sit on a 400-lb. bronze cathedra, or bishop’s chair, one of several pieces of new liturgical furniture designed by the artist Guillaume Bardet. The chair emulates the form of a “curule,” a seat used in ancient Rome to mark a position of authority.As we’ve pointed out, Macron was supposed to give his speech outside, because this is a holy place and not a political one. (We could argue that last point, given that Napoleon crowned himself here.) Many of us were thinking that this moment for him would be spoiled by the rain, just like the opening ceremony of the summer Olympics, when dignitaries sitting around Macron in the stands were shivering in plastic ponchos. Instead, this worked out pretty well for him: he’s inside and dry and spoke in the middle of the cathedral, not far from where French kings were once married.President Macron ends his speech, which was uncharacteristically short. He made no overt mention of France’s political crisis — his government was toppled by a no-confidence vote days ago, he has yet to name a new prime minister and he’s facing calls to resign. His calls for unity and fraternity resonate differently, given that context.Macron said France had set a “course of hope” by deciding to rebuild Notre-Dame “even more beautiful than before, in five years.” At the time, many critics found the deadline overly optimistic, even crazy — a fact that Macron, who is fond of risky bets, likes to remind people of. “We must keep this lesson of fraternity, humility and will,” he said. “The greatness of this cathedral is inseparable from everyone.”VideoCreditCredit...France Télévisions, via ReutersAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMacron is speaking almost in a whisper, starting by remembering the horror of the night of the 2019 fire and how people around the world stopped to watch in shock as they realized that “Notre-Dame could disappear, and this cathedral could also be mortal.”It’s a stirring speech that shoots for “transcendence,” a word Macron just deployed. It must be a welcome moment for a politician who has failed to transcend the nastiness of his country’s divided political moment.After a short cello interlude, President Emmanuel Macron began his speech. He expressed the “gratitude of the French nation” to those who worked to save the cathedral. Today, he said, Notre-Dame is being returned “to Catholics, to Parisians, to France and to the whole world.”“It was heartbreaking for us in Germany to see this on TV.

That Notre-Dame still stands is due in large part to the enormous risks taken by firefighters: They weren’t alerted to the blaze for 30 minutes because of the arcane fire warning system then in place in the cathedral. When they got here, the attic, known as the forest because of the crowded wooden posts that filled it, was burning. After rushing up the 300 steps to get there, they were forced to retreat.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Ludovic MarinOne firefighter told The New York Times afterward that the fire created a deafening blast — like “a giant bulldozer dropping dozens of stones into a dumpster.” They risked their lives, and amazingly, none died in the fire.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA bass-thumping, movie trailer-style clip about the 2019 fire and the reconstruction was just played, and ended with thunderous applause for the workers who contributed to the effort.Notably absent, in a cathedral full of world leaders, is Pope Francis, whose decision not to attend the reopening was interpreted by some in the French news media as a deliberate snub.ImageCredit...Pool photo by Ludovic MarinAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAn embattled Macron gets a needed public triumph.ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France speaking with an art restorer at the renovated Notre-Dame Cathedral last month.Credit...Pool photo by Christophe Petit TessonThe reopening of Notre-Dame provides President Emmanuel Macron with an opportunity to bask in a significant victory, after he vowed in April 2019 that France would rebuild the fire-ravaged cathedral in five years.That bold promise may have been fulfilled, but the country that Mr. Macron leads is spiraling, as a fierce legislative deadlock over the national budget has created some of France’s most intense political instability in decades.This week, his government fell and his handpicked prime minister was forced to resign. On Thursday, a defiant Mr. Macron said he would not step down, and would name a new prime minister in days. And he sought to burnish his statesman’s credentials by hosting a joint meeting on Saturday between President-elect Donald J. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine before the reopening ceremony.But domestic crisis remains. The path to passing a budget — and taking the steps needed to address France’s ballooning deficit — is far from assured in a fractious National Assembly that includes powerful far-left and far-right blocs.If France goes into the new year without a budget, it is unlikely to face a U.S.-style government shutdown. But investors are already selling off French stocks and bonds, raising the country’s borrowing costs.The trouble began brewing in the summer, when Mr. Macron, a centrist, called for a snap election after European parliamentary elections in which the far-right National Rally scored big gains. That snap election was also disastrous for Mr. Macron’s party and its allies, as a leftist coalition that had united against the National Rally won the most seats. But Mr. Macron chose as prime minister Michel Barnier, a figure from the traditional centrist right, infuriating the leftists.Mr. Barnier tried unsuccessfully to navigate the two extremes in the legislature to arrive at a budget deal. His proposal, including a combination of tax increases and spending cuts, landed with a thud, and he stepped down after losing a no-confidence vote on Wednesday.As the drama has played out, Mr. Macron has found himself increasingly irrelevant in French public life. The Notre-Dame project is one exception. On a recent tour of the freshened-up cathedral, Mr. Macron, who is expected to speak before the reopening ceremony on Saturday, called the restoration effort “the most beautiful construction project of the century.”But he and others have much work to do to restore stability to French politics.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThousands of donors helped fund the reconstruction effort.ImageThe scaffolding covering Notre-Dame, in March.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesTo mark the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, the archbishop of Paris will use his cross to knock on the door of the Gothic monument. In response, those inside the cathedral will sing Psalm 121.The psalm, in part, proclaims, “My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.” But help in the reconstruction effort also came from thousands of people around the world, many of whom had watched in horror, some via live video feed, as one of Paris’s great landmarks was devastated by fire in April 2019.While the bulk of the funding for the rebuilding effort came from big companies and foundations, a vast crowd of people contributed as well. In all, more than 840 million euros, or just over $880 million, from about 340,000 donors has poured in since the fire.Most of that money has been used already, and about $150 million will be used to continue work on the cathedral’s exterior, including the sacristy and the flying buttresses, which could take another three years.“At the time of the fire, it was not in great shape,” Philippe Jost, the head of the cathedral’s reconstruction task force, said recently. “You’ll have to get used to seeing the cathedral with scaffolding.”After the French, Americans were the second-largest donors to the restoration effort, giving an estimated $62 million to the cause, according to Michel Picaud, president of Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, a nonprofit that helped lead the international fund-raising effort. Mr. Picaud said some 45,000 American donors gave to his charity alone, with many other Americans giving to similar groups.That largess is a testament to the enduring hold that France continues to have on American hearts. Some people contributed a few dollars, while some U.S.-based organizations gave vast sums, including the New York-based Starr Foundation and the Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Foundation of West Palm Beach, Fla., which donated $10 million each, Mr. Picaud said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTTrump meets with Zelensky and Macron before Notre-Dame’s reopening.ImagePresident Emmanuel Macron of France poses with President-elect Donald J. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine ahead of a trilateral meeting at the Élysée Palace in Paris.Credit...James Hill for The New York TimesPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with President-elect Donald J. Trump in Paris on Saturday, the first face-to-face encounter between the two since Mr. Trump won the U.S. presidential election last month after claiming that he would end the war in 24 hours.Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky were brought together by President Emmanuel Macron of France at the Élysée Palace on Saturday evening, ahead of the Notre-Dame Cathedral’s grand reopening. It was a diplomatic coup for the French leader, who is otherwise facing a political crisis at home after his government fell this week.While it was not immediately clear what was said in the meeting, Mr. Zelensky was expected to press Ukraine’s case to Mr. Trump, amid concerns that his pledge to end the war quickly could leave Kyiv sacrificing substantial territory to Russia and lacking the security guarantees needed to deter future aggression.Mr. Zelensky said afterward that it had been a “productive meeting” and he thanked Mr. Trump for his determination and Mr. Macron for organizing the encounter.“We talked about our people, the situation on the battlefield and a just peace for Ukraine. We all want to end this war as quickly and fairly as possible,” the Ukrainian leader said in a statement, adding that they had “agreed to continue working together.”The meeting appeared to be part of a broader diplomatic push by Ukraine to engage with Mr. Trump’s incoming administration and influence its plans to end to the war with Russia in a way that aligns as much as possible with Kyiv’s interests. Earlier this week, a delegation of senior Ukrainian officials traveled to the United States to meet with several of Mr. Trump’s key appointees.“What is happening now is just the first act of a prelude to the negotiations to come,” Volodymyr Fesenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, wrote in a post on Facebook about the Ukrainian delegation’s visit to the United States.Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky were slated to attend the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, but it remained uncertain until the last moment whether they would meet. They eventually spoke at the Élysée Palace, in what appeared to be a carefully choreographed entrance.Mr. Macron greeted Mr. Trump at the Élysée Palace at 4:45 p.m. local time. Around 45 minutes later, Mr. Zelensky’s car pulled into the palace courtyard. The Ukrainian president stepped out, ascended the red-carpeted stairs, and entered the 18th-century building to join the French and American leaders.They posed for pictures ahead of the trilateral meeting, which lasted about 30 minutes. “United States, Ukraine, and France. Together on this historic day. Gathered for Notre-Dame. Let us continue our joint efforts for peace and security,” Mr. Macron wrote in a social media post which included a picture of them talking under the gilded halls of the Élysée Palace.Then the three leaders shook hands at they exited the palace, heading to the reopening ceremony of Notre-Dame Cathedral.The event had been seen by Ukraine as a chance to press its case to the dozens of world leaders in attendance. Mr. Zelensky said he had met with Karl Nehammer, the Chancellor of Austria, and Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia.Sounding out Mr. Trump on his plans to end the war has been a top priority for Ukraine. These plans have so far been unclear, but officials in Kyiv are concerned that Mr. Trump’s vague pledge to end the war in 24 hours could result in Russia keeping the territory it has captured and ignoring Ukraine’s demand to join NATO as a security guarantee to prevent further attacks.Ukraine’s outreach to Mr. Trump’s team has coincided with an apparent shift in Kyiv’s public stance on peace talks. After years of vowing not to cede territory to Russia, Mr. Zelensky has recently suggested he would consider doing so as a way to end the war, in return for NATO membership. Ukraine, he added, would then seek to regain its occupied territory through negotiations.The change in position has been seen as a way for Ukraine to show Mr. Trump that it is ready to make concessions as part of negotiations. By contrast, Ukraine officials have insisted that Russia didn’t want to engage in negotiations, especially as its troops are steadily gaining ground on the battlefield.Before Saturday’s meeting, Mr. Zelensky had already spoken with Mr. Trump three times this year: in a phone call over the summer, during a meeting in New York in September and in another call shortly after Mr. Trump’s election last month.In an interview with Sky News last week, Mr. Zelensky said he wanted to work with Mr. Trump “directly” and was open to his proposals. “I want to share with him ideas, and I want to hear from his ideas,” he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSee images of the fire and the restoration.ImageNotre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Tuesday ahead of the reopening ceremony.Credit...Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York TimesFive and a half years ago, a horrified world watched as Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris succumbed to a raging fire that spread through its wooden attic, toppled its 300-foot-tall spire and raced across its roof.

The head and the heart refused to accept what the eyes were seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaddeningly it seemed to be occurring in slow motion.

Notre-Dame was saved. But the days and weeks that followed the fire confirmed what you only dimly sensed that night. Something essential in the life of the city had been snuffed out. It had been so much a part of daily living, going on nine centuries, that you noticed it only when it appeared to be, suddenly, ephemeral.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis or that revelation emerged in the following weeks about lapses, precautions not taken, safety measures that were antiquated. They seemed beside the point. Notre-Dame was now, if not gone, a sad ghost of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI avoided looking at it when I was in the vicinity. It had been a kind of anchor all my life, since I first moved to Paris at the age of 3. It was unbearable to see it now as merely a blackened shell covered in scaffolding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNobody quite believed Mr. Macron when he promised to bring the cathedral back in five years. It seemed one of the grandiose promises he is good at making, and not so much at fulfilling. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the skeptics like myself were proved wrong. The gleaming facade of the cathedral that Mr. Macron reopened Saturday is stunning. Witnessing this feat carried its own tinge of loss, though. The shiny new facade resembles the foreboding soot-covered exterior I remembered from my childhood — Paris still wore its pre-World War II grime into the 1960s — but only just.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a time of dire political trouble for him, Mr. Macron has pulled off a feat of distinctly French ingenuity, with thousands of artisans contributing with devotion and skill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"imageblock-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eImage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSmoke around the altar in front of the cross, in 2019.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan aria-hidden=\"false\"\u003ePhilippe Wojazer/Reuters\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Frenchness of the moment of the cathedral’s reopening was emphasized Saturday in other less fortunate ways. The heavy police presence, and the officious minders posted at key intersections around the cathedral, all so characteristic of French public life, snuffed out any hope that the “official” reopening might be a joyous public celebration, for the people. The gloomy weather didn’t help. And the sparse crowds along the river banks seemed be largely made up of tourists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, my most distinctive recollection of the terrible night of the fire is the ecumenical, multiethnic, multiracial and above all Parisian nature of the crowd of spontaneous mourners who gathered in the city hall plaza. Christian, Muslim, Jew — all of those I interviewed were in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was a lesson in what it means to be Parisian. You live, intimately, with beauty — buildings that, like Notre-Dame, take away the visitors’ breath yet are not taken for granted by Parisians. They are integrated into daily existence. It is only when they are excised, even partially, that the Parisian becomes fully aware of how reliant she or he has become on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSaturday evening I strolled along the cathedral’s edges in the twilight, kept mostly at bay by the minders, all of them consumed by the importance of the grandees who were about to descend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe few Parisians I encountered expressed pride at the reconstruction. But they also shuddered at memories of the raging blaze. “People had the impression that a civilization was crumbling,” said Luc Sirop, a bookseller along the quai.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I was shocked, really hurt, seeing all that smoke,” recalled Audrey Bonn, a 21-year-old student who was attending a nearby school at the time. “But yes, I’m very, very impressed by this reconstruction,” she said. “It really is a moment of pride.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"imageblock-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eImage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA screen broadcasting TV coverage of Notre-Dame during the reopening ceremony, Saturday night.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan aria-hidden=\"false\"\u003eDmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"62\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMTZiMWU2NzAtOWQ3OS01MjY5LTljMGUtM2ZhZTk2YjU4NDM4\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"16b1e670-9d79-5269-9c0e-3fae96b58438\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/12/07/world/notre-dame-reopen#16b1e670-9d79-5269-9c0e-3fae96b58438\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/aurelien-breeden\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Aurelien Breeden\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/world/aurelien-breeden/aurelien-breeden-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/world/aurelien-breeden/aurelien-breeden-thumbStandard-v2.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/14/world/aurelien-breeden/aurelien-breeden-thumbLarge-v2.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fire damage has been almost entirely been repaired — the vaults are whole, the 19th-century spire and the wooden attic are back and the interior is dazzlingly clean.

Mr. Zelensky said he had met with Karl Nehammer, the Chancellor of Austria, and Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSounding out Mr. Trump on his plans to end the war has been a top priority for Ukraine. These plans have so far been unclear, but officials in Kyiv are concerned that Mr. Trump’s vague pledge to end the war in 24 hours could result in Russia keeping the territory it has captured and ignoring Ukraine’s demand to join NATO as a security guarantee to prevent further attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUkraine’s outreach to Mr. Trump’s team has coincided with an apparent shift in Kyiv’s public stance on peace talks. After years of vowing not to cede territory to Russia, Mr. Zelensky has recently suggested he would consider doing so as a way to end the war, in return for NATO membership. Ukraine, he added, would then seek to regain its occupied territory through negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe change in position has been seen as a way for Ukraine to show Mr. Trump that it is ready to make concessions as part of negotiations.
