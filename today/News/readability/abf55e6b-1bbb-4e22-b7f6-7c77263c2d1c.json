  "text": "Israel issued the first citywide evacuation order of its current offensive in Lebanon on Wednesday, telling residents of Baalbek in the east to leave. Cars began to snarl narrow roads as thousands of people prepared to relocate.The Israel Defense Forces said later in the day that it had targeted and struck Hezbollah targets in Baalbek. 19 people were killed in the attacks, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The city had not previously been a focus of strikes — a sign that the Israel-Hezbollah conflict could continue to widen.Also Wednesday, Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, delivered his first remarks in the role in a televised address that cut in and out. Qassem assumed leadership of the Lebanese political and military movement Tuesday, after long serving as a deputy to the group’s slain head, Hasan Nasrallah.Speaking before a photo of Nasrallah, alongside Hezbollah and Lebanese flags, Qassem, 71, emphasized the beleaguered group’s resilience and commitment to “the path of war” and the cause of Palestinians in Gaza. “My program is a continuation of Nasrallah’s in all avenues — political, social, jihadi and cultural and the plan of war that the leadership of the resistance put in place,” he said. “Our project is protecting Lebanon and freeing our land and supporting our brothers in Palestine.”The United States has asked Israel to explain a “horrifying” strike on a residential building in northern Gaza that health officials say killed at least 93 people, including 25 children and the family of a Norwegian Refugee Council staffer, according to the aid organization.In the Israeli military’s first explanation of circumstances surrounding the strike, an IDF official told The Washington Post it was targeting a Hamas spotter on the roof and did not mean to destroy the building. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.Here are other key developmentsThe Tuesday attack in the town of Beit Lahia was the deadliest in northern Gaza since Israel renewed military operations there in early October with the stated aim of stopping Hamas from regrouping. State Department spokesman Matt Miller called the attack a “horrifying incident with a horrifying result.”Israel has a “legal obligation to allow humanitarian assistance in and not to erect roadblocks to humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza,” Miller told reporters after Israel’s parliament passed two laws Monday that could seriously impede the work of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that aids Palestinian refugees.The U.N. Security Council said later Wednesday that “no organization can replace or substitute UNRWA’s capacity” in a joint statement signed by all 15 members of the council, including the U.S.CIA Director Bill Burns will travel to Cairo Thursday to meet with Egyptian officials to discuss a hostage release deal, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday.At least 43,163 people have been killed in Gaza during the war and 101,510 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At least 2,792 people have been killed and 12,772 injured in Lebanon, the country’s Health Ministry says. Neither agency distinguishes between civilians and combatants.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 365 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 12Israel issues first citywide evacuation order in LebanonReturn to menuIsrael issued the first citywide evacuation order of its current offensive in Lebanon on Wednesday, telling residents of Baalbek in the east to leave. The Israel Defense Forces said later Wednesday that it had struck Hezbollah infrastructure in the area.The IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, posted a message on X on Wednesday morning along with a map, warning residents of Baalbek, Ain Bourday and Douris that the military “will act forcefully against Hezbollah’s interests inside your city and villages.”The area under the order also includes the ancient Roman ruins of Baalbek, a UNESCO World Heritage site.The governor of Baalbek-Hermel region, Bachir Khodr, called Wednesday for people to flee toward Akkar, Arsal or Zahleh, to the north and east. Writing on X, he said tens of thousands of people were leaving Baalbek. He posted videos of lines of cars in traffic that he said were leaving to the town of Deir al-Ahmar from Baalbek.“Violent raids are currently taking place on the city,” Khodr tweeted.Many people, displaced from elsewhere in Lebanon since Israel’s escalation in attacks in mid-September and subsequent invasion on Oct. 1, had fled to Baalbek.Later Wednesday, Adraee warned Lebanese evacuees not to return to their homes “until further notice” in a statement on social media.Earlier this week, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said that 60 people were killed and 58 wounded in Israeli strikes in the eastern Baalbek-Hermel and Bekaa regions.Naim Qassem, new head of Hezbollah, delivers first address in roleReturn to menuHezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, is delivering his first remarks in the role, in a televised address that is cutting in and out.He assumed leadership of the Lebanese political and military movement on Tuesday, after long serving as a deputy to the group’s slain head, Hasan Nasrallah. Speaking before a photo of Nasrallah, along with Hezbollah and Lebanese flags, Qassem, 71, emphasized the beleaguered group’s resilience and commitment to “the path of war” and the cause of Palestinians in Gaza.“My program is a continuation of Nasrallah’s in all avenues, political, social, jihadi and cultural and the plan of war that the leadership of the resistance put in place,” he said. “Our project is protecting Lebanon and freeing our land and supporting our brothers in Palestine.”He said that the group was open to a cease-fire on “suitable” terms, which he has yet to enumerate, and that he would not “beg for a cease-fire.”“We have to see the impact of the U.S. election results,” he said, referring to next week’s presidential election, along with “the losses of the enemy in the battlefield, the enemy’s inability to achieve its goals.”He said Hezbollah has suffered “painful” losses in attacks on its electronic devices and a “huge blow” in Israeli strikes on top leaders. But he maintained that the group is filling empty positions and is prepared to continue fighting Israeli forces “for days, weeks and months.” He touted the Hezbollah’s unsuccessful attempt to kill Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a drone attack targeting his house.IDF provides first explanation of circumstances surrounding north Gaza strikeReturn to menuThe Israel Defense Forces provided its first explanation Wednesday of circumstances surrounding a deadly strike on a residential building that Gaza officials said killed at least 93 people, amid growing international condemnation.The Israeli military was targeting a person it said was a Hamas spotter on the roof when it struck a crowded apartment building in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza, on Tuesday, an IDF official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. It was not the military’s intention to destroy the building, the official said.An Israeli airstrike hit the building where hundreds of people had been sheltering, and the structure collapsed, local rescue workers said. It appeared to be the deadliest attack on northern Gaza since Israeli troops resumed operations against Hamas militants there in early October. Among the dead were 25 children, Gazan health officials said, and almost the entire extended family of a Norwegian Refugee Council staffer, the aid group said on social media.The IDF official said a man had been seen on the building’s roof monitoring Israeli troops with binoculars, and he was deemed to be a Hamas spotter.The official described the area as “a very active combat zone” and said the IDF had warned civilians to evacuate weeks ago. Tens of thousands of civilians, including elderly people and children, who were unable or unwilling to travel remain in northern Gaza, according to the United Nations.The attack, which came a day after Israel voted to ban the operations of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, prompted widespread condemnation.State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that the United States was “deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life,” adding that Washington has yet to receive a “full explanation” of the strike from the Israeli government. “This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result,” he said.Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, tweeted: “This horrific strike is yet another in a deadly series of recent mass casualty incidents, alongside a massive displacement campaign, that raises serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law.”U.S. inundated with claims that American arms killed Gaza civilians Return to menuThe Biden administration has received nearly 500 reports alleging Israel used U.S.-supplied weapons for attacks that caused unnecessary harm to civilians in the Gaza Strip, but it has failed to comply with its own policies requiring swift investigations of such claims, according to people familiar with the matter.At least some of these cases presented to the State Department over the past year probably amount to violations of U.S. and international law, these people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.The reports are received from across the U.S. government, international aid organizations, nonprofits, media reports and other eyewitnesses. Dozens include photo documentation of U.S.-made bomb fragments at sites where scores of children were killed, according to human rights advocates briefed on the process.Yet despite the State Department’s internal Civilian Harm Incident Response Guidance, which directs officials to complete an investigation and recommend action within two months of launching an inquiry, no single case has reached the “action” stage, current and former officials told The Washington Post. More than two-thirds of cases remain unresolved, they said, with many pending response from the Israeli government, which the State Department consults to verify each case’s circumstances.Critics of the Biden administration’s consistent provision of arms to Israel, now 13 months into a war that has killed 43,000 people, according to Gaza’s health authorities, say the handling of these reports is another illustration of the administration’s unwillingness to hold its close ally accountable for the conflict’s staggering toll.This is an excerpt from a full story.How U.S. elections could shape Israel’s multifront Middle East war Return to menuThe Biden administration spent weeks persuading Israel not to strike oil or nuclear facilities in Iran, fearing it could propel the region into an even more dangerous phase just before Americans head to the polls. After relatively limited Israeli attacks over the weekend, the Middle East appears to have edged back from the cliff.But the reprieve could be short-lived. U.S. and Israeli officials, as well as diplomats and regional experts, see Tuesday’s election as a critical inflection point — with the outcome likely to inform Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions not just in Iran, but in Gaza as well.“There is not going to be any progress on the talks until Netanyahu sees who is going to be in the White House,” said a person familiar with the thinking of Israel’s senior leadership, comments echoed by a diplomat familiar with the matter. Like others in this story, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.Senior Israeli leaders are not of one mind on which candidate would be better for their nation as it navigates its multifront war, the person said.This is an excerpt from a full story.Hezbollah, seeking stability, names new leader after Nasrallah’s killingReturn to menuBEIRUT — Hezbollah on Tuesday announced it had chosen Naim Qassem, a longtime deputy to slain leader Hasan Nasrallah, to lead the Lebanese militant and political movement as it reels from a punishing Israeli military offensive that has eviscerated the group’s senior ranks.Qassem, a 71-year-old Shiite Muslim cleric, was elected to the post of secretary general by the Shura Council, the group’s decision-making body, Hezbollah said in a statement.A well-known figure in the group who often sat for media interviews and wrote books about Hezbollah, Qassem also served as the movement’s public face after Nasrallah’s killing, delivering several televised speeches in which he tried to reassure its supporters that Hezbollah’s military capabilities remained intact and that the group was prepared for a “long” battle with Israel.This is an excerpt from a full story.",
