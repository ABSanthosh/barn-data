  "text": "BRUSSELS — The European Union hit back at President Donald Trump’s steel tariffs Wednesday by approving levies of up to 25 percent on a sweeping list of U.S. products, as the bloc’s leaders attempted to bring Washington to the negotiating table and Trump signaled a new willingness to compromise.While the list of products was not made public, a copy of the E.U. plan circulated to member states and seen by The Washington Post shows it targeted hundreds of U.S. products, including agricultural and industrial goods. On the list are soybeans, meat, iron, steel, home appliances, textiles, tobacco and ice cream. An E.U. official said the tariffs would affect approximately $23 billion worth of imported U.S. goods.The E.U. will start rolling out the tariffs next week, a belated retaliation to U.S. steel and aluminum duties imposed last month. The 27-nation bloc has not retaliated over other U.S. tariffs, including on cars, as well as to a blanket 20 percent duty on E.U. goods — part of a wave of reciprocal tariffs announced by Trump last week on what he dubbed “Liberation Day.”But hours after the new U.S. tariffs went into effect Wednesday, Trump announced on social media that he had authorized a 90-day pause for most countries, with the exception of China.There was no immediate comment from the European Union, and it was unclear how Trump’s latest announcement might affect the E.U. countermeasures approved Wednesday.Two E.U. diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said they had no information beyond Trump’s social media post and that the bloc would seek more details.The E.U. was already pursuing a phased, relatively restrained strategy as its leaders weighed the risk of escalation with Washington and the unpredictability of the American president.After weeks of deliberation across the bloc, the E.U. list, approved Wednesday in a committee vote representing the 27 member states, was pared back slightly from an initial proposal last month. American bourbon was expected to be spared after Trump threatened to counter with a 200 percent tariff on European alcohol, which would have hurt the wine industries of France and Italy.“The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,” the bloc’s executive body, the European Commission, said after the meeting in a statement that again expressed its preference for a deal.“These countermeasures can be suspended at any time, should the U.S. agree to a fair and balanced negotiated outcome,” it said.While the E.U.’s overall response to Trump’s global trade blitz has been measured, the bloc’s opening move Wednesday was calibrated to hit the United States where it hurts.Policymakers said they selected U.S. tariff targets with a focus on products made in the home states of Republican leaders, as well as goods the E.U. might be able to secure from other countries. The aim, they said, was to nudge Washington toward negotiations while limiting the pain for European businesses.The E.U. tariffs approved Wednesday range from 10 to 25 percent; some were initially imposed during Trump’s first term and later suspended. Those would go into force again on April 15.Other measures will be rolled out in stages. A 25 percent levy on textiles, tobacco and many other goods is to take effect May 16. A 25 percent tariff on almonds and soybeans won’t kick in until Dec. 1, according to the E.U. plan, giving the bloc more time to source those products elsewhere “after this year’s harvest,” an E.U. diplomat said.Hungary, led by Trump-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was the only member state to oppose the plan Wednesday, E.U. diplomats said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations.Next week, the European Commission was expected to present steps for responding to Trump’s car tariffs and the 20 percent blanket levy, which Trump appeared to suspend Wednesday. It was unclear how the 90-day pause would impact the E.U.’s deliberations, but the bloc has repeatedly described de-escalation as its top priority.Some E.U. nations had pressed the bloc to consider targeting services from big American tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Meta, while others have advocated for a more cautious approach.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week that the bloc would be willing to offer zero-for-zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods, but Trump said previously that would not be enough to strike a deal. The administration has also complained about other nontariff barriers, including what it describes as stringent regulations on food safety and digital services.European officials describe Trump’s trade grievances as selective, narrowly focused on the U.S. deficit in goods with the E.U. while ignoring America’s surplus in services.",
