  "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday congratulated Donald Trump on winning the US election, praised him for showing courage when a gunman tried to assassinate him, and said Moscow was ready for dialogue with the Republican president-elect. In his first public remarks since Trump's win, Putin said Trump had acted like a real man during an assassination attempt on him while he was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in July. Putin also said remarks Trump had made during the election campaign about Ukraine and restoring relations with Russia deserved attention. Trump said during campaigning that he could bring peace in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected. When pressed by a questioner what he would do if Trump called to suggest a meeting, Putin said he was ready to resume contacts if a Trump administration wanted that, and was ready for discussions with Trump. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, said on Friday that Putin's readiness to talk to Trump does not mean Putin is willing to alter his demands and Russia's goals in Ukraine remain unchanged. According to an interview with Trump published by NBC on Thursday, the president-elect said he has not spoken with Putin since his election victory this week but added \"I think we'll speak.\" reuters",
