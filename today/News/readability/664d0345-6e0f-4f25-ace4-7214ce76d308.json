  "text": "KYIV — President Donald Trump’s phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin has deeply rattled Kyiv and its European partners, intensifying long-held fears that Ukraine could be excluded from peace talks determining its own future and security — as well as that of the rest of the continent.Trump, who spoke to Putin on Wednesday and then phoned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to inform him of the call, said he and his Russian counterpart will try to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, without the Ukrainian leader. Trump clarified Thursday afternoon that the meeting in Saudi Arabia would involve officials from the United States, Russia and Ukraine. “Not with myself or with President Putin, but with top officials,” Trump told reporters.The announcement of the Trump-Putin call, which made no mention of Europe, plays into the fears of European leaders that their defense interests will fall by the wayside if Trump sidelines them in talks with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that it was “premature” to discuss a role for Europe in any talks.The reaction from Moscow, which has in the past maintained a reserved tone toward Trump’s statements, has been practically gleeful since the call. Peskov called the new U.S. position to end the conflict “impressive,” while Russian lawmakers hailed it as the start of a new era in relations. John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, told CNN that “they’re drinking vodka straight out of the bottle in the Kremlin tonight. It was a great day for Moscow.”Zelensky has long insisted that talks to end the war must include Ukraine, and European leaders have said they must include Europe. The Ukrainian president has also pushed for elusive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday in Brussels that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is unrealistic, that NATO membership should not be on the table and that U.S. troops in Ukraine would not be part of any security guarantee. On Thursday, after he appeared to soften his remarks on NATO membership for Ukraine, Trump weighed in on the subject, saying: “I don’t see any way that a country in Russia’s position … could allow them to join NATO. I don’t see that happening.”In Ukraine and Europe, such declarations were widely seen as weakening Ukraine’s stance at the bargaining table by announcing what Ukraine is expected to give up without clarifying what — if anything — Russia might be forced to concede.When asked about possible Russian concessions during a news conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, Trump declined to offer specifics. “Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won’t,” he said. “The negotiation really hasn’t started.”At a NATO headquarters meeting on Feb. 12, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth labeled Ukraine’s aims to recover lost territory and join NATO unrealistic. (Video: The Washington Post)NATO membership was already a distant prospect, rebuffed by the United States and others, and Europeans had quietly acknowledged that Ukraine would probably have to make territorial concessions. So those positions from the Trump team, however starkly delivered at NATO headquarters, didn’t exactly come as a surprise to European officials. Expectations had been low in recent months, with some fearing that Trump — who had vowed to end the war in a day and repeatedly bashed NATO — could abruptly stop all U.S. aid to Ukraine upon his return to office.Still, European officials were caught off guard by the Trump-Putin call and by its coming at the same time as Hegseth’s pointed messages on Ukrainian concessions.One of the bluntest reactions came from E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who said the U.S. administration was giving Russia “everything that they want even before the negotiations.”“If there is agreement made behind our backs, it will simply not work,” she said. “You need Europeans and Ukrainians to implement this deal.”For his part, Zelensky initially reacted to news about the call by trying to assuage concerns that Ukraine had been sidelined and praising his subsequent conversation with Trump as “long” and “detailed.”On Thursday, however, as outrage mounted in the country, he told journalists that “nothing about Ukraine can be decided without Ukraine.” He said there should be a meeting first to decide how to stop Putin and only then “do I think it would be fair to talk to the Russians.” He added that the Europeans should be at the negotiating table as well.Many Ukrainians were horrified by the call, with one military officer describing the United States as an unreliable partner and saying it was “the greatest disappointment from the actions of the United States.”“Your politicians have lost their dignity,” the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. “Ukraine’s betrayal after Afghanistan will have catastrophic consequences for America’s perception in the world.”The continent’s leaders scrambled overnight to insist there should be no negotiations without Ukraine, or without Europeans. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Europeans would be essential to any “emerging order” and should not sit at the “kids’ table.”Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said the call came out of the blue. “This is not how others do foreign policy, but this is now the reality,” she told German public radio. Any negotiations should not “go over the heads of the Ukrainians,” she added.French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said that while the Trump administration had already shared some of its positions in recent months, this was “a real moment of political truth.” He warned that “peace through weakness” could have “dramatic” security implications in the region.Ahead of the call and then afterward in the readout, Putin talked about the need to deal with the “roots” of the conflict. European officials believe he wants to renegotiate the continent’s security landscape.“Let’s not forget, Russia remains a threat well beyond Ukraine,” British Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters.Foreign ministers and officials from several European countries — including France, Germany and Britain — met in Paris on Wednesday night and issued a statement pledging further support for Ukraine.“We are looking forward to discussing the way ahead together with our American allies,” it said. “Ukraine and Europe must be part of any negotiations. Ukraine should be provided with strong security guarantees.”Talks on Russia’s 2014 incursion into Ukraine resulted in an agreement — forged in the Belarusian capital, Minsk — that was never fully implemented and torn up by Russia ahead of its 2022 invasion.Mykola Bilieskov, a Ukrainian political analyst at a think tank linked to the presidential office, said he found it “frightening” that Trump’s team appears to be trying “to do everything in terms of settlement at [the] price of Ukraine, its security, well-being and all else.”Despite talk of concessions by Russia, “we only now understand what Ukraine might be asked to sacrifice.”“Russia would pocket everything and then violate all promises,” he said. “I just can’t understand that people want to repeat the same mistake — placating [Russia] at our cost. … It didn’t work numerous times. Why will it work this time?”Others expressed cautious optimism that the process is only just beginning and still leaves room for Ukrainian involvement.“Trump had to call someone first,” Ukrainian lawmaker Victoria Gryb said. “The situation is not bright, but I just hope that Ukraine’s interests will be respected.” She added that it was still too early to assess potential outcomes of talks.Another lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, said the Trump administration plan to meet Zelensky in Munich suggests that “we are still in the game and still are [a] participant to the process rather than observer.”Still, the parliament is worried by Trump’s apparent willingness to give away potential bargaining chips “without receipt of anything in exchange,” the lawmaker said.“We believe that Trump has very easily stepped back from things that we together could have used in potential negotiations with Russia.”On the front line, similar fears rippled through troops who have spent years defending Ukraine’s territory.“The only thing that can stop Putin, the only thing, is if he simply exhausts himself,” said one company commander fighting near the besieged eastern city of Pokrovsk. “If Trump manages to achieve that, then I believe some kind of ceasefire might be possible. But I do not believe in the end of the war as long as Russia exists in the form in which it seeks to destroy us.”The commander said he still sees room for Trump to grow frustrated with Putin. But he insisted that Ukraine’s sovereignty will not depend solely on Trump’s vision of the country’s future.“Whether the U.S. and Trump help us or not, I understand that we must continue fighting,” he added. “Because for us, this is a question of survival.”Francis reported from Brussels.
