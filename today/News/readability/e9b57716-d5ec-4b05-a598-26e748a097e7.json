  "text": "Mr. David traveled from San Antonio to Houston, Texas to sell his soul for a white BMW, or at least that’s how his car dealer described the transaction on TikTok. After making a $1,000 down payment, David agreed to pay dealer Jo the Car Plug $590 per month for 27 years. In total, David will ultimately pay $191,000 for the vehicle. Don't miss Car insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month Lock in juicy quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10 5 minutes could get you up to $2M in life insurance coverage — with no medical exam or blood test For context, according to the BMW of North America website, a brand new BMW 530i has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $58,000. “You may as well be making a deal with the devil if you’re agreeing to pay for that long, but people know what they’re signing up for,” Jo the Car Plug told Moneywise in an exclusive interview. The used BMW 530i David purchased already has 289,000 miles on it, even though most BMWs typically last between 200,000-250,000 miles. David’s Annual Percentage Rate (APR) — the yearly interest he’ll pay — is a staggering 67%, according to Jo the Car Plug. While long-term car loans typically lasting up to 84 months (or seven years) are not uncommon, a 325-month loan is highly unusual. Here’s what car buyers need to know when choosing the right financing strategy. Buyer beware Even though the details of David’s purchase are eye-popping, he’s far from alone. Jo the Car Plug’s TikTok is full of buyers agreeing to decades-long repayments on used cars. While 84 months is the longest term offered by most lenders, there is no specific legal limit on the maximum length of a car loan in Texas. Many people cannot afford the traditional financing for a car in 60 months or less. Longer loan periods allow for those with limited resources to purchase a car. Even better, low APR offers are still being provided to those with good or excellent credit. Longer car loans spread the total amount owed over a longer period. It’s also an easier way to build credit. But, that lengthy period also allows for more interest to accrue. Additionally, the longer term means your car will likely depreciate before you pay it off, resulting in you paying more than it’s worth. Finally, the other drawback is that there’s more opportunity for you to default on your loan, which could end up with your car being repossessed.",
