  "text": "KYIV — President Donald Trump threatened new sanctions against Moscow on Sunday after Russia launched another massive missile and drone attack across Ukraine overnight, casting further doubt on Moscow’s intentions in an already shaky peace process brokered by the Trump administration.Trump had in recent days appeared to have abandoned the threat of harsh financial sanctions following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 19 in which he touted potential new trade deals with Russia. Trump’s remarks following the attacks Sunday indicated a growing sense of frustration with his Russian counterpart.“I’m not happy with what Putin is doing. He’s killing a lot of people,” Trump told reporters before he boarded Air Force One on Sunday. “I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin. I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him, but he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don’t like it at all,” Trump said.Asked if he would consider more sanctions on Russia, the U.S. president said: “Absolutely.”The latest attack, which killed 12 people, according to authorities, lasted several hours and followed heavy bombardment the day before. It came as Russia and Ukraine proceeded with a days-long prisoner exchange the two sides agreed to during a rare summit in Istanbul this month. Both attacks Saturday and into Sunday were among the largest aerial bombardments of the war in terms of the number of weapons launched.Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that it carried out a “massive” strike targeting military production facilities, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the bombing as “deliberate” and said the strikes hit civilian residential buildings, university dormitories and industrial sites.Ukrainian officials urged Western countries, including the United States, to apply new sanctions on Russia to prevent it from building more weapons used to target Ukrainian civilians. “The world may go into weekend mode, but the war does not stop for weekends or weekdays,” Zelensky wrote Sunday on Telegram. “This cannot be ignored.”Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, said the attacks were “shameful” and a breach of the Geneva Conventions in a post on X. He included an image of Kyiv engulfed in flames, but in keeping with Trump administration policy, Kellogg stopped short of directly naming or blaming Russia for the blitz.“Civilian homes were the target,” said Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, on Telegram, noting that more than 80 residential buildings were damaged and at least 70 people were wounded.Victims spanned the country: Four were killed in the Kyiv region near the country’s north, outside the capital city; three in the neighboring Zhytomyr region; four in the western Khmelnytskyi region; and one in the city of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine, local authorities said. The three killed in Zhytomyr were children ages 8, 12 and 17, Ukraine’s state emergency services said.The Russian assault involved nearly 400 missiles and drones, including nine ballistic missiles that Ukrainian air defenses, already strained and in short supply, failed to intercept, Ukraine’s air force said. Some of the missiles used were North Korean, and the attack drones were almost entirely Iranian-designed Shaheds.The use of such weapons to attack civilians lays bare how Russia has expanded its war on Ukraine by relying on weapons supplied by countries hostile to the West. Ukraine’s partners, meanwhile, have not yet made guarantees to continue providing urgently needed air defenses that could help defend against such attacks, including U.S.-made Patriot systems.Despite receiving some systems from Western partners, Ukraine has never had nearly enough supplies to defend the entire country, forcing it to regularly move its limited systems between cities in an attempt to predict the next attacks. As a result, each night, most of the population is left vulnerable to Russian attacks.Ukraine has agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States, but Russia has thus far refused the plan.Trump had urged the two sides to meet face-to-face in Istanbul earlier this month, and Zelensky said he was even prepared to meet with Putin. Moscow instead sent a low-level delegation, and the talks failed to produce a ceasefire; the only concrete result was the agreement that each side would release 1,000 prisoners. Ukraine and Russia completed the prisoner swap — the largest of the war — on Sunday, officials from both sides said hours after Russia’s attack. The two countries exchanged 120 civilians and 880 soldiers each over three days.After Putin refused to travel to Turkey, Trump claimed that the only way to achieve progress in the war would be by him speaking directly to the Russian leader. The two men spoke for several hours by phone last week, and Russia has since ramped up its devastating attacks across Ukraine.“Russia is slowing down all the processes related to the end of the war in order to kill. We have long been ready to cease fire, but Russia is doing everything to continue destroying people, because Putin likes it,” wrote Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, on Telegram.“Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in Western countries,” he wrote. “Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”Damage was reported throughout the country, including in the west. In Kyiv, the buzz of Russian drones, the steady drum of machine-gun fire and the blasts of air defense systems could be heard throughout the night. Sunday morning, the scale of destruction emerged. An entire street in the capital appeared to have been largely destroyed. The parents of the three children killed in Zhytomyr were hospitalized with injuries, and the mother was in critical condition, Klymenko said.“When the entire world calls for an end to the killing, Putin orders even more strikes, attacks, and murders of children,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.",
