  "text": "Joe Biden and Donald Trump (Picture credit: Agencies)President Joe Biden on Thursday told Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to \"get a life\" after the latter accused him and vice president Kamala Harris of responding slowly and ineffectively to the hurricanes. Biden also said that the federal government is working swiftly to support those affected by Hurricane Milton.Biden had accused Trump of spreading misinformation about the federal hurricane response during a press briefing on Wednesday.When asked if he had communicated with Trump after his statement at the White House, Biden responded, “Are you kidding me?” He then addressed Trump directly, saying, “Mr President Trump — former President Trump — get a life, man. Help these people.”The federal government is actively countering misinformation, which started circulating after Hurricane Helene last month and has continued with Hurricane Milton this week. When asked again if he intended to speak with Trump, Biden firmly said, “No.”The president praised Florida residents for adhering to evacuation orders, stating that their actions helped save lives. However, he noted it’s still too early to assess the full damage from Hurricane Milton. “It’s too early to know the full account of the damage,” Biden said. “But we know lifesaving measures did make a difference.”Biden warned that “very dangerous conditions” still exist in the state and urged residents to follow local authorities' directives. He assured that federal support will continue for as long as needed. “Vice President Harris and I have been in constant contact with state and local officials,” he said. “We’re offering everything they need.”Biden also stressed that the public would hold Trump accountable for making false claims about FEMA's capacity to assist storm victims. He mentioned speaking with Florida’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who confirmed their collaboration, saying, “I spoke with the president this morning…He said he wants to be helpful.”“Those who spread such lies are undermining confidence in the rescue and recovery efforts,” Biden said. “These lies are harmful to those who most need help. Lives are on the line, and people are in desperate situations — have the decency to tell them the truth.”Trump has heavily criticised Biden and Harris, calling their efforts “the worst response to a storm or hurricane disaster in US history.” At a campaign rally, Trump accused Harris of mismanaging the storm response in North Carolina and claimed that FEMA diverted funds to undocumented immigrants.Hurricane Milton left millions in Florida without power, while cleanup from Hurricane Helene continues across the Southeast.With less than four weeks until Election Day, Harris and Trump face a close race to succeed Biden, and disaster relief is a critical issue in key battleground states.",
