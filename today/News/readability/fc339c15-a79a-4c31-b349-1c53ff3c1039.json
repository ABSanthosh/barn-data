  "text": "With the election drawing near, both US presidential candidates are ramping up their media blitz. Vice President Kamala Harris, who has long been criticized for her limited media engagement, is actively working to change that narrative. She has ramped up her media appearances, recently featuring on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and the Call Her Daddy podcast. Meanwhile, former President and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump has also been making the media rounds, appearing on popular podcasts like Flagrant, hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz.Despite all the media appearances people on X were quick to draw comparisons between the candidates. They pointed out that how Trump's podcast appearance on Flagrant gained more views and likes than Harris' Call Her Daddy episode. Trump’s Flagrant interview pulled in 1.5M views in just 19 hours, whereas Harris' podcast episode accumulated 516K views over three days. The Presidential race is tight, as polls show a neck-and-neck fight. A New York Times/Siena College poll, conducted between September 29 and October 3, shows Harris leading Trump by a narrow margin of 49 per cent to 46 per cent—within the poll's margin of error. Harris in her Call Her Daddy interview talked about her stance on abortion rights and reiterated her commitment to fighting for student debt relief. Her appearance mainly targeted the engagement of younger voters, who are expected to play a crucial role in the election, according to her campaign.Meanwhile, Trump’s Flagrant podcast appearance covered a wide range of topics, including surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, discussing his children, and addressing issues like Iran and abortion rights.",
