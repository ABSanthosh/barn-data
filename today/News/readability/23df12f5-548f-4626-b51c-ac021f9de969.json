  "text": "Aboard Air Force One, US President Donald Trump held a candid 20-minute Q\u0026A with reporters during a flight from Las Vegas to Florida. Touching on topics as varied as TikTok’s future, potential changes to Air Force One's colour scheme, and his bold vision for Greenland and Canada, Trump once again made headlines with his off-the-cuff remarks.Changing Air Force One: 'Power blue, not baby blue'Trump reiterated his desire to revamp Air Force One's iconic design, calling the current baby blue \"outdated.\"\"We want power blue, not baby blue,\" he said. \"Everything has its time and place, and we'll be changing the colours.\"TikTok: What Trump said on reports of his talk with OracleTrump addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app facing a potential US ban. While reports linked Oracle’s Larry Ellison to the app's acquisition, Trump denied direct discussions with Ellison, whom he described as a friend. However, he confirmed he had talked with other \"very substantial people\" interested in purchasing TikTok.\"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary,\" Trump said. \"I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"He credited TikTok with helping him connect with younger voters and expects a decision on its future within 30 days.Federal workers back to the officeTrump criticised remote work practices, saying that federal employees must return to their offices or face consequences.\"You have to go to your office and you have to work. Otherwise, you're not going to have a job,\" he said, emphasising that he's not concerned about a potential talent shortage if current workers leave.Greenland and Canada: Bold plans for expansionTrump reiterated his ambition to acquire Greenland from Denmark, framing it as a strategic move for global freedom. \"I do believe Greenland, we'll get because it really has to do with freedom of the world,\" he said.On Canada, Trump suggested that the neighbouring country should become a US state.\"Canada's been taking advantage of the United States for years,\" he said, citing trade deficits and close economic ties. \"If it's a state, the people of Canada will pay a much lower tax, have no military problems, and be much more secure.\"He described Canada as \"a country that should be a state,\" claiming the move would benefit Canadians with improved security, better treatment, and lower taxes.",
