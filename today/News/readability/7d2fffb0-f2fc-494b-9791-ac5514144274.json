  "text": "Steve RosenbergRussia EditorGetty ImagesSpeaking in the Russian Arctic on Thursday, Putin said competition in the region was intensifyingIn Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic circle, President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"strengthen Russia's global leadership in the Arctic\", while warning that \"geopolitical competition in the region\" was intensifying.The first example he gave was Donald Trump's idea to acquire Greenland.But from the Kremlin leader there was no criticism of his US counterpart.And that's telling, as the White House and the Kremlin try to rebuild relations.\"In short, America's plans in relation to Greenland are serious,\" President Putin said in an address to Russia's Arctic Forum in Murmansk.\"These plans have deep historical roots. And it's clear that the US will continue to systematically pursue its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Аrctic. \"As for Greenland this is a matter for two specific countries. It has nothing to do with us.\"So said the president who had launched a full-scale invasion of a sovereign neighbouring country and claims to have annexed whole swathes of Ukraine.When Joe Biden was in the White House, Moscow and Washington were vocal in their criticism of one another.How things have changed.Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselvesWhy Trump is struggling to secure fast ceasefire in UkraineWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?Today Russia is promoting the idea of economic cooperation with the United States in an Arctic region packed with natural resources.\"We are open to considering different investment opportunities that we can do jointly with the US, in certain sectors approved by the Russian government,\" says Kirill Dmitriev, President Putin's envoy for foreign investment and economic cooperation.Mr Dmitriev, who is also chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, has already been in talks with US officials.\"We are open for investment cooperation in the Arctic. That could be in logistics, or other areas beneficial to Russia and to the US,\" Mr Dmitriev adds.\"But before deals can be done the war in Ukraine needs to end,\" I suggest. \"Many people in the West accuse Russia of dragging its feet, showing no compromise or concessions, and just laying down conditions.\"\"I am focused on economics and investments, so I don't comment on political issues,\" Mr Dmitriev responds. \"The only thing I can say is we have a very good dialogue, and I think it's very important that the US is trying to understand Russia's position.\"Watch: Krill Dmitriev in discussion with the BBC's Steve RosenbergMoscow seems confident that it can woo Washington with promises of lucrative deals in the Arctic and across Russia.That confidence is understandable considering how senior US officials have been repeating Kremlin talking points about the war in Ukraine and about Europe.In a recent interview with former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff appeared to accept the results of Moscow-organised referenda that were held in Ukrainian territories seized and occupied by Russia. These votes that have not been recognised by the international community.In the words of one recent Russian newspaper headline: \"US and Russian officials are now talking the same language.\"Are the Russian authorities at all surprised by the sea change in America's Russia policy?\"[In America] there are two parties that compete with one another,\" says Nikolai Patrushev, former head of Russia's FSB domestic security service. Mr Patrushev, who is now an aide to President Putin, is one of the most powerful figures in Russia. While on the side lines of the Arctic Forum he tells me: \"When the Democrats were in power, they took one view. The Republicans have another. \"It doesn't mean that they agree with Russia's standpoint. Only that they have their own, which they promote, and we can cooperate with them.\"I ask Mr Patrushev: \"Do you have a sense that a new world order is being forged?\".\"We used to have a system where two powers dominated in the world. Then it was just one. Now we're building a multi-polar world. But with its own peculiarities,\" says Mr Patrushev.Nikolai Patrushev at the Arctic Forum In the centre of Murmansk, a giant inflatable whale has taken over one of the city's squares. Attached to wires, it's bobbing over a sea of silver balloons designed to look like waves. The balloons are dancing in the wind beneath the blow-up beast.It's a giant installation. But then Russia has enormous ambitions, both for the Arctic and for the country's relations with America.The whale is attracting a great deal of interest with lots of families posing for photos. The giant whale artwork in the centre of MurmanskIt's an opportunity to ask Russians whether they support the idea of economic cooperation with America in the Arctic and whether they're surprised when Washington appears to take Moscow's side?Elina isn't.\"Russia is strong,\" she says. \"You should always back the strong ones and go along with them.\"Elina was among locals who gathered in Murmansk centre\"We need to develop the Arctic,\" Olga tells me. \"Cooperation with 'friendly countries' is a good thing.\"\"And do you see America as a 'friendly country'?\" I ask.\"You know what? I can't decide.\" replies Olga.Meanwhile presidential envoy Mr Dmitriev is singing the praises of one particular American - Elon Musk – and counting on cooperation.\"We believe Elon Musk is a great visionary, a great leader and a very successful person,\" Mr Dmitriev tells me. \"Russia has a lot to offer for a mission to Mars because we have some nuclear technologies which can be applicable.\"There are some video conferences we believe will be upcoming with, let's say, the Musk team.\"",
