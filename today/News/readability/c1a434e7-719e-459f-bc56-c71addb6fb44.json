  "text": "Israel has detained hundreds of health-care workers from Gaza, including at the military’s Sde Teiman detention center, Gaza Health Ministry Director General Munir al-Bursh said Tuesday, as human rights organizations demanded the release of the director of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital.The Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday that it would not comment on numbers published by the Gaza Health Ministry but that “a regrettable outcome of Hamas’ exploitation of hospitals is the involvement of medical staff, including doctors, directly in Hamas’ terror activity.” Israeli forces are “not interested in medical staff vis a vis their roles as medical professionals, but due to their potential involvement in Hamas terror,” the IDF said, adding that individuals “found not to have been involved in terrorist activity are released after questioning.”Live coverage contributors 8U.S. amplifies strikes on Yemen’s Houthis as tensions with Israel flareReturn to menuThe Biden administration directed new airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Tuesday, as the United States and its ally Israel struggle to halt a campaign of regional assaults by the Iranian-backed militant group.U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said the attacks struck targets in coastal Yemen and the capital, Sanaa, including a command node and facilities used for manufacturing and storing weapons. The operations, which also included strikes on Monday, destroyed radar positions and one-way aerial drones, Centcom said in a statement.The strikes mark the latest salvo in a year-long U.S.-led campaign aimed at halting ongoing attacks by the Houthis, a militant group that functions as the de facto government in much of Yemen, on commercial ships and military vessels in nearby waters. The Houthis’ campaign has impaired global shipping and taken a major toll on U.S. allies reliant on related revenue.This is an excerpt from a full story.Winter deepens crisis in Gaza; at least 6 infants dead from cold, UNRWA saysReturn to menuA punishing winter is deepening an already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as aid agencies and local officials warn that the nearly 2 million people displaced by Israel’s war on the besieged enclave have little protection from the elements.Many of the displaced have taken refuge in makeshift tents draped with blankets that offer scant sanctuary from plummeting temperatures, fierce winds and rain. Gaza’s civil defense agency said Tuesday it has received hundreds of distress calls from families whose tents have been flooded.“Our teams can only evacuate citizens from their damaged shelters to alternative locations,” the civil defense agency said, “which are often unsuitable for accommodation, leaving them exposed to the rain and freezing cold in the open.”The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Tuesday in a post on X that at least 100 tents in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip have been flooded. About 500 families living along Gaza’s shoreline are particularly vulnerable to winter conditions.At least six babies have died in recent days of hypothermia, UNRWA said in a separate post, worsening a crisis for Gaza’s children, who the U.N. children’s agency said this year are “disproportionately wearing the scars of the war.”“Blankets, mattresses and warm clothes are sitting outside Gaza waiting for approval to get in,” UNRWA’s post said. “The siege must be lifted.”Hazem Balousha contributed to this report.WHO, family call for release of detained Gaza hospital director Return to menuThe head of the World Health Organization called for the immediate release of Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, who was detained as Israeli forces raided the facility last week. Other human rights organizations, along with Abu Safiya’s family, have made the same demand.Gaza’s Health Ministry said Abu Safiya was among the dozens of staffers detained by the Israeli military for interrogation as soldiers forcibly evacuated the hospital.Israel has long maintained that Kamal Adwan is a Hamas stronghold where militants have been operating. Over the weekend, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman confirmed that Abu Safiya was detained by Israeli forces in Gaza for questioning about suspected militant activity. On Sunday, the IDF said it transferred some 240 Palestinians detained in the hospital to Israeli territory, but it was not immediately clear whether Abu Safiya was among them.Abu Safiya’s son, Idriss Hussam Abu Safiya, said his father was being held in Sde Teiman, a military detention camp in the Negev desert of southern Israel, citing information from released detainees. The Post could not independently confirm Abu Safiya’s whereabouts. Sde Teiman has been the subject of controversy during the war because of legal challenges over alleged human rights abuses.In a statement, Abu Safiya’s family said the doctor has been subjected to “humiliation and mistreatment” in custody. They called on international institutions and human rights groups to lobby for his release.",
