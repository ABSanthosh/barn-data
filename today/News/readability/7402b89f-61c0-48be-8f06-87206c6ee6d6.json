  "text": "The Palestinian militant group Hamas on Friday published the names of three hostages held in the Gaza Strip that it said it would release Saturday as part of a ceasefire deal with Israel, including an American citizen.Israel confirmed it had received three names from Qatari and Egyptian mediators. They include Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, the American Israeli dual national; Sasha Alexander Troufanov, 29, who holds Russian and Israeli citizenship; and Iair Horn, 46, who was born in Argentina. All three were residents of Kibbutz Nir Oz, where they were taken by Hamas fighters during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.The Hamas-run Prisoners Media Office said that in exchange for the hostages Israel was expected to release 369 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Israel did not immediately disclose how many Palestinians would be released.The announcements appeared to resolve a dispute between Hamas and Israel that had imperiled the ceasefire. Hamas said Monday that it would delay Saturday’s release of hostages over alleged Israeli ceasefire violations. U.S. President Donald Trump then warned that “all hell is going to break out” if Hamas did not free hostages by Saturday, threats echoed by Israeli officials.Dekel-Chen had been working in the kibbutz machine shop, where he was converting airport buses into mobile classrooms, when the attack began, according to his family. His wife, Avital, who was seven months pregnant, survived by hiding in a safe room for nine hours with their two young daughters. Two months later, she gave birth to their third daughter, who has yet to meet her father.Dekel-Chen’s release would leave one remaining American hostage in Gaza.Troufanov was taken by Hamas fighters along with his mother, Elena, grandmother Irina Tati, and girlfriend, Sapir Cohen, all of whom were released from captivity in 2023. His father, Vitaly, was killed in the attack.Horn, who is known for organizing Purim parties and managing the kibbutz pub, was taken alongside his brother Eitan, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, in confirming the list of names, declined to say whether the number of hostages being released was sufficient to allay its concerns about the ceasefire deal.Here’s what else to knowThe committee monitoring the ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said Friday that it had conducted “military technical planning” for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon “prior” to Feb. 18, when Israel is required to withdraw, according to a statement from the committee’s co-chair, U.S. Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers. But he seemed to leave open the possibility that the Israeli withdrawal would be delayed, saying that the committee would continue its work toward implementation of the ceasefire beyond Feb. 18.Unknown assailants attacked a convoy of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, near Beirut airport Friday, setting a vehicle on fire and injuring the force’s deputy commander, according to a statement from UNFIL. Lebanon’s government said it was looking for the attackers. “Such an act of violence threatens the safety of United Nations staff who work tirelessly to maintain stability in Lebanon, sometimes at great personal risk,” Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, said in a statement.Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Netanyahu and Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday, Netanyahu and Herzog’s offices said. Rubio’s trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will focus on freeing hostages in Gaza, progressing to the second stage of the ceasefire agreement and countering Iran, spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.Israel has detained at least 380 Palestinians during raids on northern West Bank cities, villages and refugee camps since Jan. 21, when the military launched its longest-lasting raid in the occupied territory in two decades, according to the Ramallah-based Palestinian Prisoners Society. The Israel Defense Forces says it is targeting militants in places such as Jenin, Tubas and Tulkarm. Residents and rights groups say civilians have been killed or arrested in the raids and that more than 40,000 people have been displaced by Israeli military operations in just over three weeks.More than 350 rabbis signed a full-page ad in the New York Times condemning Trump’s call for removing Palestinians from Gaza. Signatories of the ad include several prominent Jewish figures, including comedian and actor Ilana Glazer, actor Joaquin Phoenix and photographer Nan Goldin.",
