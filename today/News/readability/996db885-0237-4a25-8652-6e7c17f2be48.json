And so, there's a convenience factor that's out there,\" the firm's head of research said on CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" this week.This streamlined approach could attract investors looking for ease of access in balancing market positions.Rosenbluth also pointed out the potential popularity of these ETFs.\"I think the ETF adoption is going to continue, even if we have some of these niche-oriented products sitting side by side with Vanguard 500 in a portfolio,\" Rosenbluth said.CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect the Securities and Exchange Commission's filings description of two-stock ETFs.",
