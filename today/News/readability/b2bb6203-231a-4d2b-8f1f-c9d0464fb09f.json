  "text": "Roger Waters is facing possible prosecution after pledging support for Palestine Action, a group that has been deemed a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom.The former Pink Floyd member called Palestine Action a “great organization,” in a video posted to his X account on July 5.“This says, ‘Roger Waters supports Palestine Action, 5th of July 2025. Parliament has been corrupted by agents of a genocidal foreign power. Stand up and be counted. It’s now,’” Waters said while reading words written on a piece of cardboard.“This is Independence Day, July 5th, 2025,” the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame inductee continued. “I declare my independence from the government of the U.K., who’ve just designated Palestine Action a terrorist, proscribed terrorist organization.”Waters then reiterated his support for Palestine before further defending Palestine Action as a peaceful group.“They are absolutely not terrorists in any way. They are a nonviolent protest organization protesting the presence in the U.K. of Elbit Systems, who are an Israeli arms manufacturing organization,” he said. “I support Palestine Action, and I always will because that is the right thing to do.”The United Kingdom banned Palestine Action under its anti-terrorism laws last week after its members broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged planes in protest of Britain’s support of Israel.Following the protest, Parliament voted and proscribed the group as a terrorist organization, Fox reported. The governing body also determined that actions such as “inviting support, expressing approval or displaying symbols” of the group could bring a sentence of up to 14 years in prison and/or a fine.“Roger Waters has a long history of promoting dangerous conspiratorial tropes,” a spokesperson for the Campaign Against Antisemitism told Fox. “His declaration of support for Palestine Action, now a banned organization, is his most legally provocative move yet. We expect the police to take action, and if they do not then we will.”Waters, who has been a longtime supporter of Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, was a co-founding member of Pink Floyd. He served as the band’s lyricist, co-lead vocalist and conceptual leader until his departure in 1985.More music contentRead the original article on MassLive.",
