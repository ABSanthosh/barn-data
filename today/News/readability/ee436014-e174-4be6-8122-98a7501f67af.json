It feels strange, but everything is okay. There’s no family drama. I won’t endorse Harris (or Trump) because I am still a principled conservative, like my Dad was his entire life,\" Meghan wrote on X, quoting Walz's tweet.Last month, Meghan McCain announced she would not support either vice president Kamala Harris or Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the upcoming November election. Her statement came after her brother, Jimmy McCain, expressed his support for Harris. Jimmy McCain, 36, has 17 years of military service and works as an intelligence officer. The late senator John McCain, father of Meghan and Jimmy, passed away in 2018. He was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for over five years. In 2015, Trump faced criticism for his remark, \"John McCain was not a war hero because he was captured.\"",
