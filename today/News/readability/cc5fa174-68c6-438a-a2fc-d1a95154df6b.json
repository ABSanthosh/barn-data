  "text": "JERUSALEM — Israel has begun to airdrop food into Gaza, Israel said on Saturday, as deaths from starvation in the besieged enclave spread this week and international criticism of Israel’s restrictions on aid reached a crescendo.The Israeli military said seven pallets of flour, sugar and canned goods — which appeared to be less than a truckload of food — was dropped Saturday night after a meeting led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior aides. Israeli troops will pause fighting on Sunday to allow for food distribution and assist U.N. agencies in their aid delivery effort, the military said, and Israel will also turn on electricity to Gaza’s only functioning water desalination plant.Israel shut the plant in March, depriving Gaza of the ability to make its own potable water.Aid agencies on Saturday described the airdrops as an inadequate response and an Israeli attempt to whitewash a policy of deliberate starvation. The Israel Defense Forces said Saturday that the airdrops and other measures were “aimed at improving the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip, and to refute the false claim of deliberate starvation in the Gaza Strip.”An Israeli military official acknowledged this week to reporters that Gaza was facing a “lack of food security” but denied there was famine.Still, Israel’s moves amounted to a turnaround in its policy under intense international pressure and underscored the severe humanitarian crisis unfolding inside the strip. Netanyahu’s government began to block food and medicine from entering Gaza in March on the grounds that the previous aid distribution mechanism led by the United Nations was benefiting Hamas — a claim that has been rejected by Western and U.N. officials.An Israeli official said Saturday’s airdrop operation was conducted by Israeli Air Force planes carrying food from neighboring Jordan — marking the first time since the start of the Israel-Gaza War that Israel has directly delivered aid to Palestinians.Israel has been under blistering international criticism for its blockade of Gaza as images of dead and malnourished Palestinian children circulate around the world. In recent days, a growing group of international governments has volunteered to join airdrop missions immediately to relieve the deepening crisis.“Jordan is ready to help the people in Gaza by any means, whether it’s land convoys or airdrops or anything,” said a Jordanian official, who, like others in this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter. “People are hungry.”British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the country was “working urgently with the Jordanian authorities to get British aid onto planes and into Gaza.”“The images of starvation and desperation in Gaza are utterly horrifying,” Starmer wrote Friday in the Mirror newspaper. “News that Israel will allow countries to airdrop aid into Gaza has come far too late — but we will do everything we can to get aid in via this route.”Starmer discussed airdrops in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the British government said. “The three leaders talked about the situation in Gaza, which they agreed is appalling,” the government said in a statement. “The Prime Minister set out how the UK will also be taking forward plans to work with partners such as Jordan to air drop aid and evacuate children requiring medical assistance.”On Monday, more than two dozen mostly European countries condemned Israel’s restrictions on aid shipments and the killings of Palestinians trying to reach food. Macron said Thursday that France would recognize a Palestinian state.Germany and Spain are considering joining the airdrops, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The foreign ministry of France, which has participated in previous airdrops, did not respond to requests for comment.Ahmed al-Farra, director of the pediatric unit at southern Gaza’s Nasser Hospital, said the Ministry of Health recorded four deaths from malnutrition in 2023, 50 in 2024 and 57 in 2025 so far — with 46 in July alone.Airdrops could offer an emergency stopgap to those on the verge of death, aid professionals say, but they’re unlikely to provide more than a small fraction of the daily needs of a population of more than 2 million people.Nearly a third of Gazans had not eaten for several days, the U.N.’s World Food Program said this week. More than 62,000 metric tons of food are required every month to cover basic humanitarian needs, the U.N. said Friday.That’s about 120 trucks per day. Nearly 600 trucks were sent into Gaza in the past week, the Israeli military said Saturday, or about 85 per day.Humanitarian and military analysts say airdrops should be used only as a last resort, in areas that are otherwise inaccessible. It’s unclear what type of aircraft will be used. A C-130 plane can carry about 14 tons of aid; some trucks can carry more than 25.Aside from their cost, airdrop missions earlier in the war were criticized for leaving food in the ocean and crushing people to death. In one instance, a pallet crashed through a roof and killed five.Critics say airdrops could cause more chaos, injuries or death, and it’s not clear why dropping food from a plane makes it less likely to be diverted by Hamas — the concern cited by Israel.Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. agency for Palestinians, said streamlining truck distribution would be far more efficient.“Airdrops will not reverse the deepening starvation,” he wrote on X. “They are expensive, inefficient \u0026 can even kill starving civilians. It is a distraction \u0026 screensmoke. A manmade hunger can only be addressed by political will. Lift the siege.”In March, Israel barred nearly all food and medical supplies from entering Gaza in early March, citing a need to overhaul the U.N.-led humanitarian system.Right-wing politicians in Israel have long criticized U.N. agencies for allegedly aiding Palestinian militants, and calls within Israel to dismantle U.N.-led aid distribution in Gaza grew after Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters attacked communities and a music festival in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 more back to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded with a military campaign that has flattened much of the enclave, displaced nearly the entire population and killed more than 59,700 people.U.N. officials and Western diplomats dispute Israeli allegations that the U.N.-led aid mechanism benefited Hamas and needed to be overhauled. A bureau of the U.S. Agency for International Development has found no evidence of systematic theft by Hamas of U.S.-funded humanitarian supplies, Reuters reported Friday.Israel allowed some aid delivery in late May, mostly through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a new group created by former U.S. intelligence and defense officials in consultation with Israel.But the GHF, which has delivered 90 million meals — or less than a meal per day per person — has been criticized for distributing food only in the far south of Gaza and for operating distribution sites that have frequently seen stampedes as Palestinians fight for food. Israeli soldiers have shot into heaving crowds with guns, according to witnesses. European governments say more than 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food.Israeli military officials say they are reviewing allegations of shooting and acknowledge that its soldiers fire “warning shots” at approaching crowds.For months, Israel and the U.N. have accused each other of being responsible for the food shortage inside Gaza. Israel’s announcement of helping the U.N. distribute food, if implemented, could result in an uptick in overland aid delivery.The World Food Program on Friday released a list of obstacles to its work, including the difficulty of getting spare parts into Gaza for its trucks and the dearth of drivers approved by Israel to carry food into the enclave. The U.N. agency had requested permission for 138 aid convoys to collect cargo from the holding area, it said, but Israel approved only 76. After the trucks were loaded, the agency said, convoys waited up to 46 hours for permission to travel along a few approved routes.“Each delay to aid convoys entering Gaza means more starving people gathering along known routes hoping to intercept trucks transporting food assistance,” the agency said in a statement. “When aid trucks are held at checkpoints or rerouted multiple times, WFP teams and crowding civilians are exposed to significant risk: active hostilities, drone surveillance, sniper fire, and bombardments.”Ellen Francis in Brussels contributed to this report.",
