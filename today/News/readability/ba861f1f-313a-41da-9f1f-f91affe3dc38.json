  "text": "At a time when a volley of celebrities are endorsing Kamala Harris, rapper 50 Cent said he turned down a $3 million offer from Donald Trump campaign to perform at the Madison Square Garden rally. The singer said he was also asked to perform at the Republican National Convention which he had turned down similarly. \"I'm afraid of politics,\" he said. \"You understand? I do not like no part about them. So no gangbanging and no politics!” he said during an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show. 50 Cent has not endorsed either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris but posted long ago that Donald Trump would win the election. “It’s because when you do get involved in it, no matter how you feel, someone passionately disagrees with you. That’s the formula for the confusion that sent Kanye to Japan. He said something about both of those things — and now he can only go to Japan.” Kanye West reportedly moved to Japan after he found it difficult to book venues for his show in the US because of his anti-semitic statements. The MSG rally which was compared to Hitler's Nazi rally of 1939 drew flak for comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's 'joke' about Puerto Rico. \"There's a lot going on. There's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico,\" he said. The joke drew Democrat outrage while Donald Trump distanced from it and said he did not hear the joke. Many GOP leaders took offence at the joke while Trump's running mate JD Vance said people should not take the joke seriously and getting offended at everything should be stopped. Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz said, \"You have some a**hole calling Puerto Rico 'floating garbage' know that that's what they think about you. It's what they think about anyone who makes less money than them.\"",
