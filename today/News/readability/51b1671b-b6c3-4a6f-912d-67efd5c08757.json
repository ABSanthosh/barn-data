  "text": "KYIV — President Donald Trump said Monday that he might travel to Turkey this week for direct talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, but it appeared increasingly unlikely such a conference would happen.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated that he was ready to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday in Istanbul. But Putin, who proposed the idea, has not confirmed his own participation. The Russian leader, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has long cast Zelensky as the illegitimate puppet of a neo-Nazi regime.“You may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkey,” Trump said Monday at the White House. He said he would attend if his schedule permitted. Zelensky welcomed Trump, writing on social media that “all Ukrainians” wanted him there.Ukraine and its allies, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Poland, demanded Saturday that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire or face increased sanctions on its financial and energy sectors.Putin countered early Sunday with the invitation to a summit, to be hosted by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, where the parties could discuss a ceasefire.Trump then endorsed Putin’s proposal, undermining Zelensky and his European allies, who have said the sides should agree on a ceasefire before further talks.European leaders on Monday reiterated their demand that Russia implement a total land, air and sea ceasefire in Ukraine by midnight, but Russian forces continued to attack Ukrainian troops across the front lines, Kyiv said.“Moscow squanders another opportunity to put an end to the killings. This once again demonstrates that Russia’s only goal is to prolong the war,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X. Sybiha met virtually Monday with his European counterparts, who had gathered in London. “We discussed strong steps that can be taken, including sanctions against Russia’s banking, central bank, and energy sectors, combined with new defense assistance packages for Ukraine.”European leaders traveled to Kyiv on Saturday and issued a joint statement demanding the ceasefire. They were acting to pressure Putin after months of U.S.-led talks with the Kremlin yielded no results.“The clock is ticking,” a German government spokesperson told reporters in Berlin. “We still have 12 hours until the end of the day, and if the ceasefire is not in place by then, the European side will [set in motion] preparations for sanctions.”French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in Kyiv on Saturday, warned the sanctions would be “massive.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Monday that “the language of ultimatums is unacceptable for Russia,” and he repeated Putin’s demand that the “root causes” of the war be addressed.Putin called Sunday for the “resumption” of 2022 talks that he claimed were “interrupted” by Kyiv. If there were a ceasefire in the future, he reiterated, Ukraine must not be allowed to rearm. Russian authorities have never suggested they would observe this condition themselves by halting their own military production or imports.The Kremlin claims there are no preconditions for negotiations, but it is demanding that the talks on Thursday be based on the document that Russia proposed in Istanbul in 2022 but was never accepted by Ukraine. The deal Russia offered then was contentious because it would have slashed Ukraine’s military, locked the country out of NATO and blocked future military assistance to Kyiv.That is, it would have left Ukraine unable to defend itself from a future Russian attack.Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told state TV on Sunday that talks must be based on the 2022 document and on what he called the “real situation.”Konstantin Kosachyov, the deputy chairman of the Federation Council, dismissed Zelensky’s offer to meet with Putin. He said the talks should take place at the level of experts.“This is purely just a comedy show,” he told Russian television. “Top-level meetings are certainly not arranged this way, especially in such a complicated situation.”European leaders were noticeably irked by Trump’s Truth Social post breaking with their position Sunday, less than 24 hours after it had been agreed. Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on social media reiterating their demand for a ceasefire before any talks.“We expect Moscow to now agree to a ceasefire,” Merz wrote. “This is essential before beginning a genuine dialogue. Talks cannot begin until the weapons fall silent.”The Trump administration’s agreement to back the allies’ ceasefire demand followed an apparent shift on the war. Vice President JD Vance, who harassed Zelensky during their Oval Office blowup in February, conceded Wednesday that Russia was asking for “too much.”European leaders believe Russia is not serious about peace and that Putin needs to be pressured to end the war.“This is the time for Vladimir Putin to get serious about peace in Europe, to get serious about a ceasefire and to get serious about talks,” British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said during the meeting of European foreign ministers Monday in London.Pope Leo XIV chose Zelensky on Monday for his first public call to a foreign leader. In his first address to the Sunday crowd in St. Peter’s Square, the pope expressed hope for an “authentic and lasting peace” in Ukraine.Zelensky said the call was “warm” and that he had invited Leo to visit Kyiv.Dixon reported from Riga, Latvia.
