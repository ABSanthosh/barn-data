The Finalists Are a Surprise.After an epic election defeat in July, opposition lawmakers have presented their party’s dues-paying members with an unexpected choice of two candidates from the right.Robert Jenrick, one of the two finalists for the Conservative Party leadership in Britain, has appealed to the right by promising to slash annual immigration numbers.Credit...Neil Hall/EPA, via ShutterstockOct. 9, 2024The race to lead Britain’s vanquished Conservative Party took a dramatic turn on Wednesday when it narrowed to a clash between two right-wing candidates, a twist that provoked audible gasps of surprise when the result was announced.After four knockout rounds of voting, the party’s lawmakers left two finalists standing: Kemi Badenoch, a favorite of the right who has said the party needs to fight against “nasty identity politics,” and Robert Jenrick, a rival hard-liner who has promised to slash annual immigration numbers.The choice of two candidates from the right was unexpected, defying the pattern set by the previous round of voting. It set off a whirlwind of theories about how Tory lawmakers, renowned for their Machiavellian instincts, managed to produce an outcome that almost none of them had predicted.James Cleverly, a centrist former minister who was buoyed by a well-received performance at the party’s recent conference, had surged to the front of the field in Tuesday’s voting. But Mr. Cleverly, whose pitch to his party was that it should be “more normal,” was unexpectedly eliminated on Wednesday.Whoever wins will face a prolonged, painful job of rebuilding a party that suffered the worst electoral defeat of its modern history in July — losing voters not just to the victorious Labour Party but also to a hard-right, anti-immigrant party, Reform U.K., and the more centrist Liberal Democrats.The new leader will be selected in the next few weeks by the party’s dues-paying members, who number fewer than 170,000 and are generally older, wealthier and less ethnically diverse than the broader British population. The winning candidate is set to be announced on Nov. 2.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
