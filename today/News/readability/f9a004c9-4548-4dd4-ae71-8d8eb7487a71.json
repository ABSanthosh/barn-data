  "text": "By Giulio Piovaccari, Alessandro Parodi and Inti Landauro MILAN (Reuters) - When 24-year-old Elena Aragon set out to buy a new car, she reviewed a range of no-frills brands in her home town of Cadiz, Spain, including Stellantis' Fiat and Peugeot. In the end, she bought a Hyundai. \"The basic models for Fiat and Peugeot didn't appeal to me. But the more advanced ones, with the features I wanted, were too expensive,\" said Aragon, who opted to buy an i20 compact car with sensors for blind spots and a rear-view camera. \"I got a sweet discount and ended up paying 17,000 euros,\" the instructor at an air traffic controller school said. Aragon's choice highlights a problem that had afflicted Stellantis under CEO Carlos Tavares, who quit abruptly on Sunday: rising prices at its mass-market marques have driven away inflation-hit customers, according to Reuters' interviews with five car dealers, five consumers, two auto industry executives ahead of his resignation and a review of pricing data by market research firm JATO Dynamics. Tavares, who had led Stellantis since it was forged in January 2021 from the combination of Peugeot-owner PSA and Fiat Chrysler, had flattered investors with rapid post-merger cost cuts and boosted operating profit margins to around 13% last year, nearly twice those of rivals Volkswagen and Renault. But his good start ran out after slumping sales and bloated inventories in the more profitable North American market led the group to issue a profit warning in September and later announce he would retire in 2026. While investors focused on Stellantis' well-flagged U.S. travails, the group is however also struggling in its core European region, the Reuters review shows. Under Tavares' leadership, Stellantis lost a third of market share in Europe. Over the same period, Fiat's market penetration in Europe halved to 1.8%, while Citroen's shrunk to 2.2%, data from European car association ACEA show. Stellantis' top investor is the Fiat-founding Agnelli family through investment company EXOR led by John Elkann. The group said on Sunday it accepted Tavares's resignation \"with immediate effect\" and that Elkann would chair a new interim executive committee. Milan-listed shares were down 7% at 0834 GMT, their lowest since July 2022. The European car dealers who spoke to Reuters point the finger at Tavares' focus on efficiency and margins. \"Low price models have progressively gone missing from Stellantis' range,\" says Alberto Di Tanno, founder of dealership group Intergea, which runs 169 outlets in Italy and Switzerland.",
