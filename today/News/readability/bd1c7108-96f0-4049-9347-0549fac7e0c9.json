It remains a key meeting place where major players come together to shape the future of aviation.A Sector on the Rise: $92 Billion Contribution to UAE GDPAccording to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation sector currently contributes US$92 billion to the UAE’s GDP , equivalent to 18.2% of the nation’s total. The Middle East’s commercial aircraft fleet is also projected to grow at an annual rate of 5.1% over the next decade, underlining the importance of platforms like the Dubai Airshow in shaping the region’s aerospace future. The Dubai Airshow continues to maintain its position as one of the largest and most influential global aviation events, attracting leading decision-makers, government delegations, industry innovators, and technology pioneers. The event offers a strategic platform for stakeholders to engage in dialogue, network, and secure a front-row seat to the industry’s next era of transformation.Exclusive Military \u0026 Networking Features: SkyDive Dubai Event and Night ProgrammingMajor General Dr. Mubarak Saeed bin Ghafan Al Jabri, Executive Director of the Military Committee organising Dubai Airshow, highlighted the UAE’s rising prominence in both aviation and defence, according to remarks reported by the UAE’s official news agency, WAM.“With the industry evolving rapidly, the Ministry of Defence remains committed to advancing innovation and building the capabilities that will define the future of the military sector. Supporting and empowering the next generation of talent is central to this vision, ensuring the UAE remains at the forefront of global progress,” he said. For the first time ever, this edition will introduce a runway networking event at SkyDive Dubai, gathering elite figures from across the aviation world. This one-of-a-kind setting will blend informal networking with high-end entertainment including: Drone shows Skydiving performances Renowned DJs Premium hospitality services This exclusive gathering is expected to be a highlight of Dubai Airshow week, offering a fresh take on business networking.
