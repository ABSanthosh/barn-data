He has denied the accusation, which his many domestic and international defenders say lacks merit. If convicted, he could face a decade in prison.On Monday, even as the country came under yet another large-scale bombardment in its grueling war with Russia, Ukrainian security agencies directed dozens of raids on Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Special Anticorruption Prosecutor, saying that Russian intelligence had infiltrated the organizations.And on Tuesday, the Ukrainian Parliament, which Mr. Zelensky’s party controls, passed a measure that gives Ukraine’s prosecutor general, who was appointed by Mr. Zelensky, new powers over investigations by the two agencies. Late Tuesday night, the Parliament’s website stated that Mr. Zelensky had signed the bill into law.On Tuesday evening, thousands of people took to the streets outside the president’s offices in Kyiv, the capital, to protest the moves — the largest antigovernment protests in years.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
