  "text": "DHAKA: Radical Islamist group Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh has warned chief adviser Muhammad Yunus that he will be treated like deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina if the interim govt pushes ahead with implementing \"anti-Islamic\" proposals made by the Women's Affairs Reform Commission. Hefazat leaders also condemned the proposals as being in direct conflict with the Quran and Sunnah. Meanwhile, Khelafat Majlis also called for the abolition of the Commission. \"This is against the Quran and Sunnah and threatens the religious identity of Muslims,\" said secretary general Ahmad Abdul Quader.Hefazat's warning came during nationwide protests triggered by the Commission's recent report, which Hefazat claims goes against Islamic law. Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, \"We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking. They blame religious and social norms for gender discrimination, which is a clear rejection of Islamic law.\" Referring to Yunus, Haque said, \"We have shown him respect, but if he insists on pushing this agenda, we will be compelled to treat him no differently than Sheikh Hasina.\"",
