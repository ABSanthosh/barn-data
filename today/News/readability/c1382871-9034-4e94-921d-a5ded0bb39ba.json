India announced the resumption of civilian flights at over 30 airports in the north of the country, while in Pakistan, the authorities said that all airports were open.The situation along the two countries’ extensive boundary, however, remained uncertain, with tens of thousands of people still displaced. There were no reports of a major breach on Sunday night, the second evening of the cease-fire. But on Monday, brief drone sightings and explosions were reported in parts of Indian-controlled Kashmir.For most of last week, the two countries were engaged in intense fighting that brought cross-border shelling, drone warfare and claims from both sides that they had inflicted damage on the other’s military bases.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
