A few years later, in 1940, during World War II, the pastel was seized by Gestapo, the Nazis' secret police force.Eventually, the Monet was purchased at an auction by a Nazi art dealer and disappeared in 1941.The Parlagi family has spent decades looking for the painting.Also Read: After Mona Lisa, Climate Protesters Throw Soup at Monet PaintingIn 2023, the FBI got a lead when the artwork was listed for sale at a Houston art gallery. The team contacted Dr. and Mrs. Kevin Schlamp, the owners of the artwork, and explained its looted history. Schlamps voluntarily surrendered the piece.Following this, with the help of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, a consent judgment was secured in May 2024. The judgment awarded full ownership of the Monet to the Parlagi heirs.“We are honored to have played a role in returning this stolen artwork to its rightful owners,” said James Dennehy. “While this Monet is undoubtedly valuable, its true worth lies in what it represents to the Parlagi family. It's a connection to their history, their loved ones, and a legacy that was nearly erased,” he added.The FBI's work on this case is ongoing. Several other pieces of artwork were stolen from the Parlagi family in 1940 and the search is on.Video: Environment Activists Smear Paint On Monet Artwork In Stockholm",
