  "text": "Here are the latest developments.An Israeli strike on a residential building in northern Gaza killed dozens of people early Tuesday, the territory’s emergency service said, in the latest attack to cause mass casualties in the area since Israel renewed its offensive against Hamas in the north.The Palestinian Civil Defense, the emergency service, said at least 55 people were killed in the strike in the town of Beit Lahia. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 93 people were dead, including 25 children. The Israeli military said in a statement that it was “aware of reports that civilians were harmed” in the town and was looking into the details. Matt Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman, called the strike “a horrifying incident with a horrifying result” and said the Biden administration had contacted the Israeli government to ask what happened.Israeli forces renewed their offensive in northern Gaza this month, saying they were trying to stem a regrouping of Hamas, the militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparking the war in Gaza.The strike comes days after another Israeli attack on a residential block in Beit Lahia that left dozens of people killed or wounded, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense. The Israeli military confirmed the strike on Sunday, saying that the air force had “conducted a precise strike” targeting Hamas fighters.An overnight Israeli airstrike hit another residential building in the town on Oct. 20, killing dozens of people, Palestinian officials and emergency workers said. Roughly 400,000 people remain in northern Gaza, according to the United Nations, and many have been trapped in their ruined neighborhoods. Here's what else to know:New Hezbollah leader: The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah named Naim Qassem, the group’s longtime deputy, as its new secretary general on Tuesday, replacing Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut last month.Strikes in Lebanon: Israeli airstrikes on Monday killed at least 60 people in the Bekaa Valley, in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials said, in what appeared to be the deadliest barrage of strikes in the area since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah escalated last month.Israel and UNRWA: Israel’s Parliament passed two laws on Monday that could threaten the work of UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, by barring its operations in the country. In doing so, Israel defied calls from the Biden administration, which has warned that the legislation could prompt an even greater humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Israel vs. Iran: Israel and Iran, which have traded major military attacks in recent weeks, exchanged threats and denunciations at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday. Iran’s ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, told the Council that “Iran reserves its inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression.”Polio vaccinations in Gaza stall, and nearly 120,000 children are without the crucial second dose.ImageA Palestinian child receiving polio vaccine drops this month in Deir al Balah, in central Gaza.Credit...Haitham Imad/EPA, via ShutterstockA vaccination campaign against polio in northern Gaza, on hold during Israel’s military onslaught of the area, is leaving nearly 120,000 children with only partial protection from the disease, according to U.N. officials. The deadlock, which has left medical workers there unable to distribute a necessary second dose of the vaccine, gives the virus room to maneuver within Gaza and to spill into neighboring countries that have worked hard to be free from the disease, experts warned.“There is a safe haven for the virus in North Gaza, and that safe haven will remain if you don’t get all the children,” said Dr. Hamid Jafari, W.H.O.’s director of polio eradication for the eastern Mediterranean region.If the virus circulates in northern Gaza, even those who are vaccinated — including Israeli soldiers or aid workers — could become infected at little risk to themselves, but might ferry the pathogen outside of Gaza. “That’s the risk,” Dr. Jafari said.United Nations agencies are trying to estimate what percent of the partially immunized children in northern Gaza may come into Gaza City, and whether the conditions there will be conducive to a vaccination campaign. If 75 to 80 percent of the children end up in Gaza City, inoculations there could begin as early as next week, Dr. Jafari said.Immunization rates in Gaza had hovered around 99 percent before the war but dropped to about 86 percent by mid-2024.Aid agencies sought to start a vaccination campaign after traces of poliovirus were found in wastewater in July, and a 10-month-old boy was confirmed in August to be the first Gaza resident to be paralyzed by poliovirus in 25 years.In September, temporary pauses in the war, agreed to by Israel and Hamas, allowed aid workers to immunize about 640,000 children under 10 who were at risk of the disease. The campaign began in central Gaza, moved to the south and ended in the northern area.A second round of inoculations, intended to be given within six weeks after the first, proceeded in the central and southern regions, but renewed military activity made it impossible in the north.In recent days, Israeli forces have pounded Jabaliya, a town in northern Gaza, killing dozens of people, according to a Palestinian emergency services group. It also struck a large residential building in Beit Lahia, killing dozens.No U.N. aid has reached the north since early last week and telecommunications with the area were cut, so it was not possible to speak to U.N. staff who were trapped there, according to Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for UNRWA, the U.N. agency that provides aid to Palestinians.“It is impossible to vaccinate children when the skies are full of airstrikes and during a military campaign,” Ms. Touma said.The Israel Defense Forces and COGAT, the Israeli agency that coordinates policy in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Friday that it was working to facilitate the administration of second doses to children in northern Gaza.To halt the movement of the polio virus, at least 80 percent of the population must be fully protected, through either prior illness or vaccination.The campaign in Gaza has relied on delivering two drops of an oral vaccine, which contains a weakened version of the poliovirus. The oral vaccine produces immunity in the intestines, where the virus replicates, and effectively stops the pathogen from spreading to others.To prevent the virus from finding a foothold, ideally all children who need the vaccine would be immunized at once, Dr. Jafari said.“When you do it everywhere, the virus has nowhere to go,” he added.A single dose provides some protection from the virus, and a second dose would boost immunity in the intestines. It might also reach children who were missed the first time or who did not respond adequately to the first dose.What are the implications of new Israeli laws banning UNRWA?ImagePalestinians lined up for medicine on Tuesday at an UNRWA health center in Khan Younis, Gaza, that operates with support from Japan, one of the U.N. agency’s top funders.Credit...Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesMany humanitarian agencies have expressed fears that two measures enacted in Israel on Monday that ban UNRWA, the U.N. agency aiding Palestinians, from operating in the country could cripple its aid deliveries. The aid has never been more urgently needed. Almost all of Gaza’s 2.2 million people have been displaced over more than a year of war, and face acute and sometimes catastrophic malnutrition. The laws are to go into full effect in 90 days, and will almost certainly create new hurdles for the agency, formally the United Nations Relief Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees. The agency also works with Palestinians in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Lebanon and Syria. Legal scholars, diplomats and aid workers were assessing the new laws’ implications on Tuesday. What was clear was that they could create new diplomatic challenges for Israel, with several European governments condemning their passage and the United States — a top UNRWA funder — being on record against the measures. Here’s a look at the laws and what might happen next.What do the laws say?The 120-seat Knesset passed two bills with overwhelming majorities late on Monday, the first day of its winter session.The first effectively revokes UNRWA’s invitation, first extended in 1967, to operate within Israel. The legislation says that the foreign minister, Israel Katz, will notify the United Nations of this no more than one week after the bill’s passage. It says that “no Israeli government agencies or representatives may have any contact” with the agency.It also instructs the foreign minister to write an order that effectively excludes UNRWA from the immunities and privileges that apply to other U.N. agencies, which include immunity from prosecution for its staff.The second bill prohibits UNRWA from “operating any mission, providing any service or conducting any activity, either directly or indirectly, within Israel’s sovereign territory.” An explanatory note says that Israel will stop UNRWA’s activities within its territory. Passage of the laws ends the parliamentary process and effectively sets the 90-day clock ticking.What is UNRWA’s mission?UNRWA was set up in 1949 to assist Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, during which Israel declared itself a state. In the absence of any solution to the territorial conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the agency’s mandate has repeatedly been extended — the latest taking it to June 2026. The agency is a major employer and provides health care, food, emergency loans, housing assistance and education for millions of Palestinians. Why did the Knesset pass the laws?For decades, the agency has been a target for some Israeli politicians who argue that its work on behalf of Palestinians further perpetuates the territorial conflict.Those accusations sharpened in January, when the government accused a handful of the agency’s 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel last year that triggered the war. One member of the Knesset, Dan Illouz, said it was a “historic law,” and a “crucial measure in the global fight against terror.” UNRWA is “not an innocent humanitarian organization, as it pretends to be,” he said, adding that it “cooperates” with Hamas — a view that is shared by other supporters of the legislation and that is also widespread, though not universal, within Israeli society.More than 230 UNRWA workers have been killed in Gaza during the war, the United Nations has said.Ibrahim Dalalsha, director of the Horizon Center, a political analysis group in Ramallah, West Bank, argued that the legislation’s passage in part reflected the influence of the far right in Israeli politics, which is hostile to any two-state solution.How will the laws be applied?At first glance, the laws aim to stop UNRWA from operating in its “sovereign territory,” which to Israelis includes East Jerusalem, an area it annexed in 1967 in a move that many other countries do not recognize as legal. But proponents made clear that the laws also intend to keep UNRWA from functioning in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. How the laws are implemented may depend on several factors. And their constitutionality could be challenged in the country’s courts.The legislation also leaves many details unaddressed, including precisely how it should be put into effect and what the penalties would be for violations. That creates potential space for the government to tailor its implementation.“The legislative process is over, but the way that the laws are drafted leaves room for interpretation and for the government to decide how to implement them,” said Eran Shamir-Borer, the director of the Israel Democracy Institute’s Center for Security and Democracy.“Under Israeli constitutional law, to the extent possible, parliamentary legislation should be interpreted in such a way that it coincides with Israel’s international legal obligations,” he said, adding that nothing in the language of the legislation itself contradicted international law.How will the legislation affect UNRWA?UNRWA said on Tuesday that the legislation carried “no implications at the immediate level,” apparently referring to the 90-day window before most of the provisions go into effect, and that the agency would continue its work.“Across the region, we continue business as usual,” said Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the agency. “We will not abandon the people who depend on us for sheer survival.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on social media on Monday that it was essential that “sustained humanitarian aid” remain available in Gaza. He gave no details of how that should be accomplished. But Mr. Netanyahu’s office released a statement saying that the government was ready to work with “our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel’s security.”Aid agencies accuse Israel of severely restricting the amount of aid that comes into Gaza, something Israel denies. They also say that there are no ready alternatives to UNRWA’s network of staff, know-how and command of logistics.A joint statement on Sunday from several countries, including Japan, Britain and South Korea, said that UNRWA and other U.N. organizations needed to be able to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need.Humanitarian agencies fear the worst. Amnesty International, for example, said that the legislation would be catastrophic and that it would effectively be a “death sentence” for civilians in Gaza who rely on the aid.What is the diplomatic fallout?Several European governments immediately criticized the legislation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain reminded Israel that it had international obligations to ensure that sufficient aid reached civilians in Gaza. A special session of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday was dominated by criticism of the Israeli move, including from Israeli allies. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said that “we have concerns about this legislation being implemented,” saying that “right now, there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza.”The Biden administration has clearly opposed the bills. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken expressed deep concern about the bills in a letter to senior Israeli officials, warning that failure to allow the delivery of aid to Gaza could trigger a cutoff of U.S. military support. The letter urged the officials to take all possible steps, including using the authority of the prime minister’s office, to ensure that the legislation did not come to pass.But the full force of the laws will come after the U.S. presidential election and the inauguration of the winner, scheduled for Jan. 20, 2025. It could thus fall to the new president to determine the U.S. stance on application of the laws. The United States has long been one of the largest funders of UNRWA. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has expressed strong support for Israel’s self-defense but also profound concerns about civilian suffering in Gaza. Former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, recently accused President Biden of trying to hold back Mr. Netanyahu in his wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In 2018, as president, Mr. Trump stopped all U.S. funding for UNRWA, which his Democratic successor, Mr. Biden, restored in 2021.Farnaz Fassihi contributed reporting. Aid agencies have reacted strongly to the Israeli move to ban the U.N. Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, from operating within Israel, which is expected to have powerful implications regarding its ability to function within Gaza. Louis Charbonneau, the U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, released a statement on Tuesday saying that the move was “not only unjustified but risks expanding Israeli authorities’ use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, a war crime.” International aid agencies and rights groups have said that UNRWA provides lifesaving aid, shelter, schools and hospitals to millions of Palestinians. Civil defense rescuers searched for survivors trapped under rubble in the village of Haret Saida, near Lebanon’s southern city of Sidon, after a strike on Tuesday night. The Public Health Emergency Operations Center issued a statement saying that its preliminary toll was five dead and 33 injured.ImageCredit...Ali Hankir/ReutersImageCredit...EPA, via ShutterstockLebanon’s Ministry of Public Health said on Tuesday night that 82 people had been killed and 180 wounded in Israeli attacks on Monday. That took its total to more than 2,790 people killed and more than 12,770 wounded in Lebanon during the renewed hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel that began last year, alongside the war with Hamas in Gaza. The vast majority of the casualties stem from Israel’s intensified attacks in southern Lebanon starting in September.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., sharply criticized Israel for not allowing sufficient humanitarian aid and food to cross into Gaza and said there was no alternative to UNRWA at this critical time, when so many Palestinians were suffering. “We know that right now, there is no alternative to UNRWA when it comes to delivering food and other life-saving aid in Gaza,” she said. “Therefore, we have concerns about this legislation being implemented.”ImageCredit...Kena Betancur/Associated PressThe United Nations Security Council has convened a session on humanitarian aid in Gaza at which the dominant topic is Israel's enactment of two laws banning UNRWA, the U.N. agency aiding Palestinians. At least 56 countries are scheduled to speak on Tuesday, underscoring the widespread support among U.N. members states for UNRWA’s humanitarian work. Diplomats have been condemning the Israeli move, and some have warned that it amounted to violating the U.N. charter and international humanitarian law. Even some Israeli allies, including Britain and France, have joined in the criticism.Dozens are killed in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials say.VideoThe Baalbek district beared the brunt of Israel’s barrage, which officials said killed at least 60 people in the Bekaa Valley, in eastern Lebanon.CreditCredit...Nidal Solh/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIsraeli airstrikes on Monday killed at least 60 people in the Bekaa Valley, in eastern Lebanon, Lebanese officials said, in what appeared to be the deadliest barrage of strikes in the area since the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalated last month.At least 58 others were injured in the attacks, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which reported the death toll. Most of the airstrikes were concentrated in the Baalbek district, a patchwork of farmlands and villages in the valley that is home to a city of the same name. Hezbollah holds sway in parts of the district, one of Lebanon’s most underdeveloped regions, which borders Syria.Israel’s military has said that its operation in Lebanon is targeting Hezbollah’s military infrastructure. On Tuesday, Israel’s military said its forces had engaged in “joint aerial and ground operations” against “terror infrastructure sites” in Lebanon, but it did not mention the Bekaa Valley.While Israeli airstrikes have rained down across the valley over the past month, residents described the barrage of strikes on Monday night and Tuesday morning as the most intense they had experienced. The strikes also hit within the city of Baalbek — an urban center that has been largely spared in Israel’s recent air campaign — stoking unease that a rare pocket of relative safety in the district was no longer.“They were the most powerful strikes we’ve had here,” said Ibrahim Bayan, a deputy of the mayor of Baalbek city. “We thought the strikes wouldn’t stop until they had leveled all of Baalbek.”At around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, Mr. Bayan began to hear the thud, thud, thud of airstrikes raining down on the hills surrounding the city, he said. Then at around 7 p.m., his house shook and some of his windows shattered after strikes hit within the city limits. Mr. Bayan said he had barely slept the rest of the night as the booms of strikes and the roar of ambulance sirens echoed across the city.At Rayak Hospital, a private facility in the Bekaa Valley, patients began flooding into the emergency room soon after the strikes began on Monday night, according to the hospital’s director.“It was one of the most difficult nights not just for the hospital, but for everyone here,” said the director, Dr. Ali Abdallah.As dawn broke and the barrage ended on Tuesday morning, residents in Baalbek ventured out of their homes to size up the destruction: Within the city, the strikes had leveled several buildings around Gouraud Barracks, an old French military base that has been used as a residential neighborhood since the end of Lebanon’s civil war in 1990 and is situated near the city’s ancient Roman ruins. At least nine people living in Gouraud were killed, officials said.Mr. Bayan said that residents in Gouraud had received evacuation orders from the Israeli military last week. Some residents opted to stay after receiving the warning. Others left and then returned, assuming the area was safe a week after the warning was issued.Hezbollah began firing on Israeli positions in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel last year. Israel ramped up its attacks on Hezbollah last month, killing and injuring many of its leaders and fighters and drawing Lebanon into a broader war.The Bekaa Valley had been largely spared in the tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Hezbollah over the past year. But since the conflict intensified and expanded to eastern Lebanon, around 70 percent of residents in Baalbek have fled the city, turning the once bustling urban center into a ghost town, according to Mr. Bayan. The strikes on Monday night rattled the few who remained, he added.“Most people have no idea what to do with themselves,” Mr. Bayan said. “Those who have money already left. Those who can’t afford to go anywhere have stayed. Now they are just surviving on hope.”The Israeli military said on Tuesday that four soldiers were killed overnight in Jabaliya, in the northern Gaza Strip, adding to what has been the deadliest month for Israeli forces this year. It did not release details of their deaths. The soldiers were members of the Multidimensional Unit, a special operations task force serving under the Ground Forces, the military said. A day after Israel’s Parliament passed two laws that ban the U.N. agency that aids Palestinians from operating in Israel, a spokeswoman for the agency, UNRWA, said it would continue its work. There are “no implications at the immediate level,” said the spokeswoman, Juliette Touma. “Across the region, we continue business as usual.” Most of the laws’ provisions will not take effect for three months.Hezbollah names Naim Qassem, a longtime deputy, as its new leader.ImageNaim Qassem at a memorial ceremony for senior Hezbollah commanders near Beirut, Lebanon, in June.Credit...Wael Hamzeh/EPA, via ShutterstockHezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, named Naim Qassem, its longtime deputy leader, as its new secretary general on Tuesday, replacing Hassan Nasrallah, who was assassinated in Israeli airstrikes south of Beirut last month.The naming of Mr. Qassem, who is around 70 years old, came amid Hezbollah’s deadliest war with Israel since the group was founded in the 1980s. In recent months, Israel has killed large numbers of Hezbollah leaders and commanders, including both Mr. Nasrallah and his presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, as well as many of the group’s rank-and-file fighters.A Hezbollah statement said Mr. Qassem had been chosen by the group’s Shura Council, a senior leadership body, “in adherence to the principles and goals of Hezbollah.” It did not say how many members took part in the process or whether there had been any other contenders.Mr. Qassem now must lead his battered organization through tremendous challenges. Israel is committed to pushing the group’s forces and military infrastructure away from the Lebanon-Israel border and has destroyed some of its tunnels and bunkers, as well as many of its most sophisticated munitions.Israel’s extensive bombing of communities near Beirut and in southern and eastern Lebanon where Hezbollah held sway has displaced more than a million people, most of them Shiite Muslims who have long looked to the group for protection and social services. Caring for them now is a struggle, and it is unclear how the party will rebuild their communities after the war ends.Mr. Qassem has been Hezbollah’s primary voice since the killing of Mr. Nasrallah, appearing in video addresses from undisclosed locations. While he has hinted that Hezbollah is open to diplomacy aimed at ending the war, he has indicated no broader shift in the group’s direction, pledging that its fighters were ready to battle the Israeli troops invading southern Lebanon.“We will confront any possibility, and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land,” he said last month. “The forces of the resistance are ready for a ground engagement.”Hezbollah began firing on Israeli positions in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel last year. Israel ramped up its attacks on Hezbollah last month, killing and injuring many of its leaders and fighters and drawing Lebanon into a broader war.As the leader of Hezbollah, Mr. Qassem will have a key role in truce negotiations and may have to decide if Hezbollah will accept a cease-fire for Lebanon that is not linked to a similar agreement in Gaza. For the past year, Hezbollah has said it would stop fighting only when Israeli attacks on Gaza stopped, too.Mr. Qassem was born in 1953 in Beirut and has been involved with Hezbollah since its formation, with Iran’s support, in the early 1980s. In 1991, under a previous secretary general, Abbas al-Musawi, Mr. Qassem was appointed the group’s deputy leader.After Israel killed Mr. al-Musawi in 1992, Mr. Nasrallah was elevated to the top position and Mr. Qassem remained the deputy. He has never had the towering stature among Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East that Mr. Nasrallah did.In 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Mr. Qassem because of his role in Hezbollah, which Israel, the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization.Dozens are killed in a strike on a building in northern Gaza, Palestinian agencies say.VideoGaza’s health ministry said that at least 25 children were among those killed in an Israeli strike on a residential building in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said it was looking into the strike.CreditCredit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageBodies being buried during a funeral in Beit Lahia on Tuesday.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageAn injured man beside a destroyed building after the strike.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAn Israeli strike on a residential building in northern Gaza killed dozens of people early Tuesday, the territory’s emergency service said.The service, the Palestinian Civil Defense, said 55 people were killed in the strike. The territory’s health ministry said there were 93 dead, including 25 children. Many of the structures still standing in Gaza are heavily overcrowded, with multiple families sheltering in the fewer and fewer buildings that remain.The five-story structure where about 150 people were sheltering in the town of Beit Lahia was struck around dawn, according to Wafa, the Palestinian Authority’s news agency.The Israeli military said in response to questions about the strike that it was aware of reports that civilians were harmed and was looking into them. Israeli troops were “conducting targeted operations and making efforts to avoid causing harm to uninvolved civilians,” it said, adding that the military had earlier evacuated the area, which it called “an active combat zone.”Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman, called the strike “a horrifying incident with a horrifying result” and noted that many of the children reportedly killed had most likely fled strikes in other parts of Gaza. He said the Biden administration had contacted the Israeli government to ask what happened.Mahmoud Basal, a spokesman for the Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza, said on Monday that more than 100,000 Palestinians remained “under siege” in Jabaliya, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia — the three areas main areas of northern Gaza where Israeli troops have been waging a renewed offensive over the last few weeks.The Israeli military, formally known as the Israel Defense Forces, has said it is trying to stem a regrouping of Hamas, which attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, starting the war in Gaza. The military has repeatedly bombarded Beit Lahia.ImagePalestinians removing a body from the rubble of the destroyed residential building.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageBodies being transported from the strike site.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesImageThe remains of the residential building.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty Images“What’s happening in Beit Lahia is happening in many other places in northern Gaza,” said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli military intelligence officer. “The I.D.F. is detecting Hamas infrastructure there and attacking it.”But while the intensity of Israel’s military operation in northern Gaza appeared to be more severe than past ground maneuvers in the area, Mr. Milshtein said, it was an extension of Israel’s failed approach to fighting the war — one in which its forces have fought Hamas before withdrawing only to return to the same places months later after the group’s militants have re-established themselves.“It’s unbelievable,” Mr. Milshtein said. “When are we going to learn?”Gaza health officials said that after a strike on a residential building in Beit Lahia on Oct. 20, 87 people were killed or missing; that toll was disputed by Israel’s military, which said the numbers from Gaza officials did not align with its initial assessment.“Today’s attack on children has become an outrageous norm in Gaza, where, on average, more than 67 children are killed or injured every single day,” said Catherine Russell, the executive director of the United Nations Children’s Fund, in a statement condemning the strike in Beit Lahia. “Children in Gaza are paying with their lives and their futures,” she added.On Sunday, the civil defense said that dozens of people had been killed and wounded in Beit Lahia over the weekend in Israeli strikes. Israel’s military said it had carried out a “precise strike” targeting Hamas fighters.Some of those injured in the latest strike were being taken to Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, according to Wafa. The hospital was stormed by the Israeli military in a three-day raid that ended on Monday, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of the medical workers at the complex were detained or expelled. The facility is one of the last functioning hospitals in the area.The civil defense said its ability to respond to emergencies and carry out rescues has been hampered in the past week by the Israeli offensive.António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, said in a statement on Monday that he was “shocked by the harrowing levels of death, injury and destruction” in northern Gaza and that Israel was turning away efforts to deliver humanitarian supplies, putting lives in danger.Gabby Sobelman and Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.Hostility flares between Iran and Israel at a Security Council session.ImageIran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, at an emergency meeting of the Security Council in New York on Monday.Credit...Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesIsrael and Iran, which have traded major military attacks in recent weeks, exchanged threats and denunciations at an emergency meeting of the Security Council on Monday, undeterred by other diplomats’ attempts to ease the hostilities.Iran’s ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, told the Council that “Iran reserves its inherent right to respond at a time of its choosing to this act of aggression,” and he criticized Western countries allied with Israel that, he said, “shamelessly ask Iran to restrain itself and ignore its right to self-defense.”Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the U.N., directed part of his own comments to the Council at Iran, saying: “This is the last warning. Israel has shown restraint, but from now on you will only see strength. Any further aggression will be met with powerful and swift action.”The Council meeting was requested by Iran, with the support of Russia and China — close allies of Iran — and Algeria, the only Arab country currently holding a seat at the Council.ImageDanny Danon, Israel’s U.N. ambassador, at a news conference before the emergency Security Council meeting on Monday.Credit...Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesDiplomats and senior U.N. officials urged both sides to stand down from the cycle of tit-for-tat attacks, which risk further destabilizing the region and expanding into a regional war.“Belligerent and threatening rhetoric must cease,” Khaled Khiari, an assistant U.N. secretary general, told the Council. “Both sides must stop testing the limits of each other’s restraint and act in the interest of peace and stability for the region.”On Saturday, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes on Iran, targeting more than a dozen sensitive sites, including air defense for the capital Tehran, critical energy and oil sites and missile-developing bases. The strikes killed at least four army soldiers who were manning the air defense systems, according to Iran’s military.The Israeli strikes came in response to an Iranian attack in early October, in which Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel to avenge the killing of the leaders of two militant groups it backs — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — as well as the killings of Iranian military commanders. Iranian officials have blamed the United States for providing support and assistance to Israel in the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and in attacks on Iran, and Mr. Iravani called Washington “complicit” in the Saturday strikes on Iran.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to U.N., denied that accusation. “The United States did not participate in this military operation,” she said, but acknowledged that the United States had “encouraged” Israel to make its retaliation targeted and proportional.She stressed that the United States did not want the hostilities to escalate any further. “We believe this should be the end of the direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,” she said.In several cities in Iran on Monday, funerals were held for the four soldiers who died in the Israeli attack. Their coffins were draped in Iran’s flag and covered in flowers, with uniformed soldiers serving as pallbearers. Grieving families said the soldiers had lost their lives honorably in the defense of their country, according to video broadcast on state television.Iran appears to still be assessing the damage from the strikes and publicly downplaying their significance and scope. Iran’s minister of defense, Amir Aziz Nasirzadeh, told Iranian media on Monday that “Israel’s damages were minimal, and we immediately made repairs and replacements.”At the Security Council on Monday, China and Russia strongly condemned Israel, saying it had violated Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They joined a chorus of condemnations from countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey.“Israel is trying tooth and nail to draw Iran into confrontation,” Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N., told the Council. “And Iran is showing exceptional, for such circumstances, restraint.” He accused Israel of violating international law in its attack on Iran and recklessly destabilizing the region.Iran has been stressing its international backing in the wake of the Israeli strikes. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told Iranian media on Monday that his country was pleased with the flow of diplomatic support that followed the attack. He said Iran’s strategy in confronting Israel had two fronts: “diplomacy and the battlefield.”The prosecutor seeking warrants for Israeli leaders dismisses misconduct accusations as ‘disinformation.’ImageKarim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2023.Credit...Luisa Gonzalez/ReutersKarim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, called on Monday for an investigation into how information about workplace misconduct accusations against him spread — potentially complicating his already contentious efforts to prosecute top Israeli officials for crimes against humanity in connection with the war in Gaza.Earlier this month, The Daily Mail reported that a female colleague had accused Mr. Khan of harassment, an allegation Mr. Khan denied. The Guardian later reported that Mr. Khan had tried to suppress the allegations.On Monday, he said on social media that the court’s oversight body had “closed” the matter in May without an investigation because no complaint had been made. He added that the “alleged aggrieved person” had declined the option of an investigation, either internal or external.Mr. Khan is seeking an inquiry into the accusations against him and how the information was made public, calling the claims “disinformation” and saying news reports about them had breached court confidentiality. He said he had asked that the “inquiry be set up and permitted to do its work without interference” so that the “crucial work” of the prosecutor’s office could continue unimpeded.But the accusations against Mr. Khan could cast a shadow on his efforts to obtain arrest warrants for the Israeli government’s most prominent figures, an endeavor that some believed was already fraught.In May, Mr. Khan set off a firestorm of criticism in Israel, the United States and Britain when he sought arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as for Hamas leaders Israel identified as being behind the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that ignited the war. Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, accused the prosecutor of equating Israel with Hamas, which he said was “shameful.”The three Hamas leaders for whom Mr. Khan sought warrants — Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Muhammad Deif — have all since been killed by Israel.Israel has argued in filings to the court that the tribunal does not have jurisdiction over its officials. Separately, it has argued that it has not been given the chance to show that its own institutions can address any accusations internally, as the court’s processes require. Israel, like the United States, is not a party to the statute that created the I.C.C., which has a mandate to investigate and prosecute war crimes and genocide.On Thursday, Paivi Kaukoranta, the president of the court’s oversight body, the Assembly of States Parties, confirmed that his organization had been made aware of the allegations against Mr. Khan by “a member of his office.” She said that the court “seeks the consent of any alleged victim of misconduct before proceeding with an investigation” but “was not in a position to proceed” with one after its conversation with accusing party.Ms. Kaukoranta added that “the court has a zero-tolerance policy” when it comes to misconduct, “including sexual harassment, discrimination and abuse of authority,” and that she remained in contact with all parties.The accusations against Mr. Khan have armed his critics. Some, including the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, have suggested that the prosecutor rushed his warrant requests in an effort to save his job after the allegations against him were made. Supporters of Mr. Khan, by contrast, say he is now being smeared because he sought the warrants.South Africa submits its genocide case against Israel to the top U.N. court.ImageSouth Africa’s justice minister, Ronald Lamola, left center, outside the International Court of Justice in The Hague in January, after his country brought genocide charges against Israel.Credit...Remko De Waal/EPA, via ShutterstockSouth Africa stepped up its campaign to demonstrate that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza as it submitted its main filing on Monday to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.Meeting the Oct. 28 deadline for the filing to the court, the U.N.’s top judicial body, South Africa submitted a legal brief of more than 750 pages, plus multiple voluminous annexes, detailing the bloodshed in Gaza in the past year. The filing was delayed to the last moment, the lawyers said, to keep up with Israel’s military operations.Much of the material in the filing has already been widely reported or documented but it also offers new exhibits, according to lawyers close to the case, which throw more light on Gaza’s plight since the deadly Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year and Israel’s continuing military response.Lawyers familiar with the case said that dozens of researchers and lawyers had worked for months on South Africa’s submission, and that it addressed the razing of most of the Gaza Strip, the suffering and killing of its civilians and the statements made by Israeli political and military leaders about their plans.South Africa’s filing is meant to remain confidential until oral hearings are held next year, but it will be available to Israel and to the other countries that have joined South Africa’s complaint.Israel will have several months to challenge the filing in writing. Israel is expected to do, although it has denounced the proceedings as illegitimate.Included in the new materials submitted to the court is an 827-page report that was made public this weekend by Forensic Architecture, an investigative group based at Goldsmiths, University of London, and led by the Israeli-British architect Eyal Weizman.The report says its researchers used multiple methods, including satellite and remote-sensing images, to assess the scale and methods of the destruction in Gaza, including of its medical, religious, civilian and agricultural infrastructure.The report’s purpose is plain: Its interactive platform is called: “A Cartography of Genocide.”Lawyers say that genocide is among the most difficult crimes to prove in international law because it requires demonstrating the specific intent to destroy a group, “in whole or in part,” something that Israeli leaders have persistently denied is their intent in Gaza.But some experts point to a sentence from the United Nations’ genocide convention that forbids “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”The Forensic Architecture report hews closely to that wording, stating that “our findings indicate that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza is organized, systematic, and intended to destroy conditions of life and life-sustaining infrastructure.”Months of arguments lie ahead.The International Court of Justice, which deals with disputes between nations, has been the principal legal venue for denouncing the horrors of Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 attack and the events in the year since.South Africa filed its case accusing Israel of genocide late last year. Since then, the court has issued three emergency rulings, warning Israel to avoid genocide and to allow more food and medicine and life essentials into the Gaza Strip and to stop its attacks on civilians. But it has not begun to address the question of whether Israel has violated the U.N.’s genocide convention, which is at the heart of the case.Israel’s Knesset passes bills banning UNRWA, the agency that aids Palestinians.ImageIsraeli soldiers next to UNRWA offices in central Gaza in February, photographed during an escorted tour.Credit...Sergey Ponomarev for The New York TimesIsrael’s Parliament passed two laws on Monday that could threaten the work of UNRWA, the main U.N. agency that aids Palestinians, by barring its operations in the country. In doing so, Israel defied calls from the Biden administration, which has warned that the legislation could prompt an even greater humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Most of the laws’ provisions will not take effect for three months, and their full legal ramifications were not immediately clear. The relief agency has played a critical role in coordinating desperately needed humanitarian aid.Israel has criticized UNRWA for decades, arguing that its work aiding Palestinian refugees and their descendants further perpetuated the longstanding territorial conflict with Israel. The Israeli government has accused a handful of the agency’s 13,000 employees in Gaza of participating in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks on Israel last year that triggered the war.The legislation passed on Monday night had the potential to push the agency’s operations into precarious and uncharted territory.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under pressure from Israel’s allies, including the United States, not to move against the agency, and it was unclear how or whether the law would ultimately be implemented.However, he has consistently excoriated the agency in the past, and hours after the bills passed, his office released a statement that said: “UNRWA workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable. Since avoiding a humanitarian crisis is also essential, sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza now and in the future.”The statement continued: “In the 90 days before this legislation takes effect — and after — we stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israel’s security.”Several governments including Germany and Spain immediately criticized the passage of the bills. In one example, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain said in a statement he was “gravely concerned,” and he said that the vote threatened the “entire international humanitarian response” in Gaza.Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA’s head, said on social media that the move by the Knesset “sets a dangerous precedent.”“These bills will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell,” Mr. Lazzarini added.He also said that the move violated Israel’s obligations under international law, an accusation rejected by Israeli lawmakers.Under the new legislation, UNRWA would be unable to “operate any representative office, provide any service, or conduct any activity, directly or indirectly, in Israel’s sovereign territory.” It also bars any Israeli government agency from having any contact with UNRWA or those operating on its behalf.Both bills passed with overwhelming majorities: Each secured over 80 votes in Israel’s 120-member Parliament. Lawmakers from at least two centrist parties joined Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition in voting for the measures, reflecting mainstream backing.Ron Katz, one of the bills’ sponsors and a member of the centrist Yesh Atid party, bluntly equated Hamas and the U.N. agency. “We are saying simply: Israel is breaking away from a terrorist organization, Hamas, which called itself UNRWA,” he said.For decades, UNRWA has operated schools and clinics in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza, as well as some neighboring Arab states, serving Palestinians displaced in the war surrounding the establishment of Israel decades ago. The laws could compel UNRWA to close its office in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed, a move not recognized by much of the international community.While the laws’ full consequences are not yet known, UNRWA would struggle to bring in international staff members if Israeli government agencies were barred from giving them employment visas. And it is unclear how the agency would coordinate the movement of its aid workers in Gaza with the Israeli military, even indirectly.The United States and seven other countries, including Britain, France and Germany, had in recent days urged Israel not to ban UNRWA, arguing that its work was vital, not least for civilians in Gaza. More than 230 of the agency’s staff members have been killed since the start of the war in Gaza over a year ago.Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesman, said that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III had warned Israel in a letter that “passage of this legislation could have implications under U.S. law.” That missive had threatened a potential weapons cutoff unless Israel took steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.“We are deeply concerned by this proposed legislation,” Mr. Miller told reporters on Monday, shortly before the bills were passed. “They really play an irreplaceable role right now in Gaza, where they are on the front lines getting humanitarian assistance to the people who need it.”“We continue to urge the government of Israel to pause the implementation of this legislation,” Mr. Miller added. “We urge them not to pass it at all. We will consider next steps based on what happens in the days ahead.”Israel has increasingly worked to block the agency since January, when Israel’s government claimed that 12 of the agency’s 13,000 employees in Gaza had participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. It later added what it said were other cases and argued that scores of the agency’s employees belonged to militant groups. Israel offered little evidence to support this allegation.In August, U.N. investigators cleared 10 UNRWA employees of taking part in the Oct. 7 attacks, but the United Nations said that nine others were fired because of possible involvement. An independent review in April commissioned by the United Nations found that UNRWA had “a more developed approach to neutrality” than other aid groups and other U.N. agencies.Aid organizations say that Israeli efforts against UNRWA have weakened humanitarian efforts in the enclave, where the war has displaced most of the population, destroyed public sanitation and the health care system, and made food and potable water scarce. A report by experts this month warned again of famine.Israeli officials have said that they are acting in compliance with international law and remain committed to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, but that UNRWA should no longer operate in the enclave.After Israeli news outlets on Monday reported that a top member of Israel’s hostage and cease-fire negotiation team, Brig. Gen. Oren Setter, had resigned unexpectedly, the Israeli military issued a statement saying he will return to the efforts in the future. The Israeli military statement said that General Setter had “returned from retirement to full duty in the negotiation team as of October 7, and as part of the team has worked tirelessly since then.”The military added that General Setter “will return to assist” with work to secure the release of hostages “as needed.” General Setter declined to comment.October has been a deadly month for the Israeli military.ImageThe funeral of Ido Ben Zvi, an Israeli soldier killed in Gaza, in the northern Israeli kibbutz of Shomrat on Sunday.Credit...Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersOctober has been the deadliest month of the year for the Israeli military. A total of more than 55 soldiers have been killed in its two major campaigns: the ground operation in southern Lebanon against the Iranian-backed armed group Hezbollah and the continued battle against Hamas in Gaza.The toll roughly equals that of November, the first full month of Israel’s ground operations in Gaza in the wake of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack last year. The attack ignited Israel’s war against Hamas in the Palestinian territory and led to its eventual ground incursion into southern Lebanon at the start of this month.According to numbers released by Israel’s foreign ministry on Sunday, the anniversary of the start of the ground campaign in Gaza, more than 30 soldiers have died in combat in southern Lebanon since Oct. 1, when the ground invasion there began, along with nearly 10 in Israel related to that conflict. In Gaza, about 15 soldiers died in the same period.“It has been a year of war on multiple fronts,” said Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, adding in a statement addressing soldiers on Sunday that “no war comes without a cost.”“Our continued existence is ensured by the acts of heroism of the fallen and the wounded in body or soul,” General Halevi said. “It is our duty to complete the mission for them.”According to the Israeli authorities, 360 soldiers have died in the fighting in the Gaza Strip over more than a year of war.In the same period, the fighting in Gaza has cost more than 43,000 Palestinian lives, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, which does not distinguish between combatant and civilian deaths. The Israeli military said this summer that it had killed about 17,000 Hamas operatives in Gaza. Most of the population of 2.2 million Gazans has been displaced.Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon at the start of October to fight Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia that began firing rockets on northern Israel just after the war in Gaza began, expressing support for Hamas, which is also backed by Iran. The Israeli military described a limited invasion meant to dismantle Hezbollah’s infrastructure and ensure that more than 60,000 Israelis who fled their homes in the north could return and live in security.An even larger number of residents of southern Lebanon had been displaced over the year of cross-border fire, and the Israeli ground invasion has displaced hundreds of thousands more, according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations arm. More than 2,600 people have been killed in Lebanon during the conflict, the vast majority in recent weeks, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.Hezbollah has the largest arsenal of any nonstate armed group in the world, and its fighters have been battle-hardened in wars with Israel, and in fighting in Syria. They are considered better armed and more capable than Hamas.The military’s losses in Gaza in November of last year, the first full month of Israeli ground troops fighting in the enclave, roughly equaled October’s toll in the two conflicts, with about 55 soldiers killed in combat. In January, previously the deadliest month of this year for Israeli soldiers, more than 50 service members were killed in combat in Gaza.Daniel Byman, a senior fellow with the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, assessed that on a scale of 100, Hezbollah would have been at a 90 before the war with Israel began, meaning extremely capable, while Hamas had been at about a 50. Fighting Hezbollah will be difficult, he said.More than 50 people were killed in Israeli strikes in the Baalbek district in eastern Lebanon on Monday, and over 100 wounded, according to Bachir Khodr, the regional governor. It was the deadliest day in the area since last October, he said, which is when Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia, began attacking Israel more than a year ago in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.",
