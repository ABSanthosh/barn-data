  "text": "This satellite image provided by NOAA shows weather systems Sunday (Picture Credit: AP)A developing weather system in the south-central Caribbean Sea, now labeled potential Tropical Cyclone 18, is forecasted to intensify this week. The National Hurricane Center in Miami has issued a tropical storm warning for Jamaica and a hurricane watch for the Cayman Islands, with Cuba also expected to be affected.As of 7 pm EST on Sunday (5:30 am IST on Monday), the system was located approximately 345 miles (555 kilometres) south of Kingston, Jamaica, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and higher gusts. Moving northward at 7 mph (11 kph), the system is expected to shift northwest by Monday. Forecasters predict it will strengthen into a tropical storm by Monday, with steady intensification likely through the week.The system will be classified as a tropical storm once winds reach sustained speeds of at least 39 mph (63 kph). It will be upgraded to hurricane status if winds surpass 74 mph (119 kph). The system is expected to approach Jamaica by late Monday, and then near the Cayman Islands on Tuesday and Wednesday.The NHC has advised residents in Cuba and the Florida Keys to monitor the storm’s trajectory closely, as the system could bring heavy rainfall to these areas. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches (76 to 152 mm) are expected across the western Caribbean, with isolated amounts of up to 9 inches (229 mm) possible in Jamaica and southern Cuba, increasing the risk of flooding and mudslides in these regions.By mid-to-late week, heavy rains are anticipated to spread to Florida and surrounding areas of the southeastern US, with potential impacts along the northern Gulf Coast. Authorities are urging residents in the storm's projected path to stay informed and prepare for possible severe weather.",
