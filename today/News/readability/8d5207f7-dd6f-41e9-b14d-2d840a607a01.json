  "text": "Pakistan has nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, crediting his \"decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership\" during the recent crisis between India and Pakistan. The announcement was made in a post on social media platform X, where Pakistani officials said Trump played a key role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The nomination follows comments made by Trump on Friday, in which he argued he deserved the prestigious award for multiple peace efforts, including his involvement in easing tensions between India and Pakistan. “I should have gotten it four or five times,” the president said. “They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”While the Indian government has rejected the idea that Trump played a role in the ceasefire, Trump insists he helped prevent a potential war. “Well, I stopped a war... I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We're going to make a trade deal with Modi of India,” he told reporters earlier this week. “But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India. This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it – and they're both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, has also secured a lunch meeting at the White House following his recommendation that US President Donald Trump be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2026. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed the meeting will take place but did not provide a date.This is not the first time Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In the past, loyal lawmakers and supporters have submitted his name for consideration. He has also repeatedly voiced frustration at being overlooked, referencing the 2009 win of former US President Barack Obama.Trump also announced on Truth Social that he had arranged a peace treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. He said officials from both countries would travel to Washington on Monday to sign the agreement, although their joint statement listed the date as June 27.“This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!” Trump wrote. He also criticised the Nobel committee for not acknowledging his previous peace efforts in other regions. “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping Peace between Egypt and Ethiopia... No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do... but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!”The peace agreement between the DRC and Rwanda, reached during three days of negotiations in Washington, aims to end a decades-long conflict in eastern Congo.Trump has positioned himself as a global peacemaker, often highlighting his negotiation skills as a key approach to ending international conflicts. However, the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are ongoing, with no resolution reached more than five months into his presidency.",
