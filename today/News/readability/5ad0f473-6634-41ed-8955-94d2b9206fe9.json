In an Amsterdam park, a dog called Lucy sported orange-dyed fur. \"I love it. It's a day where every year everyone just comes together, just celebrates and it doesn't matter where you're from everyone is just accepted,\" said 22-year-old Dicky van Warmerdam. \"And if you look around, it's just a giant party and who doesn't want that?\"The official royal walkabout by King Willem-Alexander and family members in the eastern town of Doetinchem started an hour later than planned so as not to clash with the funeral at the Vatican of Pope Francis.In a video message, Willem-Alexander said the day of Dutch celebration \"has two faces\" due to the pope's funeral, and paid tribute to Francis. \"For many Catholics and non-Catholics, he was a source of inspiration,\" the king said. The king's 58th birthday is on Sunday, but King's Day was held a day earlier. The celebrations began Friday night with street markets in the central city of Utrecht and parties in other towns and cities.By Saturday afternoon, some canals in the Dutch capital were crammed with boats, the water sometimes barely visible through the throngs of people and clouds of orange smoke from flares.In a message on social media, Amsterdam Municipality said parts of the city were \"too full\" and urged people not to visit Amsterdam and \"celebrate King's Day somewhere else.\" Other cities also reported that events were overcrowded.In Amsterdam's Vondel Park, children spread out blankets and sold unwanted toys, clothes and books in one of the many \"free markets\" that spring up on sidewalks and parks. And it wasn't just the Dutch who were celebrating in Amsterdam.\"It is a great moment for togetherness, to be with friends, you know, ... to make new connections,\" said 23-year-old Lorenzo Soldi from Italy.",
