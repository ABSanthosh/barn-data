They had crammed into it with about 70 relatives after fleeing the fighting in Gaza, but when they left for Jordan, the stocks of flour were empty. “What would the family who stayed behind have for dinner?” Mohammed recalls wondering during his sleepless nights.Israeli officials said this month that more than 4,000 patients had gotten out of Gaza for medical treatment since the war began. But as of late June, more than 10,000 people in the enclave required urgent medical care that was available only elsewhere, according to the World Health Organization.For the small number of Gazan cancer patients who like Mohammed are receiving care in Jordan’s capital, Amman, that knowledge brings burdens. As well as their illness, they battle deep feelings of guilt, fear and homesickness.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
