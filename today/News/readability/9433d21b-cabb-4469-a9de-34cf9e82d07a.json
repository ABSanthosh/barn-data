According to Salt Lake City police, he “was not the intended target of the gunfire.” Despite efforts by first responders, he died later at a local hospital.Cravalho, best known for voicing the title character in Disney’s Moana, paid tribute to Ah Loo on social media, writing, “There are no words to hold the grief of losing you. Your artistry will never be forgotten; and neither will your peaceful protest. My deepest condolences, sympathies and Aloha to his family, and all who felt his impact.”Two men who were acting as part of the protest’s “peacekeeping team” were detained after the shooting. One of them reportedly fired the bullet that struck Ah Loo. Police said the men confronted Arturo Gamboa, 24, after spotting him manipulating an AR-15-style rifle away from the crowd. When they ordered him to drop the weapon, Gamboa allegedly ran into the crowd with the rifle in a “firing position.”One of the “peacekeepers” fired three shots, striking both Gamboa and Ah Loo. Gamboa was arrested and booked into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail on a murder charge.Celebrated designerArthur Folasa Ah Loo founded the fashion house Afa Ah Loo and was praised for his colourful designs that highlighted his Pacific Islander heritage. His work was well loved in the Polynesian community and gained wider attention after he appeared on Project Runway in 2019.Although he left the show early, his designs were well received. In the years that followed, he dressed several well-known Pacific Islanders. Moana 2 co-director David Derrick Jr. called him a “pillar in the community” and added, “I already miss you Uso. Thank you for blessing our lives.”Auli’i Cravalho, who voiced Moana, also shared memories of Ah Loo. She said he designed the outfit she wore for the Moana 2 world premiere, which she described as “the most significant event of my career.” Cravalho called his work “thoughtful, elegant and powerful portrayals of Pacific culture.”Ah Loo’s fashion journey began in high school. He once shared with the Salt Lake City Tribune that a failed cooking assignment led his teacher to guide him towards sewing. “The very first week, we were cooking brownies, I believe,” he said. “Instead of baking something, I fried it and I almost burned down the kitchen... The teacher was like, ‘I think cooking is not your thing. I think maybe we should switch you over to sewing.’”Outside of his career, Ah Loo focused on his family. He often made clothes for them and dedicated a full collection to his daughter Vera. “Dedicated to her and her free spirit and love for everything and anything creative!” he wrote.Ah Loo also co-founded Creative Pacific, a nonprofit that supports Pacific Islander artists and designers. The organisation was set to host a fashion show at the end of July, according to NBC News.Ah Loo is survived by his wife and two young children, according to a GoFundMe page for his family that raised over $100,000 in 48 hours.",
