  "text": "US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few hours ago, wanted to do business in India but that country is a very hard place to do business because of the high tariffs. A Few hours after PM Modi met Musk at the Blair House and discussed key topics such as \"space, technology, and innovation.\" Responding to a question over Musk and PM Modi meeting, Trump said, \"They met, and I assume he wants to do business in India, but India is a very hard place to do business in because of the tariffs. They have the highest tariffs just about in the world, and it's a hard place to do business. No, I would imagine he met possibly because, you know, he's running the company.\"\" He's doing this as a. As something that he's felt strongly about for a long time because he sees what's happening and he sees how the country is really being hurt badly by all of the fraud, waste and abuse,\" he added. At the Oval office, Trump also delivered a blunt warning to Brics nations on Thursday, declaring that if they proceed with launching a common currency, they would face a 100% tariff on all imports into the United States. He also asserted that \"Brics is dead.\" Trump's scathing remark on Brics challenges its global influence and relevance.\"Brics was put there for a bad purpose... I told them if they want to play games with the Dollar, then they are going to be hit by a 100% tariff. The day they mention that they want to do it, they will come back and say - we beg you, we beg you. Brics is dead since I mentioned that...\" Trump said.PM Modi, who is on a two day US visit, is holding a meeting with Trump and possibly the trade and tariff could be the key issues that will be discussed in the meeting.",
