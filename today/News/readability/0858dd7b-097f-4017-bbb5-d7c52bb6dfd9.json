  "text": "Ohio governor Mike DeWine signed the “Protect All Students Act” on Wednesday, prohibiting transgender students from using school bathrooms, locker rooms, or overnight accommodations aligning with their gender identity. Dubbed the \"bathroom bill,\" the law applies to public and private schools and colleges, taking effect in 90 days.The legislation mandates that facilities be designated exclusively for males and females based on biological sex assigned at birth. While it lacks enforcement mechanisms, it exempts school staff, emergencies, and caregivers assisting young children or those with disabilities.Supporters defend 'privacy and safety'The bill’s sponsor, Republican State Senator Jerry Cirino, defended it as essential for privacy and safety, stating: “It revolves around safety, security, and, I think, common sense. It protects our children and grandchildren in private spaces where they are most vulnerable.” Aaron Baer, president of the Center for Christian Virtue, praised the law, saying, “Common sense is on a winning streak in America today. No student should be forced to go into the bathroom or locker room with a student of the opposite sex.”Critics condemn 'Anti-trans bathroom bill'Opposition to the law has been swift and strong. The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio labeled it an “anti-trans bathroom bill,” arguing it compromises transgender students' safety. Jocelyn Rosnick, the ACLU's policy director, called it a “cruel invasion of students’ rights to privacy.” Equality Ohio's executive director, Dwayne Steward, criticized the measure, warning it puts vulnerable youth at greater risk. Both groups pledged to continue advocating for transgender students' rights.Broader context of transgender rights debateOhio joins 11 other states that have enacted similar bathroom restrictions, with 26 states restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors. Earlier this year, Ohio passed laws limiting gender-affirming care and barring transgender athletes in women’s sports.The national debate over transgender rights intensified during Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, which included promises to restrict transgender participation in women’s sports and limit gender-affirming healthcare. With Trump’s election win, Republican lawmakers plan to push similar measures in state legislatures convening in early 2025.While proponents argue these laws protect privacy and safety, critics say they unfairly target marginalized communities. Legal challenges loom, as the US supreme court prepares to review Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care, a decision that could affect similar laws nationwide.",
