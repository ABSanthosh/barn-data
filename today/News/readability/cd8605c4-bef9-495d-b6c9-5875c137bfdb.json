  "text": "LONDON — Reform U.K., Britain’s upstart anti-immigration party, celebrated breakthrough wins Friday as votes were tallied in local elections held a day earlier. The early results were a sign that the populist politics roiling much of Europe and the United States are gaining traction in the United Kingdom, posing a challenge to the two-party dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties.With results in most races still being tabulated Friday, Reform made sweeping gains in county and town council contests, captured its first mayoral seat and flipped, by just six votes, an open parliamentary seat held by Labour, in Reform’s first such by-election victory.The elections, largely limited to about 1,600 seats in two dozen local councils across England, are not a national poll. But they are the first broad test of voter sentiment since last summer’s general election in which Labour trounced the long-governing Tories.The vote is a rebuke to Labour, which is widely seen as failing so far to deliver on promises to boost public services and improve living standards. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s popularity slumped after he cut winter fuel subsidies for retirees, infuriating his liberal base, and hiked taxes on businesses and farmers.Nor did Starmer’s attempts to fend off Reform’s rise by tacking to the right on some issues — cutting foreign aid and adding restrictions on legal immigration — show much evidence of success Thursday.The results weren’t all bad for Labour; the party managed to outpace Reform in three of the four larger mayoral races. The Liberal Democrats also gained support in some parts of England.But the emerging story of the day was Reform U.K.’s apparent evolution from protest party to electoral winner. The party ousted dozens of Conservative officeholders and performed well in depressed postindustrial regions that have historically been Labour’s heartland.The strong showing confirmed polls that had predicted a surge by the populist right-wing movement, which has its roots in protest parties that pushed Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in 2016 and have campaigned to reduce both legal and illegal migration into the country.Thursday’s results were the best ever for a Euroskeptic party in Britain and suggest that voter disenchantment with establishment politics continues to climb.“It’s pretty clear that we are in a situation we have not really experienced before,” British polling expert John Curtice told the BBC. “The message of the opinion polls, that the Conservatives are still in the doldrums and that Labour has lost a lot of ground since last July, all seems to be reflected in the results of these elections, and who has advanced above all since last summer is Reform.”Reform U.K. founder Nigel Farage said the high-water-mark performance of his party showed that it, rather than the Conservatives, has the momentum to take on Labour until the next general election, expected in 2029.“I think we’ve supplanted the Conservative Party now as the main opposition party in government,” Farage told the BBC.Reform’s surge is a particular blow to Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader who was elected by the party in November to restore the party’s fortunes after its defeat by Labour in 2024. She has struggled to gain traction, and Thursday’s performance will increase the pressure.“It will inevitably raise questions about the leadership,” said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. “Probably all weekend Conservative MPs will be WhatsApping each other saying ‘how can we go on like this.’ ”Conservative Party co-chair Nigel Huddleston said Badenoch’s position was safe.“Kemi’s position is certainly solid,” Huddleston said on BBC Breakfast. “She’s only been leader for six months, and she was out and about right across the country. And I can tell you this: Everywhere we went, people wanted to see her more and hear more from her.”Huddleston dismissed Farage’s claims to have supplanted the Conservative Party as “not credible.” The Conservatives still control 121 seats in Parliament, compared to Reform’s five, in the 650-seat House of Commons.Reform’s victory in Thursday’s Runcorn and Helsby parliamentary by-election was by the narrowest margin in modern history, electoral experts said. Reform candidate Sarah Pochin prevailed by a half-dozen votes and only after a recount in the early hours Friday.The seat had been held by Labour for 40 years and was considered safe until the incumbent, Mike Amesbury, was forced to resign this year after being convicted of assaulting a constituent.Whatever the particulars of the local results, Reform U.K. has boosted its national standing enormously.“This shows that they have the momentum of a winning party at a point when both Conservatives and Labour are unpopular at the same time,” Travers said. “That is almost without parallel in British politics.”Reform’s rise mirrors growing support for right-wing and populist movements in Germany, Italy, France and elsewhere across Europe.The party is the latest iteration of Farage’s years-long campaign to loosen Britain’s ties to Europe. He founded the anti-Europe, anti-immigrant U.K. Independence Party and was instrumental in pushing then-Prime Minister David Cameron into holding the 2016 referendum on Britain’s E.U. membership.In July’s general election, Reform U.K. won five seats in Parliament and 14.3 percent of the vote, making it Britain’s third-largest party by vote share.Farage has been a vocal fan of President Donald Trump, meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago and attending last year’s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.More recently, the Reform leader has been forced to distance himself from Trump’s upheaval of American policies toward Europe, particularly his reducing support for Ukraine and ramping up tariffs, neither of which are popular in Britain.",
