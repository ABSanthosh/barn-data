Sign up to get the rest free, including news from around the globe and interesting ideas and opinions to know, sent to your inbox on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.DAVOS, Switzerland — The motto emblazoned on the facade of Ukraine House echoes the emerging global zeitgeist: “Your country first — win with us.” The slogan was splashed across Kyiv’s pavilion along the packed promenade of this ritzy mountain town; it headlined a high-profile Thursday breakfast attended by world leaders and prominent CEOs and was invoked by the event’s host.“If you put the interest of your country first, then it means national security is an absolute priority,” said Viktor Pinchuk, an influential Ukrainian oligarch who is a fixture at events on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) and is keen to rally support against Russia. “But that means you must not let our crazy, terrible enemy win in Ukraine.”The return of President Donald Trump and his “America First” agenda loomed over proceedings all week in Davos, even if the U.S. president wasn’t physically present. Ukraine’s many well-wishers in attendance seemed intent on mustering a pitch for greater backing to Kyiv that would play to Trump’s instincts and priorities. Prior to his election victory, Trump had cast doubt on extending military aid to Ukraine and touted his good rapport with Russian President Vladimir Putin.But before the Davos crowd, during a Thursday evening virtual address, Trump signaled a shift in tone, calling for an end to the war in Ukraine and placing the onus on Russia to come to the table, arguing that Kyiv was ready for negotiations. And in an earlier social media post that was welcomed by analysts and political elites in Davos, he seemed to issue a threat to the Kremlin: “I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE,” he wrote.Trump also urged NATO’s Europe members to boost military spending to a dramatic 5 percent of GDP, a reflection of his long-standing view — shared, to a certain extent, by rival Democrats — that Europe needs to step up its investments in defense. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte concurred. “The problem is not Trump or the U.S.,” he said in Davos. “The problem is Europe.”Andrzej Duda joins Washington Post Live on Tuesday, Jan. 21. (Video: The Washington Post)Many others in Davos seemed to be reading from the same script. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged Europe to get its act together; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen championed a more robust, independent and united continent — not least as Trump plots potential tariffs on E.U. exports and complains, as he did yet again Thursday, about the European Union treating the United States “very badly.”“What Europe needs to understand … is that Trump was right on pushing us to increase our defense expenditure,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb told me. “At the same time, we need to work very hard to convince [him] that trade tariffs are not good.”Stubb, speaking on the sidelines of the WEF, said he was “carefully optimistic” about prospects for peace in Ukraine and the role Trump could play in brokering a truce. “It’s important that these negotiations begin with Ukraine from a position of strength,” Stubb said, pointing to the clear “fact that Trump wants to forge peace, and he wants to win peace” and citing strains in Russia’s economy and capacity to sustain the conflict.“I believe that President Donald Trump understands well that Russian imperialism has to be stopped,” Polish President Andrzej Duda said during a Washington Post Live event hosted in Davos. “And he also understands that it is in the American interest to keep U.S. hegemony in this part of the world.”But what peace will look like is far less clear. Most analysts believe neither side can win the bloody war of attrition and that a temporary ceasefire would probably take place in a context where tens of thousands of Russian troops still occupy a vast stretch of Ukrainian territory. Western officials and their Ukrainian counterparts routinely tout the need for a “just peace” after Russia’s invasion, but the facts on the ground do not lend themselves to an ideal scenario where Ukraine is able to restore control over all its lands lost to Russia.Instead, the emerging consensus among Western officials is that military aid must continue to bolster Ukraine’s hand at the negotiating table while Kyiv must also be offered sweeping commitments in defense from the West to avoid a resumption of conflict or further land grabs by Moscow. “A just peace is a peace that has security guarantees,” Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, told me during a WEF event, gesturing to the past decade where the rest of the world looked away as Russia consolidated its position after illegally annexing Crimea in 2014. “We’ve had a very bad experience with a frozen conflict.”Zelensky and his allies, including neighbors in Eastern Europe, hope for NATO membership, but accession to the alliance was not favored by the Biden administration, and even less so by Trump. The Ukrainian president in Davos also floated the prospect of a force of some 200,000 allied peacekeepers helping secure Ukraine’s territory.Stubb argued that Trump wouldn’t want “a rerun” of what transpired in Afghanistan in 2021, when U.S. withdrawal was followed by the frantic collapse of the Western-backed government in Kabul. In order to avoid that, Stubb explained, Trump and all other interlocutors for Ukraine would have to defend three principles: ensuring that Kyiv isn’t bullied into becoming a Moscow client after a peace deal, retains the sovereign ability to decide whether it wants to join the European Union and NATO, and does not concede any of its claims over the territory captured by Russian forces.But Russian visions for peace, as my colleagues reported this week, are rather different. The most common “formula, increasingly pushed by officials from Putin on down, involves a neutral, demilitarized Ukraine outside of NATO, with Russia keeping the territory it has already annexed,” they wrote. “It may also encompass Moscow’s demands for broader talks on Europe’s security architecture and for NATO to roll back its military infrastructure from its eastern borders.”European officials in Davos were hopeful that, with a more united front and a new pressure campaign led by Trump, the Ukrainian vision for how the war should end would win out. “If there is alignment on the fact that we cannot allow Russia to win this war, then things can happen quickly,” Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, told me.Trump seemed to echo that sentiment in remarks from the Oval Office on Thursday. “I think Russia should want to make a deal,” he said. “From what I hear, Putin would like to see me and we’ll meet as soon as we can. ... It would be nice to end that war. It’s a ridiculous war.”",
