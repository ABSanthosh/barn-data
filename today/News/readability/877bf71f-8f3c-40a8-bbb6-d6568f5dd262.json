  "text": "By Norihiko Shirouzu, Chris Kirkham (Reuters) -Tesla aims to stun investors Thursday night with its long-awaited “robotaxi unveil,\" a potential milestone after a decade of Elon Musk’s unfulfilled promises to deliver self-driving vehicles. The automaker is widely expected to showcase a prototype called the \"Cybercab\" rather than a road-ready driverless taxi. Convincing regulators and passengers of the vehicle’s safety could prove much harder and take much longer — while its main competitors, such as Alphabet’s Waymo, expand robotaxi fleets they're already operating in select cities today. Tesla has to date pursued a different technological path than all of its major self-driving rivals - one with potentially higher rewards but also higher risks to both its business and its passengers, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen executives, consultants and academics specializing in self-driving technology and three former Tesla autonomous-vehicle engineers. Tesla's strategy relies solely on a combination of “computer vision,” which aims to use cameras the way humans use eyes, with an artificial-intelligence technology called end-to-end machine learning that instantly translates the images into driving decisions. That technology already underpins its \"Full Self-Driving\" driver-assistance feature that, despite its name, can't be operated safely without a human driver. Musk has said Tesla is using the same approach to develop fully autonomous robotaxis. Tesla’s competitors - including Waymo, Amazon’s Zoox, General Motors’ Cruise and a host of Chinese firms - use the same technology but typically layer on redundant systems and sensors such as radar, lidar and sophisticated mapping to ensure safety and win regulatory approval for their driverless vehicles. Tesla's strategy is simpler, and much cheaper, but has two critical weaknesses, industry executives, autonomous-vehicle experts and one of the Tesla engineers told Reuters. Without the layered technologies used by its peers, Tesla's system struggles more with so-called \"edge cases\" — rare driving scenarios that self-driving systems and their human engineers struggle to anticipate. The other major challenge: The end-to-end AI technology is a “black box,” the Tesla engineer said, making it “nearly impossible” to “see what went wrong when it misbehaves and causes an accident.” The inability to precisely identify such failures, he said, makes it difficult to safeguard against them. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its technology.",
