  "text": "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut on Thursday, according to Lebanese state media, marking the third consecutive day of such strikes. Around dawn, Israeli strikes targeted at least three areas in Beirut’s suburbs, the state-run National News Agency reported — with more hits reported later in the Ghobeiry neighborhood.Live coverage contributors 11Hospitals are running out of food as strikes continue in Gaza’s besieged northReturn to menuDisplaced residents, medical officials and injured people in northern Gaza described increasingly dire conditions amid Israeli operations in the region, warning of a lack of food, continued shelling and “a constant state of terror.”Every hour, hospitals in northern Gaza are losing patients because of severe and some preventable conditions, said Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza.Both adults and children alike are facing malnutrition and dehydration due to a lack of food at the hospital, he said. “We cannot provide even a single meal to the patients, which prolongs wound healing, nor can we offer a meal to the health-care workers who work around-the-clock,” he said.The hospital doesn’t have a single ambulance to transport the injured from disaster sites, he said. “Heartbreakingly, I have received multiple distress calls from people trapped under the rubble of their homes, but I could do nothing for them,” he added, citing a lack of equipment, vehicles and ambulances. “Sadly, the next day, their voices were gone, and they were counted among the dead, with their homes becoming their graves. This scene is repeated daily.”Nidal al-Darini, 40, who is sheltering at the Indonesian Hospital with his two daughters, 10 and 8, said shelling around the hospital “does not stop.”Despite the hospital being staffed by just one doctor and one nurse, Darini said it houses approximately 80 people — mostly patients and their companions. Food and medical supplies are scarce.Strikes continued across Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces on Thursday issued a new evacuation order for Jabalya in the north, telling people who haven’t left to do so immediately.Razan Halawa lives in a warehouse near her recently bombed house in Jabalya, along with her husband, young daughter and 20 others.“We live in a constant state of terror,” she said. “Bombing is continuous; we hear tanks moving daily, shells falling everywhere and drones firing along our street.”Another strike on the Hamama school in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood in western Gaza City killed two and injured 10, according to the ambulance service of Gaza’s Health Ministry.Israeli forces hit Beirut suburbs for third consecutive dayReturn to menuThe Israel Defense Forces said it launched a series of airstrikes on targets around Beirut on Thursday, marking the third consecutive day of its attacks on the southern suburbs of the capital.Israeli forces struck 30 targets in suburbs south of Beirut over the past two days, the IDF said, an area that the IDF described as a Hezbollah stronghold.Lebanese state media reported strikes targeting at least three areas in Beirut’s suburbs around dawn, with more hits reported later Thursday in the Ghobeiry neighborhood south of the capital.Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman, issued fresh evacuation warnings for this area throughout Thursday, warning that Israeli forces intended to strike buildings in the area that he said were being used by Hezbollah.Away from the capital, Israeli troops conducted ground raids through southern Lebanon, the IDF said. Six more Israeli soldiers were killed fighting Hezbollah forces, the IDF said in a Wednesday update.On Tuesday, the most recent day for which data was available, Lebanon’s health ministry said another 78 people were killed and 122 injured in strikes across the country. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.In southern Lebanon, the IDF said it killed 200 Hezbollah militants over the past week, and disabled 140 launchers that it said the group used to fire rockets and projectiles over the border into Israel. The Washington Post could not independently verify the tolls.The strikes came as Israeli forces said Hezbollah militants continued to fire “projectiles” across the border into Israel. By Thursday afternoon, the IDF said around 25 of them had crossed into Israeli territory so far that day.Israel accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by rights groupReturn to menuHuman Rights Watch accused Israel of war crimes and crimes against humanity in a report Thursday, including using “starvation as a weapon of war,” two days after the Biden administration said it would not penalize Israel for failing to meet U.S. demands to increase aid flow.Based on interviews, analysis of Israel’s evacuation system and satellite imagery, the researchers concluded Israel has violated international law, which stipulates that an occupying power can displace civilians only when there is a military imperative to do so or for the population’s security. The report said Israel’s conduct has displaced more than 90 percent of Gaza’s population — 1.9 million Palestinians — over 13 months of war.“Evacuation routes and so-called safe zones were consistently and repeatedly bombed, undermining the Israeli position that people were moved for their safety,” Nadia Hardman, refugee and migrant rights researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a briefing for journalists this week. The report also warned that continued arms provision by the United States, Germany and other countries to Israel “risks complicity” in war crimes and crimes against humanity.Displaced Palestinians line up for food in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, on Nov. 10 as humanitarian organizations say the enclave is on the brink of mass starvation. (Video: Reuters)The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that it was “misguided and deeply misleading to portray ... the IDF’s extensive efforts to minimize civilian harm as tools for forcible displacement.” It said it “only operates in areas in which there is known to be a military presence, and is still at this time working to dismantle Hamas’ military infrastructure in various parts throughout the Gaza Strip.” “Contrary to claims in HRW’s report, Israel’s efforts are directed solely at dismantling Hamas’s terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza,” Oren Marmorstein, spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement. He added: “Israel views all civilian harm as a tragedy, while Hamas views all civilian harm as a strategy.”Fresh food, eggs and meat “barely exist” throughout the Gaza Strip, the World Food Program said Wednesday. In the besieged north, where Israeli forces have carried out a withering offensive since early October, experts have said famine looms for the estimated 50,000 to 75,000 people remaining.Israel says its operation in the north is targeting Hamas fighters who have regrouped. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, blames international organizations for the lack of distribution and said Tuesday it was “surging humanitarian aid” there, including by recently opening a new crossing in the Strip’s south.“There is no starvation and no famine,” the COGAT chief, Brig. Gen. Elad Goren, told The Washington Post last week.Israel prepares Lebanon cease-fire plan as ‘gift’ to Trump, officials sayReturn to menuTEL AVIV — A close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Donald Trump and Jared Kushner this week that Israel is rushing to advance a cease-fire deal in Lebanon, according to three current and former Israeli officials briefed on the meeting, with the aim of delivering an early foreign policy win to the president-elect.Ron Dermer, Netanyahu’s minister of strategic affairs, made Mar-a-Lago the first stop on his U.S. tour Sunday before traveling to the White House to update Biden administration officials on the state of Lebanon talks, a sign of how swiftly America’s political center of gravity has shifted after Trump’s electoral victory.“There is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump … that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon,” an Israeli official said. Like others in this article, the official spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.This is an excerpt from a full story.",
