  "text": "Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney told a press conference on Wednesday that \"high level\" talks are underway with the United States about joining US President Donald Trump's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.\"We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments in partnership (with the US). And it's something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level,\" Carney said.However, the Liberal Party leader, under whom it won a snap federal election last month after he succeeded fellow Liberal Justin Trudeau as prime minister in March, also warned of \"new and increasing missile threats.\"\"These threats, in the not too distant future, could come from space. We take those threats seriously,\" Carney stated.\"My government is also in talks with our European allies on becoming a full partner of ReArm Europe,\" he added, referring to an initiative to bolster European defense capabilities and industry.North American neighbours Canada and the United States are partners in continental defense through the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).At the same time, Ottawa is looking to diversify its trade and security partnerships after once its strong ties with Washington frayed over tariffs.It recently announced a review of a major purchase of US-made F-35 combat planes and signed a deal with Australia to develop Arctic radar systems.GoldenDomeThe ambitious, next-generation system draws inspiration from Israel's famous Iron Dome and has a projected cost as high as $542 billion over two decades. The Golden Dome is designed to be a space-based shield which will intercept incoming threats before they reach US soil. Unlike traditional systems which rely on ground-based interception, this initiative will use a constellation of satellites capable of detecting and engaging missiles in the early stages of flight. The technology is expected to provide protection even from missiles launched from other continents or from space, addressing evolving threats from countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and potentially Iran.",
