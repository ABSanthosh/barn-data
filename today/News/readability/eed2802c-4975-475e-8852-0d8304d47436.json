Washington understands the inevitability of Tehran's response. All this brings the spiral of confrontation to a new level and increases the risks of World War III,\" Slutsky, who heads the State Duma international affairs committee, wrote on Telegram.(Reuters) US Attacks Iran LIVE: France Urges Restraint, Diplomacy After \"Concerning\" US Strikes On Iran France's foreign minister said on Sunday that Paris was concerned by U.S. air strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites overnight and urged all sides to show restraint and move to towards a negotiated solution to the crisis.Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X that France, which had held talks with Iran on Friday in Geneva along with its European partners, had neither participated in these strikes nor in their planning.\"France has noted with concern the strikes carried out last night by the United States against three Iranian nuclear programme sites,\" Barrot, who spoke with his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio on Saturday evening, said.\"France is convinced that a lasting resolution to this issue requires a negotiated solution within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,\" Barrot wrote on X.

Israel Iran Attack LIVE Updates: Germany Calls On Iran To \"Immediately\" Resume Negotiations With US German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Sunday called for a swift return to diplomacy after the US struck three nuclear sites in Iran overnight, his spokesman said.Iran must \"immediately enter into negotiations with the US and Israel and to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict\", Merz said, according to his spokesman Stefan Kornelius.The German government believes \"large parts of Iran's nuclear programme have been damaged by the airstrikes\", Kornelius said.

The dramatic U.S. strike, including the targeting of Iran’s most heavily fortified nuclear installation deep underground, marks the biggest foreign policy gamble of Trump’s two presidencies and one fraught with risks and unknowns.Trump, who insisted on Saturday that Iran must now make peace or face further attacks, could provoke Tehran into retaliating by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery, attacking U.S. military bases and allies in the Middle East, stepping up its missile barrage on Israel and activating proxy groups against American and Israeli interests worldwide, analysts said. Such moves could escalate into a broader, more protracted conflict than Trump had envisioned, evoking echoes of the “forever wars” that America fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he had derided as “stupid” and promised never to be dragged into.“The Iranians are seriously weakened and degraded in their military capabilities,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. “But they have all sorts of asymmetric ways that they can respond... This is not going to end quick.” (Reuters) US Attack Iran News LIVE: Additional US Embassy Staff Left Iraq Due To \"Regional Tensions\" More personnel from the United States diplomatic mission departed Iraq over the weekend as part of ongoing efforts to reduce embassy staffing due to \"regional tensions\", a US official said Sunday after Washington attacked Iranian nuclear sites.After the US strikes, Iraq's government denounced a \"military escalation\" that threatens \"peace and stability in the Middle East.\"The US official told AFP that \"as part of our ongoing effort to streamline operations, additional personnel departed Iraq on June 21 and 22.\"The departures were a continuation of a process that started last week \"out of an abundance of caution and due to heightened regional tensions\", he added.The embassy and the consulate remain operational. US Attack Iran News LIVE: UN Watchdog Says \"No Increase\" In Radiation Levels After US Attack on Iran The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Sunday said that it had not detected any increase in radiation levels at key nuclear sites in Iran following US air strikes.\"Following attacks on three nuclear sites in Iran... the IAEA can confirm that no increase in off-site radiation levels has been reported as of this time,\" the nuclear watchdog posted on X, just hours after US President Donald Trump said the strikes had \"totally obliterated\" Iran's main nuclear sites at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz. Israel Iran Conflict LIVE: Iranian State TV Says Iran Launches 30 Missiles At Israel Iranian state television reported that Tehran launched 30 missiles at Israel on Sunday after US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Iran's armed forces said Sunday they targeted multiple sites in Israel including Ben Gurion airport, after US attacks on key nuclear sites in the Islamic republic.\"The twentieth wave of Operation Honest Promise 3 began using a combination of long-range liquid and solid fuel missiles with devastating warhead power,\" the armed forces said in a statement quoted by Fars news agency. The targets included the airport, a \"biological research centre\", logistics bases and various layers of command and control centres, it added. Israel Iran Conflict LIVE: Overview Of Iran's Nuclear Programme American planes launched a \"very successful attack\", US President Donald Trump said, claiming Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities had been \"completely and totally obliterated\". Trump has said Tehran must never get a nuclear weapon, and ally Israel has claimed its attacks on Iran have set back the country's nuclear weapons progress by several years. Iran has always denied any ambition to develop nuclear weapons and maintained its right to a civilian nuclear programme.Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme in recent years, after a landmark deal with world powers curbing its nuclear activities in exchange for sanction relief began to unravel in 2018 when the United States under Trump unilaterally withdrew. As of mid-May, Iran's total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 9,247.6 kilograms -- or more than 45 times the limit set out in the 2015 deal -- according to the latest report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Among its stockpiles, Iran has an estimated 408.6 kilograms (901 pounds) enriched to up to 60 percent -- just a short step from the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead. The country now theoretically has enough near-weapons-grade material, if further refined, for about 10 nuclear bombs, according to the definition by the Vienna-based IAEA. (AFP) Israel Iran Attacks LIVE: Israel Launches New Attack On Iran After 16 Hurt In Iranian Strikes At least 16 people were hurt and at least one impact was reported in central Israel after Iran launched two waves of missiles at the country following the US bombing of its nuclear sites, rescue services and reports said.

Israel Iran War LIVE: Airlines Keep Avoiding Middle East Airspace After US Attack On Iran Airlines continued to avoid large parts of the Middle East on Sunday after U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, with traffic already skirting airspace in the region due to recent missile exchanges.\"Following US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, commercial traffic in the region is operating as it has since new airspace restrictions were put into place last week,\" FlightRadar24 said on social media platform X.Its website showed airlines were not flying in the airspace over Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel. They have chosen other routings such as north via the Caspian Sea or south via Egypt and Saudi Arabia, even if it results in higher fuel and crew costs and longer flight times.Missile and drone barrages in an expanding number of conflict zones globally represent a high risk to airline traffic. (Reuters) US Attacks Iran LIVE: Iran's Foreign Minister Says Tehran Reserves \"All Options\" To Defend Sovereignty \"The United States, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has committed a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the NPT by attacking Iran's peaceful nuclear installations,\" Iran's Foreign Minister Sayyid Abbas Araghchi said in a statement. \"The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences.
