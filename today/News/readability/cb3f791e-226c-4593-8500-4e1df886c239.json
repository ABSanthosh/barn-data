  "text": "SEOUL — South Koreans headed to the polls Tuesday to vote for a new president two years early, following the impeachment and removal of Yoon Suk Yeol for declaring martial law for the first time in the nation’s democratic history.Polling stations opened at 6 a.m. local time, after record levels of early voting. Exit polls are expected soon after ballot boxes close at 8 p.m. local time.In typical South Korean style, campaign rallies have felt like K-pop performances, complete with choreographed dance moves and boppy tunes. But the serious issues of martial law, impeachment and democratic norms all loom large as voters cast their ballots.“Koreans on both sides of the aisle are fighting for their own version of what democracy means,” said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank.The new president will also need to contend with President Donald Trump’s volatile approach to U.S. allies and his perception that South Korea is a “money machine.” He has demanded that Seoul increase payments for having U.S. troops protect South Korea and has levied tariffs on key South Korean industries such as car manufacturing.The vote follows a tumultuous six months since the dramatic night in December when Yoon attempted to seize power. He was impeached by the end of that month and was also indicted on criminal charges that he led an insurrection. A court officially removed him from power in April, launching a 60-day period to elect a new president.And now voters will choose. Here’s what to know about the June 3 election.What to knowWho are the front-runners to be president?What are the main issues at play?Will the election heal South Korea’s political divisions?What does this mean for U.S.-South Korea relations?",
