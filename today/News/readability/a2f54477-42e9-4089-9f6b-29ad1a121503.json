  "text": "Chuck Schumer, with Sen. Tina Smith as Senate Democrats gathered behind closed doors to mount a last-ditch protest over a Republican-led spending bill, before announcing his supportA day after stating that Democrats will oppose the GoP funding bill, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer conceded on Thursday, announcing his readiness to proceed with a Republican-backed government funding bill that has significantly divided Democrats who sought to restrict the Trump administration.In private discussions during a heated lunch meeting and subsequent public statements before Friday's vote, the New York senator acknowledged that despite the GOP bill's flaws, a shutdown would be more detrimental, potentially giving President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk unrestricted authority in government operations, as reported by the Associated Press.\"Trump has taken a blowtorch to our country and wielded chaos like a weapon,\" Schumer said. \"For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift. It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.\"This comes after Schumer on Wednesday had announced that his party members would not support the House-approved bill maintaining current federal funding levels for six months. Instead, he advocated for a one-month extension to enable Congress to evaluate individual spending bills and reach a mutually acceptable agreement. \"Our caucus is unified\" on such a measure to \"keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" Schumer had stated briefly from the floor.Thus, Schumer's shifted stance potentially resolves a prolonged impasse. Senate Democrats had initiated a final protest regarding the package, which had secured House approval without the restrictions they sought on Trump and billionaire Musk's attempts to restructure federal operations.Democratic legislators face significant pressure to counter the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, which is substantially altering established government agencies and dismissing numerous federal employees.Trump extended an offer to negotiate on Thursday: \"If they need me, I'm there 100%.\" The president subsequently directed responsibility towards Democrats for potential disruptions, stating during an Oval Office meeting, \"If it shuts down, it's not the Republicans' fault.\"Democrats proposed a temporary 30-day funding measure as an alternative, but according to Schumer, Republicans rejected this proposal. Despite strategic disagreements among Democrats, they expressed concerns about potential disruption under Trump and Musk during a government closure.During an animated private lunch, Schumer informed Democrats of his intention to proceed with the bill. These details, initially reported by The New York Times, were confirmed by two anonymous sources familiar with the discussions. quoted by AP.As Thursday's Senate session began, with the Friday midnight deadline approaching, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared, \"It's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait.\"Regular debates about federal funding often intensify near deadlines, but this year's situation demonstrates Republicans' political advantage with their majority control of the White House and Congress, whilst highlighting Democrats' limitations in preventing the Trump administration's modifications to federal operations.House Republicans achieved an unusual unity in passing their bill, with conservatives supporting the DOGE reductions while Democrats remained opposed. The House subsequently adjourned, leaving final action to the Senate.Schumer's options remained limited, with no guarantee of final passage before the deadline. The Republican 53-47 majority requires Democratic support to achieve the necessary 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster.\"I'm in the camp of like, don't ever, ever shut the government down,\" expressed Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa.Democrats face a crucial decision within 24 hours- provide votes to advance the package funding government operations through September's end or risk a shutdown after midnight Friday.\"They'll cave,\" stated Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn. Cornyn noted the Democrats' contradictory position of criticising Musk and the Trump administration regarding federal employee reductions whilst potentially causing complete work stoppage through a government shutdown.Meanwhile, progressive Democrats, including House allies, urged resistance against Trump, despite shutdown risks. Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, posted that the House GOP bill will \"supercharge Musk's theft from working people to pay for billionaire tax cuts. Senate Democrats must stop it.\"Unusually, the House package requires the District of Columbia to revert to 2024 levels despite having approved its balanced budget, prompting protests from city leadership warning of service reductions. Schumer committed to \"work with them to fix it.\"Democratic senators continue evaluating options before voting. \"Both choices that we are being offered are full of despair,\" remarked Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo.",
