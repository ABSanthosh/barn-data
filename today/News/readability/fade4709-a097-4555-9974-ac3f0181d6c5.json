  "text": "This is a representational AI imageA New Jersey man is suing United Airlines, alleging that a pilot forcibly removed him from an aeroplane bathroom mid-flight while his pants were still down before having him arrested.The passenger, 20-year-old Yisroel Liebb, says he was flying from Mexico to Texas when he experienced constipation and spent an extended period in the restroom. According to his lawsuit, his seatmate, Jacob Sebbag, grew concerned and alerted the flight crew when Liebb had been inside for about 20 minutes.When a flight attendant knocked, Liebb reportedly assured them he would be out soon. However, 10 minutes later, the pilot allegedly demanded he exit immediately.The lawsuit claims that, in a fit of anger, the pilot broke down the bathroom door and yanked Liebb out while his pants were still down, exposing him to fellow passengers. As he scrambled to pull up his pants, the pilot allegedly threatened to have both him and his seatmate arrested, making a remark about how \"Jews act,\" the lawsuit states.Upon landing, the pair were met by five US customs and border protection agents, who detained them inside the terminal. Liebb claims the handcuffs were so tight that he cried out in pain, while he and Sebbag missed their connecting flight to New York due to the ordeal.Though they were released without charges, the two had to pay for hotel and meal expenses before they could fly home the next day, according to the complaint.Liebb alleges he suffered injuries to his head and legs when he was forcefully removed from the bathroom, while both men claim they experienced severe wrist pain from the handcuffs.The lawsuit, which also names homeland security, the transportation security administration, and customs and border protection, seeks damages to be determined at trial, plus attorneys' fees.United Airlines declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
