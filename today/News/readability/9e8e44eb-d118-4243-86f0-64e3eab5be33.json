  "text": "Results are starting to come in. Here’s the latest.The first polls have closed in Canada in a deeply consequential election that will decide the country’s next leader, its response to President Trump’s threats and the shape of its economic future at a time of global turmoil. More polls will close across the country over the coming hours, with results expected late Monday.Pre-election opinion surveys showed the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, with a slight advantage over the Conservative Party and its leader, Pierre Poilievre, as voters headed to the polls to elect their parliamentary representatives. The leader of the party that wins the most seats will become prime minister.Three more parties, all projected to secure small numbers of seats in the country’s parliament, the House of Commons, are in the fray: the left-wing New Democratic Party; the Greens; and the Bloc Quebecois, which is focused on gaining sovereignty for Quebec.Just three months ago, the Conservatives had been leading polls by more than 25 percentage points, and Mr. Poilievre appeared all but certain to become Canada’s next prime minister. Justin Trudeau and the Liberals had led the country for a decade, becoming increasingly unpopular.But Mr. Trudeau’s resignation in March and Mr. Trump’s tariffs and sovereignty threats against Canada upended the race. With Mr. Carney as the party leader and prime minister, the Liberals rapidly gained support as the ones to better handle Mr. Trump.In Canada’s parliamentary system, voters choose who they want to represent their electoral district, known in Canada as a riding; the candidate who has the most votes wins, and the party that has the most seats becomes the ruling government, even if they do not control the majority. There are 343 seats in parliament.But the two leaders vying to become Canada’s next prime minister are central to the choice Canadians are making on Monday, and they offer different personalities, experiences and visions for the nation at a critical juncture.Here’s what else to know:The incumbent: Mr. Carney, 60, replaced Mr. Trudeau as prime minister just last month. He is a former central banker and executive with a global career. A dedicated centrist who has spent a lifetime in rarefied high-power circles, he has built his pitch as an anti-Trump, vowing to devote his financial expertise to improving his country’s economy and shielding it from Mr. Trump’s tariffs and annexation threats.The challenger: Mr. Poilievre, 45, is a career politician who supports deregulation and a smaller federal government. His tonal and ideological similarities to Mr. Trump — he denounces “woke ideology,” wants to defund the national broadcaster and slash foreign aid — have put off some voters, who see him as too similar to Mr. Trump at a time when the U.S. president is seen as an enemy of Canada.Closing times: Polls opened in a staggered manner to make vote counting easier across the vast country’s six time zones. Most will close at 9:30 p.m. Eastern time.Results: The first polls to close were in Newfoundland, at 7 p.m. Eastern time, with the rest of Atlantic Canada and Labrador scheduled to follow at 7:30 p.m. Ballots are counted by hand, not machines. The New York Times will provide live results coverage with detailed information about every district race.Choosing leaders: Party leaders were chosen by party members in earlier votes. In federal elections, voters do not vote for Canada’s leader, as they might in a presidential system.Nasuna Stuart-UlinReporting from OttawaSupporters of the Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, wait for the party’s election night event to begin in Ottawa.Nasuna Stuart-Ulin for The New York TimesAfter a record advance poll turnout of 7.3 million people, Elections Canada is allowing officials in some electoral districts to begin counting those votes before the polls close. In the past, the advance vote was tallied after the election day ballots. The ridings with an early advance count include the seat currently held by Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative leader. It had about 44,000 advance votes, the most in the country.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhen will we know the results?ImageCanada uses paper ballots, which employees of Elections Canada count by hand at every polling station.Credit...Nasuna Stuart-Ulin for The New York TimesThe results of Canada’s federal election will most likely be known on Monday evening.Canada uses paper ballots, which employees of Elections Canada count by hand at every polling station; no counting machines are used. Candidates are allowed to appoint representatives to oversee the counting process.The polling stations’ results are then reported to Elections Canada, which immediately releases them online.Because the ballot boxes are not moved to central counting locations, the first results usually begin trickling in soon after the polls close. The full count tends to extend until well after the broad results of the election have become clear.Polls have now closed across Atlantic Canada. At 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, polls will close in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. The last polls in Canada to close will be in the westernmost province of British Columbia, where voting will continue until 10 p.m. Eastern time.The website of Elections Canada, the independent agency that runs the vote, went down at about 7:20 p.m. Eastern time, delaying the release of results from Atlantic Canada and preventing voters elsewhere from accessing voting information.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTClimate change, once a big issue, fades from Canada’s election.ImageGas flare as seen from Kitamaat, British Columbia.Credit...Pat Kane for The New York TimesThe melting Arctic icecap. Record-smashing wildfires across several provinces. A country that, on average, is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world.And yet, as Canadians go to the polls Monday, climate change isn’t even among the top 10 issues for voters, according to recent polling.“That’s just not what this election is about,” said Jessica Green, a political scientist at the University of Toronto who focuses on climate issues.What the election is about, nearly everyone agrees, is choosing a leader who can stand up to Donald J. Trump. The American president has been threatening Canada with a trade war, if not total annexation as the “51st state.”Leading in the polls is the Liberals’ Mark Carney, who has a decades-long pedigree in climate policy. For five years, he was United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, and he spearheaded a coalition of banks that promised to stop adding carbon dioxide to the environment through their lending and investments by 2050.Despite that résumé, Mr. Carney has not made climate central to his campaign. When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down, one of Mr. Carney’s first moves was to scrap one of his predecessor’s least popular policies, a tax on fuel that included gasoline at the pump and was based on emissions intensity.Even though most Canadians got much of that money back in rebate checks, Mr. Carney called the policy poorly understood and thus “too divisive.”That move, coupled with what many see as similarities between his Conservative Party opponent, Pierre Poilievre, and Mr. Trump, have helped Mr. Carney as he’s risen in the polls.Claudia CulleyReporting from Vancouver“I think (Pierre Poilievre) wants Canada to thrive. He wants not just the rich people to thrive, but also, like, the working class people as well.”Jack DeWitt, 19, a music student who said he was voting Conservative because the current Liberal government “hasn't gone well at all.”ImageCredit...Claudia CulleyThe first polls in Canada’s national election have closed, in Newfoundland.

In Canada’s election, it’s a liability.ImageMark Carney with Xi Jinping of China during G20 meetings in Hangzhou, China, in 2016.Credit...Bernd von Jutrczenka/picture alliance, via Getty ImagesAsked to name the biggest threat to Canada’s security during an election debate, Mark Carney, the country’s prime minister and Liberal Party leader running to win a full term, gave a surprising answer: “China.”Analysts saw it as an attempt to distance himself from the country amid heightened scrutiny on his own past work there.Mr. Carney, a former central banker and business executive, dealt with the Chinese establishment in his recent private-sector roles for companies with investments in China.But what was once an asset — experience working with a rising global power — has become a political liability in Monday’s national elections.Mr. Carney and the Liberals have come under criticism for supporting a parliamentary candidate with connections to groups representing China’s Communist Party in Canada. Foreign interference in diaspora communities in Canada by China, India and other nations has been a concern for both parties, and the subject of inquiries.The relationship between Canada and China sharply deteriorated following a diplomatic crisis that began when Canada detained a Chinese executive in 2018 on behalf of the United States.Days later, the Chinese authorities detained two Canadian men, holding them for two and a half years.For many Canadians, the dispute underscored the ruthlessness of China’s Communist Party.“If you take the pulse of Canadian society, most people would hold unfavorable views toward China,” said Lynette Ong, a Chinese politics professor at the University of Toronto. “It’s politically incorrect to say out loud that there is a need to work with China on certain issues.”Of the various accusations leveled against Mr. Carney as he tries to lead his party to victory in Monday’s election, claims about his allegedly nefarious links to China have been the most persistent.Immigration policy, once expected to be an election-defining issue, has fallen among voters’ concerns.ImageInternational students and others lining up for buses in Brampton, Ontario, where many students and temporary workers from India have settled.Credit...Ian Willms for The New York TimesImmigration policy dominated the attention of Canadians in the weeks before Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as prime minister in January. But as voters cast their ballots on Monday, the issue has notably lost traction behind pressing concerns over the country’s economy and President Trump’s tariffs.Mr. Trudeau’s government had turbocharged immigration in a bid to address Canada’s labor shortage, announcing in November 2022 that the government planned to bring in almost 1.5 million immigrants between 2023 and 2025.But when those newcomers arrived and settled mostly in dense, urban areas, Canadians blamed the rising immigration levels for growing pressure on housing costs and social services like health care.As Mr. Trudeau’s popularity dropped, his unpopular policy to accelerate immigration was dramatically undone. Several ministers announced their resignations when it appeared that Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals could not recover from the political damage of policies that included immigration.As Canada rolled back its pathways for newcomers, Marc Miller, the last immigration minister under Mr. Trudeau, also linked societal strains to the number of newcomers in explaining the government’s decisions to scale back admissions.The moment represented a sharp change in tone for Canada.“For the longest time, immigration had always been lauded as a net benefit to the Canadian economy,” said Antje Ellermann, a director at the Center for Migration Studies at the University of British Columbia. “That really was a mantra, and policymakers were very careful not to talk about any potential costs of immigration.”Then somewhat overnight, after Mr. Trump began to amplify his threats to Canada’s economy, the issue of immigration — which had partially caused the Liberals’ downfall — faded into the background.“If it hadn’t been for Trump, we would see immigration as a quite salient issue in this campaign,” Ms. Ellermann said.Polls have shown that Canadians think the country is accepting more immigrants than it should, an attitude that has prevailed, even among many of the newcomers.“A lot of immigrants in Canada also feel there are too many immigrants,” said Jack Jedwab, chief executive of the Association for Canada Studies, a research group, and the Metropolis Institute, a think tank focused on migration.Mr. Jedwab’s recent analysis, based on surveys conducted by the firm Leger, showed higher support for Liberals among immigrants whose first language is neither English nor French. But that is a small minority in Canada.“Our demographics have evolved so much that it’s hard to really refer to an ‘immigrant vote,’” said Mr. Jedwab, adding that immigrants tend to vote based on regional trends.As much is clear in Brampton, Ontario, a suburban city west of Toronto where more than half of residents are South Asian. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre focused an April 9 campaign rally on crime control, knowing the city’s residents faced rampant home invasions, car thefts and extortion rackets that targeted immigrants.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAng Li and McKinnon de KuyperReporting from Windsor, Ontario“I grew up liberal and I’m a diehard … I like their policies.”Brian Hennessy, 73, was a production worker at General Motors for 31 years.

Critics say she has courted ideological minorities, including fervent anti-vaccine organizations, advocates for Albertan secessionism and hard-line anti-trans activists, to secure her election.She has been careful to make those groups feel included in her agenda while not fully endorsing their rhetoric.That ability, along with the political freedom afforded by her lack of interest in national office, has put her at the vanguard of Canada’s changing right.In recent months, Ms. Smith has defended her pro-Trump overtures as a diplomatic approach that complements the more aggressive stance taken by the federal government.Simply put, she said of her Trump ties, “I’m happy to be good cop.”Stephanie NolenReporting from Halifax, Nova Scotia“I like having my rights, as a woman. I care about that a lot, so I have to make sure the Conservatives don’t win. This is my first time voting Liberal – I usually support the N.D.P. and think they're great.

Ontario and Quebec, the most populous provinces, which fall in the Eastern time zone, will vote from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.The country’s westernmost province, British Columbia, will close a half-hour later than Ontario and Quebec do, at 10 p.m. Eastern.(Elections Canada, the nonpartisan agency that administers the federal election, has a complete list of polling hours.)About 7.3 million Canadians cast their ballots during the early-voting period, April 18 to April 21, according to Elections Canada, a 25 percent increase over early-voting turnout in the 2021 election.Nori OnishiReporting from Montreal“It’s important for me that Quebec be represented in Ottawa.

But in French-speaking Quebec, it’s the Liberals versus the Bloc Québécois, a party that runs candidates in Canada’s federal elections, though only in the province of Quebec, and champions Quebec independence. Just a few months ago, the Bloc was so far ahead in the polls that analysts said it had a good chance of becoming the main opposition to a Conservative-led government. But the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Trump’s threats against Canada upended the elections, leaving the Bloc struggling, according to the polls. Many Bloc supporters came to the conclusion that the French language and Quebec’s culture would have a better chance of surviving inside Canada, not as part of a 51st American state. Bloc strongholds around the island of Montreal suddenly became battlegrounds. ImageYannick Maheu, 52, and his daughter Rosaly, 20.Credit...Nori Onishi/The New York TimesIn one such electoral district south of Montreal, La Prairie-Atateken, where the Bloc won comfortably in the past two elections, polls showed a dead heat. A longtime Bloc supporter, Yannick Maheu, 52, voted for the Bloc, along with his daughter, Rosaly, 20, who was voting for the first time. But he said he had also been drawn by Mark Carney as the best equipped to deal with Mr. Trump and was pleased that polls show the Liberals heading toward a victory. “I wouldn’t have supported the Liberals if Justin Trudeau were still prime minister,” he said. “But with Carney, under the current circumstances, I think a Liberal government will be good for us.” ImageChristine Lussier, 55, and her husband, Raymond Thibert, 67Credit...Nori Onishi/The New York TimesChristine Lussier, 55, and her husband, Raymond Thibert, 67, voted for the Liberal candidate.

But three candidates piled on the fourth: Prime Minister Mark Carney, the former central banker of Canada and England, who took the office last month after being elected the leader of the Liberal Party.Mr. Carney’s opponents included his chief contender, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party, which for much of the past year had dominated polls and appeared headed for a certain victory in the April 28 federal election. Mr. Carney’s move into politics and Mr. Trump’s economic and political assault on Canada have since reversed the fortunes of the Conservatives, with the Liberals enjoying a slight lead in the polls.The other candidates were Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party and Yves-François Blanchet, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, a party that promotes Quebec’s independence and runs candidates only in that province.The key takeaways from the two-hour debate: No one had concrete ideas on pushing back against Trump. The candidates were divided on crime. They argued over the funding of public broadcasting. They debated building oil and gas pipelines. And the Trudeau legacy hung over the debate.All of the politicians agreed that President Trump’s economic policies and his proposal to annex Canada have created a crisis.But none of them offered any specific details about how they would get the American leader to change course, beyond general talk of tough negotiations at which they would assert Canada’s sovereignty and economic independence.“They want to break us so that they can own us,” Mr. Carney said.Mr. Carney leaned on his past as the governor of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 economic crisis and his time as the governor of the Bank of England during Brexit to present himself as the ideal negotiator.Mr. Poilievre, a lifelong politician, criticized the Liberal government of the last decade as putting Canada “under the thumb” of the United States.Pat KaneReporting from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories“The liberals mentioned Indigenous issues and people a number of times in their campaigning, and the conservatives didn’t.

But when he stood onstage for the closing credits of the show, he said, “I got angrier and angrier.”He thought about Mr. Musk’s remark that Canada is “not a real country,” and about how President Trump had called the former Canadian prime minister “Governor Trudeau” and rudely referred to Canada as “the 51st state.” He thought about tariffs, and about graffiti he’d seen in Winnipeg: “There’s no greater pain than being betrayed by a friend.”And he thought about the legendary Canadian hockey player Gordie Howe and his famous “elbows up” response to aggression on the ice.And so Mr. Myers, the 61-year-old star of the “Wayne’s World,” “Austin Powers” and “Shrek” films and a beloved figure on both sides of the Canadian-American border, boldly opened his down vest and flashed his “Canada Is Not for Sale” T-shirt on live television. “Elbows up,” he mouthed into the camera, twice.“What happened came from my ankles and from my brain and from my heart, and it was not about me — it was about my country,” he said. “I wanted to send a message home to say that I’m with you, you know.”Ximena GonzalezReporting from Calgary, Alberta“I’m not the most happy with some of the decisions of the Liberal government over the last 10 years. As a party leader, I actually prefer Mark Carney to Pierre (Poilievre), but I felt like we needed a change, so I voted conservative.”Chris Gooding, 28, a business strategy consultant in Calgary-Centre. He said he hopes his vote can help advance capital projects in Alberta’s energy and resource extraction sectors.ImageCredit...Ximena GonzalezDespite his shaky French, Mark Carney is a hit in Quebec.ImageAn election poster for Prime Minister Mark Carney in Blainville, Quebec.Credit...Renaud Philippe for The New York TimesWhen Prime Minister Mark Carney appeared in mid-April on Quebec’s most popular talk show, “Tout le Monde en Parle,” the most consequential question may not have been about President Trump or tariffs. Instead, it was probably when the host asked him what he “knew or liked about” Canada’s French-speaking province.“A singer? A city? A feature? A cheese? Anything?” the host, Guy Lepage, suggested, in French, as Mr. Carney laughed but gave no clear answer.Winning over voters in Quebec has usually, in great part, meant winning hearts by speaking French, grasping the province’s history and appreciating its culture. That was never going to be easy for Mr. Carney, a political novice whose appeals to Québécois voters have been marked by his faltering French and a series of gaffes that have raised doubts about his basic knowledge of Quebec, the country’s second-most-populous province.Until a few months ago, the Bloc Québécois — a party that runs candidates for the federal Parliament in Quebec but that supports independence for the province — appeared headed for a big victory that would have considerably hurt Mr. Carney’s chances of winning the April 28 federal election. But Mr. Carney and his Liberal Party now have a huge lead in the polls in Quebec.The abrupt reversal is another sign of how Mr. Trump’s tariffs and aggressive threats of annexation have upended Canada’s elections. Most Canadians regard Mr. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England who has never before run for office, as the most capable candidate to deal with the American president, polls show. Even many hardcore supporters of the Bloc Québécois are now considering Mr. Carney and are cutting him some slack for his lack of connection to Quebec.“He seems competent,” said Yves Lefebvre, 67, a retired roofer who was shopping Monday at a supermarket in Sainte-Thérèse, a Bloc stronghold north of Montreal. “I don’t care if he speaks only English.”Mr. Lefebvre, who said he usually votes for the Bloc, said he was hesitating this time because he was worried about Mr. Trump’s tariffs. That Mr. Carney appeared to know little about Quebec did not matter, Mr. Lefebvre said, adding, “I don’t understand English. I go to Ontario and I’m clueless.”Analysts like to say that in Canada’s elections, Ontario, the province with the biggest population and 36 percent of the seats in Parliament, effectively decides who wins a federal election. It is difficult for any party that does poorly in Ontario to make up the difference in the rest of the country. But Quebec, with a 23 percent share of the seats, decides whether a party will get a majority, which would allow it to govern without a smaller party’s support.",

Most Canadians regard Mr. Carney, a former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England who has never before run for office, as the most capable candidate to deal with the American president, polls show. Even many hardcore supporters of the Bloc Québécois are now considering Mr. Carney and are cutting him some slack for his lack of connection to Quebec.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He seems competent,” said Yves Lefebvre, 67, a retired roofer who was shopping Monday at a supermarket in Sainte-Thérèse, a Bloc stronghold north of Montreal. “I don’t care if he speaks only English.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Lefebvre, who said he usually votes for the Bloc, said he was hesitating this time because he was worried about Mr. Trump’s tariffs. That Mr. Carney appeared to know little about Quebec did not matter, Mr. Lefebvre said, adding, “I don’t understand English. I go to Ontario and I’m clueless.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalysts like to say that in Canada’s elections, Ontario, the province with the biggest population and 36 percent of the seats in Parliament, effectively decides who wins a federal election. It is difficult for any party that does poorly in Ontario to make up the difference in the rest of the country. But Quebec, with a 23 percent share of the seats, decides whether a party will get a majority, which would allow it to govern without a smaller party’s support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
