  "text": "At least 36 people were killed and dozens more injured in an explosion at a pharmaceutical factory in the southern Indian state of Telangana, state authorities said. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue workers continue to search the site following Monday’s blast. Authorities said 12 people remain missing.The blast occurred around 9 a.m. local time Monday at a plant in Pashamylaram, some 30 miles west of Hyderabad, the state capital. According to reports by local outlets, the explosion flattened a four-story building and threw workers hundreds of feet. More than 140 people were on-site when the explosion occurred, officials told reporters.The bodies were “badly burnt and mutilated,” Telangana Health Minister Damodar Raja Narasimha told the Associated Press, and DNA tests were necessary to identify remains. The cause of the explosion is under investigation.Photos from the scene show rubble heaped stories high.Families of workers at a factory in India's southern Telangana state searched for loved ones after an explosion killed dozens on June 30. (Video: Reuters)The Telangana state government and Sigachi Industries, the operator of the factory, are set to pay 10 million rupees, around $117,000, to family members of each of the deceased, Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy said in televised remarks. Injured workers are also set to receive compensation.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences on X and pledged an additional 200,000 rupees, around $2,300, to the families of the deceased.Shares of Sigachi on the Mumbai-based National Stock Exchange tumbled nearly 10 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday. The Pashamylaram plant is one of Sigachi’s three manufacturing units, according to company documentation, and accounts for over a quarter of Sigachi’s total manufacturing capacity. The plant produces microcrystalline cellulose, a chemical commonly used in vitamin supplements and tablets, the company told the AP.The firm did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the cause of the explosion or its response to it.India has the third-largest pharmaceutical industry in the world by volume and is the leading supplier of generic medicines and vaccines.Labor and human rights watchdogs have warned of inadequate safety measures and lax oversight in some Indian factories.In a 2020 report on human rights in India, the U.S. State Department found that health and safety inspection capacity was insufficient and enforcement often poor. Global union federation InustriALL said that some 235 workers died across 116 industrial accidents in India between May 2020 and June 2021, according to media accounts and reports by the group’s affiliates.The Pashamylaram blast came after a series of industrial accidents in the country. An August explosion at a chemical plant in Atchutapuram, in the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh, left 17 workers dead. In May 2024, two unrelated explosions at chemical factories in Mumbai and the eastern state of Chhattisgarh killed at least 11, according to news items published by Britain’s Royal Society of Chemistry.The 1984 Bhopal disaster, the world’s worst industrial accident, occurred when a leak at a pesticide plant exposed hundreds of thousands of people in the central Indian city of Bhopal to a highly toxic gas and left a death toll in the thousands.",
