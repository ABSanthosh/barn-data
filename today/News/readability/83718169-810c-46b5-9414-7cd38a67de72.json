  "text": "E-4B 'Nightwatch' (Picture credit: US Air Force)While Air Force One is often recognized as the US president’s \"flying Oval Office,\" the E-4B \"Nightwatch\" plays an even more crucial role in national security. Often referred to as a \"flying war room,\" this highly specialized aircraft is designed to serve as a mobile command center in the event of a nuclear crisis, ensuring the safety of the president, senior officials, and key military leaders.Unmatched capabilitiesThe E-4B, a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200, is equipped with advanced technology and defense systems that allow it to operate in extreme conditions. Its primary purpose is to maintain command and control over military operations during a crisis, especially in the event of a nuclear attack. Unlike Air Force One, which serves as the president's mobile office, the E-4B is built to withstand a nuclear blast and maintain secure communications under all circumstances.The plane's impressive features include a \"ray dome\" on top, housing 67 satellite dishes and antennas that provide the E-4B with far more communication capabilities than Air Force One. Additionally, its exterior is shielded against thermal and nuclear effects, and its electrical systems are designed to resist electromagnetic pulses (EMPs).Training and operational costsOperating the E-4B is no small feat. In 2022, the US Air Force invested $9.5 million in a simulator to train E-4B crews, including pilots and flight engineers. These high operational costs are necessary to ensure the aircraft can remain airborne for extended periods—up to 12 hours without refueling, and indefinitely with mid-air refueling capabilities.A flexible and self-sufficient aircraftThe E-4B's main deck is divided into six functional areas: a command room, conference room, briefing room, operations work area, communications room, and rest area. This design allows officials to manage crisis situations, hold meetings, and communicate with both domestic and international contacts while in the air. The plane can accommodate up to 112 people, including the president, senior military leaders, and essential staff.Secretary of defense's trusted companionBeyond its role in supporting presidential operations, the E-4B is also used by the secretary of defense for international travel. The plane ensures the secretary has secure communications and a fully functional command center wherever they go, providing a level of continuity even in the most unstable global environments. The E-4B also serves as a press briefing location when the secretary of defense is abroad, ensuring that crucial information can be communicated seamlessly during high-stakes situations.",
