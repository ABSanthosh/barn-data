  "text": "United Nations: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres Monday voiced concern over tensions between India and Pakistan being at \"at their highest in years\" and called for \"maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink\".\"Make no mistake: A military solution is no solution,\" Guterres said in a brief statement.Guterres offered his \"good offices\" to both governments in the service of peace. \"The United Nations stands ready to support any initiative that promotes de-escalation, diplomacy, and a renewed commitment to peace,\" he said.His remarks came hours before closed consultations of the UN Security Council on India-Pakistan tensions after Islamabad sought an emergency meeting.\"Tensions between India and Pakistan are at their highest in years. I deeply respect and am profoundly grateful to the Government and people of both countries - and their significant contributions to the work of the United Nations, not least UN peacekeeping,\" Guterres said.\"And so it pains me to see relations reaching a boiling point,\" he said.Guterres said that he understands the \"raw feelings\" following the \"awful terror attack\" in Pahalgam on April 22 and again strongly condemned that attack, extending his condolences to the families of the \"Targeting civilians is unacceptable - and those responsible must be brought to justice through credible and lawful means,\" he said.\"It is also essential - especially at this critical hour -- to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,\" Guterres added.\"Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink,\" he said.Ties between India and Pakistan plummeted following the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.India announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan including suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, shutting down of the only operation land border crossing at Attari and downgrading of diplomatic ties following the terror attack.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is committed to taking \"firm and decisive\" action against terrorists and their backers.Modi also told the top defence brass that the armed forces have \"complete operational freedom\" to decide on the mode, targets and timing of India's response to the attack.Amid raging tensions, Pakistan requested closed consultations on the situation and the Greek Presidency has scheduled the meeting for May 5 in the afternoon.Pakistan currently sits as a non-permanent member of the powerful 15-nation Security Council, which is being presided over by Greece for the month of May.Apart from the five veto-wielding permanent members -- China, France, Russia, the UK and the US -- the 10 non-permanent members in the Council are Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Pakistan, Panama, South Korea, Sierra Leone, Slovenia and Somalia.In the weeks following the Pahalgam attack, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke with all Council members, except China and Pakistan. He also spoke with Guterres.In his calls, Jaishankar underlined that \"its perpetrators, backers and planners must be brought to justice.\" Last Friday, Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said at a press conference at the UN that his country has the right to convene a meeting when \"we feel appropriate\".He said the situation that evolved after the Pahalgam attack is a real threat to regional and international peace and security.The closed-door meeting will not take place in the UNSC Chamber where Council members sit at the powerful horse-shoe table but in a consultations room next to the chamber.Last week, Ahmad met Guterres and briefed him about the security situation in the region.Guterres last week also spoke to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
