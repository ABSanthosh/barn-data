Taking to X, Musk invoked the legacy of Epaminondas, the Greek general credited with ending Spartan dominance at the Battle of Leuctra.He said the new party will apply \"extremely concentrated force at a precise location on the battlefield\" to shatter the current political status quo.Musk also suggested at the party timeline when he would run for elections. Replying to X user who asked Musk about his election plans, to which he responded, “Next year”. Musk's announcement came on Saturday, just a day after President Donald Trump signed his \"big, beautiful\" tax-cut and spending bill into law which Musk openly criticized. A day earlier, during the July 4 Independence Day celebrations, Musk had signaled his intentions on The America Party by posting a poll on X, asking: \"Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!\"Musk came out strongly against the legislation, denouncing it as \"debt slavery\" and accusing Republican lawmakers of betraying their promises of fiscal cut.The clash quickly escalated, with Trump hitting back by threatening to pull federal funding from Musk's companies and even hinting at the possibility of deportation.Epaminondas was a Theban leader born around 410 BC. He waged a war against Sparta, a prominent city-state in the Peloponnese region in ancient Greece, renowned for its powerful military. He defeated the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC and led several successful campaigns into the Peloponnese.",
