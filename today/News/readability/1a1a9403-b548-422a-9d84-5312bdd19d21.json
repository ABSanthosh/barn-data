  "text": "BRUSSELS — The European Union and Canada hit back Wednesday at President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs with levies of their own on billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. products, including bourbon and motorcycles, while warning of further retaliation.The European Union unveiled a two-stage response that will target up to $28 billion in U.S. exports. Canada announced 25 percent tariffs on $20.7 billion.The U.S. decision to raise tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent took effect Wednesday — the latest salvo in Trump’s campaign to reshape America’s trading relationship with the world.European leaders for months warned that they would retaliate swiftly against new U.S. tariffs, even as they emphasized that a trade war would hurt both sides and tried to negotiate an off-ramp with the Trump administration.With a deal elusive, the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive branch, said it will reimpose tariffs dating to Trump’s first term on April 1. After consultations, leaders said, the commission will target an additional $19 billion in products by mid-April.“We deeply regret this measure,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. “Jobs are at stake, prices up, nobody needs that.” She and other leaders said they remained ready to negotiate.Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the government is matching Trump’s increased tariffs on steel and aluminum “dollar for dollar.”The Canadian tariffs, set to start at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, will hit steel products worth roughly $8.7 billion, aluminum products worth $2.08 billion and other products worth $9.85 billion. LeBlanc said the U.S. tariffs were unfairly targeting Canada’s important steel and aluminum industry and creating “disruption and disorder” for consumers in both countries. Canada was the top steel supplier to the United States last year.The levies also disturbed U.S. trade relations with other countries. In Brazil, officials reacted to steel tariffs with anger. The United States is the largest foreign market for Brazilian steel. President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, speaking at a car factory in southeastern Brazil, said he wouldn’t be intimidated.“It doesn’t matter if Trump keeps yelling, because I’ve learned not to be frightened of an ugly face,” Lula said. “Speak calmly with me, speak with respect to me.”But Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said Wednesday that his country was not ready to retaliate. He said the Brazilian steel sector does not compete with the American steel industry but collaborates with it, and Brazil will try to negotiate a way out of the impasse. Later, the Lula administration said it might complain to the World Trade Organization. “The Brazilian government laments the decision taken by the American government,” the administration said in a statement.South Korea, Japan and Australia, security allies that sell significant volumes of steel and aluminum to the United States, held out hope for exemptions from the tariffs, though Trump has insisted there will be none. All were granted carve-outs from Trump’s tariffs in 2018; none retaliated Wednesday.E.U. officials said their countermeasures would be designed for maximum political pressure. They hoped they would give the 27-nation bloc leverage to reach a deal.The sides have been here before. When Trump imposed tariffs on the European Union during his first term, its leaders responded with levies on industries based in the home states of Republican leaders, such as bourbon from Kentucky, represented by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and iconic American products such as Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Levi’s jeans.Those tariffs were suspended after negotiations with the Biden administration. But that suspension will now be allowed to expire April 1.E.U. leaders will consult with member states and industry leaders on additional tariffs.The European Commission published a 99-page list of U.S. goods that could be hit, including chewing gum, soybeans, home appliances, beef, poultry and alcoholic beverages. Some tariffs could again target the home states of Republican leaders, such as Louisiana, represented by House Speaker Mike Johnson. There is also a focus on goods that can be secured from other countries.“We’re trying to hit the U.S. in important sectors for them, where it does not cost us much,” said a senior E.U. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Another goal, the official said, is to prompt American businesses to convey to the Trump administration that “this is a bad idea.”European leaders have long made clear that they would prefer to negotiate and persuade Trump to forgo tariffs. Their two-step approach, and the nearly three weeks before it starts, appears to allow time for that.The disruption is “avoidable if the U.S. administration accepts our extended hand and works with us to strike a deal,” E.U. Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said.Officials in Europe, like other U.S. trading partners, have tried to strike a delicate balance between launching countermeasures to deter further U.S. tariffs and containing harm to their economies. They have struggled to engage with a U.S. administration that has at times fluctuated between threats and backpedaling — and to gauge whom to lobby in the administration, diplomats say.Analysts said Europe will have to be prepared for escalation.“This is only the first act. We’ll have to see how all of this develops,” said Ignacio García Bercero, a former European Commission trade official. “There’s so much unpredictability these days.” The administration has pledged more tariffs on a broader range of imports from U.S. trading partners that could start in April.The United States is Europe’s largest export market. Key European economies were already dealing with sluggish growth. Now businesses are bracing for the prospect of a protracted trade war.Germany, the bloc’s leading exporter to the United States, would be particularly vulnerable, with some of the biggest anticipated effects on the car and pharmaceutical industries. Industry leaders have also warned that a U.S.-China trade war could have spillover impact on Europe: China could divert cheap goods to the continent, unwelcome competition for businesses.The European Union has been preparing for U.S. tariffs. At bloc headquarters in Brussels, a group dubbed the “Trump task force” has been strategizing for Trump’s return since last year and focusing on preparing for trade scenarios.Yet Sefcovic, who visited Washington recently, said this week that the Trump administration “did not seem to be engaging” with European overtures to negotiate. “We jointly identified the few areas that would allow us to move forward by fostering a mutual benefit,” he told reporters. “But in the end, one hand cannot clap.”Javaid reported from Washington and McCoy from Rio de Janeiro.
