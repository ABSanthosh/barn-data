Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the US Capitol in support of federal workers.Several federal employees have agreed to take up the Trump administration's severance package, which includes eight months' worth of salary and benefits for leaving their government positions.Working alongside Musk, President Trump has been eager to substantially restructure and reduce the size of the federal government. Some critics dispute the legality of these severance offers, arguing that such a significant staff reduction would require congressional approval.",
