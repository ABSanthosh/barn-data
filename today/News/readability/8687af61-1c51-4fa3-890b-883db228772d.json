  "text": "A large group of teenagers on bikes were caught on cellphone cameras looting a Ralphs, releasing pepper spray in the Los Angeles store before turning their attention on a married couple, hurling insults and rocks at their vehicle, terrifying the two men. The incident unfolded on April 19 at the Ralphs grocery store on Vermont Avenue and Adams Street near the University of Southern California, Los Angeles campus. One of the victims, Ryan Benson, told KTLA’s Sandra Mitchell that he and his husband were terrified and felt trapped in their vehicle as the situation escalated. “Saying things like, ‘You guys gay?’ Homophobic slurs, hitting the car, throwing bottles,” Benson said. The group of teens had reportedly just rushed the grocery store, ignoring commands from store security, taking items and releasing pepper spray inside the store. A large group of teens on bike swarmed a Ralphs in L.A., stealing items and setting off pepper spray before physically and verbally harassing a married couple on April 19, 2025. (Ryan Benson)A large group of teens on bike swarmed a Ralphs in L.A., stealing items and setting off pepper spray before physically and verbally harassing a married couple on April 19, 2025. (Ryan Benson)A large group of teens on bike swarmed a Ralphs in L.A., stealing items and setting off pepper spray before physically and verbally harassing a married couple on April 19, 2025. (Ryan Benson)“There was so much pepper spray in the air that everyone in the store was coughing, sneezing, hiding their face under their shirt,” Benson added. This is not the first time a large and rowdy scrum of teenagers has unleashed mayhem on city streets. In January, the driver of a Mercedes in the Mid-Wilshire area was swarmed by a group of teenagers on bicycles, who vandalized the vehicle. Investigators with the Los Angeles Police Department said it’s possible that the group from Ralphs could be linked to other similar crimes, such as kicking and beating a person near Beverly Hills in February and the looting of 7-Eleven convenience stores in the city. As for Benson and his husband, he said the damage done to his car by the group will cost thousands of dollars to repair. “Our window is broken, our windshield is cracked, both doors are dented, and there is a dent with paint damage,” he explained. “I understand that they’re children, but these are really scary things and we can’t just decide that it’s not happening.”While no arrests have been, Benson has put out the video on social media and said some of the teens he believes were involved in the incident have since threatened him.Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
