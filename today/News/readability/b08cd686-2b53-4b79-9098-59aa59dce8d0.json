Five were from Spain and the sixth person was the pilot, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters on Thursday. All were onboard the helicopter at the time of the crash. \"Our hearts go out to the families,\" Adams said.New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said the identities of the victims will not be released until the families are notified. The cause of the crash is under investigation.Video footage of the incident shows the helicopter falling out of the sky upside down and then splashing down in the Hudson River.Officials said the helicopter lost control soon after turning at the George Washington Bridge to move along the New Jersey shoreline. The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down, CNN reported.What we know about the Hudson helicopter crashThe first calls of the crash came around 15:17 EDT (20:17 GMT) and rescue boats were launched immediately, New York Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said.\"Swimmers were in the water shortly after the call,\" he said.Once on the scene, rescuers searched the water for victims or survivors and initiated \"immediate life-saving measures\" but the efforts were unsuccessful.Four victims were pronounced dead on scene, while two others were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, officials said. The part of the river where the helicopter crashed is near Manhattan's west side, an area known for its trendy shops and dining. It's also near the main campus of New York University.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the investigation into the crash of the Bell 206, a two-bladed helicopter, will be led by the National Transportation Safety Board.The Coast Guard, which said it would work with local agencies to assist with the investigation, sent emergency assets to the scene.The Bell 206 is commonly used by sightseeing companies, television new stations and police departments. This is not the first deadly tourist helicopter crash in New York City. In 2018, another tourist helicopter crashed into the East River and all five passengers drowned. Only the pilot survived. In 2009, a helicopter carrying Italian tourists collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine.",
