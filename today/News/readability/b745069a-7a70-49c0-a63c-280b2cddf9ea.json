Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that tariffs announced back in April will take effect on Aug. 1 for countries that have not reached an agreement with President Donald Trump's administration.\"President Trump's going to be sending letters to some of our trading partners saying that if you don't move things along, then on August 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level,\" Bessent said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"Countries will \"get a letter saying that if we have not reached an agreement, then you will go back to the April 2 level,\" he said.Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 is yet another new tariff deadline, but the August date could still give trading partners more time to renegotiate tariff rates.\"We are saying this is when it's happening, if you want to speed things up, have at it, if you want to go back to the old rate that's your choice,\" Bessent said.In April, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the steep tariffs he had unveiled just days prior on most major trading partners. That 90-day pause is due to expire on Wednesday, sparking concern among investors and U.S. trading partners.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Bessent's remarks.Read more CNBC politics coverageBessent: Tariffs will 'boomerang' back to April levels by Aug. 1 for countries without dealsRep.
