  "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican U.S. House Representative Mark Green said on Monday that he will resign from Congress to take up an offer from the private sector after the House votes again on President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill.“Recently, I was offered an opportunity in the private sector that was too exciting to pass up,\" Green, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said in a statement.\"As a result, today I notified the Speaker and the House of Representatives that I will resign from Congress as soon as the House votes once again on the reconciliation package,\" he added.Green's resignation will narrow Republicans' majority in the House to 219-212, meaning Speaker Mike Johnson will only be able to lose up to three votes on any legislation to pass it.An army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Green, 60, has represented Tennessee's 7th District in Congress since his election in 2018.The Republican-led Senate is considering Trump's sweeping budget package after it passed the House, and is likely to make significant changes before sending the bill back to the House.(Reporting by Jasper Ward and Ismail Shakil; Editing by Stephen Coates)",
