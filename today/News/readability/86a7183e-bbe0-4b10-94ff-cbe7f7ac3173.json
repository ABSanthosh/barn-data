  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — Israeli forces have launched “extensive” ground operations in northern and southern Gaza, the military said Sunday, as airstrikes across the territory killed about 100 people and flagging ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas were underway in Qatar.The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that the ground maneuvers were part of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, a military offensive that Israeli leaders have described as including a potential long-term occupation of the Gaza Strip.Later Sunday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government would “introduce a basic amount of food to the population” of Gaza, after blocking all food and aid from entering the enclave for more than two months. Last week, the world’s leading body on hunger crises warned that all of Gaza was at risk of famine.“On the recommendation of the IDF … Israel will introduce a basic amount of food to the population in order to ensure that a hunger crisis does not develop in the Gaza Strip,” the statement said.It did not connect the announcement to ongoing ceasefire talks in Qatar, where Israeli and Hamas delegations are considering variations of a proposal that would see the release of some Israeli hostages, who were abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in exchange for another temporary ceasefire. But it was unclear whether the ground operations would undermine the talks, even as long-standing obstacles remained, including Hamas’s demand for a lasting end to the war and Israel’s insistence that the group fully disarm.“We will increase control over the Gaza Strip by dividing the territory and moving the population,” IDF spokesman Effie Defrin said during a short briefing with reporters on Sunday. Five divisions are now operating in the territory, after a “preliminary wave of strikes” over the past week were carried out in support of the incursions on the ground, the IDF said.Those strikes, including on hospitals, tent camps and residential buildings, killed hundreds of Palestinians and helped bring the war’s total death toll in Gaza on Sunday to 53,339, according to the local health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Since March 18, when Israel shattered an eight-week ceasefire, 3,193 people have been killed in Gaza, the Health Ministry said Sunday.Israel’s security cabinet had signed off on a plan this month to push Gaza’s population of more than 2 million people to the southern part of the enclave, after which Palestinians fear they will be permanently expelled from their land.“I would rather die than leave my home,” said Shaimaa Abu Haseera, a mother of three boys staying in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. She said she would not heed the military’s orders to evacuate. “There is nowhere safe to go,” she added.It was unclear Sunday where exactly the ground operations were taking place. Israel has maintained a military presence in key areas of Gaza, withdrawing only partially during the eight-week ceasefire. Since then, Israeli forces have prepared for a wide-scale invasion of the enclave, according to officials and local media reports.In recent days, tanks amassed along Israel’s border with Gaza. “We are in a prolonged war,” Defrin said.Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage. Many of those who were abducted have since been rescued, released, or confirmed dead by Israeli authorities. Israel believes 23 hostages are still alive; last week, Hamas freed Edan Alexander, 21, an IDF soldier and dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, as a goodwill gesture to the Trump administration. The militant group said it hoped his release would help facilitate another ceasefire with Israel.But on Sunday, nearly a week after Alexander was reunited with his family, images from across Gaza showed Palestinians sifting through scorched debris, pulling the dead and wounded from the rubble and fleeing their homes near the periphery, piling mattresses and other belongings atop rickety cars and donkey carts.In Khan Younis in southern Gaza, 50 people were killed Sunday, including in a strike on a tent camp in what Israel once designated a “safe zone” in the coastal area of Mawasi. In northern Gaza, a region decimated by the fighting, doctors and residents reported strikes near hospitals and on a crowd gathering to dig a water well in the area of Saftawi.At al-Awda Hospital in Jabalya, in northern Gaza, director Mohammed Salha said Sunday that most of the facilities there are at least partially destroyed after heavy airstrikes overnight.“We have urgently tried to do some repairs,” he said in a voice note, adding that “moving is very difficult” because of the drones and planes still firing on the area.At the nearby Indonesian Hospital, where many patients and staff evacuated early Sunday morning, a witness said an Israeli quadcopter was “shooting at anyone who tried to leave.” He spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals by Israeli forces. The attacks forced the hospital to halt all services.In a statement, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was urgently calling for the “immediate protection of civilians and health-care facilities.”“Every medical facility that is forced to stop providing services, or has services interrupted, has very real consequences for civilians — people with no part in this fight — who are already traumatized or in pain,” said Yasmine Praz Dessimoz, the ICRC’s director of operations.Israel, which has bombed hospitals across Gaza, has said Hamas uses the facilities for military purposes. But according to the United Nations, which has tracked Israeli attacks on hospitals, “insufficient information has so far been made available to substantiate these allegations, which have remained vague and broad, and in some cases appear contradicted by publicly available information.”In a strike last week, Israel said it targeted an underground bunker for Hamas leaders near the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The military later released aerial footage it said showed “exposed underground infrastructure” at one of the hospital buildings — but the image, geolocated by The Washington Post, actually showed the grounds of a boys’ school nearby.Two people familiar with the matter said the strike’s target was Mohammed Sinwar, the younger brother of slain Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who now heads the group’s military wing. The two spoke on the condition of anonymity last week because they were not authorized to talk to the media. It is unclear whether Sinwar was killed in the strike.“Hamas is under a lot of pressure. They lost almost all of their leadership,” said Amir Avivi, a former deputy commander in the IDF’s Gaza division. “And they understand that the army is serious about conquering vast areas of Gaza.”Akram Abu Khousa is a farmer from northern Gaza who was displaced to the enclave’s central region. Israeli forces seized his land in Beit Lahia as a part of an extended buffer zone they have established in the territory.“The war never stopped in the first place,” Abu Khousa said. “They say the attack on Hamas began, but really it’s an attack on civilians, children, women and old people.”Westfall reported from Washington, Cheeseman from Beirut, Soroka from Tel Aviv and Mahfouz from Cairo.
