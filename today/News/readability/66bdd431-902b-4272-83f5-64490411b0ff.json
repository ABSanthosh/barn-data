  "text": "A congressional inquiry into the attempt to assassinate US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally a year ago on Sunday lamented \"inexcusable\" failures in the Secret Service's operations and response, and called for more serious disciplinary action.On July 13, 2024, a gunman shot the then-Republican presidential candidate during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear. One bystander was killed and two other people, in addition to Trump, were wounded before a government sniper killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks.\"What happened was inexcusable, and the consequences imposed for the failures so far do not reflect the severity of the situation,\" said the report released by the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.The dramatic incident energised Trump's bid to return to the White House, with his campaign using a photo of him bloodied and pumping his fist as he was hurried offstage to woo voters.The report did not shed new light on the gunman's motive, which still remains a mystery, but accused the Secret Service of \"a cascade of preventable failures that nearly cost President Trump his life.\"\"The United States Secret Service failed to act on credible intelligence, failed to coordinate with local law enforcement,\" said the committee's Republican chairman, Rand Paul. \"Despite those failures, no one has been fired,\" he added. \"It was a complete breakdown of security at every level-fueled by bureaucratic indifference, a lack of clear protocols, and a shocking refusal to act on direct threats. \"We must hold individuals accountable and ensure reforms are fully implemented so this never happens again.\"- 'Mistakes were made' -The Secret Service cited communication, technical and human errors and said reforms were underway, including on coordination between different law enforcement bodies and establishment of a division dedicated to aerial surveillance.Six unidentified staff have been disciplined, according to the agency. The punishments range from 10 to 42 days' suspension without pay, and all six were put into restricted or non-operational positions.Reflecting on the assassination attempt earlier this week, Trump said \"mistakes were made\" but that he was satisfied with the investigation.In an interview with his daughter-in-law on Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" Trump said the sniper \"was able to get him from a long distance with one shot. If he didn't do that, you would have had an even worse situation.\"\"It was unforgettable,\" Trump said of the events. \"I didn't know exactly what was going on. I got whacked. There's no question about that. And fortunately, I got down quickly. People were screaming.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
