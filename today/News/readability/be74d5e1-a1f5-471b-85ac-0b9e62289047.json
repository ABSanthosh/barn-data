America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never — that will never, ever happen.” “I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Carney on leading this minority government. No, no — we’ll have plenty of opportunity to debate.” [music: “Your Man” by Down With Webster]Mark Carney of the Liberal Party spoke to supporters on Tuesday after being declared the winner of Canada’s election.CreditCredit...Cole Burston for The New York TimesApril 29, 2025Updated 6:27 p.m. ETPrime Minister Mark Carney led his Liberal Party to a narrow victory in Canada’s pivotal election on Monday, securing a fourth term in power for the party and a renewed mandate to lead the fight against President Trump over trade and the nation’s sovereignty.Mr. Carney, a former central banker who was running for office for the first time, struck a combative tone toward the United States during his acceptance speech in the early hours of Tuesday at a Liberal Party event in Ottawa.But the Liberals failed to win a majority of seats in the House of Commons so Mr. Carney’s government will need to rely on smaller parties to push through his legislative agenda.Carney promises to face up to Trump.Mr. Carney has not met Mr. Trump in person since becoming Liberal Party leader and prime minister last month. But he made Mr. Trump’s menacing comments about making Canada the 51st state and the tariffs he has imposed on Canadian goods the center of his campaign.The two men held what was described as a professional call before the election, though Mr. Carney said during the campaign that Mr. Trump had brought up the 51st state threat during that conversation.Mr. Carney has said that he will maintain Canada’s retaliatory tariffs against the United States. But he has cautioned that expanding them would harm Canadians more than they would pressure Americans.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
