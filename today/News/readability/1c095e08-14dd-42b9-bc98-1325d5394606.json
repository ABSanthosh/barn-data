The boat was transporting the passengers, who were mostly women, to a food market.Authorities have not confirmed what caused the sinking but local media suggested the boat may have been overloaded. Overcrowding on boats is common in remote parts of Nigeria where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes.Rescuers had trouble finding the location of the capsizing for hours after Friday’s tragedy struck, according to Justin Uwazuruonye, who is in charge of Nigeria’s national emergency management agency operations in the state.Such deadly incidents are increasingly becoming a source of concern in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, as authorities struggle to enforce safety measures and regulations for water transportation.Most of the accidents have been attributed to overcrowding and the lack of maintenance of the boats, often built locally to accommodate as many passengers as possible in defiance of safety measures. Authorities have also not been able to enforce the use of lifejackets on such trips, often because of lack of availability or cost.",
