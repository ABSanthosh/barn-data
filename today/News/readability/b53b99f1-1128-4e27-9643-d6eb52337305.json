Seven people are still missing.The Red Sea governor, Amr Hanafi, said the yacht, called Sea Story, had been struck by high waves on Monday and sank in less than 7 minutes.The 34-metre boat was carrying 30 tourists from several countries and 14 crew when it sent a distress signal at 5.30am local time (3.30am GMT) on Monday, according to the governorate’s Facebook page.Some of the passengers were inside the cabins of the Sea Story when it was hit by fast-moving waves. Photograph: Red Sea governorate/FacebookNo information has been released about the nationalities of the people whose bodies were recovered. Officials previously said the missing people included Egyptians and foreigners. The BBC reported two of the missing were from the UK, although the British government has not confirmed that report.Statements from rescued crew members and tourists indicated the boat capsized after being hit by fast-moving waves, the governorate’s statement said. Some of the passengers were inside the cabins when the waves hit the four-decked, wooden-hulled motorised yacht, according to the statement.Weather forecasters had previously released warnings of rough waters and high winds.Of the 44 people onboard, 13 were Egyptians, including some crew, and 31 were foreign nationals from the US, Germany, UK, Poland, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, China, Slovakia, Spain and Ireland.More than two dozen people were rescued on Monday from the vessel south of the coastal town of Marsa Alam, some of them being airlifted to receive medical treatment. Two of those rescued were from the UK, according to the BBC. The UK Foreign Office confirmed it was providing consular support to a number of British nationals and their families after the incident.A further five people – two Belgians, an Egyptian, a Swiss citizen and a Finnish national – were rescued on Tuesday, the Red Sea governorate said.The German foreign ministry said three of its citizens were missing, and three others had been rescued. Poland also confirmed two of its nationals, a man and a woman, were missing.Ireland’s government confirmed on Tuesday that an Irish citizen who was onboard was safe. “My understanding is that the Irish citizen is OK and receiving consular assistance,” the foreign affairs minister, Micheál Martin, told reporters in Dublin.Spain’s foreign ministry has said five Spanish nationals were rescued and were out of danger.Renowned for its coral reefs, the Red Sea is a major hub for Egypt’s tourism industry.The governorate’s Facebook page showed photos on Monday of what appeared to be rescued tourists speaking to the governor.The Sea Story was built in 2022 and can hold 36 passengers. The boat had no technical problems, obtained all required permits prior to the trip, and was last checked for naval safety in March, according to officials. It had left Marsa Alam for a five-day journey.Egypt’s meteorological authority on Saturday warned about turbulence and high waves on the Red Sea and advised against maritime activity for Sunday and Monday.The Egyptian military was coordinating rescue operations with the governorate.Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report",
