This visit follows King Charles's visit to Southport in August, where he met with some of the surviving children and their families.After the attack, false information spread on social media, incorrectly identifying the attacker as an Islamist migrant, leading to violent clashes and an attempt to attack the town's mosque. Authorities charged a teenager, who was 17 at the time, with the murders.Following the July incident, similar riots occurred across the country, which police and the government attributed to far-right groups. This resulted in about 1,500 arrests and nearly 400 people being jailed.",
