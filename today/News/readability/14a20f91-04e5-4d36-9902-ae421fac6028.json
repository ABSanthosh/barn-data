  "text": "Fifa has banned the former Gabon youth-team coach Patrick Assoumou Eyi, known as “Capello”, for life after its adjudicatory chamber found him guilty of committing repeated acts of sexual abuse against multiple players.Eyi – who left his post as head coach of Gabon’s under-17 team in 2017 – admitted charges of raping, grooming and exploiting young players after allegations first reported by the Guardian in 2021. One former player who was coached by Eyi claimed he would lure alleged victims to his home, which he called the “Garden of Eden”.Fifa provisionally suspended Eyi when the claims were first made in 2021 and its independent ethics committee opened an investigation. It was confirmed on Tuesday that he has been handed a lifetime ban from all football-related activities and fined 1m Swiss francs (£878,000).“The investigation into Mr Eyi concerns complaints from at least four male football players who accused him of sexual abuse between 2006 and 2021. Most of these incidents occurred while the players were minors,” said Fifa.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.“In its decision, the adjudicatory chamber found that Mr Eyi had breached article 24 (Protection of physical and mental integrity) and article 26 (Abuse of position) of the Fifa code of ethics and sanctioned him with a lifetime ban from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level. In addition, a fine in the amount of CHF 1,000,000 has been imposed on Mr Eyi.”It is understood Fifa is continuing to investigate allegations that the president, Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, did not report alleged sexual abuse by Eyi and a number of other coaches to Gabon’s authorities. The Guardian reported last January that an independent investigator recommended he should be immediately suspended.Fifpro, the international players’ union, welcomed the ban issued to Eyi and said: “This ruling stands as a testament to the incredible courage and persistence of survivors and whistleblowers who, despite facing threats, ostracisation, and immense pressure, refused to stay silent.”It said, though, that more work needed to be done. “Football in Gabon will not be safe until all perpetrators and those who enabled them are brought to justice.”The Guardian has approached Eyi for comment.",
