  "text": "PHILADELPHIA - Forecasters are keeping an eye on a possible winter storm just days into 2025 that they believe could bring the first \"significant\" snowfall to our area.The potential winter storm is earmarked for Monday, when forecasters believe frigid artic air could pair with a system of precipitation to create snow.\"A significant pattern change is expected across much of the country as an Arctic Outbreak is forecast to spread from the Northern Plains to the south and east, leading to exceptionally high probabilities of below-normal temperatures expected across much of the East,\" the National Weather Service said.It's unclear at this time if the winter storm will even happen, so potential snow totals and the timing of the weather event will likely follow in the coming days.The Weather Service said frozen precipitation is possible across the middle parts of the country, and heavy snow could impact the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.Philadelphia has gotten used to winters with little-to-no snow, and snapped a two-year snowless streak last January.The FOX 29 Weather Authority predicted a similarly lackluster winter for snow lovers, with a total of 17 inches slated for our area this season.Two storms this winter, however, are predicted to dump 6+ inches of powder on Philly, and snow could remain on the ground for a total of two weeks.",
