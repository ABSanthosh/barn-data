  "text": "Ella Emhoff was ridiculed for a viral clip from her recent appearance at a fashion event in New York. Kamala Harris's stepdaughter Ella Emhoff got viciously trolled on X by mostly MAGA accounts for her latest appearance at the CFDA Fashion Awards in New York. Social media users called her ugly and delusional for thinking that she's a supermodel while many others commented on how she was \"getting emotional for no reason\" during her interaction. She was also trashed for her fashion sense. Ella Emhoff is a fashion designer and she was last seen crying during Kamala Harris' speech at Howard University where she conceded the election. Rumors spread that she had a mental breakdown after Kamala Harris's defeat and had to be hospitalized. Ella took to social media and refuted the claims and said there was nothing wrong in crying or showing emotion. \"There's a rumor about me having a mental breakdown and being checked into a hospital. Not true. Also, f**k you if you're out there spreading that. There's nothing wrong with sowing emotion and crying. Anyone who says otherwise probably needs a good cry,\" Emhoff wrote.The latest trolling started as MAGA influencers started sharing Ella's interaction at the fashion event. Podcaster Benny Johnson wrote, \"I don't think live in the same country as these people.\"\"If the Hunger Games were real,\" another wrote.\"This is what mental illness looks like,\" another comment read. \"They're the same person. Same greased-back hair, the same glasses, and the same delusion of thinking they're famous people,\" one wrote.\"These people are broken beyond repair. This woke mind virus is real!\" a comment read.\"I find the coverage of Ella Emhoff VERY sexist. Sure, I'm not Kamala Harris fan, nor do I like tattoos tbh. But it's a GOOD thing for women to feel confident in themselves dressing how THEY please; refreshing that she's not a Barbie; and nice how much she loves her step-mother,\" one X user wrote condemning the trolling.",
