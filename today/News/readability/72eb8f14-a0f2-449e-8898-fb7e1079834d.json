  "text": "Tempers flare before Zelensky abruptly departs the White House without signing a minerals deal.The United States’ relationship with Ukraine erupted in a storm of acrimony on Friday as President Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in an explosive televised Oval Office showdown and abruptly cut short a visit meant to coordinate a plan for peace.In a fiery public confrontation unlike any seen between an American president and foreign leader in modern times, Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance castigated Mr. Zelensky for not being grateful enough for U.S. support in Ukraine’s war with Russia, and sought to strong-arm him into making a peace deal on whatever terms the Americans dictated.With his voice raised and temper flaring, Mr. Trump threatened to abandon Ukraine altogether if Mr. Zelensky did not go along. After journalists left the Oval Office, Mr. Trump canceled the rest of the visit, including a planned joint news conference and signing ceremony for a deal on rare minerals, and U.S. officials told the Ukrainians to leave. A grim-faced Mr. Zelensky strode out, climbed into a waiting black sport utility vehicle and departed the White House grounds.“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”The White House later sent out Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close Trump ally, to tell reporters that Mr. Zelensky should consider stepping down. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with or he needs to change,” Mr. Graham said on the White House driveway.The president’s verbal assault on Mr. Zelensky was a stunning display of anger and resentment toward the leader of a country that has been invaded by a larger power intent on eliminating it as an independent state. No other president in memory has lashed out at a visiting foreign leader in the Oval Office on camera in such a vituperative way, not even at an adversary of the United States, much less a putative ally.Talking over the Ukrainian leader, Mr. Vance called Mr. Zelensky “disrespectful” for coming into the Oval Office and making his case in front of the American news media and demanded that he thank Mr. Trump for his efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia. Mr. Trump jumped in and told the Ukrainian leader that “you’re not really in a good position right now” and that “you’re gambling with World War III.”“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out,” Mr. Trump added. “And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out and I don’t think it’s going to be pretty.”ImageThe exchange between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine grew heated in the Oval Office on Friday. Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe spectacle underlined how radically Mr. Trump has reoriented American foreign policy in less than six weeks back in office, all but switching sides in the war in Europe as he expresses sympathy for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and antipathy for Mr. Zelensky.Even as he shouted at the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, the president spoke of Mr. Putin as if they were friends, saying that the Russian leader has “been through a lot with me” in enduring the “Russia hoax,” referring to the investigation of Mr. Putin’s clandestine efforts to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election.The confrontation provided a major boost to Mr. Putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between Ukraine and its most important patron, the United States. Russian officials seemed overjoyed on social media. Dmitri A. Medvedev, a top Putin lieutenant, praised Mr. Trump for “telling the truth” to Mr. Zelensky’s face.America’s traditional European allies, on the other hand, were deeply alarmed and rallied behind Mr. Zelensky, with the leaders of France, Germany, Poland and others issuing statements of support for Ukraine and its beleaguered leader. The show of solidarity came just days after the United States sided with Russia over Europe in opposing a U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression on the third anniversary of its full-fledged invasion of Ukraine.After leaving the White House, Mr. Zelensky tried to smooth over the rupture with a social media post aimed at Mr. Vance’s complaints about ingratitude. “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people,” he wrote, using the acronym for president of the United States.In a later interview with Fox News, Mr. Zelensky refused to apologize to Mr. Trump, but expressed regret about the exchange and appreciation to the United States for its support. “We are thankful and sorry for this,” he said.Mr. Trump seemed less interested in making up. Speaking with reporters on the South Lawn before heading to Florida for the weekend, the president said that Mr. Zelensky opposes peace. “He’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,” Mr. Trump said. Asked if he wanted Mr. Zelensky to step down, he said, “I want somebody that’s going to make peace.”Mr. Vance’s eagerness to assail Mr. Zelensky raised the question of whether it was a planned or impromptu ambush. Mr. Vance has never been a supporter of Ukraine and said in 2022 that “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.”After Mr. Vance began chastising Mr. Zelensky, it seemed to prompt Mr. Trump to join in. The result, though, was the blowup of an economic deal that Mr. Trump had prioritized in recent days, a commitment by Ukraine to turn over rare mineral rights to repay U.S. military aid over the past three years. The future of that deal remained unclear.Mr. Zelensky’s hurriedly arranged visit to Washington to sign that deal was meant to smooth over tensions with Mr. Trump, who just last week parroted Russian talking points by falsely claiming that Ukraine “started” the war and calling Mr. Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”With Mr. Zelensky agreeing to the minerals deal, Mr. Trump seemed ready to make nice by telling reporters on Thursday that he did not even remember the dictator comment and expressing respect for the Ukrainian leader. He welcomed Mr. Zelensky at the door of the West Wing on Friday morning with an honor guard, and they shook hands politely but without evident warmth.The encounter, though, quickly turned hostile shortly after they sat down in the Oval Office with journalists present. Mr. Zelensky, dressed in his usual dark long-sleeved shirt, sought to explain the history of the war with Russia, noting that it went back to 2014 when Moscow first seized Crimea and occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and continued through Mr. Trump’s first term.He also expressed skepticism of peace efforts mentioned by Mr. Vance. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?” he asked. “What do you mean?”Bristling, Mr. Vance replied: “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.”He then began assailing Mr. Zelensky. “I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Mr. Vance lectured. “You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”He accused Mr. Zelensky of mounting a “propaganda tour” in the United States. “Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”Mr. Zelensky tried to respond to Mr. Vance’s assertions and said that the United States could feel threatened by Russia some day. “You have a nice ocean and don’t feel now, but you will feel it in the future,” he said.That set off Mr. Trump, who cut off Mr. Zelensky. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he said, raising his voice. “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.”“I’m not playing cards,” Mr. Zelensky replied. “I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m the president in a war.”“You’re gambling with World War III,” Mr. Trump retorted. “And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”Mr. Vance jumped back in. “Have you said ‘thank you’ once this entire meeting? No.”ImagePresident Trump with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the White House before their meeting in the Oval Office on Friday.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York Times“A lot of times,” Mr. Zelensky said. “Even today.”Mr. Vance then accused him of campaigning for “the opposition” by visiting an ammunition plant in Scranton, Pa., last fall when the Ukrainian leader thanked workers for the arms they were making.“Please,” Mr. Zelensky said. “You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war —”Mr. Trump interrupted. “He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble.”“I know,” Mr. Zelensky said, adding that he was “thankful” for U.S. support.Mr. Vance was unsatisfied. “Just say thank you,” he demanded.“I said a lot of times,” Mr. Zelensky repeated. “Thank you to the American people.”After the meeting blew up, Trump administration officials regrouped and ultimately decided to tell Mr. Zelensky to leave, according to a person with knowledge of the events. Two officials were dispatched to inform the Ukrainians, who were waiting in the Roosevelt Room. One Ukrainian official proposed a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky to calm things down, the person said, but the Americans said no.Mr. Graham later called the meeting a “complete, utter disaster” but blamed it on Mr. Zelensky, saying that he had advised the Ukrainian leader in a meeting earlier in the day: “Don’t take the bait. Don’t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump.”It was a measure of how much Republicans have fallen behind Mr. Trump that Mr. Graham and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, both onetime hawks and strong supporters of Ukraine against Russia, backed the president and vice president.“Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump?” Mr. Graham said. “I have never been more proud of the president. I was very proud of JD Vance standing up for our country.”Mr. Rubio echoed the point online: “Thank you @POTUS for standing up for America in a way that no President has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America First. America is with you!” The White House seemed happy to highlight the clash, releasing a list of supportive statements by the president’s own cabinet officials and Republican allies echoing Mr. Rubio’s argument that he was defending American interests.The Oval Office blowup drew criticism from supporters of Ukraine. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, gave an “answer to Vance” on social media: Mr. Zelensky, she said, “has thanked our country over and over again both privately and publicly.” She was one of several lawmakers who met with Mr. Zelensky before his visit to the White House.“And our country thanks HIM and the Ukrainian patriots who have stood up to a dictator, buried their own \u0026 stopped Putin from marching right into the rest of Europe,” she wrote. “Shame on you.”Adding their support were presidents and prime ministers of France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Moldova, Portugal, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg and others.“We stand with Ukraine in good and in testing times,” wrote Friedrich Merz, set to be Germany’s next chancellor after elections this week. “We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war.”Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.‘This is going to be great television’: Trump sums up his showdown with Zelensky.ImagePresident Trump sounded almost excited by the drama of his fiery confrontation with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesOne of the most surreal moments of Friday’s Oval Office showdown between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine came at the very end.After all the shouting and the saber-rattling and the lecturing and the pleading and the politicking had ceased, the American president shifted a little in his seat and shared an observation.“This is going to be great television,” he remarked. “I will say that.”It was a conclusion as startling as it was fundamentally Trumpian.This was not a season finale boardroom scene of “The Apprentice” that had just taken place. It was the highest of high-stakes talks — one that could determine the fate of millions, the existence of a sovereign nation and the security of a continent — going wildly off the rails.But for Mr. Trump, one thing that was on his mind, as always, was the ratings. He sounded almost excited by the drama of the spectacle, as though he could feel the front pages of the world’s newspapers being written in real time.This is a man who spent years yelling at people on TV as a way to make a living. He is wired to think about things in terms of “great television.” He is a highly conscious performer. But playacting as a tough guy on NBC on Thursday nights between 9 and 10 p.m. is not the same thing as bossing around an ally before the eyes of the world, even if Mr. Trump uses the same language to describe one performance as he would the other.Still, how one postures before the cameras is of paramount importance in this White House.After the meeting, the president did an imitation of Mr. Zelensky in front of the cameras and said: “All of a sudden, he’s a big shot.” Where Mr. Trump is involved, there is usually room enough for one big shot.The other European leaders who had come to Washington over the past few weeks to reason with him about Russia understood this. They knew how to play their parts in the Oval Office while the cameras were rolling. President Emmanuel Macron of France literally held Mr. Trump’s hand at one point. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a letter from King Charles III to Mr. Trump for all to see. It went over so well that Mr. Trump brought the letter out to wave around again a little while later at their joint news conference.It’s not that Mr. Zelensky doesn’t know how to perform. He was a television actor before he became president and has been skillful in using the media as he tries to galvanize support. But evidently the role of supplicant was not one he was going to play Friday.Right away, things got off to a bad start, since Mr. Trump seemed to feel the Ukrainian leader was not properly costumed: He wasn’t wearing a suit. “He’s all dressed up today,” Mr. Trump said sarcastically as he greeted him outside the West Wing.Ordinarily, in the theater of Trump, it is the journalist who plays the role of the heel. The president regularly clashes with members of the news media, and everybody more or less knows how to play their parts. This time the character arguing with him up there was another president — one with his own aims and his own experience playing to the world’s cameras.Vice President JD Vance told Mr. Zelensky that it was “disrespectful” for him to “try to litigate this in front of the American media.” But so much of the Trump doctrine is litigated before the media. And it was Mr. Vance — a onetime best-selling author and TV talking head who is media savvy himself — who seemed particularly determined to instigate a blowup while reporters were in the room.Outside the White House, hundreds of journalists lined up for a news conference that would never come. When Mr. Trump announced that he was calling it off, a mob of cameras rushed across the pavement to get the shot. Mr. Zelensky emerged from West Wing. He climbed into the back of a black Chevrolet suburban adorned with two little flags, one American and one Ukrainian. All the cameras slowly turned to watch as he made his way down the drive and away from the White House.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTEurope rallies around Zelensky after the explosive White House meeting.ImagePresident Volodymyr Zelensky leaving the White House after a heated meeting with President Trump on Friday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesEuropean leaders quickly pledged their continued support for Ukraine on Friday after President Trump’s blistering criticism of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a meeting at the White House.In statement after statement, leaders in France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Norway, Finland, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia, Belgium, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Ireland lined up behind Ukraine and praised its embattled leader. Even as Western leaders generally shied from explicitly criticizing Mr. Trump, who had told Mr. Zelensky he was “not in a good position” and angrily threatened to pull American support for Ukraine unless he agreed to a cease-fire deal with Russia, many in Europe addressed their statements of encouragement directly to Mr. Zelensky. “Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said on social media, referring to Mr. Zelensky. “Be strong, be brave, be fearless. You are never alone, dear President.” President Emmanuel Macron of France, who had put on a display of friendship with Mr. Trump during a chummy visit to the White House on Monday, said the United States and Europe had been justified in aiding Ukraine and imposing sanctions on Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago. In a statement, Mr. Macron urged America to remain on the side of the Ukrainians, who he said were “fighting for their dignity, their independence, their children, and the security of Europe.” Friedrich Merz, who is on track to become Germany’s next chancellor after the country’s election this week, said in a statement addressed to “Dear Volodymyr” that his country would stand behind Ukraine “in good and in testing times.” “We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war,” Mr. Merz added, apparently referring to Mr. Trump, who has called Mr. Zelensky a dictator and blamed him for the invasion. The departing German leader, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said that Ukraine could rely on Germany and the rest of Europe. Daniel Fried, a career diplomat under American presidents of both parties who had just returned from a trip to Brussels, said the Oval Office clash had jolted Europe’s capitals, generated a wave of sympathy for Mr. Zelensky and upended a peace process that appeared to be gaining traction.“The Europeans are horrified and dismayed,” Mr. Fried said, adding that Europeans see the United States shifting to a great-power strategy in which large countries carve up the world. “They’re watching the America they know and respect change in a matter of a couple of weeks.” ImagePrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and President Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesPrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, a center-left leader who carefully avoided any major disagreements with Mr. Trump during a visit to the White House on Thursday, spoke with Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky on Friday, according to the prime minister’s office. Mr. Starmer “retains his unwavering support for Ukraine and is playing his part to find a path forward to a lasting peace,” the office said in a statement. Mr. Starmer is scheduled to host in London an international meeting on Ukraine on Sunday with Mr. Zelensky and other leaders from across Europe. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, a right-wing nationalist who has long been at odds with much of Europe, appeared to side with Mr. Trump, saying on social media, “Strong men make peace, weak men make war.” He did not mention Ukraine or Mr. Zelensky in his post. Mr. Trump’s upbraiding of Mr. Zelensky also predictably won praise in Russia. Dmitri Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Telegram that Mr. Trump had told “the truth.”The Canadian foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, joined the European leaders in offering words of support for Ukraine, telling reporters that Ukrainians were “fighting for their own freedoms, but also fighting for ours.”Ms. Joly, whose country’s relationship with Mr. Trump has been deeply strained by the American president’s threats to annex Canada and plans to impose tariffs, stressed the importance of maintaining Western unity over the war in Ukraine. She said that the Russians were watching.Mr. Zelensky responded to each European leader on social media, writing, “Thank you for your support.”But he offered his most ample statement of gratitude to Mr. Trump, who had said in the Oval Office earlier on Friday that Mr. Zelensky was not “acting at all thankful” for American aid.“Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,” wrote Mr. Zelensky, also thanking Mr. Trump, and adding, “Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”Stephen Castle, Christopher F. Schuetze, Nataliya Vasilyeva and Megan Specia contributed reporting.On Fox News, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is describing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine as “rude” and “antagonistic.” She says it is “absolutely not true” that today’s blowup came as a result of any sort of ambush planned by Trump and Vance.President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine concluded the interview on Fox News by expressing regret about his exchange with President Trump and thanking the United States for its support. “We are thankful and sorry for this,” he said. Zelensky also told Bret Baier that “of course” he could salvage his relationship with Trump. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTZelensky said he wished President Trump was more supportive of Ukraine instead of him trying to play the role of the mediator. He reiterated that Russia started the conflict by invading Ukraine. “I want really him to be more at our side,” Zelensky says.Zelensky says the spat in the Oval Office was “not good for both sides.”Zelensky says he does not know whether the confrontation with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance was a planned ambush, as some Democrats have suggested. “It was just a really tough situation,” he says.Zelensky, the Ukrainian leader, rejects the idea that he should step down, after Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters outside the White House that Zelensky should consider resigning after the Oval Office meeting this afternoon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTZelensky is refusing to back down in the face of the aggression by Trump and Vance. On Fox News, he’s insisting that Ukraine needs security guarantees in order to end the war with Russia.ImageCredit...Win Mcnamee/Getty Images“I respect our soldiers,” Zelensky says. He says he can’t just say ‘stop’ to his soldiers because people in his country want a just and lasting peace. Essentially, he is saying that he won’t just give up and let Russia win.President Zelensky tries to give the same history lesson on Fox News that President Trump and Vice President Vance took such umbrage with during the meeting in the Oval Office.On Fox News, Bret Baier asks President Zelensky if he feels like he owes President Trump an apology for the confrontation in the Oval Office this afternoon. Zelensky does not directly answer the question.Baier follows up, pressing him on whether he owes Trump an apology. Zelensky, once again, declines to apologize. “I think that we have to be very open and very honest,” he says. “And I’m not sure that we did something bad.”President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, appearing on Fox News after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him in the Oval Office today, began his interview with Bret Baier by thanking the American people for supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia. “You helped us to survive,” he says.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA person with knowledge of the events said that after the meeting in the Oval Office blew up, U.S. officials regrouped and ultimately decided to tell President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to leave. The Ukrainians waited in the Roosevelt Room. Ultimately, two U.S. officials were dispatched to tell the Ukrainians to leave. One of the Ukrainians proposed a meeting between Trump and Zelensky to calm things down; the Americans said no, the person said.As President Trump left the White House to travel to Florida for the weekend, he assailed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine further, saying that the Ukrainian leader did not want peace. “He’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,” Trump told reporters on the South Lawn. “We’re looking to end the death.”VideoAsked if he wanted Zelensky to step down, Trump said, “I want somebody that’s going to make peace.”Fourteen Democratic governors released a joint statement condemning how President Trump and Vice President JD Vance treated President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine today at the White House and pledging their support for Ukraine.“Donald Trump and JD Vance used the sacred Oval Office to berate President Zelensky for not trusting Vladimir Putin’s word,” the governors said. “Americans must protect our strong democratic values on the world stage instead of undermining President Zelensky’s work to fight for his nation and the freedom of his people after being invaded by Russia.”Senate Republicans greeted Zelensky warmly in the morning, but some turned away in the afternoon.ImageSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, spoke to reporters outside the White House shortly after President Trump and Vice President Vance loudly rebuked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesBefore receiving an Oval Office tirade from President Trump and before his White House visit was unceremoniously cut short on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was welcomed warmly by a bipartisan group of senators at a closed-door gathering at the Hay-Adams Hotel near the White House.Republicans who have been among the Senate’s staunchest Russia hawks grinned and clasped hands with Mr. Zelensky in photographs posted on social media. But by the afternoon, at least one of them, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, was outside the White House suggesting that Mr. Zelensky should resign. Another, Senator Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and one of Ukraine’s most outspoken Republican advocates on Capitol Hill — who had organized the meeting at the hotel — took down a post showing him shaking hands with Mr. Zelensky.The abrupt change in tone reflected the pivot underway in Washington, as some of Ukraine’s most ardent Republican defenders on Capitol Hill found themselves recalibrating and falling in line with Mr. Trump, some discarding long-held positions with remarkable speed.Mr. Graham, who began the day smiling in multiple photos with Mr. Zelensky, initially appeared eager to celebrate what he had predicted would be a diplomatic victory for the United States with a minerals deal with Kyiv. “This is Donald Trump the deal maker and peacemaker on display,” he declared in a video.But a few hours later, after Mr. Zelensky was caught in a fiery confrontation with Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, Mr. Graham pivoted dramatically. Appearing on the White House lawn moments after the uproar in the Oval Office, Mr. Graham scolded the Ukrainian president for being “disrespectful” and told reporters that Mr. Zelensky needed to “resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or change.”Mr. Graham said he had anticipated a blowup, claiming to have warned Mr. Zelensky at the morning meeting not to “take the bait” from Mr. Trump. Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the episode, and to offer reminders that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has been the aggressor in the war on Ukraine. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the scene “disgraceful \u0026 downright un-American” in a social media post, arguing that it reflected a White House that had “once again sided with a murderous thug, Putin, over our democratic ally, Ukraine.”Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, who had participated in the morning’s bipartisan meeting, voiced a similar alarm. “Whose side are we on?” he asked in an interview. “If you say we’re on Ukraine’s side, today’s events are shocking. If you say we’re on Putin’s side, or the president is on Putin’s side, then it all makes sense. That’s what’s so alarming.”Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, framed the spectacle as an embarrassment on the world stage, calling Trump’s conduct in the meeting “appalling.”Yet for many Republicans, including some who have long questioned U.S. support for Ukraine, the confrontation was not an embarrassment but a triumph. The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, chided the Ukrainian president and praised Mr. Trump’s dressing-down of the wartime leader, saying in a social media post that, “What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first.”Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee celebrated the U.S.-Ukraine rupture, writing on social media: “The United States of America will no longer be taken for granted. The contrast between the last four years and now could not be more clear.”And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a leading Republican opponent of aid to Ukraine over the past three years, called the clash a long-overdue reckoning. “What we saw today is the culmination of an arrogant small man’s ego FINALLY meeting world leaders who won’t put up with it,” she wrote on social media. “God Bless President Trump and Vice President Vance!!”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSpeaker Mike Johnson, who last year put his own job on the line when he brought to the floor a supplemental aide package to give more than $60 billion in aide to Ukraine, responded on social media to the explosive Oval Office meeting by praising President Trump. “Thanks to President Trump - the days of America being taken advantage of and disrespected are OVER,” he wrote, adding. “What we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first”Read excerpts from the fiery exchange between Trump and Zelensky.Earlier in the day, Trump greeted Zelensky outside the West Wing.By The Associated PressZelensky told Trump not to trust Putin.By ReutersTrump and Vance berated Zelensky.Trump tried to strong-arm Zelensky into making a peace deal with Russia.Zelensky left the White House after the fiery exchange with Trump and Vance.A meeting between President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Friday turned into an angry showdown at the Oval Office. At times cross talk made some comments difficult to understand. Here are key excerpts from the heated exchange.Trump (responding to a reporter): I’m not aligned with Putin. I’m not aligned with anybody. I’m aligned with the United States of America. And for the good of the world. I’m aligned with the world. And I want to get this thing over with. You see the hatred he’s got for Putin. It’s very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hate. He’s got tremendous hatred. And I understand that. But I can tell you the other side isn’t exactly in love with him either.So it’s not a question of alignment. I’m aligned with the world. I want to get the thing set. I’m aligned with Europe. I want to see if we can get this thing done. You want me to be tough? I can be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen. I’d be so tough. But you’re never going to get a deal that way. So that’s the way it goes.Vice President JD Vance: I will respond to this. So look, for four years in the United States of America, we had a president who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin. And then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States’ words mattered more than the president of the United States’ actions.What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That’s what President Trump is doing.Zelensky: Yeah. OK. He occupied it, our parts. Big parts of Ukraine. Part of east and Crimea. So he occupied it on 2014. So during a lot of years, I’m not speaking about just Biden. But those times was Obama, then President Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now the President Trump. And God bless: Now President Trump will stop him. But during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people. Trump: 2015.Zelensky: 2014.Vance: 2014 and 2015.Trump: 2014. I was not here.Zelensky: But during 2014 ’til 2022.(…) Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations. My bilateral conversation. And we signed with him. Me, like a new president. In 2019, I signed with him the deal I signed with him, Macron and Merkel. We signed cease-fire, cease-fire. All of them told me that he will never go. We signed him. Gas contract. Gas contract. But after that, he broken the cease-fire. He killed our people and he didn’t exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn’t do it. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?Vance: I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.Vance: Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect. I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have man power problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.Zelensky: Have you ever been to Ukraine? You say what problems we have.Vance: I have been to—Zelensky: Come once.Vance: I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you’ve had problems bringing people into your military?Zelensky: We have problems. I will answer.Vance: And do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?Zelensky: A lot of questions. Let’s start from the beginning.Vance: Sure.Zelensky: First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now, but you will feel it in the future. Trump: You don’t know that.Zelensky: God bless, you will not have a war.Trump: Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.Zelensky: I’m not telling you.Trump: Because you’re in no position to dictate that. Remember this: You’re in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel. We’re going to feel very good.Zelensky: You will feel influence. I’m telling you.Trump: We’re going to feel very good and very strong.Zelensky: You will feel influence.Trump: You’re right now not in a very good position.Trump: You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position. And he happens to be right about. You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us you start having cards.Zelensky: I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious. I’m the president in a war—Trump: You’re playing cards. You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III. You’re gambling with World War III. And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.Vance: Have you said ‘thank you’ once this entire meeting? No. In this entire meeting, have you said ‘thank you’? You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who is trying to save your country.Zelensky: Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you—Trump: He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. Wait a minute.Zelensky: Can I answer?Trump: No. No. You’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.Zelensky: I know. I know.Trump: You’re not winning. You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.Zelensky: Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong, from the very beginning of the war, we’ve been alone, and we are thankful. I said thanks in this cabinet, and only in this cabinet.Trump: You haven’t been alone. We gave you through this stupid president, $350 billion. We gave you military equipment. And your men are brave. But they had to use our military. If you didn’t have our military equipment—Zelensky: You invited me—Trump: If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.Zelensky: In three days. I heard it from Putin: in three days.Trump: Maybe less.Zelensky: This is something, in two weeks. Of course. Yes.Trump: It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. I tell you.Vance: Just say thank you.Zelensky: I said it a lot of times thank you to the American people.Vance: Accept that there are disagreements. And let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.Trump: But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful.Zelensky: I am thankful.Trump: You don’t have the cards. You’re buried there, your people are dying. You’re running low on soldiers.Zelensky: Don’t, please, Mr. President.Trump: Listen. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a cease-fire. I don’t want a cease-fire. I want to go, and I want this.’ Look, if you could get a cease-fire right now, I’d tell you, you take it. So the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.Zelensky: Of course we want to stop the war.Trump: But you’re saying you don’t want a cease-fire.Zelensky: But I said to you, with guarantees.Trump: I want a cease-fire, because you’ll get a cease-fire faster than an agreement.Zelensky: Ask our people about cease-fire, what they think—Trump: There wasn’t with me. That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. That was with Obama.Zelensky: It was your president.Trump: Excuse me. That was with Obama, who gave you sheets, and I gave you javelins.Zelensky: Yes.Trump: I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is: Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave javelins. You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards. But without us, you don’t have any cards.It’s going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.Reporter: What if Russia breaks cease-fire? What if Russia breaks peace talks? What do you do then? I understand that it’s a heated conversation?Trump: What are you saying?Vance: She’s asking: What if Russia breaks the cease-fire?Trump: What if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? OK? What if they broke it? I don’t know, they broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect Obama. They respect me. Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony. That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam. And he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, ‘Oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.’ The 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam. And he had to put up with that.He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. He did. Maybe. Maybe he didn’t. I don’t know what happened. But he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if he can make a deal.The problem is, I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave.Zelensky: Thank you.Trump: But you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out.But you don’t have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest. That’s not a nice thing.All right. I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think, huh? This is going to be great television. I will say that. All right. We’ll see what we can do about putting it together. Thank you.Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News that President Zelensky should use his scheduled interview with host Bret Baier to apologize and tell the world that he “screwed up big time.” Graham was among several senators who met with Zelensky before his meeting with the president. “I told him this morning, don’t take the bait, don’t let the media or anybody else get you into an argument with President Trump,” he said, adding, “Zelensky is going to have to fundamentally change or go.”Graham was sent out to talk with reporters at the White House, so his comments can reasonably be taken as a message from Trump.ImageCredit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTPresident Zelensky issued a statement on social media thanking the United States and President Trump. “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,” he wrote, then he thanked Trump. While berating Zelensky earlier at the White House, Trump had told the Ukrainian president, “You’re not acting at all thankful.”President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine were supposed to sign an agreement here in the East Room of the White House today for the United States to share in Ukraine’s rare mineral wealth. But the ceremony was canceled after a heated exchange between Trump, Zelensky and Vice President JD Vance in the Oval Office.ImageCredit...Doug Mills/The New York TimesPresident Emmanuel Macron of France did not comment directly on the Oval Office blowup between President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Trump. But speaking to reporters on a state visit to Portugal, Macron insisted that “there is an aggressor, Russia, and an aggressed people, Ukraine” and that “we must thank all those who have helped, and we must respect those who have been fighting since the beginning, because they are fighting for their dignity, their independence, for their children and for the security of Europe.” Dmitri Medvedev, a former Russian president and the current deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, has called the televised altercation between President Trump and President Zelensky a “dressing-down at the Oval Office.” On his Telegram channel, Medvedev, the first senior Russia official to weigh in on the Trump-Zelensky meeting, praised the U.S. president for “telling the truth” to Zelensky’s face and urged him to suspend military aid for Ukraine.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFox News says that Zelensky’s planned interview with Bret Baier is, for now at least, still scheduled to go ahead today.The planned signing of a U.S.-Ukraine agreement over rare minerals did not happen, a White House press officer confirmed. The departure was an extraordinary moment at the White House: the leader of an ally whose country is fighting for its life abruptly leaving, or being thrown out, after an explosive shouting match in the Oval Office.VideotranscripttranscriptReporter: “Mr. President is there no deal?

After journalists left the Oval Office, Mr. Trump canceled the rest of the visit, including a planned joint news conference and signing ceremony for a deal on rare minerals, and U.S. officials told the Ukrainians to leave. A grim-faced Mr. Zelensky strode out, climbed into a waiting black sport utility vehicle and departed the White House grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” \u003ca href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114082877976878390\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMr. Trump wrote on social media\u003c/a\u003e. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe White House later sent out Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close Trump ally, to tell reporters that Mr. Zelensky should consider stepping down. “He either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with or he needs to change,” Mr. Graham said on the White House driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe president’s verbal assault on Mr. Zelensky was a stunning display of anger and resentment toward the leader of a country that has been invaded by a larger power intent on eliminating it as an independent state. No other president in memory has lashed out at a visiting foreign leader in the Oval Office on camera in such a vituperative way, not even at an adversary of the United States, much less a putative ally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTalking over the Ukrainian leader, Mr. Vance called Mr. Zelensky “disrespectful” for coming into the Oval Office and making his case in front of the American news media and demanded that he thank Mr. Trump for his efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia.

Putin of Russia and antipathy for Mr. Zelensky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as he shouted at the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office, the president spoke of Mr. Putin as if they were friends, saying that the Russian leader has “been through a lot with me” in enduring the “Russia hoax,” referring to the investigation of Mr. Putin’s clandestine efforts to help Mr. Trump win the 2016 election.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe confrontation provided a major boost to Mr. Putin, who has long sought to drive a wedge between Ukraine and its most important patron, the United States. Russian officials seemed overjoyed on social media. Dmitri A. Medvedev, a top Putin lieutenant, praised Mr. Trump for “telling the truth” to Mr. Zelensky’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmerica’s traditional European allies, on the other hand, were deeply alarmed and rallied behind Mr. Zelensky, with the leaders of France, Germany, Poland and others issuing statements of support for Ukraine and its beleaguered leader. The show of solidarity came just days after the United States sided with Russia over Europe in opposing a U.N. resolution condemning Russian aggression on the third anniversary of its full-fledged invasion of Ukraine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the White House, Mr. Zelensky tried to smooth over the rupture with a social media post aimed at Mr. Vance’s complaints about ingratitude. “Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people,” \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1895555315716014324\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehe wrote\u003c/a\u003e, using the acronym for president of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a later interview with Fox News, Mr. Zelensky refused to apologize to Mr. Trump, but expressed regret about the exchange and appreciation to the United States for its support. “We are thankful and sorry for this,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Trump seemed less interested in making up. Speaking with reporters on the South Lawn before heading to Florida for the weekend, the president said that Mr. Zelensky opposes peace. “He’s looking to go on and fight, fight, fight,” Mr. Trump said. Asked if he wanted Mr. Zelensky to step down, he said, “I want somebody that’s going to make peace.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Vance’s eagerness to assail Mr. Zelensky raised the question of whether it was a planned or impromptu ambush. Mr. Vance has never been a supporter of Ukraine and said in 2022 that “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Mr. Vance began chastising Mr. Zelensky, it seemed to prompt Mr. Trump to join in. The result, though, was the blowup of an \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/world/europe/trump-us-ukraine-mineral-deal.html\" title=\"\"\u003eeconomic deal that Mr. Trump had prioritized in recent days\u003c/a\u003e, a commitment by Ukraine to turn over rare mineral rights to repay U.S. military aid over the past three years. The \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/ukraine-mineral-deal-trump.html\" title=\"\"\u003efuture of that deal\u003c/a\u003e remained unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Zelensky’s hurriedly arranged visit to Washington to sign that deal was meant to smooth over tensions with Mr. Trump, who just last week parroted Russian talking points by falsely claiming that Ukraine “started” the war and calling Mr. Zelensky a “dictator without elections.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Mr. Zelensky agreeing to the minerals deal, Mr. Trump seemed ready to make nice by telling reporters on Thursday that he did not even remember the dictator comment and expressing respect for the Ukrainian leader. He welcomed Mr. Zelensky at the door of the West Wing on Friday morning with an honor guard, and they shook hands politely but without evident warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe encounter, though, quickly turned hostile shortly after they sat down in the Oval Office with journalists present. Mr. Zelensky, dressed in his usual dark long-sleeved shirt, sought to explain the history of the war with Russia, noting that it went back to 2014 when Moscow first seized Crimea and occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and continued through Mr. Trump’s first term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also expressed skepticism of peace efforts mentioned by Mr. Vance. “What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about?” he asked. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBristling, Mr. Vance replied: “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe then began assailing Mr. Zelensky. “I think it\u0026#39;s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Mr. Vance lectured. “You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe accused Mr. Zelensky of mounting a “propaganda tour” in the United States. “Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Zelensky tried to respond to Mr. Vance’s assertions and said that the United States could feel threatened by Russia some day. “You have a nice ocean and don’t feel now, but you will feel it in the future,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat set off Mr. Trump, who cut off Mr. Zelensky. “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel,” he said, raising his voice. “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m not playing cards,” Mr. Zelensky replied. “I’m very serious, Mr. President.

Two officials were dispatched to inform the Ukrainians, who were waiting in the Roosevelt Room. One Ukrainian official proposed a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky to calm things down, the person said, but the Americans said no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Graham later called the meeting a “complete, utter disaster” but blamed it on Mr. Zelensky, saying that he had advised the Ukrainian leader in a meeting earlier in the day: “Don’t take the bait. Don’t let the media or anyone else get you into an argument with President Trump.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a measure of how much Republicans have fallen behind Mr. Trump that Mr. Graham and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, both onetime hawks and strong supporters of Ukraine against Russia, backed the president and vice president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump?” Mr. Graham said. “I have never been more proud of the president.

It was the highest of high-stakes talks — one that could determine the fate of millions, the existence of a sovereign nation and the security of a continent — going wildly off the rails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut for Mr. Trump, one thing that was on his mind, as always, was the ratings. He sounded almost excited by the drama of the spectacle, as though he could feel the front pages of the world’s newspapers being written in real time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a man who spent years yelling at people on TV as a way to make a living. He is wired to think about things in terms of “great television.” He is a highly conscious performer. But playacting as a tough guy on NBC on Thursday nights between 9 and 10 p.m. is not the same thing as bossing around an ally before the eyes of the world, even if Mr. Trump uses the same language to describe one performance as he would the other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, how one postures before the cameras is of paramount importance in this White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the meeting, the president did an imitation of Mr. Zelensky in front of the cameras and said: “All of a sudden, he’s a big shot.” Where Mr. Trump is involved, there is usually room enough for one big shot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other European leaders who had come to Washington over the past few weeks to reason with him about Russia understood this. They knew how to play their parts in the Oval Office while the cameras were rolling. President Emmanuel Macron of France literally held Mr. Trump’s hand at one point. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer presented a letter from King Charles III to Mr. Trump for all to see. It went over so well that Mr. Trump brought the letter out to wave around again a little while later at their joint news conference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not that Mr. Zelensky doesn’t know how to perform. He was a television actor before he became president and has been skillful in using the media as he tries to galvanize support. But evidently the role of supplicant was not one he was going to play Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight away, things got off to a bad start, since Mr. Trump seemed to feel the Ukrainian leader was not properly costumed: He wasn’t wearing a suit. “He’s all dressed up today,” Mr. Trump said sarcastically as he greeted him outside the West Wing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily, in the theater of Trump, it is the journalist who plays the role of the heel. The president regularly clashes with members of the news media, and everybody more or less knows how to play their parts. This time the character arguing with him up there was another president — one with his own aims and his own experience playing to the world’s cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVice President JD Vance told Mr. Zelensky that it was “disrespectful” for him to “try to litigate this in front of the American media.” But so much of the Trump doctrine is litigated before the media. And it was Mr. Vance — a onetime best-selling author and TV talking head who is media savvy himself — who seemed particularly determined to instigate a blowup while reporters were in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside the White House, hundreds of journalists lined up for a news conference that would never come. When Mr. Trump announced that he was calling it off, a mob of cameras rushed across the pavement to get the shot. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Zelensky emerged from West Wing. He climbed into the back of a black Chevrolet suburban adorned with two little flags, one American and one Ukrainian. All the cameras slowly turned to watch as he made his way down the drive and away from the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"FeedItem\" id=\"ad-0\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"61\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-ad0\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvertisement\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"#after-dfp-ad-mid1\"\u003eSKIP ADVERTISEMENT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-post\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/28/us/trump-news#trump-zelensky-europe-leaders\" data-source-id=\"100000010020425\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"60\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ2ZmUzMDc3LTYzYTAtNTc1NC1hYmVkLWVhNTI1NDg2ZjExZg==\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/tim-balk\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Tim Balk\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbStandard.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 75w, https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/14/reader-center/author-tim-balk/author-tim-balk-thumbLarge.png?quality=75\u0026amp;auto=webp 150w\" sizes=\"40px\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzQ2ZmUzMDc3LTYzYTAtNTc1NC1hYmVkLWVhNTI1NDg2ZjExZg==\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#trump-zelensky-europe-leaders\"\u003eEurope rallies around Zelensky after the explosive White House meeting.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"imageblock-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-figure\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eImage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption data-testid=\"photoviewer-children-caption\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePresident Volodymyr Zelensky leaving the White House after a heated meeting with President Trump on Friday.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCredit...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan aria-hidden=\"false\"\u003eDoug Mills/The New York Times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eEuropean leaders quickly pledged their continued support for Ukraine on Friday after President Trump’s blistering criticism of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a meeting at the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn statement after statement, leaders in France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Norway, Finland, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia, Belgium, Lithuania, Luxembourg, and Ireland lined up behind Ukraine and praised its embattled leader. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven as Western leaders generally shied from explicitly criticizing Mr. Trump, who had told Mr. Zelensky he was “not in a good position” and angrily threatened to pull American support for Ukraine unless he agreed to a cease-fire deal with Russia, many in Europe addressed their statements of encouragement directly to Mr. Zelensky. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Your dignity honors the bravery of the Ukrainian people,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, \u003ca href=\"https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1895565933265260843\" title=\"\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esaid on social media\u003c/a\u003e, referring to Mr. Zelensky. “Be strong, be brave, be fearless.
