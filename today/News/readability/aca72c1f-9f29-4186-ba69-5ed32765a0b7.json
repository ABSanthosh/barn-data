The Biden administration has been in contact with militia leaders but has wrestled with how to directly engage, in part because the United States has designated the lead rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, as a terrorist organization.In an early concession to the group, the United States will no longer pursue a bounty of up to $10 million for its leader, Ahmed al-Shara, formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.That announcement was made in a Friday briefing for reporters by Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, one of three Biden officials who visited Damascus and met there with Mr. al-Shara. She was joined by Roger D. Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Daniel Rubinstein, the new special adviser on Syria. Mr. Carstens traveled to Syria in 2020 seeking more information from the Assad government on Mr. Tice; he was accompanied by Kash Patel, then the principal deputy in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
