Calling the claim \"false,\" Trump said that he never applied to Harvard University. He graduated from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, \"Michael Wolff, a Third Rate Reporter, who is laughed at even by the scoundrels of the Fake News, recently stated that the only reason I’m “beating up” on Harvard, is because I applied there, and didn’t get in. That story is totally FALSE, I never applied to Harvard. I graduated from the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. He is upset because his book about me was a total “BOMB.” Nobody wanted it, because his “reporting” and reputation is so bad!\"Earlier, Michael Wolff claimed that Trump’s long feud with Harvard University reportedly stemmed from his own failure to gain admission in 1964.“But the other thing is that, by the way, he didn’t get into Harvard. So one of the Trump things is always holding a grudge against the Ivy Leagues,” author of bestsellers Fire \u0026 Fury said at The Daily Beast Podcast.There are no proof to confirm the Michael Wolff 's claim as there are no official record—public or private—that confirms Donald Trump ever applied to Harvard in the 1960s.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has escalated its crackdown on Harvard, first freezing $2.2 billion in federal funding and then suspending the university’s ability to enroll international students. These punitive measures followed Harvard’s failure to comply with government demands to address reported antisemitic incidents and to provide federal officials with lists of foreign students.",
