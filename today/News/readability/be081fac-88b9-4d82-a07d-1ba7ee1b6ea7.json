He was distraught about what members of his family, including his mother and 13-year-old son, along with his friends, were enduring there. He began having nightmares and panic attacks and was unable to sleep.Determined to support his family and help his country rebuild, Mr. Al Kadiri decided to book a ticket home.“Lebanon was going into an apocalyptic phase,” Mr. Al Kadiri, 40, said on a recent morning in the outskirts of Beirut. “Going back was the only best option.”Lebanon’s large and influential diaspora — estimated at nearly three times the size of the country’s population of 5.7 million — has been trickling back, hoping to offer physical and financial support for a country devastated by one of the bloodiest wars in decades in the Mediterranean nation.ImageAbed Al Kadiri, an artist, in his studio in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in January. He watched from abroad as areas in and around the city, where he grew up, were pummeled by Israeli bombardments.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
