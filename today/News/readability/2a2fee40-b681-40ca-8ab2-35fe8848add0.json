  "text": "Israel launched a strike on a suburb of southern Beirut on Friday, the first such attack on the Lebanese capital since Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire late last year.Traffic quickly filled the streets of the Hadath neighborhood after Israel’s military issued an evacuation warning, saying it was targeting a building it identified as a Hezbollah facility. Video from the southern suburbs showed schoolchildren with backpacks rushing along a street choked with cars and motorcycles. Lebanon’s education ministry issued an emergency order calling on all schools in the area to close.The evacuation warning Friday afternoon followed reports of two projectiles launched from Lebanese territory. One of the projectiles launched toward Israel was intercepted, the other fell in Lebanese territory. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed armed group and Lebanese political party, denied launching the rockets, according to a statement carried by Lebanon’s state news agency. The statement also said Hezbollah remains committed to the ceasefire agreement.Israel initially responded with strikes on southern Lebanon on Friday morning. Lebanon’s health ministry said the attacks killed three people and injured 18 more in the town of Kfar Tibet, just a few miles from the Israeli border.It comes less than a week after Israel launched its most extensive strikes on Lebanese territory since the ceasefire. The Israeli airstrikes launched last week killed seven and wounded 40 in the south and east of the country, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.The ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel continued to hold despite the extensive airstrikes last week, but the exchange fueled concerns that the fragile truce in Lebanon could be imperiled by violence elsewhere in the region. The fighting in Gaza resumed this month, and the United States continues to strike another Iranian ally, the Houthis in Yemen.Here’s what else to knowIsrael’s parliament passed legislation Thursday giving lawmakers greater political influence over the appointment of the nation’s judges, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started the process of firing the head of Israel’s security service, and passed a hotly-debated budget.Iran’s foreign minister said the country was willing to engage in indirect negotiations, after President Donald Trump said he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader expressing his desire to negotiate a nuclear deal but reiterating the prospect of a military attack.At least 50,208 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, and more than 113,910 have been wounded, according to the latest figures from the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of those killed were women and children.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered its war in Gaza, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 407 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.",
