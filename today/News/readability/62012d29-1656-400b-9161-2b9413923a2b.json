  "text": "Elon Musk and Scott Bessent's fight was not just a push or shove, Musk punched Bessent like a rugby player. A more salacious account of the beginning of the Elon Musk- Donald Trump feud has now surfaced, courtesy MAGA activist Steve Bannon, who claimed that the physical fight between Elon Musk and Scott Bessent was not just a push or shove. But Elon Musk hit Bessent's ribcage like a rugby player and Bessent too hit Musk. Multiple people had to step in to break up the fight as they reached the then NSA Mike Waltz's office. Bannon earlier narrated the physical fight but now presented more details of it after Trump, Musk's ultimate showdown. Bannon said when Trump heard about it he said it was \"too much\". But this episode had no contribution to Elon Musk's recent black eye as this took place weeks ago when Waltz was the National Security Adviser but the episode can be earmarked as the beginning of the end. Mid-April, Musk and Bessent went to the Oval officer to make their respective cases about their preferences for the acting IRS commissioner. Trump supported Bessent's choice which rankled Musk. After they exited the Oval Office, they started exchanging insults. Bessent called Elon Musk a fraud. That led to the exchange of blows. Before this, Musk expressed his feelings about Trump's tariffs and made personal appeals to Trump to revese the tariffs. After his exit from the White House, Musk started to attack Donald Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill and their public spat brought their relationship to an end with Elon Musk calling Trump ungrateful, liar and also a pedophile as he hinted that Trump's name is there in Epstein Files. He also called for Trump's impeachment. Donald Trump reacted in a measured way threatening to cut federal funding for Musk's companies. Elon Musk. A day later, Musk deleted his most damning post linking Trump to Epstein but Trump issued another threat that Elon Musk will face very serious consequences if he starts bankrolling Democrats for office.",
