The ship's full restoration is expected to be completed before a ruling party meeting this month.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had witnessed the initial failed launch of the destroyer, had excoriated the accident as caused by \"carelessness\" that tarnished national dignity, and he ordered the ship restored before the party meeting.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
