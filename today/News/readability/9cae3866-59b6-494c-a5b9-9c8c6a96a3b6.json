  "text": "A drone was launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in the Caesarea area, his office said Saturday. However, it did not hit his home, and both Netanyahu and his wife were not present at the time, with no casualties reported, his spokesman Omer Dostri added.The Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that Israel was intensifying “its targeting of the health system” in northern Gaza. At least three people were killed as three hospitals came under attack, the ministry said.“The Israeli forces fired a spree of bullets and artillery” against the perimeter of one hospital and shelled the upper floor of another, Munir al-Bursh, the general director of all hospitals in Gaza, told The Post. The Health Ministry reported one death after the entrance to a laboratory at Kamal Adwan Hospital was targeted. It said two patients died inside Indonesian Hospital as a result of the siege and power outage. It added that al-Awda Hospital was also targeted.Hours earlier, on Friday, Israeli strikes on homes in Jabalya, also in northern Gaza, killed 33 people, Gaza’s civil defense force said. In a statement Saturday, the Israeli army said its forces were “operating against terrorists” in the Jabalya area. It added that its forces “operating near the Indonesian Hospital” were “briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure” and that “there was no intentional fire directed at it.”Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar this week raised hopes that peace could be on the horizon in the battered Gaza Strip. President Joe Biden said Thursday in the aftermath of Sinwar’s death that there is “now the opportunity for a ‘day after’ in Gaza.” But on Friday he offered a more restrained perspective, telling reporters that “there’s a possibility of working to a cease-fire in Lebanon,” where Israel is targeting Hezbollah, while “it’s going to be harder in Gaza.”Here are other key developments today:Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin to discuss the progress made in “targeted raids and precision strikes” conducted by the Israel Defense Forces in Lebanon, a readout from Gallant’s office said. Gallant emphasized that the purpose of those sites in southern Lebanon was to serve as “launchpads for October 7-style attacks … which Israel will not allow,” it continued.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the death of Hamas leader Sinwar “painful” in a statement Saturday, but he insisted that the movement would not “halt its progress,” adding: “Hamas is alive and will stay alive.”In a rare rebuke, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister accused Iran of attempting “to establish a rejected guardianship over Lebanon” and said Iran’s envoy should be summoned in response to reporting that a senior Iranian official said Tehran is ready to help negotiate a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Najib Mikati in a statement called the comments “a blatant interference in Lebanese affairs.”At least 2,448 people have been killed in Lebanon during the war, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. At least 42,519 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Neither distinguishes between civilians and combatants.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 353 soldiers have been killed in its Gaza military operations since then.Live coverage contributors 9IDF and Hezbollah continue trading attacksReturn to menuOn Saturday, strikes pounded Israel and Lebanon as the Israel Defense Forces and Hezbollah continued to trade fire. One man in northern Israel was killed when his vehicle was hit by shrapnel, emergency officials said. A large blast was identified in Lebanon’s Dahiya area, and at least two people were killed by a drone in Lebanon’s city of Jounieh, according to Lebanese state-run media.The IDF sent out several evacuation warnings Saturday afternoon local time, including for an area of Dahiya and Burj al-Barajneh in Beirut’s southern suburbs. A strike in the Dahiya area were reported that afternoon, and photos from news agencies showed smoke rising from the Dahiya area, in the vicinity of the Beirut international airport.An Israeli drone killed a man and woman who were driving on a highway in Jounieh, north of Beirut, on Saturday, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported.IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said Saturday night that in the last few hours, the IDF targeted five buildings in the Dahiya where he said ammunition storage facilities were “hidden in civilian buildings.” He said that more than 1,500 Hezbollah members have been killed since the start of the war.The Israeli military also said that it is conducting what it called “limited, localized, targeted ground raids” in southern Lebanon, and it has destroyed over 50 tunnel shafts including what it said was “an underground Hezbollah ‘Radwan Force’ command center,” which included an area for weapons storage and motorbikes.On Saturday, Israel’s military said about 180 projectiles were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel, leading to at least one death and several injuries.A 50-year-old man died after shrapnel struck his car in the northern Ein Hamifratz area, Israeli paramedics and Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel’s emergency services, said. Next to the 50-year-old driver was another passenger, who said that the driver wasn’t able to duck when an explosion hit following sirens, according to MDA senior EMT Alex Mutzkin in a statement.At least 10 others were injured in strikes across northern Israel Saturday, two in moderate condition and eight in mild condition, said MDA in a statement.U.S. and U.N. differ in assessments of current aid levels to Gaza Return to menuNAPLES, Italy — Israel is taking steps to increase aid flows into the Gaza Strip, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday, providing a provisional assessment of a critical issue that the Biden administration has tied to the provision of arms and other military aid.But Austin’s positive preliminary assessment was at odds with statements by U.N. officials who said Israel has failed to allow significant aid quantities into Gaza’s most desperate northern areas, and has continued to tell Gazans to leave their homes in parts of northern Gaza.Austin made his assessment almost a week after he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a letter to top Israeli officials pressing them about dire humanitarian needs in northern Gaza, and linking the country’s performance on that count to American laws and policies that would require Washington to suspend arms supplies if Israel violates the laws of war or U.S. norms.“What we saw recently was a sharp decline in the amount of [humanitarian aid] that was going in,” Austin told reporters following a meeting of G-7 defense ministers in Naples. “We need to bend that curve in the other direction.”Asked whether the United States was seeing that decline being reversed in the days since his Oct. 13 letter, Austin said: “I am seeing things being done to get more aid in; yes.”Austin and Blinken in their letter set out specific criteria they wanted to see Israel meet within 30 days, including ensuring that at least 350 aid trucks can enter Gaza daily and lifting evacuation orders when not operationally required.On Saturday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, said that a dozen trucks carrying flour were permitted into Gaza City this week, “by far not enough.”While the officials’ letter did not explicitly threaten to suspend arms supplies, it referenced U.S. laws and policies that could require the United States to suspend arms shipments if Israel is found to have violated international law.Austin urged Israel to use the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in an Israeli operation this week, to reshape its operations in Gaza.“I think we .. have a window of opportunity … to really begin to focus in earnest on people,” he said.The recent U.S. warnings on aid have been paired with steps to increase American support to Israel’s defense. The Pentagon recently deployed an advanced air defense system to Israel amid the country’s intensifying standoff with chief adversary Iran.Austin, a former Army general who commanded troops in combat across the Middle East, also called out Israel for its treatment of civilians in Lebanon, where Israeli forces are conducting ground operations in the country’s south and also bombing targets across the country.Austin blamed Hezbollah for concealing weapons among civilians but also urged Israel to take greater care. “The number of civilian casualties have been far too high,” Austin said of Israel’s deepening involvement in Lebanon. “We would like to Israel scare back on some of the strikes that it’s taking, especially in and around Beirut”Three killed as hospitals come under fire in northern Gaza, officials sayReturn to menuAttacks rattled three hospitals in northern Gaza on Saturday, with at least three people killed, hospital and Health Ministry officials said.The Gaza Health Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Israel was intensifying “its targeting of the health system” in north Gaza — as the Kamal Adwan, Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals came under siege or fire. It called on international institutions to “intervene urgently to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip.”It said two patients had died inside the Indonesian Hospital, as a result of the power outage and lack of medical supplies. One other person was killed at the entrance to Kamal Adwan Hospital laboratory and several others were injured, it said. The general director of all hospitals in Gaza, Munir al-Bursh, said in a message to The Washington Post that “a spree of bullets and artillery” had been fired at the perimeter of Kamal Adwan.At the Indonesian Hospital, there were more than 40 patients and several staff members inside during the bombardment, the Health Ministry said. It added that Israel had targeted the upper floors of the hospital as well as a group of displaced people outside, and that the hospital is experiencing a power outage.Bursh said that while none of the dozens of people inside that hospital were injured, some outside had been hurt. He said a wall outside the hospital had been destroyed and the hospital was filled with smoke, with fires in some parts. “Medical staff has gathered in one place fearing for their lives, with the patients, in a corner at the hospital,” he added.The Israel Defense Forces said troops operating in the area near the Indonesian Hospital had “been trained for the operational activity and briefed on the importance of mitigating harm to civilians and medical infrastructure.” It added there had been “no intentional fire” directed at the hospital.”Lebanese Christians, caught in crossfire, refuse to leave war zoneReturn to menuQLAAYA, Lebanon — The Israeli fighter jet, roaring overhead, unleashed devastation on its nearby target. The blast shook Marita El Hajj’s house and rattled the windows.The 9-year-old continued to stare straight ahead. Eyes glazed, face impassive, she barely flinched. In this Maronite Christian village less than three miles from the Israeli border, such strikes are now nearly constant.Through the past year, Marita has physically felt the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah growing more intense. The symptoms of her autism have deteriorated sharply in the past three weeks, her parents said, as the fight around their village has exploded into all-out war.“We just want peace,” said Marita’s mother, Manal El Hajj. “We do not want this war.”This is an excerpt from a full story.Israelis, Palestinians brace for aftermath of Sinwar’s killing in GazaReturn to menuJERUSALEM — A day after learning of the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, diplomats and governments on Friday pushed to take advantage of the unexpected killing as a chance to restart moribund talks for a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of hostages.President Joe Biden said Thursday that Secretary of State Antony Blinken would visit Israel within days in another attempt to push the process forward, while Vice President Kamala Harris said in a social media post that Sinwar’s death “gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting of security officials Friday, according to Israeli media reports, which said the discussions focused on efforts to prevent Hamas from harming the hostages to avenge Sinwar’s killing. Netanyahu’s office declined to comment.It remained far from clear who would represent Hamas if talks reconvene.This is an excerpt from a full story.Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.History: The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex, predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
