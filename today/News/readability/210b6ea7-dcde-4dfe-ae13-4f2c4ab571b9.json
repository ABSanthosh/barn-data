Former White House communications director and current investor, Anthony Scaramucci's forgotten investment in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock for his newborn son turned into a powerful lesson on the rewards of long-term investing. What Happened: Last year, during a recent appearance on The Julia La Roche Show, Scaramucci shared how, at 28 years old, he purchased $1,200 worth of Microsoft stock for his son, AJ, shortly after his birth in September 1992. Don’t Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation. At the time, he opted to check the box to reinvest dividends, even though Microsoft wasn't paying any. “I had an account, it was for my son AJ,” Scaramucci recalled. “He was born on the 23rd of September in 1992. On Oct. 1, I bought him $1,200 of Microsoft.” Back then, with no internet access and only paper statements being mailed, Scaramucci moved a few times, and his brokerage, Goldman Sachs, lost track of his address. The account sat untouched for nearly three decades. “We found the account, it was 26–27 years later,” Scaramucci said. “I think I said it went up $88,000, but my son said, ‘No, Dad, it went up $288,000.'” Previously, during a podcast, Scaramucci incorrectly shared that his investment went up around $72,000. The longtime investor admitted he would have likely sold the stock during Microsoft’s stagnant period under former CEO Steve Ballmer had he known he still owned it. “There was a period of time when Steve Ballmer was running that company... they were flatlining at Microsoft for about eight or nine years,” Scaramucci said. “I would have sold that stock, didn’t know I owned it, and it ended up being a big win.” See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Why It’s Important: Microsoft went public on March 13, 1986, with an initial offering price of $21. Shares closed their first day of trading at $27.75, with more than 2.5 million shares exchanged. Over the years, Microsoft underwent several stock splits, including 2-for-1 splits in 1987 and 1990, followed by 3-for-2 splits in 1991 and 1992. Additional 2-for-1 splits occurred in 1994, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2003.",
