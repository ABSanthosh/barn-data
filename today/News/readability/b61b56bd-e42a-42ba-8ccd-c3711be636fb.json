  "text": "LONDON — Boris Johnson has published his political memoir. The book is like the former prime minister: Funny. Frustrating. And not entirely believable. At least, that’s the early take.The book, titled “Unleashed,” was released in Britain on Thursday. It will be available in the United States next week. Online preorder sales were brisk in the United Kingdom.There are some spicy reveals. Queen Elizabeth II, he says, suffered from bone cancer. Her death certificate said simply she died of “old age.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he suggests, may have planted a listening device in his Foreign Office bathroom during a visit to London in 2017. Or as Johnson recalled, “it may or may not be a coincidence but I am told that later, when they were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox.”In another passage, Johnson recounts asking his military advisers “whether it might be technically feasible to launch an aquatic raid” on a warehouse in the Netherlands to recover AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine doses he believed were owed to Britain.The revelations have made minor news and sparked rounds of chat on TV and social media here. But British readers seem to be viewing the memoir more as entertainment than definitive history.Although he still writes an opinion column in the Daily Mail and is fairly popular with the public, Johnson is no longer a highly influential political figure. His words have carried limited weight since he was pushed out of office by members of his own party, who had grown furious with his inability to give straight answers.Will the memoir burnish his image? Lay the groundwork for a comeback? Or reinforce the sense that he was an unserious leader?The Daily Mail, which has been running excerpts, proclaimed it “the political memoir of the century.” The London Times called it “childishly amusing.” The Guardian went with “memoirs of a clown.”The book covers Johnson’s years as London mayor, Brexit campaigner, foreign secretary and prime minister. Coming in at 772 pages, it retains the feel, the propulsion, of a dashed-off newspaper column, with all the usual Johnsonian giddy word play — alongside lots of references to ancient Rome and Greece.In Johnson’s telling, his predecessor, Prime Minister Theresa May, was “old grumpy-knickers.”President Donald Trump was “like an orange-hued dirigible exuberantly buoyed aloft by the inexhaustible Primus stove of his own ego.”The short-statured French President Emmanuel Macron wore a “Cuban-heeled bootee” and was a “positive nuisance” over Brexit. On a serious note, Johnson claims that Macron was “weaponizing” illegal migration during the Brexit negotiations by turning a blind eye toward the gangs smuggling people across the dangerous English Channel.In the past week, Johnson has been doing the rounds on British television talk shows. The exchanges have at times been rocky — and revealing as to how Johnson is viewed as a former leader.ITV interviewer Tom Bradby told Johnson that “Anthony Seldon, who I guess you would call, more or less, the sort of official biographer of prime ministers, says you’re the worst prime minister in British history.”Johnson: “Er, well, I —”Bradby, turning the screwdriver, “In the whole of history —”Johnson: “Well, I think, I don’t know. I don’t know this guy, uh, very well. But I think that’s complete nonsense.”On right-leaning GB News, Telegraph columnist Camilla Tominey asked: “Do people misunderstand you?”Johnson replied: “They understand me too well.”Tominey: “So when people criticize you as a buffoon? Another criticism is that you are a pathological liar?”Johnson responded that “a lot of very clever people were driven potty by Brexit, and they couldn’t believe that their argument, which they thought was better, had been defeated.”Asked on LBC Radio by host Nick Ferrari: “Which was your greater lie? Lying about proroguing Parliament to the queen, or lying to Parliament about the [rule-breaking pandemic] parties?”Johnson eventually answered, “Neither. Since neither of them were a lie, there was no lie.”A court ruled in 2019 that Johnson’s government had unlawfully suspended Parliament and been misleading — including, perhaps, to the queen — about its real reasons for doing so. And an investigation by lawmakers determined last year that Johnson deliberately misled Parliament about boozy government gatherings at the height of the covid lockdown.In the book, Johnson mostly blames the “Partygate” scandal — what he calls the “the whole Partygate hoo-ha” — on malicious leaks by his closest aides (whom he had hired).A “miserable and wildly inflated affair,” which he says distorted what happened when hardworking colleagues “briefly slackened the tempo of their work and raised a glass,” Johnson writes.Nothing to see here, people — except during that very same time, Johnson’s government effectively canceled Christmas, locked the pubs and wrote draconian rules that forbade families from gathering for funerals.In the Times of London, reviewer Tom Peck cautioned, “The reason Johnson, a biographer of notoriously dubious merit, has turned to autobiography significantly earlier than he would have liked is because his party correctly calculated that the country could no longer believe a word he had to say.”Asked if he wasn’t forever deflecting and blaming others, Johnson told one interviewer that “there’s yards and yards of self-loathing” in the book.He does say that he learned some things during his time in office. He writes that he made a “mistake” in offering “pathetic” and “groveling” apologies for the parties at Downing Street, which “made it look as though we were far more culpable than we were.”Johnson says he “has no idea” if he will ever run for office again. He writes: “I used to claim that my chances of becoming PM were about the same as being reincarnated as an olive or decapitated by a Frisbee. The longer I spend away from Westminster, the stronger my belief that you should only get involved if you really think you can be useful.”His memoir, filled with memories of how well he did things, as well as a long list of policy prescriptions, suggests he continues to see himself as highly useful.The book can be read as a pitch to run things again someday. At the end is a chapter titled “Some Pointers for the Future.” Johnson’s to-do list for Britain includes: fix capitalism, the climate crisis, housing, taxes and health care, as well as “the national obsession with running ourselves down.”Johnson still has supporters, but far, far fewer than at his peak.This year’s Conservative Party conference in Birmingham coincided with the publication of his memoir excerpts. Johnson was not the talk of the town. He had the whiff of yesterday’s man.At one conference event hosted by the Spectator magazine, which Johnson once edited, the audience was asked about his future prospects. In a show of hands, most participants opposed his return even as a lawmaker, let alone leader.",
