  "text": "Israel’s security cabinet will convene Tuesday to discuss details of a U.S.-backed cease-fire agreement with Lebanon to halt the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister.Intense negotiations over the past week have brought the two countries closer to an agreement, but the deal has not yet been finalized, according to Israeli, Lebanese and Western officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity Monday to discuss the precarious negotiations. Among the biggest sticking points is whether Israel will be allowed to continue striking targets in Lebanon that it considers threats.Israel and Lebanon have reached a tentative understanding on the terms of the deal ahead of the cabinet meeting, one Western official said. The deal, as it stands, would include a role for France, the official said. Israel, angered by France’s reaction to International Criminal Court arrest warrants issued last week for Israeli leaders, had tried in recent days to exclude the country, the official added.The ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu, former Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant and a Hamas leader on Thursday for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict. The French Foreign Ministry said it would fulfill its legal obligations to the ICC, which include arresting the subject of a warrant if that person enters the country.A Western diplomat with knowledge of the negotiations said both sides were prepared to approve the deal, but urged caution. “We have already lived moments where a deal was close before major escalatory steps were taken.”Here are other key developmentsHuman Rights Watch said Monday that an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon that killed three journalists last month was carried out with a U.S. bomb-guidance kit in what was “most likely a deliberate attack on civilians and an apparent war crime.” The Oct. 25 strike occurred without warning at 3:30 a.m., hitting a residence where the journalists were staying in the southern town of Hasbaya, The Washington Post reported.Israel carried out multiple strikes on the southern Lebanese district of Tyre on Monday, killing at least a dozen people, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The Israel Defense Forces said Hezbollah fired 30 projectiles into Israel on Monday.Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy strikes over the weekend. The IDF said Hezbollah fired 250 projectiles into Israel on Sunday, and Lebanese officials reported 29 dead from an Israeli strike in Beirut on Saturday. The IDF said Monday that it struck “several Hezbollah command centers” in Beirut’s southern suburbs.At least 44,235 people have been killed in Gaza during the war and 104,638 injured, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At least 3,768 people have been killed and 15,699 injured in Lebanon, the country’s Health Ministry said. Neither agency distinguishes between civilians and combatants.Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 378 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 10Israeli cabinet to convene Tuesday to discuss Hezbollah cease-fire dealReturn to menuJERUSALEM — Israel’s cabinet will convene Tuesday to discuss details of a U.S.-backed cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, according to a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister.Intense negotiations over the past week have brought the two sides closer, but the deal has not yet been finalized, according to Israeli, Lebanese and Western officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity Monday to discuss the precarious negotiations.“We believe we’re close” to an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire deal, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday. He added that Biden administration negotiator Amos Hochstein was back in Washington after “very positive” conversations with the governments of Lebanon and Israel.Kirby declined to comment on details of the proposed agreement. “We believe the trajectory is going in the right direction,” Kirby said, “but it’s not done.”Among the biggest sticking points is whether Israel will be allowed to continue striking targets in Lebanon that it considers threats. Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, asserted Monday that Israel will retain the ability to neutralize threats in southern Lebanon.But a top aide to Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, an intermediary for Hezbollah in the negotiations, dismissed the prospect of a clause that would enshrine Israel’s right to attack over Lebanon’s. “Self-defense is a legal right for both sides,” said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing talks.The aide added that a final draft of the deal is “not present yet.”In a briefing to reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday, Avi Dichter, a member of Israel’s security cabinet, said the cease-fire agreement would be markedly different from U.N. resolution 1701, which was signed to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.“The only way to bring back, safe and sound, our people to the villages along the border — there has to be something different. It cannot be like it happened before in 2006,” Dichter said. “There will be no Hezbollah south of the Litani River. We know it. And we are much more determined this time than we’ve been before.”DeYoung reported from Washington.Officials say Lebanon cease-fire deal not certain, but could be closeReturn to menuBEIRUT — Local officials and foreign diplomats said Monday that Israel and Lebanon are close to reaching a cease-fire agreement, but they cautioned that the deal could still fall apart at the last minute.A Lebanese official agreed that talks are progressing but added: “You never know what will happen between now and when it’s finalized.” Like others, the official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive, ongoing negotiations.“We have clearly made significant progress; however, we’re not there yet,” said a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.The proposal for the U.S.-backed cease-fire agreement will be discussed by Israel’s security cabinet on Tuesday, according to an Israeli official. If both sides agree, a cease-fire could bring at least a temporary pause to more than a year of fighting across the Israeli-Lebanese border that has led to enormous death, destruction and displacement.Previous cease-fire talks have broken down at the last minute, however. In early September, Western diplomats were optimistic that they were in the final stages of negotiations when an Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah and his top aides, ending any immediate hope for a break in fighting.“We should remain cautious as we have already lived moments where a deal was close before major escalatory steps were taken,” said one Western diplomat.Taylor reported from Washington. Abbie Cheeseman in Beirut and Michael Birnbaum in Washington contributed to this report.In wake of ICC warrants, U.K. says it would follow ‘due process’ if Netanyahu visitedReturn to menuBritain would follow due process if Israel’s prime minister visited the U.K., foreign minister David Lammy said.Lammy was asked on Monday if the U.K. would uphold the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu.“We are signatories to the Rome Statute, we have always been committed to our obligations under international law and international humanitarian law,” Lammy told reporters. He was in Italy for a G-7 meeting.“Of course, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process and due process would be followed in relation to those issues.”Other European nations have offered a mixed response on whether they would arrest Netanyahu if he stepped foot in their country. Some countries, like Ireland and Belgium, have made it clear they would uphold the arrest warrant. Hungary openly defied the ICC, saying it would welcome Netanyahu.Israel nowhere near finishing war in Gaza, security cabinet member saysReturn to menuJERUSALEM — Israel is nowhere close to ending its war in Gaza, Avi Dichter, a member of the security cabinet, said in a briefing Sunday evening.“We are not at the beginning of the end. We still have a lot of work to do,” Dichter said, adding that Israeli forces will stay in Gaza until they reach a “decisive victory,” which he said could take years. “Gaza will never again be a threat to the state of Israel,” Dichter said.At least 44,211 people have been killed in Gaza since the outbreak of war, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel has in recent weeks renewed military operations in northern Gaza, encircling areas and hitting targets in what it describes as an effort to stop Hamas from regrouping there; humanitarian groups say aid has been cut off and the north is on the verge of humanitarian collapse.Dichter, who also serves as agriculture minister, said he doesn’t know who would lead Gaza in the long term but ruled out the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.On Lebanon, Dichter said Israel was seeking a cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, but with marked differences from U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended its last war against Lebanon in 2006. There was heavy fighting between Israel and Hezbollah this weekend: The Israeli military said the group fired about 250 projectiles into Israel on Sunday, and Lebanese officials said an Israeli strike in Beirut killed at least 29 people on Saturday.Israel also carried out multiple strikes on the southern Lebanese district of Tyre on Monday, killing at least a dozen people, according to Lebanon’s Health Ministry. The Israeli military said that Hezbollah fired 30 projectiles into Israel on Monday.Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, tweeted Monday: “An agreement with Lebanon would be a huge mistake — a missed chance to eliminate Hezbollah. … Now, precisely when Hezbollah is weak and eager for a cease-fire, we must not stop.”The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also expressed skepticism Sunday that a U.S.-led cease-fire deal was imminent. “I do not see the Israeli government interested clearly in reaching an agreement for a cease-fire,” he said in a press briefing after meeting with Lebanese officials.Human Rights Watch: Israel used U.S. device in strike that killed journalists in LebanonReturn to menuHuman Rights Watch announced Monday that an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon last month that killed three journalists was “most likely a deliberate attack on civilians and an apparent war crime.”The New York-headquartered organization said that Israel used “an air-dropped bomb equipped with a United States-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit” in its Oct. 25 strike against a residence where journalists were staying in the southern town of Hasbaya. As The Washington Post previously reported, the strike landed without warning at 3:30 a.m., killing two cameramen and a broadcast engineer who worked for Hezbollah-aligned outlets. The JDAM is a piece of equipment that turns unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions.The Israeli military said at the time that the guesthouse, where 18 journalists were staying, was a “Hezbollah military structure” and that militants were “located inside the structure” when the strike was carried out. It said it received reports after the strike concluded that “journalists had been hit,” and was reviewing the incident.The IDF and U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.The United States is Israel’s largest arms supplier, having provided Israel with billions of dollars’ worth of security assistance and weapons since Israel’s war in Gaza began. The Biden administration has also spearheaded efforts to negotiate cease-fire deals in Gaza and Lebanon, though the attempts so far have failed.“Israel’s use of U.S. arms to unlawfully attack and kill journalists away from any military target is a terrible mark on the United States as well as Israel,” said Richard Weir, senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli military’s previous deadly attacks on journalists without any consequences give little hope for accountability in this or future violations against the media.”According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began over 13 months ago — making it the deadliest period for journalists in more than 30 years since the CPJ started to collect this data.Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon are ongoing. The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it struck “several Hezbollah command centers” in Dahiyeh, a southern suburb of Beirut.The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, visited Lebanon on Sunday and alleged that Israeli forces have “erased 37 entire villages in South Lebanon” while continuing to bomb Lebanon’s capital, Beirut.“This must stop, as do Hezbollah’s attacks on Israeli communities,” he wrote. “Without a cease-fire, neither the Israeli nor the Lebanese [internally displaced persons] will be able to return home.”U.S. condemns killing of Israeli Moldovan rabbi in UAEReturn to menuThe United States condemned the killing of an Israeli Moldovan rabbi, Zvi Kogan, in the United Arab Emirates, saying it was offering “all appropriate forms of support” to Israeli and UAE authorities.“This was a horrific crime against all those who stand for peace, tolerance, and coexistence,” National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said in a statement Sunday. “It was an assault as well on UAE and its rejection of violent extremism across the board.”Kogan, 28, was an emissary of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, a branch of Orthodox Judaism. Chabad said Sunday that he was abducted in Dubai on Thursday afternoon.The UAE’s Interior Ministry, referring to Kogan as a Moldovan citizen, said in a Monday statement that the three men arrested in connection with Kogan’s death were Uzbek nationals.Israeli officials said Kogan was murdered but did not say who they believed was responsible.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday called Kogan’s death a “heinous antisemitic terror attack,” adding, “Israel will use every means to ensure the murderers and their handlers face justice; none will escape accountability.”Middle East conflict The Israel-Gaza war has gone on for over a year, and tensions have spilled into the surrounding Middle East region.The war: On Oct. 7, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel’s creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.Hezbollah: Hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, a militant organization backed by Iran, have escalated over the past year, leading to an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon. Israel’s airstrikes into Lebanon have grown more intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel’s founding.Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century’s most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including President Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations’ cease-fire resolutions.History: The roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex, predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.
