But he has been skeptical about continuing aid to Kyiv.Siversk, eastern Ukraine. The city has been under heavy shelling from Russian-occupied territory.Credit...Tyler Hicks/The New York TimesNov. 6, 2024Updated 10:26 a.m. ETWith Donald J. Trump’s victory in the United States presidential election, Ukrainians now face an all-but-certain American policy shift in the midst of a war that is turning against them. Russia has made some of the swiftest territorial advances in recent months, and diplomatic efforts are underway by multiple countries to find a negotiated settlement.Mr. Trump will enter office with a record of skepticism, if not outright hostility, to continued U.S. aid to Ukraine, and he has promised that he could end the war in one day — without saying how. It is unclear how any initiative by Mr. Trump would dovetail with existing cease-fire discussions, but his pledge to bring the war to a rapid end has stirred concern in Kyiv that he will pressure Ukraine into an agreement on unfavorable terms.“His desire for a deal — and probably a quick one — does not bode well for sustained U.S. support,” the Royal United Services Institute, an analytical group based in London, wrote on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Trump.Russia will most likely respond to Trump’s win by pressing its advantage of numbers on the battlefield in anticipation of reduced Western support, the group said.Ukrainska Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, wrote in a commentary on the American election that the war in Ukraine was less central to U.S. politics than the wars in Vietnam or Korea had been. There, “American boys fought and died,” the site noted.Ukraine has said all year that it is prepared to work with either a Republican or Democratic administration, and in September President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with Mr. Trump while on a visit to the United States.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
