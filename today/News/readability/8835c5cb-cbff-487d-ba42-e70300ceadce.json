Eleven passengers were rescued, four sustaining minor injuries. The sheriff provided no details on the victim or the specifics of the mechanical failure.Emergency responders maintained radio contact with the people trapped below, who had access to water, blankets, and chairs to keep them comfortable. However, they were not informed of the fatality, only that the elevator was malfunctioning, the sheriff said.State engineers, mine safety experts, and firefighters were on site, and while using the elevator to retrieve those trapped inside remained the safest option, firefighters were also preparing for a potential rope rescue operation.\"If we have to, we can bring people up on those ropes, but it also subjects those first responders now to the threat and endangerment of doing so,\" Mikesell said.The family-operated mine, located 110 miles (180 km) south of Denver, has been operational for 50 years and had only one other safety incident in 1986.",
