  "text": "The city of Treasure Island, Florida, looked like a “ghost town” on Tuesday, October 8, after evacuation orders were issued ahead of Hurricane Milton, local authorities said.Aerial footage from the City of Treasure Island shows the streets of the city almost completely empty, with debris from Hurricane Helene still visible.The City described the scene as “heartbreaking” and said that the city now looked like “a ghost town.”“The eerie calm before the storm feels surreal as families flee to safety, leaving behind a city bracing for the unknown,” the city said on Facebook.Treasure Island Fire Rescue told residents to “leave the island immediately” on Tuesday.Milton was forecast to make landfall as a major hurricane late Wednesday or early Thursday, according to weather officials.
