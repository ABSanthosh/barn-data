  "text": "The Pentagon said Friday that it will send “a small number” of U.S. defense contractors to Ukraine, where they will repair advanced American-made weapons, including F-16 fighter jets, Bradley fighting vehicles and air defense systems, donated by Western allies amid Russia’s invasion.The development comes in the closing weeks of the Biden administration while there is deep uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump’s intent to sustain the extensive military and economic assistance Washington has provided the government in Kyiv over nearly three years of conflict. Biden has steadfastly opposed putting Americans in harm’s way to aid Ukraine, while Trump, who spoke with Ukraine’s president after securing reelection Wednesday, has objected to the expense and vowed to bring the war to an end — possibly on terms unfavorable to Kyiv.The U.S.-funded contractors will be far from the front lines and won’t be fighting Russian forces, defense officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Their employers will be responsible for the contractors’ safety and security while in Ukraine, and “risk mitigation plans” will be required as part of companies’ bids for the work, officials said.The expansion of American support was first reported by CNN.Ukraine received its first provision of F-16s in July. Its military has been operating air defense systems donated by the United States and other NATO nations since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. The repairs will also include Bradley vehicles, which the Ukrainians have used in aggressive attacks on Russian forces, and unspecified “complex systems,” a defense official said. It was not immediately clear whether the Pentagon intends to extend this contracted maintenance work to other U.S.-made equipment vital to Ukraine’s fight, including tanks, additional armored vehicles and artillery systems.Ukrainian mechanics are increasingly versed in fixing Western weapons as they take abuse on the battlefield. But for more complex repairs, the U.S. has facilitated equipment transport to depots in Poland, including the replacement of worn artillery barrels and vehicles torn apart by mines and Russian fire.U.S. personnel in Poland also have assisted Ukrainian forces through a practice known as “tele-maintenance,” in which they effectively act as customer service to help them fix problems remotely.Ukrainian soldiers have told The Washington Post in interviews that they prefer waiting weeks for substantial repairs rather than using broken or faulty equipment. The stakes are high for infantry troops counting on that support, an officer in Ukraine’s 72nd Mechanized Brigade recently said, citing an example of battle tanks missing Russian targets because their gun barrels were dilapidated from overuse.U.S. defense officials declined to say where in Ukraine the contractors will be based, citing security sensitivities, but noted that numerous U.S. companies already have personnel in the country to perform work for the Ukrainian government. U.S. contractors also already have signed contracts with the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, including to bolster Ukraine’s energy grid as it is attacked by Russian airstrikes and drones. A significant amount of international help for Ukraine is based in the western part of the country, far from the front line.correctionA previous version of this article erroneously stated that U.S. contractors would help repair Patriot air defense systems, citing a U.S. defense official. The Pentagon later corrected itself and said the support was broadly for air defense systems. The article has been corrected.",
