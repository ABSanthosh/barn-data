The move came a day after the return of an unidentified body in place of Bibas stoked anger in Israel, along with an accusation that Hamas had committed a “violation of utmost severity” of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.Bibas, who was abducted along with her young sons, Ariel and Kfir, in the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, was expected to be one of four bodies handed over by Hamas on Wednesday, alongside those of her children. But early on Friday, Israel said it had found evidence that Hamas had sent the wrong body.Mahmoud Mardawi, a senior Hamas leader, told The Washington Post Friday that a second, correct body had been sent to the International Committee of the Red Cross. He said the transfer of the wrong body was a mistake caused by the chaos of conflict.The Red Cross acknowledged receiving the second body. “Tonight, at the request of the parties, an ICRC team received human remains, which were then transferred to Israeli authorities, the nongovernmental organization said in a statement. The ICRC can not confirm any additional details.”The Israel Defense Forces said it was “following the reports regarding Shiri Bibas,” and Israel’s ministry of health said a forensics team was standing by for a quick response.Hamas said the children and their mother died in an Israeli airstrike. The IDF said Friday that the two children, whose bodies were identified, were “brutally murdered.”“Contrary to Hamas’s lies, Ariel and Kfir were not killed in an airstrike,” an Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said in a statement. “The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys — they killed them with their bare hands,” Hagari said, citing forensic and intelligence findings.The IDF did not release the findings, but Hagari said they had been shared with “partners around the world so they can verify it.” Hamas has not provided evidence for its account of how the family was killed.Despite the rising tension, there was no immediate indication that the release of six Israeli hostages set for Saturday would be in jeopardy.Here’s what else to know:In a video released Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of “cynically” refusing to return the remains of Shiri Bibas and of deliberately sending the body of a Palestinian woman instead. Israeli President Isaac Herzog condemned the failure to return Bibas’s body as “another cruel act by the terrorists of Hamas, who continue to show utter disregard for humanity.”Hamas has agreed to free six living hostages — including two held in Gaza for about a decade — on Saturday, followed by the bodies of four other hostages next week. In return, Israel is expected to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.Saudi Arabia will host a gathering of Arab countries Friday after remarks this month by President Donald Trump that he wants to displace the Palestinian population in Gaza and develop the enclave into a Mediterranean “Riviera.” Leaders from Jordan and Egypt will join those from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates at the gathering, according to Saudi Arabia’s state news agency.correctionA pervious version of this post misstated the year of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. It was Oct. 7, 2023, not Oct. 7, 2022. The post has been corrected.",
