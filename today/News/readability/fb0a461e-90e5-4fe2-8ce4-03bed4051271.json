  "text": "Two people who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washington were shot dead late Wednesday after attending an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown D.C., according to authorities. Police say they believe the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, who witnesses say shouted, “Free, free Palestine!” after the shooting, acted alone.Rodriguez is in custody and has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and murder of foreign officials, a death-penalty-eligible offense. Here’s what to know.The factsIsraeli authorities identified the victims as Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, a young couple who worked at the embassy.They were shot while leaving an event organized by the American Jewish Committee, a pro-Israel advocacy group that “confronts antisemitism.”The suspect has been identified as Elias Rodriguez, said D.C. Police Chief Pamela A. Smith.The shooting will be investigated as a possible hate crime, said Steven J. Jensen, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office. Israeli officials blamed the attack on antisemitism.What happened?Police were alerted to the shooting just after 9 p.m. Wednesday, Smith said during a news conference that night. Both victims were pronounced dead at the scene, she said.The gunman was seen pacing back and forth outside the museum before the attack, she said, before he approached a group of four people and opened fire using a handgun, Smith said. The suspect was detained after he entered the museum, Smith said.Two Israeli Embassy employees were shot and killed near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington on May 21.

Police believe the suspect targeted the event but did not plan to focus on specific individuals before arriving at the scene, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.Who were the victims?According to Israeli government officials, Lischinsky was a research assistant in the embassy’s political department, while Milgrim organized missions and visits to Israel.“Yaron and Sarah were our friends and colleagues. They were in the prime of their lives,” the Israeli Embassy in Washington wrote on X. “No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this devastating loss.”Yechiel Leiter, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, told reporters that Lischinsky had recently purchased a ring and planned to propose to Milgrim.Yaron and Sarah,Words cannot begin to describe the heartbreak and sorrow. Just this morning, we were still laughing together by the coffee corner — and now, all that remains is a picture.Instead of walking you down the aisle, we are walking with you to your graves.What an… pic.twitter.com/MNmsb6Y40R— Tal Naim (@TalNaim_) May 22, 2025 The couple met while working for the Israeli Embassy. They often attended Jewish community events in Washington, according to Chabad Rabbi Levi Shemtov.Lichinsky grew up in Germany and moved to Israel when he was 16 with his brother. He attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he completed a degree in international relations and Asian studies in 2021, according to Nissim Otmazgin, dean of humanities at the university. He later attended a master’s program in diplomacy at Reichman University in Israel.Milgrim, who is from Prairie Village, Kansas, graduated with “highest distinction” in spring 2021 with a bachelor of arts in environmental studies and a minor in anthropology from the University of Kansas, according to a spokesperson for the university. After that, Milgrim moved to Washington to get a master’s degree in international affairs at American University.Who is the suspect?Police said Rodriguez is 31 and from Chicago. He worked for the American Osteopathic Information Association, which does advocacy and provides resources for the osteopathic profession. A LinkedIn profile that appeared to belong to Rodriguez listed his role as an administrative specialist since July.Police had not received intelligence about “any type of terrorist act or hate crime,” Smith told reporters Wednesday night. “We don’t see anything in his background that would have put him on our radar at this time.”Law enforcement officials are reviewing a document posted on social media about an hour after the shootings by an X account appearing to belong to the suspect, according to two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation. Bongino said in a post to X on Thursday that authorities are working to confirm that “certain writings” are linked to Rodriguez — an apparent reference to the document.Officials had not publicly confirmed as of Thursday afternoon that the document was written by Rodriguez.What have officials said?President Donald Trump responded to the killings on Truth Social, saying: “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his “heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were cut short in an instant by a vile antisemitic murderer.” He said he had ordered enhanced security at Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide.In a news conference Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar blamed the shooting on “antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement” since the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. Israel subsequently declared war in Gaza and severely diminished the flow of aid and food into the enclave; more than 53,000 Palestinians have died since the beginning of the conflict, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.Lior Soroka and Emily Davies contributed to this report.correctionAn earlier version of this story incorrectly said Sarah Lynn Milgrim completed a degree in international relations and Asian studies in 2021. Yaron Lischinsky completed that degree.",
