But, despite the urgency, it remains unclear whether anyone will be elected at all.The country’s Parliament is fractured along sectarian lines and lawmakers have failed in 12 previous votes to elect a new president since October 2022, when Michel Aoun stepped down from the office at the end of his six-year term.The vote on Thursday could be no different. Lebanon is facing diplomatic pressure by the United States and other foreign donors who have hinged postwar financial support on the election of a president. But it is not clear that the leading candidate, Joseph Aoun, the U.S.-backed commander of the Lebanese military (and unrelated to the former president), will receive enough votes to be elected.ImageFormer President Michel Aoun delivering a speech to his supporters gathered outside the presidential palace in Baabda, east of Beirut, in Oct. 2022.Credit...Bilal Hussein/Associated PressThank you for your patience while we verify access.
