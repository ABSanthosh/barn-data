Thanks for cutting the National Weather Service,” someone is heard shouting in the video.Another person said, \"Get the hell out of San Diego, a******!\"Vance is no stranger to being mocked while in public. His PR stunt of a trip to Greenland had to be rearranged when the entire country said he wasn’t welcome, he has been endlessly mocked with AI memes on social media, and back in March, pro-Ukraine protestors called him a traitor while he was on a sky vacation in Vermont.Social media users were quick to see the video of Vance being ruthlessly shouted down while hiding in his motorcade and jumped on the chase to mock him.
