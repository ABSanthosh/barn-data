  "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday backed a suggestion by US counterpart Donald Trump that Russia, the United States, and China should all cut their defence budgets in half, saying it was a \"good proposal\" and that Russia was \"ready for a discussion.\"\"I think it's a good idea. The US would cut by 50 percent and we would cut by 50 percent and then China would join if it wanted,\" Putin said in a televised interview.Russia has significantly increased military spending since launching its offensive in Ukraine in 2022, fuelling economic growth but also inflation. Putin said that in 2024, defence and security spending would reach about 8.7% of GDP.While he could not speak for China, Putin indicated that Russia was open to negotiations with Washington on the issue. \"We could come to an agreement with the US (on cutting spending), we're not against it,\" he said. \"We think it's a good proposal and we are ready for a discussion about this.\"European role in Ukraine peace talksPutin also addressed the role of European nations in potential peace negotiations for Ukraine, saying their participation was \"in demand,\" despite past reluctance.\"I see nothing wrong with this,\" Putin said when asked about European involvement in talks. \"Well, probably no one can demand anything here. Especially not from Russia.\" However, he added, \"If they want to come back, they're welcome.\"The Russian leader claimed that European countries had \"themselves rejected contacts with us,\" believing Ukraine could secure a military victory. He added that Russia also valued the perspectives of BRICS nations, including Brazil, India, China, and South Africa.\"We are grateful to all our partners who raise these questions, who aim for peace to be achieved. And that's why I'm saying that not only Europeans but other countries have the right and can take part. And we view this calmly,\" he said.Reactions to US -Russia talksPutin dismissed European concerns over last week's meeting between Russian and US officials in Riyadh, calling their reaction \"emotional.\" He framed the discussions as an effort to \"improve the level of trust\" between Moscow and Washington.\"Both in his recent phone conversation with Trump and at the meeting in Riyadh, problems related to the Ukrainian crisis were touched on,\" Putin said. \"But it was not discussed in essence. We just agreed that we will approach this.\"He described Trump's stance on Ukraine as \"cold reasoning\" and suggested that, if re-elected, the former US president would have \"his hands free\" to pursue his proposals.Putin mocks Zelenskyy, calls him ‘toxic’Putin also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , echoing Trump’s claim that he is unpopular and a \"dictator.\" He suggested that Zelenskyy was losing credibility among Ukraine's military for giving \"ridiculous orders\" and had become \"toxic in society as a whole.\"The Russian leader contrasted Zelenskyy with Ukraine’s former military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny, who was recently appointed Kyiv’s ambassador to London. Calling him a \"possible rival,\" Putin claimed Zaluzhny enjoyed higher approval ratings than the Ukrainian president.Putin’s comments come amid continued tensions over Ukraine and growing uncertainty over the future of US and European military aid to Kyiv.",
