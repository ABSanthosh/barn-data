  "text": "Qatar said Saturday that it had paused mediation efforts for a cease-fire deal in the Gaza Strip, announcing in a statement that it would resume its role helping broker an agreement only when the parties, including Israel and Hamas, “show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.”Qatari officials notified the two sides 10 days ago, according to foreign ministry spokesman Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, after a last-ditch effort to restart negotiations after the death of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in October.Hamas and its allies still hold about 100 Israeli hostages, more than half of whom are thought to be alive. The group wants a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops, while Israel, led by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says it will not agree to a long-term truce and instead prefers a temporary pause during which it would release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages.The statement from Doha came as the Biden administration said it had informed Qatar that Hamas leaders, some of whom live in the capital, were no longer welcome there.Hamas leaders “should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner,” a senior administration official said Friday, accusing the Palestinian militant group of rejecting multiple hostage release proposals. “Their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive diplomacy.Two officials familiar with the matter, and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about the negotiations, said that Qatar had accepted the demand and notified Hamas representatives that they must leave.But in his statement Saturday, Ansari said that the news media reports on the Hamas office in Doha were “inaccurate.”“The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication between the two parties,” Ansari said.U.S. and Qatari officials have long said that kicking Hamas out of Doha would hurt diplomatic efforts toward bringing hostages home and result in Hamas simply relocating to a country with worse relations with Washington, such as Turkey, Lebanon or Syria.One diplomat said Biden officials likely wanted to deprive the Trump administration of being able to claim credit for kicking Hamas out of Qatar, a move supported by pro-Israel political donors in Washington.In explaining the decision, U.S. officials accused Hamas of opposing numerous proposals on cease-fire and hostage deals. Hamas has long supported a cease-fire deal that would include a permanent end to the war. Israel, with backing of the Biden administration, refused to support a deal that explicitly ended the conflict, agreeing only to a temporary cease-fire, then discussions to negotiate an end to the war.Israeli news media, citing anonymous senior officials. reported Friday that Qatar had made it clear to Hamas that it is not welcome in the country.In response, Ghazi Hamad, a member of Hamas’s political bureau from Gaza, said that “this news seems illogical and lacks a solid foundation.”Hazem Balousha contributed to this report.",
