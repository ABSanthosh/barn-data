Hezbollah said it had launched a “swarm of attack drones” over the border into Israel.“We are studying and investigating the incident — how a drone infiltrated without warning and struck the base,” said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. “We must provide better defense.”Over the past week, Israel has intensified its assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon, inflicting heavy bombardments around the capital, in southern Lebanon, and elsewhere. Lebanon’s government said that at least 23 people had been killed over the past 24 hours. But the airstrikes and ground invasion, which began two weeks ago, have so far failed to accomplish their stated goal: preventing cross-border attacks by the militants.On Sunday, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, with Israel’s military saying that Hezbollah had fired around 115 rockets or missiles as of 3 p.m. local time.Concern about further attacks on Israel, which is also at war with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, prompted the United States to announce on Sunday that it was sending an advanced missile defense system to Israel, and 100 troops to operate it. That will put American forces still closer to the war in the Middle East. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
