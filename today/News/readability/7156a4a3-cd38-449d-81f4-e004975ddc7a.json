  "text": "Vice admiral Shoshana Chatfield, has been dismissed by the Trump administration, US officials confirmed on Monday. Though no clear reason was given, news agency Associated Press sources said her removal appears to be linked to her public support for diversity within the military ranks. According to officials, Chatfield received a phone call from admiral Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. She was told the administration wanted to take the position in a “different direction.” Defence secretary Pete Hegseth is believed to have made the decision last week, though it is not clear if president Trump was directly involved. The officials spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter. This is the third removal of a high-ranking female officer under Trump. In February, Hegseth fired admiral Lisa Franchetti, the then-chief of naval operations. Admiral Linda Fagan, commandant of the coast guard, was dismissed a day after Trump returned to office. The firings are part of a broader effort to eliminate what Trump and Hegseth describe as \"woke\" policies in the military. They have been vocal about dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes. Senator Mark Warner called the firing “deeply disturbing,” criticising Trump for undermining US alliances and removing \"decorated\" officers. Who is Shoshana Chatfield?Chatfield is a US navy pilot and bronze star recipient.She is a native of Garden Grove, California.She has served in key roles in Afghanistan, the Pacific, and Europe.She holds degrees from Boston University, Harvard, and the University of San Diego.She is the only woman serving on Nato’s top military committee.Chatfield was reportedly targeted by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which urged her removal, citing her support for a 2015 Women’s Equality Day event and diversity summits in a LinkedIn post.",
