  "text": "A group of Western nations allied with Israel announced sanctions Tuesday against two far-right ministers who they say have incited violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank.Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Norway all said in a statement that they were taking measures against Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir — both ultranationalist settler leaders and key members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s shaky coalition government.Over the past few years, and as tensions have spiked, Smotrich and Ben Gvir “have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights,” the statement said. “Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous,” it added. “We have engaged the Israeli government on this issue extensively, yet violent perpetrators continue to act with encouragement and impunity.”Israeli officials criticized the move, with Foreign Minister Gideon Saar describing the sanctions as “outrageous,” “scandalous” and “unacceptable.”“This is a planned and coordinated pressure campaign,” he said in a statement. “We will hold a cabinet meeting to decide on our response.”In a post on X, Smotrich said he had been at the inauguration of a new Jewish settlement near the West Bank city of Hebron when he heard the news. “I heard that Britain had decided to impose sanctions on me because I am thwarting the establishment of a Palestinian state,” Smotrich wrote. “There couldn’t be a better moment for this. … With God’s help, we are determined to continue building.”Smotrich has overseen an aggressive expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, territory Palestinians had hoped would make up the bulk of any future independent state. The United Nations warned last week that the rate of settler violence is its highest in 20 years, with perpetrators injuring about 44 Palestinians each month.The joint action by some of Israel’s key allies marked a significant departure from its most important backer, the United States. Among those placing sanctions on the ministers are four out of five members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance, which includes Washington.In a statement Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the sanctions and urged allies to reverse them, saying the United States “stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel.”At the same time, even as Britain and others sought to pressure Netanyahu and his ruling coalition, the new U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, drew controversy by allegedly working to help preserve it.Israeli media outlets reported Monday that Huckabee met with ultra-Orthodox political parties threatening to leave Netanyahu’s government, which would trigger fresh elections. The reports prompted Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid to accuse Huckabee of interfering in domestic politics and “trying to help Netanyahu.”In a social media post Tuesday, Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who is well-known for his evangelical Christian faith and vocal support for Israel and West Bank settlers, clarified that he believed “Americans would likely see a collapsed government as an unstable one.”But he denied working to prop up Netanyahu’s government. “There was no attempt to instruct or advise” Israeli political parties, Huckabee wrote. “Israel is a sovereign nation with its own procedures on selecting a government. We respect that. Reports that go beyond that are either misleading or untrue.”Neither the Biden nor Trump administrations imposed any penalties on senior Israeli officials over violence in the West Bank or for Israel’s conduct in Gaza, where it is fighting a punishing war against the militant group Hamas. Last year, President Joe Biden’s White House slapped sanctions on some of the more extremist settlers in the West Bank, as well as an organization that helps set up and develop illegal outposts. President Donald Trump lifted those restrictions soon after taking office this year.It wasn’t immediately clear how the sanctions announced Tuesday would affect the Netanyahu cabinet ministers and their work in government. In Britain, the measures include a freeze on financial assets as well as a travel ban, according to a separate statement from the Foreign Office. But, the statement said, the two men were being penalized in their “personal capacity” rather than as ministers.“Israel must cease expansion of illegal settlements which undermine a future Palestinian state, clamp down on settler violence, and condemn inflammatory and extremist statements from both individuals,” the statement said.In Britain, frustration with Israel’s strategy in Gaza has mounted since Netanyahu imposed a total siege on the enclave in March. He said it was aimed at pressuring Hamas, which attacked Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 250 others.But as hunger experts warned of a potential famine, Netanyahu said in May that he would begin letting a trickle of U.N. aid into Gaza. At the same time, Israel introduced a new aid-distribution system involving U.S. contractors, one that, since it opened two weeks ago, has been marred by chaos and violence.Amid the warnings of mass starvation last month, Britain joined France and Canada in demanding that Israel stop expanding military operations in Gaza and allow emergency aid to flow, threatening “further concrete actions” otherwise. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy appeared before the House of Commons to condemn Israel’s recent conduct as “repellent,” “monstrous” and “morally unjustifiable.”Britain then suspended free-trade negotiations with Israel, and the European Union said it would review its commercial ties, citing an association agreement that includes provisions on human rights.A diplomatic official familiar with the British government’s considerations said Tuesday’s sanctions were meant to be a calibrated fulfillment of the promise to take more actions. Both Ben Gvir and Smotrich, who are considered extreme even by many in Israel, were considered obvious targets for sanctions, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations.But while the sanctions focused on the ministers’ actions in the West Bank, the statement from the five countries’ foreign ministers said they “cannot be seen in isolation from the catastrophe in Gaza.”“We continue to be appalled by the immense suffering of civilians, including the denial of essential aid,” the statement said. “There must be no unlawful transfer of Palestinians from Gaza or within the West Bank, nor any reduction in the territory of the Gaza Strip.”Cheeseman reported from Beirut, Hendrix from London and Shih from Jerusalem.",
