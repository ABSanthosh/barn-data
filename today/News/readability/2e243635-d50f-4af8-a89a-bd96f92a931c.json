  "text": "The first group of White South Africans arrived in the United States on Monday, designated by President Donald Trump as refugees fleeing racial discrimination in their home country. Other arrivals, including of refugees fleeing some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, have ground to a halt under Trump.Since his first term, Trump has expressed support for South Africa’s White farmers and criticized a new law that would permit the seizure and redistribution of land to address racial inequalities rooted in the legacy of apartheid. But South Africa says it has not seized any land under the law and that Trump’s claim that White South Africans face “genocide” has no factual basis.Amid Trump’s moves, U.S.-South Africa relations are deteriorating. The White House has ordered the government to suspend work with the Group of 20 conference that will be hosted by South Africa this year, according to two people familiar with the matter, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, his office says, is set to meet with Trump in Washington next week. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the visit.Here’s what you need to know about situation for White farmers in South Africa.What to knowThe people who arrived as refugees are descendants of European settlersApartheid left lasting racial inequities in land ownershipTrump has long expressed support for South Africa’s White minority",
