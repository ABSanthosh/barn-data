  "text": "Here’s the latest.President Trump on Friday dismissed a European diplomatic effort seeking to keep the war between Israel and Iran from spiraling into a broader conflict, telling reporters, “Iran didn’t want to speak to Europe, they want to speak to us.”He also suggested there was little he could do to get Israel to stop its bombing campaign. “Israel is doing well in terms of war, and I think you would have to say Iran is doing less well,” he said. “It’s a little hard to get someone to stop.”As Israel and Iran pummeled each other with strikes and missile attacks and the conflict continued for the eighth day, representatives of Iran and Europe held three hours of talks in Geneva that ended with no signs of a breakthrough.The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany emerged discussing the need to continue speaking with Iran, hoping the talks will offer an off-ramp for Iran and forestall a decision by Mr. Trump to thrust the United States into the hostilities.A day after backing away from threats that raised the specter of an imminent U.S. strike and creating a two-week window for diplomacy, Mr. Trump said he still wanted to be a “peacemaker.” But he suggested that only direct talks between the United States and Iran would produce a way out of the war. “Europe,” he said, “is not going to be able to help.”The Europeans urged Iran to resume direct nuclear talks with the United States, but Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran would consider re-engaging in diplomacy only “once the aggressor was held accountable for the crimes committed.”The fighting between Iran and Israel, meantime, went on. Iran sent a barrage of missiles into Israel on Friday that struck in several cities, including Haifa. Earlier, Israel announced that it had conducted strikes on missile factories and a research center linked to Iran’s nuclear program.Here is what else to know:Latest attacks: Iran’s state broadcaster reported that Israeli strikes overnight targeted an industrial complex in its northern provinces, along the coast of the Caspian Sea. In Israel, a missile from a volley of some 35 fired from Iran struck an abandoned building in downtown Haifa, causing extensive damage to surrounding buildings, including to a mosque.

If Mr. Trump decides to send American bombers to help Israel destroy a uranium enrichment facility in Iran, it will likely initiate a more dangerous phase in the war. Here are some ways that could play out, and a look at how the U.S. military’s powerful bunker-busting bombs work.Leily Nikounazar and Adam Rasgon contributed reporting.Farnaz Fassihi and Parin BehroozExplosions and air defenses at work could be heard in Tehran, Isfahan, Tabriz and Qom, according to residents of those Iranian cities who communicated with limited internet via text messages. A prominent journalist in Tehran said in a text message that she could hear massive explosions the capital around 4 a.m. local time. A local news outlet for the city of Qom reported on its Telegram page that a residential building had been hit.The roof of a building in Tel Aviv was on fire after the latest round of Iranian missiles was launched at Israel early Saturday morning, according to announcements by Israel’s emergency services. The residents safely evacuated the building, the Magen David Adom emergency service said, and, so far, no injuries had been reported.Shortly after Israel’s Home Front Command said it was safe for Israelis to leave their bomb shelters, the Israeli Army announced it had started a series of strikes against missile storage and launching sites in central Iran.David E. SangerDavid E. Sanger, a White House and national security correspondent, has covered the efforts to halt the Iranian nuclear program for more than two decades. He reported from Washington.News AnalysisAn Iran deal in two weeks? Hard to achieve, even if Trump really wants one.ImagePresident Trump made clear to reporters on Friday that he is interested largely in the coercive part of coercive diplomacy.Credit...Eric Lee for The New York TimesAsk diplomats who have negotiated with Iran, and they usually describe it with some variant of: Brace yourself, it takes a long time.It took the better part of two years to put together the Obama-era agreement that all but halted Iran’s nuclear program. After President Trump scrapped that deal in his first term, it took 15 months for the Biden administration to negotiate a way to piece it back together — at which point Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vetoed the near-final agreement. So what could Mr. Trump, dangling the possibility that last-minute diplomacy could provide an alternative to bombing Iran’s main uranium enrichment facility, hope to accomplish in the two-week window he has given himself to make a decision?Not much, the veterans of such negotiations warn. But then again, the environment is very different this time.Ayatollah Khamenei is the final word in all foreign policy issues — but he is also most likely in hiding, American intelligence officials say.Iran’s foreign minister and lead negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, says he is open to placing limitations on Iran’s nuclear output similar to what he and his colleagues negotiated with the United States a decade ago.But on Friday, he told his European counterparts in Geneva that Iran would never negotiate as long as Israel was dropping missiles on its military bases and nuclear facilities, and carrying out targeted killings of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps officers and nuclear scientists.Mr. Trump, for his part, made clear to reporters on Friday that he is interested largely in the coercive part of coercive diplomacy. Iran, he insisted, had only minutes left on the clock. “I’m giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum,” he said.And he dismissed the idea that the meeting in Europe would do anything but slow things down. “Iran didn’t want to speak to Europe,” he said. “They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help.”Whether Mr. Trump is serious about negotiations or just buying time to better prepare for a military assault and its aftermath remains unclear.But there was no public evidence yet that the contacts between Mr. Araghchi and Steve Witkoff, the president’s Middle East envoy, could lead to a meeting, much less a deal that would satisfy Mr. Trump. Or even that such a deal would be enough to hold back Israel’s determination to wipe out Iran’s nuclear facilities.Mr. Araghchi knows every inch of the Iranian nuclear complex, and was a central player in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump exited three years later. But even today American officials do not know how much sway he holds with the ayatollah.Mr. Witkoff is the mirror opposite: He knew virtually nothing about the Iranian program and has spent the past few months cramming on the details of nuclear enrichment and Iranian negotiating history. But he has a tight relationship with Mr. Trump that goes back to their New York real estate days, and holds considerable sway over what constitutes an acceptable deal.If the two men were able to come to the kind of agreement that has eluded them through two and a half months of negotiations, they would still have to sell it back home.“These are not normal times,” said Richard Haass, who oversaw Iran policy for President George H.W. Bush and was a senior State Department official for President George W. Bush. “The pressure on Iran, since they are losing, is more intense than it has ever been. And the pressure on Trump to use military force if it looks like the Iranians are trying to buy time rather than reach an agreement will be huge.”Success may depend on exactly what Mr. Trump demands: the “unconditional surrender” that he keeps talking about, or a narrower, face-saving halt in remaining nuclear enrichment, with the understanding that while Iran may retain what it views as its “right” to produce nuclear fuel, it will never again exercise that right.“Two weeks may be enough time for an unconditional capitulation. A day suffices for that,” said Robert Malley, who participated in the negotiations that led to the 2015 agreement and then led the failed Biden-era effort to reconstitute some version of that deal.But, Mr. Malley added, “that may be what President Trump wants, but it is almost certainly not what he will get. As the Islamic Republic sees it, it’s tantamount to being offered the choice between committing suicide and taking their chances at being killed. History suggests they will take their chances.”Mr. Malley noted that there might be room for a diplomatic off-ramp, one in which “Iran agrees to ‘voluntarily’ and ‘temporarily’ stop enriching uranium, which is much easier now that its enrichment capacity is a shadow of its former self.” That, he added, could “give space for U.S.-Iranian negotiations and halt the mad dash to a U.S. war.”It is the kind of creative approach that, when missiles were not flying, might be wordsmithed over weeks or months in Vienna, then taken back to Tehran and Washington for formal sign-off. Clearly, no one has time for that process now. As he emerged from the talks in Geneva on Friday, Mr. Araghchi did not sound in the mood for even starting down that road, any more than Mr. Trump sounded very interested in negotiating.The Iranian foreign minister suggested that, in retrospect, perhaps his talks with Mr. Witkoff had been an elaborate American-engineered shadow play, a cover for the Israelis as they prepared for war.“So they had perhaps this plan in their mind, and they just needed negotiations perhaps to cover it up,” Mr. Araghchi told Andrea Mitchell of NBC. “We don’t know how we can trust them anymore. What they did was in fact a betrayal to diplomacy.”Iran, he said, would never entirely stop making nuclear fuel. “Zero enrichment is impossible,” he said. “This is an achievement of our own scientists. It is a question of national pride.”President Trump signaled that he was not inclined to ask Israel to stop its strikes on Iran as part of American negotiations. When asked about it, according to reporters traveling with him to New Jersey, Trump said, “It’s very hard to make that request right now. If somebody is winning, it’s a little bit harder to do than if somebody is losing,​ but we’re ready, willing and able, and we’ve been speaking to Iran, and we’ll see what happens.”ImageCredit...Eric Lee for The New York TimesAccusations fly at a heated U.N. Security Council session on Iran and Israel, amid pleas for peace.ImageDanny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, at the Security Council’s meeting on Friday.Credit...Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesIn a fiery United Nations Security Council meeting on Friday, Israel and Iran, along with their allies, traded scathing accusations over blame for the war between them, and the deeply divided council reached no conclusions on how to proceed.After decades of limited hostilities, directly and through Iran’s proxies, the most intense conflict between them began a week ago. Israel began bombing Iran, saying it needed to eliminate the threat of Tehran developing a nuclear weapon that it could use against Israel, and Iran began firing missiles and drones at Israel in return.The Iranian ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, denounced “the so-called pre-emptive attacks and existential threat claims used by this terrorist regime and its allies to justify aggression,” and described Israel as a nation that “kills innocent people and violates the territorial integrity of the states.” He held up photos of children he said were killed by Israeli strikes.The Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, in turn, accused Iran of “playing the victim,” and demanded of Mr. Iravani, “How dare you ask the international community to protect you from the consequences of your own genocidal agenda?”The meeting — riddled with personal attacks and finger-pointing among the members — came as talks in Geneva between Iran and European countries adjourned without a breakthrough, and Iran’s foreign minister said serious negotiations were not possible until Israel stopped bombing.Security Council members largely agreed on the need to end the fighting and seek diplomacy, but their session devolved into arguing over who was to blame.Dorothy Camille Shea, the interim U.S. representative, denounced Iran as the “principal source of instability and terror in the Middle East” with the capabilities to produce a nuclear weapon, and said the United States continues to support Israel. Other Western nations like Britain and France struck a more cautious tone with a greater emphasis on de-escalation and negotiation.Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador, slammed the United States, Britain, France and Germany for spreading a “groundless fabrication” that Iran had plans to possess nuclear weapons, calling the Western powers “complicit” in the Israeli attacks and “just as dangerous as the deadliest weaponry.”ImageVasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, at the Security Council meeting on Friday.Credit...Brendan McDermid/ReutersThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, declared on June 12 that Iran was in breach of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the first time the agency has passed a resolution against the country in 20 years.The agency reported that Iran had accelerated its enrichment of uranium, an element that can be used to make an atomic bomb, to a high level. It noted that all of the other nations that possess such highly enriched uranium also have nuclear weapons, but stopped short of saying that Iran was building one.Mr. Nebenzya called the I.A.E.A. report “biased” and “baseless,” while Fu Cong, China’s representative, took a milder stance on Friday. He condemned Israel’s attacks and called for an immediate cease-fire, but refrained from criticizing the I.A.E.A. or the United States.U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran is not trying to build a bomb, though it might be able to do so within a year. When asked about that on Friday, President Trump said, “Well, then my intelligence community is wrong.”The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, acknowledged Iran’s longstanding denial about seeking nuclear weapons but pointed to a “trust gap.”“The only way to bridge that gap is through diplomacy, to establish a credible, comprehensive and verifiable solution, including full access to the inspectors of the I.A.E.A.,” he said.Mr. Guterres warned Israel and Iran to give peace a chance before the conflict escalates further. “We are not drifting toward a crisis. We are racing toward it.”At least 224 people have been killed and more than 2,500 injured in Israeli strikes across Iran as of Thursday, according to Iran’s Ministry of Health. At least 29 people have been killed and about 900 injured in Iranian strikes across Israel, Mr. Danon said on Friday. Both countries said the majority of their casualties were civilians.The Israeli government approved a plan to renovate 500 public bomb shelters and install 1,000 new mobile bomb shelters across the country, the defense ministry announced on Friday, as Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the military chief of staff, said Israelis “must be ready for a prolonged campaign.” The mobile shelters will be installed in sensitive areas, according to the statement, and most of the renovations will take place in public shelters in central Israel. The project is estimated to cost upwards of $28 million.ImageCredit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesPresident Trump, speaking to reporters outside Air Force One, insisted he wanted to be a “peacemaker” and that sending ground troops to Iran would be the “last thing you’d want to do.” “I’m giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum,” he said.He also said Europe would not be able to negotiate with Iran: “Iran didn’t want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help.”President Trump says this situation in Iran is different from the one that led to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, when the U.S. used faulty intelligence to support it. “Within a matter of weeks, or certainly within a matter of months, they’re going to be able to have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said. “We can’t let that happen.”When a reporter told him that his intelligence community does not believe Iran is currently building a nuclear weapon, Trump shot back: “Well, then my intelligence community is wrong.”Trump’s rebuke of Tulsi Gabbard signals an uneasy moment.ImageTulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, in the Capitol this week.Credit...Eric Lee for The New York TimesPresident Trump was angry.Earlier this month, Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, had posted a three-and-half-minute video to social media describing her visit to Hiroshima, Japan, and outlining the horrors caused by the detonation of a nuclear weapon there 80 years ago.Speaking directly to the camera, Ms. Gabbard warned that the threat of nuclear war remained. “As we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” she said, “political elites and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tension between nuclear powers.”Mr. Trump berated Ms. Gabbard for the video, according to two people briefed on the conversation. He said that her discussion of nuclear annihilation would scare people and that officials should not talk about it.Mr. Trump’s displeasure with the video laid bare months of his skepticism of Ms. Gabbard and frustrations with her. The president and some administration officials viewed her overseas travel, as the video exemplified, as being as much about self-promotion of her political career as it was about the business of government, multiple officials said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics of the administration.But the tensions surrounding Ms. Gabbard are now in the open, as Mr. Trump considers mounting a military strike on Iran. Ms. Gabbard, a critic of overseas entanglements, has privately raised concerns of a wider war. And on Friday Mr. Trump said “she’s wrong” when he was asked about her testimony in March that Iran had not decided to build a nuclear weapon.After the video was posted, the president also told Ms. Gabbard that he was disappointed in her, and wished she had used better judgment, according to one of the two people briefed on the conversation. He told Ms. Gabbard that he believed she was using her time working for him to set herself up for higher office. Mr. Trump told Ms. Gabbard that if she wanted to run for president, she should not be in the administration, one of the people briefed on the meeting said.ImageMs. Gabbard and her husband, Abraham Williams, at her swearing-in at the White House in February. Credit...Eric Lee/The New York TimesWhile Ms. Gabbard is a former Democrat, her credentials as a critic of America’s long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a skeptic of foreign military interventions appeal to Mr. Trump’s base, and her views dovetail with those of some of his other advisers. Her supporters are openly advocating that the president keep her.“The president needs someone who will give him the right intelligence information, whether he likes it or not,” said Daniel L. Davis, an analyst at the think tank Defense Priorities, which advocates a restrained foreign policy. “If you put someone else in there, they might only tell him what he wants to hear.”Mr. Davis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, was Ms. Gabbard’s choice for a top intelligence role before criticism from Republicans over his skepticism of Israel’s war in Gaza forced her to rescind the appointment.There is no question, officials said, that Ms. Gabbard’s standing has been weakened and that she is embattled. But few in the administration want to see her depart. Some say she has people who like her, while others worry about who might replace her. Two officials said that Mr. Trump’s anger over the video had faded and that they were back on better terms.Ms. Gabbard continues to brief the president regularly and speaks often to John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, who held Ms. Gabbard’s job in the first Trump administration, according to multiple officials.In a statement, the White House press office dismissed any notion she has been sidelined. Steven Cheung, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in his national security team. “D.N.I. Gabbard is an important member of the president’s team and her work continues to serve him and this country well,” Mr. Cheung said.Ms. Gabbard was an aggressive supporter of Mr. Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. He and his top advisers valued her input, especially when Mr. Trump was preparing to debate Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Ms. Gabbard had memorably attacked in a Democratic primary debate in 2019.After the election, Mr. Trump quickly decided to nominate her for director of national intelligence. But from the beginning he made clear to associates that he harbored some doubts. Mr. Trump, according to associates, saw her as overly interested in her own success.Mr. Trump drew a contrast between Ms. Gabbard and the other former Democrat he named to his cabinet, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.“Bobby’s a star,” Mr. Trump told one associate. “Tulsi? Tulsi wants to be a star.” Mr. Trump’s implication was that unlike Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Gabbard did not have what it took to succeed in politics.ImageMs. Gabbard with Mr. Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tucker Carlson during a campaign event in Georgia in October. Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesAnd soon after her swearing-in, he began to complain about her effectiveness.At the same time, Mr. Trump — long mistrustful of the intelligence community — questioned whether there needed to be an Office of the Director of National Intelligence at all.A senior intelligence official said Ms. Gabbard had overseen a 25 percent cut in the size of her office. And Ms. Gabbard has repeatedly told people in the White House that she is willing to be the last director of national intelligence, according to an official. The office, Ms. Gabbard said, could be reabsorbed into the C.I.A., or become something akin to the National Security Council, a bare-bones oversight group.At least for a time, the kind of foreign policy restraint Ms. Gabbard favors appeared to gain traction this spring.In White House discussions about Israel and Iran, Ms. Gabbard raised the range of possible consequences of an Israeli strike against Iran, saying it could trigger a wider conflict that brought in the United States. Vice President JD Vance, at times also a skeptic of military intervention, made similar arguments and was among those who supported Mr. Trump’s impulse to initially try to negotiate a deal with Iran.As the C.I.A. delivered intelligence reports that Israel intended to strike Iran regardless, Mr. Trump and senior aides became more publicly supportive of the Israeli campaign.Ms. Gabbard did not attend a key meeting at Camp David, where Mr. Ratcliffe presented assessments about Iran’s nuclear program. Ms. Gabbard, according to officials, was on Army Reserve duty. Other people with knowledge of the matter have said she was not invited. (Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Ms. Gabbard had met daily with Mr. Trump and his team.)Then on Tuesday, Mr. Trump contradicted Ms. Gabbard in public. After the Israeli strikes began, a journalist on Air Force One asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Gabbard’s testimony in March that Iran had not decided to make a nuclear bomb.“I don’t care what she said,” Mr. Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”He made similar comments on Friday.ImageMr. Trump, aboard Air Force One this week, contradicted Ms. Gabbard’s assessment of Iran’s nuclear program. Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesAn official from Ms. Gabbard’s office said her position was not at odds with Mr. Trump’s. In her testimony, Ms. Gabbard reported the consensus opinion of the intelligence community: that Iran’s supreme leader had not authorized the country to build a nuclear weapon. But Ms. Gabbard had also noted Iran’s large stocks of enriched uranium and a shift in tone that was “likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decision-making apparatus.”But Mr. Trump’s Air Force One remark came off as a rebuke.To a certain extent, some officials said, courting Mr. Trump’s displeasure is a hazard of any intelligence job in his administration.Mr. Trump believes the intelligence community undermined him in his first term, and his long-held skepticism that it is part of a disloyal deep state continues. Ms. Gabbard, when briefing Mr. Trump, presents a range of options and assessments. But it is difficult to talk about the findings of spy agencies and not raise Mr. Trump’s ire, the official said.Ms. Gabbard’s most important job as director of national intelligence is overseeing, and delivering, the president’s daily intelligence brief. But the brief is actually produced a few miles from her office at the C.I.A., and many of those working on the document are detailed from the agency. Ms. Gabbard announced internally last month that she would physically move the production of the brief to her headquarters, known as Liberty Crossing.Within the administration, several senior officials saw it as a way to try to enhance her own relevance at a time when Mr. Trump was questioning the relevance of the office. Others said it was an expensive decision that would be logistically difficult to carry out. Ultimately, the White House put the move on pause, according to multiple people briefed on the matter.Ms. Gabbard has influential defenders inside and outside the government. Mr. Vance, seen as the most senior voice for a less hawkish, more restrained foreign policy, issued a long social media post defending the administration’s support of Israel’s attack on Iran. He added to that a message supporting Ms. Gabbard. He also released a statement calling her a “patriot.”Her supporters insist that she remains relevant and that, over time, her skepticism of American intervention in Ukraine and caution on military action against Iran will once more prevail. The possible delay of any decision by Mr. Trump to strike Iran represents an opportunity for diplomacy and critics of American military intervention to make the case for restraint, some of Ms. Gabbard’s supporters said.Olivia C. Coleman, a spokeswoman for Ms. Gabbard’s office, dismissed the reports of dissatisfaction or tensions with the White House as “lies made up by bored, irrelevant anonymous sources with nothing better to do than sow fake division.”“The director,” Ms. Coleman said, “remains focused on her mission: providing accurate and actionable intelligence to the president, cleaning up the deep state and keeping the American people safe, secure and free.”The Treasury Department said today that it was imposing Iran-related sanctions on eight entities, mostly in Asia, and on an individual, and identifying one vessel as blocked property. The agency said those parties were involved in the procurement and shipment of sensitive machinery for Iran’s defense industry. The agency said the vessel was the Shun Kai Xing, owned by the Hong Kong-based Unico Shipping Co. The department said the ship was carrying machinery for the Iranian company Rayan Roshd Afzar Co. — on which the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2017 — and for a second company controlled by executives of the first one, Towse Sanaye Nim Resanaye Tarashe. Most of the entities listed in the new announcement are based in China or associated with the country. One company is based in Turkey.One of the buildings affected by the shockwave of an Iranian missile strike in Haifa, Israel, on Friday was the Ottoman-era al-Jarina Mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Haifa. Omar Hussein, 24, the mosque’s muezzin and deputy imam, said in an interview that his father was injured and transferred to the hospital after the missile struck nearby. He said that the mosque lacks a proper shelter, raising concerns for the safety of worshipers. “It’s a significant mosque that serves Muslims in the city and nearby towns,” he said, expressing sadness over the damage and the war, adding he hoped it would end soon.VideoCreditCredit...Rawan Sheikh Ahmad for The New York TimesThe Church of Our Lady and the House of Grace, a halfway house associated with the church, were damaged by an explosive blast caused by an Iranian missile slamming into downtown Haifa, Israel, on Friday afternoon, according to Jamal Shehade, the director of the halfway house.Though Shehade described the damages as not being severe, he said colored glass windows in the church were shattered by the blast. The church building, he said in an interview, was erected in 1862, and some of the windows were about 100 years old.The Israeli military said on Friday that it struck Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, a day after the Iran-backed group’s leader, Naim Qassem, said it “will act as we see fit.” In a statement, the Israeli military said that Hezbollah “attempts to reestablish activity in these sites,” near the city of Nabatieh. Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire in November, after their most recent war, but each side has accused the other of violating the truce.Israel and Iran launch fresh attacks amid diplomatic push.ImageEmergency personnel outside a building hit by an Iranian missile in Haifa, Israel, on Friday. Israeli jets hit targets across Iran.Credit...Daniel Berehulak/The New York TimesIsrael and Iran traded intensive fire for the eighth consecutive day on Friday, with Iranian missiles striking Israeli cities and Israeli jets pounding targets across Iran, despite diplomatic efforts to contain the conflict.A missile launched from Iran early Friday morning damaged several buildings in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba, where a strike the day before had hit a major medical center that had been largely evacuated. About nine hours later, a missile from a volley of some 35 struck an abandoned building in downtown Haifa, Israel’s third-largest city, causing extensive damage to surrounding buildings, including a mosque.There were no direct fatalities from the strikes on Friday in Israel, though 23 people were wounded in Haifa, according to Magen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service, and dozens more in strikes across the country. A woman died after she had a heart attack in a shelter in northern Israel while sirens warning of incoming missiles were blaring, the service said.In the Iranian capital, Tehran, large crowds took to the streets for a prayer march in support of the Iranian regime, while a resident interviewed by The Times described thinning traffic and closed shops amid ongoing Israeli strikes. Iranian government websites remained inaccessible from outside the country on Friday and had not been updated, making it impossible to confirm the number of casualties there. The communication blackout was part of a countrywide internet shutdown now in its fourth day.The Israeli military said air force jets had struck military and nuclear sites in Tehran overnight. Iran’s state broadcaster reported early Friday morning that Israeli strikes had targeted an industrial complex in the Sefid-Rud area in the northern provinces along the Caspian Sea coast, and large blasts were also reported in the northern city of Rasht and north of Tehran.Later on Friday, the Israeli military said it had struck missile storage and launch sites in the regions of Tabriz and Kermanshah, as well as surface-to-air missile batteries in southwestern Iran. Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, said on Thursday that he had ordered the military to increase attacks on Iranian government targets to “destabilize the regime.”The exchanges continued even as Iran’s top diplomat was meeting on Friday in Geneva with European foreign ministers for talks aimed at reaching a diplomatic compromise. The talks broke up without any evident breakthrough.The talks followed President Trump’s announcement Thursday that he would delay a decision on whether to join Israel’s attacks, saying he would make up his mind “within the next two weeks.”Farnaz Fassihi, Leily Nikounazar, Patrick Kingsley and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.News AnalysisA potential strike on Iran tests Trump’s propensity to play to both sides.ImageThe war in Iran is exactly the kind of Middle East entanglement that President Trump’s anti-interventionist base believed he was bitterly opposed to, because he said he was.Credit...Kenny Holston/The New York TimesWhen President Trump was pressed this week about his administration’s conflicting messages on mass deportations, he did not offer much clarity.“Everybody’s right,” he said.Since his first campaign for president 10 years ago, Mr. Trump has excelled at appearing to favor both sides of the same issue, allowing supporters to hear what they want to hear, whether he’s talking about tariffs, TikTok, abortion, tax cuts or more.But the prospect that the United States might join Israel in bombing Iran is testing his ability to embrace dueling positions with little to no political cost. Some of Mr. Trump’s most ardent supporters — those who defended him during multiple investigations and ultimately returned him to the White House — are ripping each other to shreds over the idea, and at times lashing out at Mr. Trump himself, as well.The war in Iran is exactly the kind of Middle East entanglement that Mr. Trump’s anti-interventionist base believed he was bitterly opposed to, because he repeatedly said he was. But he is also the same president who, in his first term, authorized missile strikes in Syria after its leadership used chemical weapons on citizens, and the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani — two actions he took pride in.To Mr. Trump, the contradictions are not actually contradictions.“I think I’m the one that decides that,” he told The Atlantic recently in response to criticism from one of his most vocal anti-interventionist supporters, Tucker Carlson, who said the president’s support for Israel’s fight in Iran ran against his “America First” message.Mr. Trump was propelled to victory in the Republican primary in 2016 as an outsider, in part because he forcefully condemned the invasion of Iraq, authorized by the last Republican president more than a decade before, and the seemingly endless war that followed. Yet he said the United States should have taken the country’s oil, and ran radio ads saying he would “bomb the hell” out of the Islamic State.He has said he wants to renew the tax cuts he put into effect in his first term, which saved some of the wealthiest earners millions, while also suggesting that congressional Republicans should implement a new tax on the wealthiest.ImageIranians protesting in Tehran on Friday.

He wants to engage in mass deportation and also wants to sell visas for $5 million. He has celebrated the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade as a point of pride, while also condemning Republican governors who signed bills banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.He has both celebrated and criticized his own criminal justice reform bill of 2018.Despite the contradictions, Republicans for years have been united in support of Mr. Trump and what he says he wants, giving him a benefit of the doubt that few if any career politicians have ever received. Even when most elected Republicans held Mr. Trump at a distance after the deadly attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Trump still had a tight grip on Republican primary voters.Mr. Trump, a celebrity known to the electorate for decades, has obscured longstanding and unresolved foreign policy divisions within the party dating back to the aftermath of President George W. Bush’s push to invade Iraq.But as Mr. Trump decides whether to plunge the United States into the heart of the Israel-Iran conflict, his core supporters are splintering.Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday that he could take up to two weeks to decide did not sit well with some of his most hawkish supporters. On social media, the Fox News host Mark Levin began a lengthy post by suggesting that the president was being pulled back from what he actually wants to do. “LET TRUMP BE TRUMP!” Mr. Levin wrote. “We got our answer. Iran says no unconditional surrender. Again. And again. And again. They cheat and lie and kill. They’re TERRORISTS!”His anti-interventionist supporters, meanwhile, have been equally alarmed by what he might decide to do. “Anyone slobbering for the U.S. to become fully involved in the Israel/Iran war is not America First/MAGA,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia posted on social media over the weekend.Mr. Trump’s advisers say that, on the Israel-Iran conflict in particular, the president is dealing with a fast-moving, complicated situation that does not lend itself to simple, black-and-white solutions, despite the fact that he has consistently campaigned that way.“President Trump considers the nuances of every issue, but ultimately takes decisive action to directly benefit American families,” said Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman. “The American people trust this president to make the right decisions,” she said, adding that he “started the Make America Great Again movement because he represents a new leadership that puts Americans first.”Mr. Trump’s inconsistencies were clear in 2011, the year he gave his debut speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference.ImageMr. Trump with Tucker Carlson in October.

Mr. Trump, able to command seemingly endless media attention, absorbed Mr. Paul’s support base and was able to reshape the Republican Party in the process.But in 2025, Mr. Trump is not the only one who can command media attention.Mr. Carlson is no longer on Fox News, but he has a show that streams on the website X, and is a leading voice among foreign policy “restrainers” who have argued that Mr. Trump would be acting against his own movement should he strike Iran.Stephen K. Bannon, an adviser who was exiled from the White House in the first year of Mr. Trump’s first term, has become one of the dominant voices among the MAGA faithful with his “War Room” podcast, delivering the same message as Mr. Carlson.Yet Mr. Trump has found that many of his allies will ultimately come back to him, despite unhappiness with some of his decisions.Mr. Bannon’s split with Mr. Trump healed in 2020. And Mr. Trump has frustrated Mr. Carlson before, particularly after the Suleimani assassination in January 2020.At the time, Mr. Carlson condemned the killing. But by the time Mr. Trump was again the nominee in 2024, Mr. Carlson was one of his vocal supporters.Talks between Iran and European countries broke up in Geneva, with no signs of a breakthrough. “We are keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran, and we urge Iran to continue their talks with the United States,” said Britain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy. “This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don’t see regional escalation of this conflict.”A close confidant of Iran’s supreme leader who was reported killed last week in an Israeli airstrike actually survived the attack but was seriously wounded, several state news agencies have reported. Senior Iranian officials and news outlets had reported that the adviser, Ali Shamkhani, who oversaw nuclear talks with the United States, was among several military and civilian leaders killed last Friday.Ashley AhnBreaking news reporter“How dare you ask the international community to protect you from the consequences of your own genocidal agenda,” Israel’s ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said to Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, in a tense Security Council meeting. Danon slammed Iravani, who criticized Israel’s attack just minutes before, for “playing the victim.”ImageCredit...Brendan Mcdermid/ReutersIsrael’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, suggested he did not believe a diplomatic breakthrough to curb Iran’s nuclear program would be achieved over the next two weeks, the period of time President Trump said he had allocated to give diplomacy a chance.“I don’t trust their intentions,” Saar told reporters in Haifa, near where an Iranian missile hit earlier on Friday. “I don’t trust their honesty.”Ashley AhnBreaking news reporterDorothy Camille Shea, the interim U.S. representative at the U.N., condemned Iran as the “principal source of instability and terror in the Middle East” with the capabilities to produce a nuclear weapon. Her statement was in stark contrast to the messages delivered just minutes before by the representatives of Algeria and Russia, who fully backed Iran.Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, said Israelis needed to prepare for a “prolonged battle” with Iran.“The battle has not ended,” he said in recorded remarks. “Indeed, we have achievements, but it is expected that challenging days still lie before us.”In Tehran, where Israeli bombing has put people on edge, the city’s notorious traffic has thinned and few shops are open, said Omid, a sales manager who asked to be identified only by his first name for security reasons. He was able to speak in an online chat despite a near-total internet blackout, and said a bakery near him had run out of flour and closed.In homes and cafes, which are still open, discussion of Iran’s future dominates, and many people hope the war will “break the political and social stagnation, sparking movement in Iran’s stagnant politics, society and economy,” Omid said. People in the city yearn to end to the hardships Iran has endured, to connect with the world, and to enjoy greater political and social liberty.Huge crowds rally across the Middle East, venting anger at Israel.Large crowds took to the streets of Tehran on Friday to protest Israel’s attacks on Iran.Tens of thousands of demonstrators poured into the streets across Iran, Iraq and Lebanon on Friday after midday prayers, in a sweeping display of fury toward Israel amid a rapidly widening regional conflict.In Tehran, the Iranian capital, crowds surged from mosques into central squares, trampling and burning Israeli and American flags while holding aloft portraits of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Chants of “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” rang out from the sea of demonstrators as they marched in what Iranian state media called protests of “rage and victory.” Similar demonstrations in support of the country’s military were also reported in at least half a dozen other Iranian cities, including Tabriz and Mashhad.VideoLarge crowds rallied in Iran, Lebanon and Iraq to protest against Israel’s attacks.CreditCredit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesThe protests unfolded as Israel and Iran continued to trade fire despite a renewed diplomatic push in Geneva, where European leaders met with Iran’s foreign minister to present a proposal aimed at de-escalating the conflict. Earlier on Friday, Israel said it had carried out overnight strikes on missile factories and a research center linked to Iran’s nuclear program. Hours later, Iran launched a fresh barrage of missiles toward Israeli cities.In Iraq, thousands gathered on Friday in Baghdad’s Sadr City district — a stronghold of the powerful Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has at times resisted Iranian influence — to denounce Israel and express solidarity with Iran. Under the blistering sun, many protesters wore white burial shrouds, a Shiite symbol of martyrdom, and some burned Israeli and American flags.In Basra and Najaf, two other Shiite-majority cities in Iraq, crowds echoed similarly defiant sentiments.In the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, where the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah holds sway, supporters also staged rallies, marching amid the rubble of neighborhoods heavily damaged during Hezbollah’s recent war with Israel.People in the crowds pumped their fists as they pledged support for Mr. Khamenei, an ally of Hezbollah’s former leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year.Still reeling from its recent war with Israel, Hezbollah — Iran’s most powerful regional ally — has for now indicated privately that it does not intend to intervene in Iran’s conflict with Israel, according to senior Lebanese officials and Western diplomats.Leily Nikounazar contributed reporting.Iran’s internet blackout has now lasted more than two days, according to NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group. The shutdown has cut off almost all communication with the outside world. It is the most severe internet blackout recorded since nationwide protests swept Iran in 2019, said the monitoring group.Ashley AhnBreaking news reporterVasily Nebenzya, Russia’s U.N. ambassador, accused the United States, Britain, France and Germany of spreading the “groundless fabrication” that Iran planned to build nuclear weapons. In the Security Council meeting, he said those nations and the I.A.E.A., the U.N. nuclear watchdog that declared Iran had breached the nonproliferation treaty, were “complicit” in the Israeli attacks.Ashley AhnBreaking news reporter“We are not drifting toward a crisis, we are racing toward it,” the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, told the Security Council in New York. He called on Israel and Iran to settle their differences peacefully.Johnatan ReissReporting from Nahariya, IsraelA mosque in downtown Haifa was damaged in the latest missile barrage from Iran, the Israeli Interior Ministry said in a statement.

The longer Israel waits for President Trump’s decision on an American attack on Iran, the greater the strain on Israel’s defenses.Credit...Leo Correa/Associated PressPresident Trump’s deferral of a decision on whether to launch an American attack on Iran has left Israel in a strategic bind.Israel’s main remaining war goal is to wipe out a nuclear enrichment site at Fordo in northern Iran, which is buried so deep underground that Israeli bombs will struggle to damage it.For days, Israeli officials hoped that Mr. Trump would send American warplanes armed with the only munitions in the world that are deemed powerful enough to destroy Fordo.Now, Mr. Trump says he will wait up to two weeks before deciding whether to make such an intervention — a delay that imposes a dilemma on Israel.The longer Israel waits for Mr. Trump, the greater the strain on its air defense system. To keep out Iran’s ballistic missile barrages, Israel is burning through its stocks of missile interceptors, forcing it to prioritize the protection of some areas over others. As time goes on, that raises the risk of more missiles hitting both civilian neighborhoods and strategic security sites.With Israel’s airspace closed and much of its economic life suspended, the war’s protraction will also come at an economic cost. The sooner the war ends, the faster commercial flights will return and businesses can resume full operations.Rather than wait for American help, Israel could decide to attack Fordo alone — taking a chance with the planes and munitions it has at its disposal. Some analysts say that Israel could even send commandos to enter and sabotage the site. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at going it alone on Thursday, saying in a television interview that Israel would “achieve all of our objectives, all of their nuclear facilities. We have the power to do so.”But experts say that this route is fraught with risk and that its effect may be limited. “It probably won’t be on the scale of what the U.S. can achieve,” said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. “If we could do what the U.S. can, we would have already done it.”Another option is for Israel to wind down the war unilaterally, without attacking Fordo. But that approach would leave at least a significant part of Iran’s nuclear enrichment program intact, leaving open the possibility that Iran might create a nuclear bomb that could be used against Israel.For now, Israel does not seem set to take that route. Israel’s political leadership has begun to speak explicitly about prompting the collapse of the Iranian regime and assassinating its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Even if Israel has no real way of toppling his government, the tone of the comments suggest that Israel, at the very least, intends to continue with its strikes for several days.The tone of the Israeli news media on Friday also indicated continued domestic support for the Israeli campaign, as did new opinion polling. After Israel’s attack on Iran, Mr. Netanyahu’s party is in its strongest polling position since October 2023, when Hamas carried out the deadliest attack in Israel’s history.Lia Lapidot contributed reporting from Tel Aviv.What happens if Trump decides to strike Iran or assassinate its leader?ImageMarching in Tehran on Saturday after Israel’s attacks.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIf President Trump decides to send American bombers to help Israel destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility in Iran, it will likely kick off a more dangerous phase in the war.And if the United States assassinates Iran’s supreme leader, as Mr. Trump hinted was possible, there are no guarantees he will be replaced by a friendlier leader.Iran’s autocratic clerical leadership, which has ruled for nearly half a century since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, has proved its staying power, even in the face of multiple domestic uprisings. Demolishing Fordo, the enrichment site buried deep in a mountain, may not obliterate Iran’s nuclear program and could lead the country to broaden the war or accelerate that program.Here are some ways it could play out if the United States enters the war.Iran could negotiateBefore Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran’s nuclear program and other targets last week, Iran and the United States were discussing limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment program. It was rapidly producing fuel close to the levels needed for nuclear weapons, and in exchange for new limits on the program, Iran would win relief from economic sanctions.The two sides were nowhere near a final agreement, but signs of a possible compromise had emerged by early June. When Israel attacked Iran, the negotiations collapsed.Yet Iran has signaled that it remains willing to talk, and even a strike on Fordo would not necessarily wipe out prospects of a return to the negotiating table.ImageCars lined up in Tehran at a gas station on Sunday as smoke billowed from an oil refinery that was struck during an Israeli attack.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIf the Trump administration follows an attack on Iran with an enticing offer, such as large-scale sanctions relief or peace guarantees, there is still a chance that Iran would consider making concessions, said Vali Nasr, an Iran expert and a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.“Is there an offer on the table that the Iranian people in this moment can actually rally around?” he said. “If it’s only a stick, then they’re going to fight.”So far, Mr. Trump has not extended many carrots.He called in a social media post on Tuesday for Iran’s “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.”Iran may lean into nuclear activityAll eyes are on Fordo. But it is possible that Iran has secret nuclear sites aimed at producing weapons that the United States and Israel do not know about, though no public evidence has emerged of such places.If they do exist, Iran could use whatever it has left to try to accelerate its nuclear program in the wake of an American attack.With the damage Israeli airstrikes have done to nuclear facilities and the killings of top nuclear scientists, Iran probably lacks the capacity to build a nuclear weapon quickly, analysts said. Still, it could move in that direction and would have fresh incentive to do so.“You would begin to see that broader escalation that they’ve held back on,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Program at Chatham House. After all, Iran would have few other options left for deterring future attacks, she added.ImageA satellite image of the Natanz nuclear enrichment site in central Iran on Sunday after multiple buildings were destroyed by Israeli airstrikes.Credit...Maxar Technologies, via ReutersIran’s Parliament has publicly discussed a withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The treaty, of which Israel is not a signatory, currently requires Iran to submit to oversight by the International Atomic Energy Agency and other transparency obligations and to commit to not building a nuclear bomb.So far, the government has reiterated its longstanding insistence that Iran’s nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. But Iran has firmly refused to capitulate to a central American demand that it give up uranium enrichment, saying it has the right to a civilian nuclear program.The war could get bigger and messierOver the past week, Iran has avoided striking American troops or other targets that could pull the United States into the war.Its leaders may still be hoping to make a deal with the Trump administration to end the conflict and wary of taking on the U.S. military on top of Israel’s.Though Iran has responded to Israeli attacks with missiles and threats of its own, it has refrained from hitting American troops or bases in the Middle East. It has also not struck Arab countries allied with the United States, such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.Nor has it sent global oil prices soaring by sealing off or harassing traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping channel to Iran’s south. But at least one Iranian official has warned that Iran could do so if the United States enters the war.And Iran’s allied militias in the region, including the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and armed groups in Iraq, have not joined the fight. Many of them have been seriously weakened over the past two years.But those Iranian allies could still join the fray if the Trump administration decides to strike.If the United States tries to force Iran to capitulate, “Iran will keep hitting until the end of the missile capabilities,” said Ellie Geranmayeh, an Iran expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations.Talk of regime changeMr. Trump said on social media this week that the United States is weighing whether to kill Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but had decided “not for now.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said in a Fox News interview this week that changing Iran’s regime “could certainly be the result” of this war.Even if the United States assassinates Mr. Khamenei, however, the religious-military establishment that has tightly held power in Iran for nearly five decades may not fall.ImageIran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in Tehran last year.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesWith a war raging, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the most powerful branch of Iran’s military, could seize control of the country, said Mr. Nasr, the professor.They might put in place a more Western-friendly government, or, more likely, replace Mr. Khamenei with a more extreme figure who would dig in for a long fight, Mr. Nasr added.If the military does not assert itself quickly, some analysts fear that Iran could plunge into chaos or civil war as different factions struggle for control.But they see little chance for Iran’s liberal opposition, which has been weakened and brutally repressed by the regime, to prevail.Iran’s people could rise up againMr. Netanyahu encouraged the Iranian people last week to capitalize on Israel’s attacks on their government and “rise up” against their “evil and oppressive regime.”Iranians have staged mass protests against clerical rule several times in recent history, most recently with the “Women, Life, Freedom” demonstrations of late 2022. Each time, the opposition has faced a harsh crackdown by government security forces.ImageProtests in western Iran in 2022 over the death of a 22-year-old woman who had been arrested on accusations of violating the country’s hijab rule.Credit...Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSome Iranians so despise the clerical leaders that they have at times looked to Israel as an ally and openly hoped for the United States to install new leadership.Some Iranian opponents of the regime cheered Israel’s initial attacks on Iran, which they saw as more evidence of their government’s incompetence and mismanagement. But the growing death toll, the attacks on civilian infrastructure and the panic gripping Iranian cities are hardening many in the country against Israel.Iranian social media platforms have been full of patriotic posts in recent days, expressing unity against foreign intervention, if not exactly support for the regime.Leily Nikounazar and Parin Behrooz contributed reporting.In talks in Geneva, Europe attempts to find an off-ramp for Iran.ImageAbbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, speaking at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva on Friday.Credit...Martial Trezzini/Keystone, via Associated PressAs missiles flew between Israel and Iran, diplomats from Europe convened on Friday across a table from Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Switzerland to try to find an off-ramp for a rapidly accelerating regional conflict.But there were no signs of a breakthrough in the three hours of talks, with a defiant Mr. Araghchi saying afterward that Iran would consider a resumption of diplomacy only “once the aggressor was held accountable for the crimes committed.” He did say Iran was willing to speak to the Europeans again.The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany were left to talk in generalities about the need for continued dialogue, which they hope will forestall a decision by President Trump to thrust the United States into the hostilities.“We are keen to continue ongoing discussions and negotiations with Iran, and we urge Iran to continue their talks with the United States,” Britain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, said to reporters. “This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don’t see regional escalation of this conflict.”France’s foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, was similarly vague, declaring it was important to pursue a dialogue with Iran because “we believe there is no definitive military solution to the Iranian nuclear problem.”Mr. Trump said, in effect, that the European officials were wasting their time. “Iran didn’t want to speak to Europe,” he said on Friday afternoon. “They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help.”With Mr. Trump having set a new deadline of two weeks before he decides whether to join Israel’s aerial campaign against military and nuclear sites in Iran, the diplomats delivered an urgent message to Mr. Araghchi that his government must make significant concessions in its nuclear program.Mr. Trump said on Friday that sending ground troops to Iran would be the “last thing you’d want to do.” He added, “I’m giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum.”Expectations for the meeting were modest, given the wide gaps between Iran and the United States in their now-suspended negotiations. Yet Mr. Trump’s reprieve, after a week in which he seemed to be marching inexorably toward war, buoyed hopes somewhat, suggesting that there was still time to act.The diplomacy, however, came against a fiery backdrop of strikes by both sides. A barrage of Iranian missiles struck several sites in Israel on Friday, severely injuring two people in the northern city of Haifa. Earlier, Israel announced overnight strikes on missile factories and a research center linked to Iran’s nuclear program.Speaking to Iranian state media before the session, Mr. Araghchi said Iran viewed the United States as a “partner in this crime.” Mr. Trump, he noted, used the word “we” in social media posts about the Israeli military operation.Among the issues on the table in Geneva, European diplomats said, was giving inspectors unfettered access to Iran’s nuclear facilities and cutting its stockpile of ballistic missiles, which it has fired against Israel in retaliation for Israeli strikes on military bases and nuclear installations.Mr. Araghchi said he had made clear that those missiles were critical to Iran’s defense and “are not negotiable.”The missile strikes on Thursday and Friday had a familiar pattern of military targets, but also inflicted widening damage on civilian areas in both countries. Israel struck the headquarters of an advanced research institute connected to Iran’s nuclear program. An Iranian missile hit a residential street in a city in southern Israel, leaving a large crater.ImageA rally in Tehran on Friday to condemn Israel’s attacks on Iran. Mr. Araghchi said that Iran viewed the United States as a partner in the attacks.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York TimesIsrael’s defense minister, Israel Katz, said he had ordered the military to increase its attacks on Iranian government targets to “destabilize the regime,” deter it from firing at Israel and displace the population of Tehran.How much destruction Israel has inflicted on Iran’s nuclear program was still not clear. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, told the United Nations Security Council that the uranium enrichment site at Natanz had been seriously damaged but that there were no signs of damage to Fordo, a prime Israeli target that is built deep inside a mountain.There was no sign of easing on the part of Israel, which did not take part in the meeting. Asked whether it would pause the attacks to give space for negotiations, Daniel Meron, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told reporters, “We haven’t yet fulfilled our goals, so we are continuing.”Israel, he said, expected Europe to stand firm in demanding a complete rollback of Iran’s nuclear program and the dismantling of its arsenal of ballistic missiles.Mr. Lammy arrived in Geneva after meeting on Thursday at the White House with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to gauge American intentions and plead for diplomacy.“We discussed how Iran must make a deal to avoid a deepening conflict,” Mr. Lammy said. “A window now exists within the next two weeks to achieve a diplomatic solution.”British diplomats left that meeting cautiously optimistic that Mr. Trump would prefer a diplomatic solution to further military escalation, provided any deal with Tehran was genuine, according to a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.President Emmanuel Macron of France said on Friday that the diplomats were planning to extend a “comprehensive diplomatic and technical negotiation offer” to Iran and that the Iranian government needed to “show its willingness to join the negotiating platform we will be putting on the table.”“No one can seriously believe that this threat can be addressed with the current operations alone,” Mr. Macron said during a visit to the Paris Air Show. He noted that some of Iran’s enrichment facilities were “extremely protected” and that it was not entirely clear where Iran stockpiled its enriched uranium.ImageEuropean foreign ministers in Geneva on Friday. Expectations for the meeting with Iran were restrained, given the wide gaps between Tehran and Washington.Credit...Fabrice Coffrini/Keystone, via Associated PressBritain, France and Germany reconstituted a diplomatic group, known as the E3, which conducted on-again, off-again talks with Iran in the early 2000s and played an important role in negotiations that resulted in Iran signing a nuclear agreement with the West in 2015. The foreign ministers were joined by the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs, Kaja Kallas.In Mr. Araghchi, the Europeans confronted a seasoned negotiator who hammered out the framework of that deal in secret talks with emissaries from the Obama administration in 2013. Mr. Trump withdrew from the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018.The images of Iranian and European diplomats gathering at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva were reminiscent of earlier high-stakes negotiations. In November 2013, marathon talks at the same hotel ended in frustration after France objected that the West was not doing enough to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment.This time around, the Europeans have played mostly a bystander role in a drama that pits Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mr. Trump against Iran’s leaders, led by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The mixed results of Friday’s meeting are a reminder to them of the challenges of diplomacy with Iran.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva, Aurelien Breeden from Paris and Luke Broadwater from Washington.",

After President Trump scrapped that deal in his first term, it took 15 months for the Biden administration to negotiate a way to piece it back together — at which point Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vetoed the near-final agreement. So what could Mr. Trump, dangling the possibility that last-minute diplomacy could provide an alternative to bombing Iran’s main uranium enrichment facility, hope to accomplish in the two-week window he has given himself to make a decision?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot much, the veterans of such negotiations warn. But then again, the environment is very different this time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAyatollah Khamenei is the final word in all foreign policy issues — but he is also most likely in hiding, American intelligence officials say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIran’s foreign minister and lead negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, says he is open to placing limitations on Iran’s nuclear output similar to what he and his colleagues negotiated with the United States a decade ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut on Friday, he told his European counterparts in Geneva that Iran would never negotiate as long as Israel was dropping missiles on its military bases and nuclear facilities, and carrying out targeted killings of Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps officers and nuclear scientists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Trump, for his part, made clear to reporters on Friday that he is interested largely in the coercive part of coercive diplomacy. Iran, he insisted, had only minutes left on the clock. “I’m giving them a period of time, and I would say two weeks would be the maximum,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd he dismissed the idea that the meeting in Europe would do anything but slow things down. “Iran didn’t want to speak to Europe,” he said. “They want to speak to us. Europe is not going to be able to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether Mr. Trump is serious about negotiations or just buying time to better prepare for a military assault and its aftermath remains unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there was no public evidence yet that the contacts between Mr. Araghchi and Steve Witkoff, the president’s Middle East envoy, could lead to a meeting, much less a deal that would satisfy Mr. Trump. Or even that such a deal would be enough to hold back Israel’s determination to wipe out Iran’s nuclear facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Araghchi knows every inch of the Iranian nuclear complex, and was a central player in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump exited three years later. But even today American officials do not know how much sway he holds with the ayatollah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Witkoff is the mirror opposite: He knew virtually nothing about the Iranian program and has spent the past few months cramming on the details of nuclear enrichment and Iranian negotiating history. But he has a tight relationship with Mr. Trump that goes back to their New York real estate days, and holds considerable sway over what constitutes an acceptable deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the two men were able to come to the kind of agreement that has eluded them through two and a half months of negotiations, they would still have to sell it back home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“These are not normal times,” said Richard Haass, who oversaw Iran policy for President George H.W. Bush and was a senior State Department official for President George W. Bush. “The pressure on Iran, since they are losing, is more intense than it has ever been. And the pressure on Trump to use military force if it looks like the Iranians are trying to buy time rather than reach an agreement will be huge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuccess may depend on exactly what Mr. Trump demands: the “unconditional surrender” that he keeps talking about, or a narrower, face-saving halt in remaining nuclear enrichment, with the understanding that while Iran may retain what it views as its “right” to produce nuclear fuel, it will never again exercise that right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Two weeks may be enough time for an unconditional capitulation. A day suffices for that,” said Robert Malley, who participated in the negotiations that led to the 2015 agreement and then led the failed Biden-era effort to reconstitute some version of that deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, Mr. Malley added, “that may be what President Trump wants, but it is almost certainly not what he will get. As the Islamic Republic sees it, it’s tantamount to being offered the choice between committing suicide and taking their chances at being killed. History suggests they will take their chances.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMr. Malley noted that there might be room for a diplomatic off-ramp, one in which “Iran agrees to ‘voluntarily’ and ‘temporarily’ stop enriching uranium, which is much easier now that its enrichment capacity is a shadow of its former self.” That, he added, could “give space for U.S.-Iranian negotiations and halt the mad dash to a U.S. war.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is the kind of creative approach that, when missiles were not flying, might be wordsmithed over weeks or months in Vienna, then taken back to Tehran and Washington for formal sign-off. Clearly, no one has time for that process now. As he emerged from the talks in Geneva on Friday, Mr. Araghchi did not sound in the mood for even starting down that road, any more than Mr. Trump sounded very interested in negotiating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Iranian foreign minister suggested that, in retrospect, perhaps his talks with Mr. Witkoff had been an elaborate American-engineered shadow play, a cover for the Israelis as they prepared for war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“So they had perhaps this plan in their mind, and they just needed negotiations perhaps to cover it up,” Mr. Araghchi told Andrea Mitchell of NBC. “We don’t know how we can trust them anymore. What they did was in fact a betrayal to diplomacy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIran, he said, would never entirely stop making nuclear fuel. “Zero enrichment is impossible,” he said. “This is an achievement of our own scientists. It is a question of national pride.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"60fba79c-e284-5348-aa71-1c2c56e7e3e7\" data-testid=\"reporter-update\" data-url=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/20/world/israel-iran-trump#60fba79c-e284-5348-aa71-1c2c56e7e3e7\" role=\"article\" aria-posinset=\"51\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" aria-live=\"off\" aria-labelledby=\"post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvNjBmYmE3OWMtZTI4NC01MzQ4LWFhNzEtMWMyYzU2ZTdlM2U3\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"live-blog-byline\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/erica-l-green\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Erica L.

To keep out Iran’s ballistic missile barrages, Israel is burning through its stocks of missile interceptors, forcing it to prioritize the protection of some areas over others. As time goes on, that raises the risk of more missiles hitting both civilian neighborhoods and strategic security sites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Israel’s airspace closed and much of its economic life suspended, the war’s protraction will also come at an economic cost. The sooner the war ends, the faster commercial flights will return and businesses can resume full operations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than wait for American help, Israel could decide to attack Fordo alone — taking a chance with the planes and munitions it has at its disposal. Some analysts say that Israel could even send commandos to enter and sabotage the site. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at going it alone on Thursday, saying in a television interview that Israel would “achieve all of our objectives, all of their nuclear facilities. We have the power to do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut experts say that this route is fraught with risk and that its effect may be limited. “It probably won’t be on the scale of what the U.S. can achieve,” said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. “If we could do what the U.S. can, we would have already done it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother option is for Israel to wind down the war unilaterally, without attacking Fordo. But that approach would leave at least a significant part of Iran’s nuclear enrichment program intact, leaving open the possibility that Iran might create a nuclear bomb that could be used against Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, Israel does not seem set to take that route. Israel’s political leadership has begun to speak explicitly about prompting the collapse of the Iranian regime and assassinating its leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
