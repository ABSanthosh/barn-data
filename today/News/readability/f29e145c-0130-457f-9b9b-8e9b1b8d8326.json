  "text": "Cairo: Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 120 Palestinians over the last 48 hours and hit a hospital on the northern edge of the enclave, wounding medical staff and damaging equipment, Palestinian medics said on Saturday.Among the dead were seven members of one family whose house was hit overnight in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City, the health officials said. The rest were killed in separate Israeli strikes in central and southern Gaza.At the same time, Israeli forces deepened their incursion and bombardment of the northern edge of the enclave, their main offensive since early last month.A spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas said a female Israeli hostage in the group's custody had been killed in a northern area under attack by Israeli forces.\"The life of another female prisoner who used to be with her remains in imminent danger,\" spokesperson Abu Ubaida added, accusing the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being to blame.An Israeli military spokesperson said it was investigating the Hamas report.\"At this point, we are unable to confirm or deny it,\" the spokesperson said. \"Hamas continues to engage in psychological terrorism and act in a cruel manner.\"A group representing hostages' families did not immediately reply to a request for comment.DAMAGE, INJURIES AT HOSPITALIsrael's military says its operations in northern Gaza aim to prevent Hamas fighters from carrying out attacks and regrouping. Local residents say they fear the goal is to permanently depopulate a strip of territory as a buffer zone, something Israel denies.At Kamal Adwan Hospital, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of Gaza that is barely operational, director Hussam Abu Safiya said the ongoing Israeli bombardment in the area appeared aimed at forcing hospital staff to evacuate - something they have refused to do since the incursion began.\"Yesterday (Friday), from the afternoon until midnight, the bombardment directly targeted the entrance to the emergency and reception area several times,\" he said in a statement, adding that 12 staff members including doctors and nurses were injured.The strike also caused significant damage that disrupted the electrical generator, oxygen supply network and water supply, he added.Asked to comment on Abu Safiya's statement, the Israeli military said that following an initial review it was \"not aware of a strike in the area of the Kamal Adwan Hospital\", adding that it does everything possible to avoid harming civilians.Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and civilians as human shields, and has made public videos and photos to support that claim. Hamas rejects the allegations and says it does not use the civilian population or facilities for military purposes.Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, according to Gaza officials.The war was launched in response to an attack by Hamas-led fighters who killed 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has said.Months of attempts to negotiate a ceasefire have yielded scant progress and negotiations are now on hold, with mediator Qatar having suspended its efforts until the sides are prepared to make concessions.Hamas wants a deal that ends the conflict, and leads to the release of Israeli and foreign hostages held captive in Gaza as well as Palestinians jailed by Israel, while Netanyahu has said the war can end only once Hamas is eradicated.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)
