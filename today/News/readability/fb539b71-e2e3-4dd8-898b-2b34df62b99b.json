  "text": "JERUSALEM — The Israeli government early on Saturday approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that calls for the cessation of fighting in Gaza and the release of the first three Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as early as Sunday.A significant increase in humanitarian aid, including as many as 600 trucks of food, tents, medical supplies and fuel per day, is also expected to begin flowing into the devastated enclave on Sunday, humanitarian workers say.The terms of the deal had been resisted for months by far-right members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, who argued that a truce would be premature and result in the release of Palestinian militants who would attack Israel.Ultimately, the agreement was endorsed Friday by Netanyahu’s inner war cabinet with only Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir voting in opposition. After a lengthy debate that stretched past midnight, the wider cabinet of government ministers also voted to ratify the deal.“This is a vital step toward fulfilling the highest covenant between the state and its citizens,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement Friday after the deal was backed by the war cabinet. “There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, and Israeli duty. We must bring all of our hostages back home.”Hamas officials also confirmed that last-minute disagreements with Israel had been resolved early on Friday. The militant movement touted the ceasefire on social media as a “dignity agreement” and characterized it as an exchange that would yield the release of prisoners from various Palestinian factions.“We renew our salute to our people in the Gaza Strip and their steadfastness, which had the first credit after God in completing this deal,” Zaher Jabareen, the head of the Hamas Office of Martyrs and Prisoners, said in a statement. “We ask God to heal the wounded and grant our people freedom and liberation.”In Israel, where polls showed roughly 70 percent of the population supported a hostage deal, its completion marked a political victory for Netanyahu, who had spent days trying to convince his far-right allies to back the ceasefire. Netanyahu told his ministers that he had assurances from President-elect Donald Trump that fighting could resume if Hamas did not fulfill its part of the agreement, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.Netanyahu also acceded to demands from his right flank with his government freeing Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank who have been accused of attacking Palestinians and detained by Israeli security forces.“As part of the hostage release deal, I have decided to release the settlers currently held in administrative detention and send a clear message of support and encouragement to the settlement movement,” said Israel Katz, Netanyahu’s defense minister. “It is better for Jewish settler families to rejoice than for the families of released terrorists.”Israel’s military and its hospitals have been preparing to receive hostages held in Gaza with medical and psychological services, and Egyptian officials said they are preparing to receive Palestinian patients from Gaza when its southern Rafah border crossing opens.According to the deal, 33 Israeli hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, assault will be released during the initial six-week phase of the ceasefire. Three of the hostages will be freed on the first day the agreement takes effect, followed by four more after seven days. After that, three additional Israelis will be released every seven days, with 14 to be released in the final week of the initial phase.In exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. On the seventh day of the ceasefire, Palestinian civilians who were ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate from northern Gaza in October 2023, as Israeli forces pounded the area, will be allowed to return home.Humanitarian groups say that if the Gaza border opens on Sunday, the amount of aid allowed to enter the enclave would be eight times the average daily amount last month.Scaling up the operation quickly will be difficult, the groups warned. Few border crossings are open, and Israeli inspections have proceeded slowly, aid agencies say. A significant backlog of trucks remain stuck outside Gaza’s borders. Once inside the territory, trucks are often looted by armed gangs and desperate civilians.Janti Soeripto, chief executive of Save the Children, said her group had 60 trucks “ready to roll if the gates open” but warned that there may be logistical and security challenges. “It’s less about the actual supplies. It’s more about how do you then deliver them inside safely and securely,” Soeripto said. “And that’s going to be a bit of a wait-and-see and adapt type of moment.”Aid groups say they’ve already begun to prepare trucks and plan where to position staff once the ceasefire begins. Mediators of the deal have begun to engage with U.N. leadership to discuss the details of implementation, according to Georgios Petropoulos, head of the Gaza office for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Hazem Balousha contributed to this report.",
