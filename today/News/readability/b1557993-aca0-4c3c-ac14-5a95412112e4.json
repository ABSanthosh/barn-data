The country has for years recorded high rates of violent crime, but in recent years, gunmen have started targeting taverns, family gatherings and even a birthday party, in assassination-style hits.Police officers arrested Siphosoxolo Myekethe, 45, at his home on Monday, eight miles from the village still stunned by the shooting. He appeared briefly in a court in Eastern Cape Province on Wednesday and was charged with 18 counts of murder. Mr. Myekethe, who is being represented by a legal aid attorney, has not entered a plea. Prosecutors said that he had previous convictions for murder and escaping legal custody, and at the time of his arrest was on parole.He will again appear in court next Tuesday for a bail hearing. Prosecutors say they plan to oppose bail.Mr. Myekethe was arrested after the police launched a manhunt following the shooting. A motive was not clear, and it was not known if the accused was connected to the victims, prosecutors said. The police said they would continue to search for other people who may be connected to the attack.In the early hours of Saturday, Sept. 28, at least one shooter targeted two homesteads in a village outside Lusikisiki, a rural town. Members of the same family had gathered there to prepare for a traditional ceremony. Thirteen people were killed at one homestead, most of them women, and a 14th person later died of injuries at a hospital, the police said. At the other, all four people in one house were killed. A 14-year-old boy was among the dead. Six people survived, including a 2-month-old baby, the police said.Mr. Myekethe was also charged with the illegal possession of an unlicensed AK-47 assault rifle, prosecutors said in a statement. Crime statistics released by the government in August showed that murder rates had increased in four of South Africa’s nine provinces, driven largely by gun violence.In the past four months, the police have seized more than 430 illegal firearms, including automated rifles, most of them confiscated in the Eastern Cape, the police minister said.Lynsey Chutel is a Times reporter based in London who covers breaking news in Africa, the Middle East and Europe.
