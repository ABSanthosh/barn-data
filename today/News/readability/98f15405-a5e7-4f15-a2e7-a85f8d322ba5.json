  "text": "The fiancée of a man who was found dead in a locked storage trailer at a Sealy Mattress facility in Rockdale County has filed a negligence lawsuit against the company.“I just want answers as to how this could have happened,” said Jasmin Jennings.Jennings says Joshua Armour was having a mental health crisis on Oct. 22 when he wandered onto the mattress facility property in Conyers. He made a frantic call to his brother saying he was in a dark place.“He called his brother Joe screaming. He was in a panic saying he was trapped. He didn’t know where he was,” Jennings told Channel 2′s Tom Regan.[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]Armour’s brother and sister traced his phone’s location to the mattress facility. When they went there the following day and ask to search the property, or have someone search the property, they were denied, according to the family attorney.“Instead of meeting them with humanitarian compassion and going to search for Joshua, which could have saved his life, they chose to ignore the families’ pleas,” said attorney Kate Reddy.Family lawyers also say the facility had surveillance video of an unidentified man crossing onto the property at the time of Armour’s disappearance.“Logically, what it seemed like Sealy did in response to that information of an unidentified person being there, is they chose to act to protect the property in those trailers, and they did not see if someone was in the trailer, so they locked Josh in those trailers,” said attorney Mark Johnson.TRENDING STORIES:The cause of the death of the 27-year-old father of two hasn’t been determined, but lawyers believe it could have been heat-related.“Weather that week in Atlanta was in the eighties and a simple Google search will tell you that the temperature in that trailer was well over 100 degrees. What Josh experienced in the trailer before he died was unimaginable,” said Johnson.Jennings said the death of her fiancé was preventable.“My son asks questions on what happened to his dad. How do I explain this to a five-year-old? It’s extremely difficult. I don’t know what the future looks like right now. I’m just taking it one day at a time and being strong for my kids.” said Jennings.Tempur Sealy International released a statement that read,“We are saddened by this tragic incident and our deepest sympathies are with the victim’s family and loved ones. We have been conducting a thorough investigation to understand all the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident and have fully cooperated with local authorities. As this is an ongoing investigation, we are unable to provide further details or comment at this time.”Erin Grant, Head of Public Relations \u0026 Communications, Tempur Sealy International, Inc.[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]",
