  "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into longtime dirt racer Scott Bloomquist’s fatal plane crash found that Bloomquist likely intentionally flew his plane into a building.Bloomquist’s plane crashed into a barn next to an airstrip on his Tennessee property on August 16, 2024. Per the investigation report released on June 5, the NTSB said the probable cause of the crash was “the pilot’s intentional flight into a building as an act of suicide.”“At this time, the family of Scott Bloomquist is not making any public statements regarding the plane crash or the recent NTSB findings,” a statement said (via Fox Sports). \"They are focused on supporting one another and respectfully request privacy as they navigate this difficult period.

He’s regarded as one of the best dirt track drivers ever and was inducted into the National Dirt Late Model Hall of Fame in 2002. He won over 30 Late Model races in the World of Outlaws and had over 90 wins in the Lucas Oil dirt Late Model series.In 2019, Bloomquist suffered significant lower-body injuries in a motorcycle accident in Daytona. A year before his plane crash, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer ahead of a scheduled back surgery. Not long before his plane crash, Bloomquist said he had to be hospitalized because he didn't notice a horsefly bite he had received on one of his legs because of continued numbness from the injuries sustained in the motorcycle crash.",
