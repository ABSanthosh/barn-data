  "text": "After hours of deliberation, the Israeli government on Friday approved a ceasefire agreement with Hamas that calls for the cessation of fighting in Gaza and the release of the first three Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as early as Sunday.A significant increase in humanitarian aid, including as much as 600 trucks of food, tents, medical supplies and fuel per day, is also expected to begin flowing into the devastated enclave on Sunday, humanitarian workers say.The deal was endorsed earlier Friday by Netanyahu’s inner war cabinet with only Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir voting in opposition.The agreement ran into last-minute snags Thursday over disputes about which prisoners Hamas wanted released from Israeli custody in exchange for hostages taken from Israel, and whether the Israeli military would remain in the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s border with Egypt.A senior Hamas official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told The Washington Post that the parties reached a final agreement early Friday for the first phase of the ceasefire — slated to last 42 days — after hours of talks.In Israel, where polls showed roughly 70 percent of the population supported a hostage deal, its completion marked a political victory for Netanyahu, who had spent days trying to convince his far-right allies to back the ceasefire. Netanyahu told his ministers that he had assurances from President-elect Donald Trump that fighting could resume if Hamas did not fulfill their part of the agreement, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.Here’s what else to know:Israeli airstrikes have continued in Gaza since the deal was announced. As of Friday evening local time, at least 117 people have been killed, including 30 children, since the first reports of the ceasefire Wednesday, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesman said.The first six weeks of the deal are expected to involve the release of 33 hostages, including Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior Biden administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House. French President Emmanuel Macron, in a message posted Friday on X, said two French citizens, Ofer Kalderon and Ohad Yahalomi, are also among the 33 hostages set to be released.The Treasury Department on Friday sanctioned Yemen Kuwait Bank, accusing it of providing “financial support” to the Houthis, the Yemeni militant group backed by Iran.At least 46,788 people have been killed and 110,453 injured during the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children.Israeli officials say they believe 98 hostages remain in Gaza and that about 60 are believed to still be alive. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s October 2023 attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed during its military operation in Gaza.Live coverage contributors 14Banning UNRWA would undermine Gaza ceasefire, agency commissioner saysReturn to menuFull implementation of newly passed Israeli laws prohibiting the operation of UNRWA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, would be “catastrophic” for civilians in Gaza, UNWRA Commissioner Philippe Lazzarini said he told the U.N. Security Council on Friday. If Israel moves to enforce the laws, he told reporters after the closed-door meeting, “it would undermine the ceasefire agreement” now expected to begin Sunday, “and sabotage Gaza’s recovery and political transition.”The laws, scheduled to go into effect on Jan. 30, prohibit any UNWRA activities on Israeli territory or contacts between Israel officials with UNRWA. Numerous international officials working with UNRWA have already been denied Israeli visas that would allow them to enter Gaza, where all entries are controlled by Israel.The ceasefire agreement promises a “surge” of humanitarian assistance to Gaza, and Lazzarini said the agency intends to continue distributing aid until it is no longer permitted to do so.UNRWA, which maintains its headquarters in Jerusalem, provides schools and health care for millions of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and is by far the largest provider of food and other humanitarian aid in Gaza. There are currently 4,000 UNRWA trucks full of aid awaiting entry into the enclave, Lazzarini said.Instead of an abrupt termination, Lazzarini said, any end to its activities should be a gradual process. “We have a clear choice,” he said he told the council. Either UNRWA is allowed to “implode,” or arrangements are made for the “orderly conclusion” of its U.N. mandate.Gazans eye ceasefire with mixed feelings: ‘What do we have left?’ Return to menuPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)For Palestinians reeling from the devastating toll of Israel’s more than 15 month-long war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, their hopes Thursday, the day after a ceasefire deal was announced, were modest:To return to homes reduced to ruins. To sleep a night without fear. To grieve.Mohammed Abu Alkas, a 32-year-old marketing manager who now lives in a badly damaged house in the central Gazan city of Nuseirat, expressed mixed feelings about watching people celebrate as the news of the agreement — brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt — was announced Wednesday night.“Their happiness breaks my heart, because what do we have left?” he said.Like Abu Alkas, more than 90 percent of those who have survived are displaced from their homes, many of them multiple times, according to the United Nations.Abu Alkas is still wearing the same pair of pants, now tattered, that he had on when the war began more than a year ago. During that time, he has been displaced three times. He was injured alongside his mother in an airstrike.On Tuesday, the day before the ceasefire was announced, another missile that hit a neighboring house sprayed body parts into their building: a leg and parts of a face.“Until the last moment, death,” he said.This is an excerpt from a full story.Here’s what we know about the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal Return to menuHamas and Israel reached a ceasefire and hostage release deal Wednesday following more than 15 months of war that has laid waste to the Gaza Strip and divided Israelis.Israel’s government needs to ratify the deal, which was mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.The first stage of the three-phase agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, according to Qatar’s Foreign Ministry.Thirty-three living hostages are set to be released over the course of that ceasefire, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, according to U.S. officials. Two Americans — Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen — are slated for release in the first phase, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss negotiations, said Tuesday that the captives released in the first stage would be children, women, injured people and those 50 and older.The first phase will also include a “withdrawal and redeployment of Israeli forces outside densely populated areas,” the Qatari ministry said.Internally displaced people in Gaza will be allowed to return to their homes.This period will also see a surge of much-needed humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave.Negotiations for the second phase of the deal — during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza — are supposed to begin in coming weeks.During the third phase, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.This is an excerpt from a full story.Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal brings hope for devastated northern GazaReturn to menuThe ceasefire deal announced this week between Israel and Hamas brings hope for northern Gaza, where the desperate conditions have caused one of the most rancorous disputes among President Joe Biden’s humanitarian officials since the start of the 15-month war.The inability of aid workers to access the area has created confusion and disagreement about the severity of the conditions there, culminating in a U.S.-funded report declaring in December that famine was underway in northern Gaza — a claim denied by the Israeli government.“Israel’s near-total blockade of humanitarian and commercial food supplies to besieged areas of North Gaza Governorate … has been in place for nearly 80 days,” read the report. “In the absence of a change to Israeli policy,” the report predicted that at least two to 15 people would die each day beginning as early as January.The report, produced by the famine-tracking organization Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) just weeks before Biden was due to leave the White House, threatened to further tarnish the administration’s legacy in Gaza and its title was challenged internally by a senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development.When the report published in late December without changes to the title, the Biden administration ordered the famine warning be deleted from FEWS NET’s website — the first such retraction in the organization’s 40-year relationship with the U.S. government.This is an excerpt from a full story.",
