  "text": "US President-elect Donald Trump met French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday. While some netizens are discussing this unusual meeting, few were ripping Zelenskyy’s fashion sense. The Ukrainian President faced criticism for his informal attire during the Notre Dame cathedral's formal reopening in Paris.At both the ceremony Presidents at Élysée Palac, while the presidents wore formal suit, Zelenskyy opted for casual black attire with combat boots. \"BUY A FUCKING SUIT VOLODOMYR! I am literally in Paris right now. Someone tell Zelenskyy I will personally buy him a suit and take him shopping for it. On my card. He doesn’t even need to spend the billions he’s laundered over the past three years!\" a user said on X while other one said, \"Everybody is dressed business attire. But not Zelenskyy. He shows up in a sweater and jacket. He's an embarrassment, or should be.\"Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, known for his own casual style, expressed approval, describing Zelensky's choice as a \"mood.\"The Ukrainian leader's military sweatshirt featured imagery resembling the Ukraine Armed Forces emblem, similar to what he wore during his 2022 Congressional address requesting support against Russian forces.Trump adviser Roger Stone criticised the choice, stating to The Post: \"He can't afford a suit? He wore a suit and tie to the World Economic Forum event, but can't wear one to address a joint session of Congress or to meet the President-elect of the United States?\"After the meeting in Paris, the Ukrainian president took to his X account and said that Trump is, as always, resolute.\" I thank him. I also extend my gratitude to Emmanuel for organizing this important meeting. We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way. We spoke about our people, the situation on the ground, and a just peace. We agreed to continue working together and keep in contact. Peace through strength is possible,\" he said in a post on X.",
