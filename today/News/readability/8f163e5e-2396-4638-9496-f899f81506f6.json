  "text": "Authorities in Australia have recommended that about 1,200 young children undergo health screenings after a man who worked at child care centers in Victoria state was charged with more than 70 offenses including sexual assault.Joshua Brown, a 26-year-old from Point Cook in southwest Melbourne, was charged May 12 with more than 70 offenses including sexual assault, sexual activity in the presence of a child, and possessing and producing child abuse material, Victoria Police said in a statement Tuesday.The charges relate to eight victims ranging in age from 5 months to 2 years who were placed at a Point Cook child care center between April 2022 and January 2023, police said.The center has been identified as Creative Gardens Early Learning Centre by Victoria authorities. Twenty child care centers where Brown worked between January 2017 and May 2025, including some for as little as a day, have been named so parents can check whether they may have used the facilities during that time, authorities said.The acting commander of the Victoria Police Crime Command, Janet Stevenson, said at a news conference Tuesday that Brown was charged after a search warrant was carried out at his home.She said Brown was not known to police before the investigation and had passed background checks to work with children in the state. “He was a child care worker at the time of his arrest,” she said, adding that he was providing temporary fill-in child care in some cases and may have held other roles throughout his employment.Stevenson, in the police statement, described the investigation as “incredibly distressing and confronting.”“The most important thing for our investigators was that we needed to identify the victims involved. These are some of the most vulnerable members of our community, and the conversations police have had to have with their families were no doubt life changing in the worst possible way.”Victoria’s chief health officer, Christian McGrath, said health authorities have contacted about 2,600 families that used the relevant centers in the cited time period. About 1,200 children have been recommended to undergo screening for infectious diseases because of the potential risk of exposure, he said, adding that the large figure is due to an “abundance of caution” and to provide certainty for families.McGrath declined to comment on the nature of the infectious diseases and whether any of the victims or the accused had tested positive, citing private health information and the sensitive nature of the investigation.“We do understand that this is another distressing element to this situation,” McGrath said, speaking at the Tuesday news conference. “Families and the wider community can be assured that the infections that the children were potentially exposed to can be treated with antibiotics and there is no broader public health risk to the community.”At this stage, there is no evidence to suggest that other staff members at any of the centers were involved or that any other alleged offenses have taken place outside Victoria, police said in the statement. However, detectives are examining an allegation at a child care center in Essendon — another suburb of Melbourne — that is being investigated as a priority, police said.Victoria authorities have set up a dedicated website and helpline for those affected, and testing will be free. Families will also be eligible for a payment of about $3,300 to help with alternative care arrangements and loss of earnings, the website said.Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan, speaking at Tuesday’s news conference alongside police and health officials, said she was “sickened by these allegations of abuse.” “They are shocking and distressing, and my heart just breaks for the families who are living every parent’s worst nightmare,” she said. “As a parent, too, I can only imagine the unbearable grief and pain the affected families are experiencing right now.”",
