Her four-year-old son is in critical condition. The accident occurred in the Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Gravesend, where nine people were injured. The driver and Uber driver were hospitalized, with no charges filed yet.A mother and her two young daughters were killed in Brooklyn on Saturday when a driver with a suspended licence crashed into an Uber before ploughing into the family. The three were walking home from synagogue when the tragedy struck. The woman’s four-year-old son was also struck and remains in critical condition, fighting for his life, authorities confirmed. Overall, nine people were injured in the devastating crash.The tragedy unfolded just after 1 pm on Ocean Parkway, near Quentin Road, in the Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of Gravesend. Police said a Toyota Camry Uber and an Audi collided, sending the Audi hurtling into a crosswalk, where it struck the family.“The bang I heard, it was like an earthquake,” a witness told the New York Post. “It went on for a good 30 seconds. It felt like the world stopped for that second.”The Audi, driven by 32-year-old Miriam Yarimi, fatally hit the 35-year-old mother and her daughters, aged eight and six, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.“This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn’t have been on the road,” Tisch stated at a press conference at the scene.The woman’s husband, who was at home with their infant at the time, was later informed of the heartbreaking loss.“My neighbor had to go to the husband and tell him that his wife and two children passed away,” a local resident said. Shocking images from the aftermath showed children’s shoes scattered on the pavement, while paramedics desperately worked on the injured. A first responder was seen on his knees, visibly distraught and in tears.Three passengers inside the Uber, an adult and two children, were also taken to Kings County Hospital in stable condition. Both Yarimi and the 62-year-old Uber driver were transported to Coney Island Hospital, where they were expected to undergo tests for drink-driving.So far, no charges have been filed against Yarimi.New York city mayor Eric Adams described the crash as a tragedy of “Shakespearean proportions.”“A mother going for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed,” he said at an unrelated event. “I cannot imagine the pain of the family.”",
