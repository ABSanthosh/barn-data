  "text": "Chief executive officer of Google Sundar Pichai.Marek Antoni Iwanczuk | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesGoogle on Friday made the latest a splash in the AI talent wars, announcing an agreement to bring in Varun Mohan, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence coding startup Windsurf.As part of the deal, Google will also hire other senior Windsurf research and development employees. Google is not investing in Windsurf, but the search giant will take a nonexclusive license to certain Windsurf technology, according to a person familiar with the matter. Windsurf remains free to license its technology to others.\"We're excited to welcome some top AI coding talent from Windsurf's team to Google DeepMind to advance our work in agentic coding,\" a Google spokesperson wrote in an email. \"We're excited to continue bringing the benefits of Gemini to software developers everywhere.\"The deal between Google and Windsurf comes after the AI coding startup had been in talks with OpenAI for a $3 billion acquisition deal, CNBC reported in April. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The move ratchets up the talent war in AI particularly among prominent companies. Meta has made lucrative job offers to several employees at OpenAI in recent weeks. Most notably, the Facebook parent added Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang to lead its AI strategy as part of a $14.3 billion investment into his startup. Douglas Chen, another Windsurf co-founder, will be among those joining Google in the deal, Jeff Wang, the startup's new interim CEO and its head of business for the past two years, wrote in a post on X.\"Most of Windsurf's world-class team will continue to build the Windsurf product with the goal of maximizing its impact in the enterprise,\" Wang wrote.Windsurf has become more popular this year as an option for so-called vibe coding, which is the process of using new age AI tools to write code. Developers and non-developers have embraced the concept, leading to more revenue for Windsurf and competitors, such as Cursor, which OpenAI also looked at buying. All the interest has led investors to assign higher valuations to the startups.This isn't the first time Google has hired select people out of a startup. It did the same with Character.AI last summer. Amazon and Microsoft have also absorbed AI talent in this fashion, with the Adept and Inflection deals, respectively.Microsoft is pushing an agent mode in its Visual Studio Code editor for vibe coding. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said AI is composing as much of 30% of his company's code.The Verge reported the Google-Windsurf deal earlier on Friday.WATCH: Google pushes \"AI Mode\" on homepage",
