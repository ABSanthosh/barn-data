This appeal came just a day after Trump issued several executive orders focused on transgender rights and immigration.\"I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,\" Budde said. \"There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families, some who fear for their lives.\" Trump's Savage 'Eyeroll' After 'Woke' LGBTQ+ Plea By Washington Cathedral Bishop | WatchBudde also addressed Trump's promise to enact mass deportations and turn away refugees and asylum-seekers, saying, \"I ask you to have mercy, Mr. President, on those in our communities whose children fear that their parents will be taken away and that you help those who are fleeing war zones and persecution in their own lands to find compassion and welcome here.\"Trump, seated in the front pew, occasionally looked down, while Vice President JD Vance glanced at his wife before seemingly raising his eyebrows in surprise.Meanwhile, when asked by a reporter later what he thought of the service, Trump responded, \"Did you like it? Did you find it exciting? Not too exciting was it? I didn't think it was a good service, no. They could do much better.\"Donald Trump SLAMS sermon, after Bishop pleads for immigrants, transgender rightsThe direct appeal to Trump at the start of his first full day as president was a remarkable moment at an event that has not historically been political, according to many. They saw Budde's candid sermon as a sign of the alarm in Washington and beyond over his immigration agenda and blitz of executive actions focused on gender identity. Budde was flooded with messages of support from people hailing her \"courage\". \"Wow. A bishop just called out Trump and Vance to their faces at church,\" said a podcast cast host on X. A man with Democrat in his also praised the bishop and said, \"HAHAHA! Trump is FURIOUS after being called out by Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde,\" adding, \" Trump’s fragile ego has been badly damaged!\"Meanwhile, Rep Mike Collins was irked by the sermon and said, \"The person giving this sermon should be added to the deportation list.\" Other people also jumped on social media to oppose the bishop's action. \"They can leave America now while there is still time or cry me a River,\" said an entrepreneur according to his X profile. In an interview, Budde explained that she decided to speak to him directly because \"of the fear that I have seen and experienced among our people -- people that I know and love, both within the immigrant community and within the LGBTQ community, and how terrified so many are.\"Bishop Budde, aged 65, holds the distinction of being the first female spiritual leader of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, a position she has maintained since 2011.Prior to her Washington appointment, she served as rector at St. John's Episcopal Church in Minneapolis for close to twenty years. She completed her education at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, and spent her formative years between New Jersey and Colorado. The diocese under her leadership, encompassing the National Cathedral, had arranged for a prayer service to be held the day following the inauguration, irrespective of the election results. She confirmed her commitment to deliver the sermon, regardless of who emerged victorious.",
