  "text": "KYIV — Russia continued to fire artillery at Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour truce for Easter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, but Kyiv will honor the ceasefire if Moscow does. Both sides appear eager to show an interest in peace talks before an increasingly impatient Trump administration.Putin declared a unilateral truce to begin at 6 p.m. Moscow time and said he expected Ukraine to follow Russia’s example. Kyiv’s reaction, he said, would demonstrate whether it was earnest about seeking a peaceful resolution to the war.Zelensky appeared initially to dismiss Putin’s Saturday suggestion, calling it an “attempt to play with people’s lives.”Ukraine previously agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the Trump administration, but Russia rejected it. Later, the sides agreed separately with Washington to halt strikes on energy infrastructure, but each has since accused the other of repeated violations.Less than an hour before Putin’s ceasefire was to take effect Saturday, air raid alerts blared across the country and Zelensky said Russian drones were spotted over Ukraine.“Shaheds in our skies,” he said, referring to the armed drones supplied by Iran, “are Putin’s true attitude to Easter and to people’s lives.”But later, he said if Russia was “now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly — mirroring Russia’s actions.”“Silence in response to silence, defensive strikes in response to attacks,” he wrote on X. “If a complete ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond the Easter day of April 20. That is what will reveal Russia’s true intentions — because 30 hours is enough to make headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures. Thirty days could give peace a chance.”But he tried also to manage expectations, noting that “Russian artillery fire has not subsided.”“We know all too well how Moscow manipulates, and we are prepared for anything. Ukraine’s Defense Forces will act rationally — responding in kind. Every Russian strike will be met with an appropriate response,” he said.The Russian Ministry of Defense said it would adhere to the pause in fighting on the condition that Ukraine did so as well.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha noted Russia had rejected the Trump administration’s ceasefire proposal and was continuing to attack civilians. A Russian missile attack on Sumy on Palm Sunday killed 34 people and wounded at least 117. Another on a playground in Kryvyi Rih on April 4 killed 21 people, including nine children.Later, after Zelensky’s statement, he wrote “Ukraine makes its step,” adding that Zelensky “puts it straight: yes, Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire if Russia does actually cease it. But not for 30 hours. For 30 days, as we agreed upon in Jeddah on March 11.”“Moscow must now demonstrate whether it takes peace seriously,” he wrote.The Russian declaration comes against the backdrop of apparent waning interest on the part of the Trump administration in faltering peace talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. was ready to “move on” from peace talks, barring sufficient progress “within days.”“We are now reaching a point where we need to decide and determine whether this is even possible or not,” Rubio told reporters.Donald Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that the U.S. would “take a pass” on brokering further talks between Moscow and Kyiv if the two sides “make it very difficult” to reach a peace deal.Putin added Saturday that Russia was ready for negotiations, and welcomed the work of diplomats in the U.S. and China seeking to resolve the conflict. The war began after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.“I don’t see it as a serious indicator that Putin is ready for peace,” said Eric Ciaramella, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who previously served as the U.S. deputy national intelligence officer for Russia. “It’s clearly a maneuver to stay in President Trump’s good graces. If Putin were serious, he would have accepted the longer truce the Ukrainians already agreed to.”Both Russia and Ukraine have proposed similar cessations of fighting in the past. The United Nations proposed an Easter truce in April 2022, which Ukraine agreed to but Russia turned down. Russia also proposed a truce around Christmas in 2023, which Ukraine rejected.Russia agreed to a limited cessation of strikes targeting energy infrastructure in March, while blocking a U.S.-brokered proposal for a ceasefire on military operations in the Black Sea, saying it was unwilling to participate unless sanctions against several Russian financial institutions were dropped, conditions that European leaders opposed.Despite the limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure attacks, both sides accused each other of breaking it.A Russian academic, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Putin’s declaration of the brief Easter truce came as “the Russian leadership understood they need to make some kind of gesture to throw the ball onto the other side’s court.”“A propaganda battle is going on between Moscow and Kyiv, with both sides trying to accuse each other of being responsible for the continuation of the conflict,” he said. “It is a theater for an audience of one — Donald Trump.”",
