That has long been the core sticking point with Israel.Displaced Palestinians north of Gaza City on Friday.Credit...Saher Alghorra for The New York TimesAaron BoxermanRonen Bergman and Abu Bakr BashirAaron Boxerman reported from Jerusalem, Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv and Abu Bakr Bashir from London.May 31, 2025Updated 6:10 p.m. ETThe White House denounced Hamas’s response on Saturday to a new American cease-fire proposal as totally unacceptable and said it “only takes us backward” after the group sought firmer guarantees that the deal would lead to a permanent end to the war.Under the U.S. proposal, which was floated by Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s Mideast envoy, Israel and Hamas would halt the fighting in Gaza for at least 60 days, during which some hostages would be freed in exchange for Palestinians jailed by Israel. And there would be further U.S.-backed negotiations on a permanent end to the war.That issue has long been the core sticking point in the truce negotiations. Hamas has been willing to free the remaining Israeli and foreign captives in Gaza as part of a broader deal to end the war. Israel has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas lays down its arms and sends it leaders into exile.Mr. Witkoff laid the blame on Hamas for the impasse, saying in a statement that its response “only takes us backward.” He said Hamas should accept the U.S. framework as the basis for further intensive negotiations, “which we can begin immediately this coming week.”A Hamas official outside of Gaza had said earlier on Saturday that the group was seeking amendments to the Witkoff proposal around the guarantees for ending the war decisively.An Israeli official said Hamas had demanded stronger guarantees that the temporary truce would pave the way for the end of the conflict that began almost 20 months ago. Both the Israeli and the Hamas officials requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
