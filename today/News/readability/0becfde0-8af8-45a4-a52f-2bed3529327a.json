  "text": "Following Thursday’s mass shooting at Florida State University that left two dead and six injured, 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner has been identified as the suspected gunman. In the immediate aftermath, social media users began scrutinising Ikner’s political affiliations, resurfacing old quotes, social media posts, and what appear to be voter registration records.One widely circulated post on X claims Ikner is a registered Republican, pointing to a Florida Voter Registration form allegedly listing his party as GOP. The same post notes that Ikner’s Instagram bio frequently cited Bible verses, drawing assumptions about his conservative leanings.Also read: 'Guns don't shoot ... ': What Donald Trump said after Florida State University shootingFurther fuelling the speculation, users shared a screenshot from a 2017 FSUNews article where Ikner commented on an anti-Trump rally held on campus prior to Donald Trump's inauguration. “These people are usually pretty entertaining, usually not for good reasons. I think it’s a little too late, he’s [Trump] already going to be inaugurated on Jan. 20 and there’s not really much you can do unless you outright revolt, and I don’t think anyone wants that,” Ikner is quoted as saying.Authorities confirmed Ikner is the son of Jessica Ikner, a Leon County Sheriff’s Deputy with more than 18 years of service. Officials said the weapon used in the shooting belonged to his mother. Ikner had previously participated in law enforcement youth programs, including the sheriff’s office Youth Advisory Council.He was taken into custody at the scene and remains hospitalised under police watch. An investigation into the motive and background of the suspect is ongoing.",
