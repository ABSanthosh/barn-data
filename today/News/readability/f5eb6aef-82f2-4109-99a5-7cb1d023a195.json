  "text": "The Justice Department on Wednesday announced charges against 12 Chinese citizens accused in a cyberespionage scheme that allegedly targeted U.S. government agencies, contractors, journalists and critics, whose data was sold to clients including the Chinese government.The victims included the U.S. Treasury Department, which acknowledged late last year that its networks had been breached by Chinese actors, federal authorities said. Among the other targets were the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the Commerce Department, the foreign ministries of several Asian nations, religious groups and news organizations critical of China.Justice Department officials described the charges — laid out in indictments unsealed in New York and Washington — as part of a broader effort to crack down on what they have portrayed as a marketplace of hackers for hire often working at the behest of Beijing.“We are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide, as well as the enabling companies and individual hackers that they have unleashed,” Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department’s national security division, said in a statement.U.S. authorities see China as the greatest long-term threat to national security and have previously raised alarms about its targeted hacking campaigns. For years, they have warned that Chinese state-backed hackers have been ramping up increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks to breach critical U.S. infrastructure, steal data from federal agencies and infiltrate telecommunications networks.The Trump administration has been rolling back efforts by the FBI and other agencies to counter digital and cyberthreats. Earlier this week, the Pentagon paused offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command, though Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the decision would not affect similar operations by other agencies including the CIA.Officials likened the cases unsealed Wednesday to a similar indictment announced in March 2024 against seven Chinese hackers accused of a 14-year campaign targeting U.S. businesses and government officials — including some within the White House.The 12 Chinese citizens newly named as defendants are believed to be in China and are unlikely to face extradition. But authorities said identifying them in legal documents and detailing the alleged links between them and the Chinese government would expose their operations to broader public scrutiny.Beijing has previously denied any involvement in state-level hacking and says it is a victim of such attacks, pointing the finger back at the United States. Responding to the charges announced Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington accused the United States of using cybersecurity to “smear” China.“Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace and has diverse actors,” embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu said. “Tracing the source of cyberattacks is a complex technical issue. We hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude.”The case unsealed in New York targeted a network of eight employees and managers at the Shanghai-based company iSoon as well as two officials at the Chinese Ministry of State Security. All 10 were accused of conspiring to carry out cyberattacks against U.S. federal agencies and private companies.iSoon, also known as Anxun, sells third-party hacking and data-gathering services to Chinese government bureaus, security groups and state-owned enterprises, The Washington Post has reported. The indictment described the business “as a key player in the [Chinese government’s] hacker-for-hire ecosystem.”Last year, a trove of nearly 600 internal files leaked from iSoon gave an unprecedented look into the company’s operations and the extensive cooperation between it and the Chinese government.Those documents — including chat logs between staff members and other data covering more than eight years of operations — showed iSoon competed for contracts with powerful Chinese government entities, including the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security and the military, to steal data from at least 20 foreign governments, as well as private companies.Wednesday’s indictment shared new details on how iSoon allegedly chose its targets and how it and other Chinese hacking companies allegedly sold the stolen data.The company primarily relied on spear-phishing, officials said, which means tricking victims into clicking malicious links that give hackers access to sensitive login credentials. It charged Chinese intelligence agencies the equivalent of about $10,000 to $75,000 for each successful hack, with extra fees for analyzing the data it extracted, according to the indictment.When its hackers weren’t attacking targets identified by Chinese ministry officials, the indictment said, they attacked speculatively — breaking into computer systems of private companies, think tanks, religious organizations or U.S. government contractors to steal data they could sell on the open market.That conduct was quietly encouraged by Chinese authorities because it allowed the government to deny accusations of official involvement, U.S. officials said.“They cast a wide net. Identifying vulnerable computers, exploiting these computers. Stealing information from them that they will then sell to” Chinese government security services, said a senior FBI official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the investigation. “If that fails, the cyber mercenaries turn into cyber dealers selling their stolen data to anyone willing to pay the price.”Two other hackers, including the suspect in last year’s Treasury Department cyberintrusion, were charged in separate cases unsealed in Washington.The indictment against those men — Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai — accuses them of causing millions in damage through cyberattacks stretching back nearly a decade.Zhou — founder of Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Co. and a member of what authorities described as the Green Army, a Chinese nationalist hacking group with activity dating back to the 1990s — allegedly used his company to broker the sale of data stolen by Yin from “highly sensitive U.S. critical infrastructure networks.”Yin is a notorious figure in the Chinese hacking scene linked to the hacking group APT27, which is known for targeting international government and defense data. In January, the U.S. Treasury Department identified him as a suspect in the breach of its networks last year and levied sanctions against him.Treasury imposed additional sanctions against Zhou on Wednesday, while the State Department announced a $2 million reward for information leading to Yin’s arrest.",
