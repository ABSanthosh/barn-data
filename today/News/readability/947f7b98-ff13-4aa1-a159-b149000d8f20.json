  "text": "LOS ANGELES (KTLA) – A significant change in the weather is in the forecast for Southern California, including the likelihood of rain.An area of low pressure will drop into the region on Saturday, bringing a tenth to a half inch of rain to most areas through Sunday, along with significantly cooler temperatures, according to meteorologists.“Local amounts up to one inch are possible across south-facing slopes of the San Gabriel mountains,” the National Weather Service said, adding that thunderstorms are also possible.The low pressure system will also bring snow to higher elevations, including ski resorts that have struggled with very little natural snowfall this season. The Weather Service said snowfall amounts will range from two to five inches above 5000 feet, with local amounts of up to 10 inches at the resorts.While Southern California desperately needs the precipitation, officials are bracing for the potential impact on the Palisades and Eaton wildfire burn scars.At a news conference Wednesday, Los Angeles County Public Works Director Mark Pestrella explained how his agency is preparing for the possibility of mudslides that could cause further destruction in the wildfire-ravaged areas.“As the rain approaches L.A. County, Public Works will mobilize 24/7 storm patrols. All flood control dams and channels have been prepared,” said Pestrella.Concrete barriers known as “K-rails” are being deployed to divert debris flows, Pestrella said, and crews are filling sandbags for businesses and residents in areas impacted by the fires.“Our objective in this incident is to protect the public, property and the natural environment,” he told reporters.KTLA meteorologist Henry DiCarlo, however, expressed confidence that the storm will not bring enough precipitation to cause major trouble.“We’re going to get our share of rain, which is good because it signals a change,” said DiCarlo. “It may not be a lot, but that is also good because we don’t want slides in those burn areas.”Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
