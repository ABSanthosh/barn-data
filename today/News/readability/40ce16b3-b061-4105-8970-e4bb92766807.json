  "text": "US president Donald Trump on Monday declared full support for the Senate’s newly approved budget plan.Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the bill includes “all the elements we need”—from permanent tax cuts to major spending reductions and border security. \"The budget plan just passed by the United States Senate has my complete and total endorsement and support. All of the elements we need to secure the border, enact historic spending cuts, and make tax cuts permanent, and much more, are strongly covered and represented in the bill. Thank you to Senate majority leader John Thune, and house speaker Mike Johnson for their hard work and attention to detail. There is no better time than now to get this deal done,” the president wrote in his post.\"\"The House, the Senate, and our great administration are going to work tirelessly on creating “the one, big, beautiful bill,” an appropriate name if Congress so likes. Everyone is going to be happy with the result. Passage will make even the subject of world trade far easier and better for the USA. The House must pass this budget resolution, and quickly — make America great again!\" the president added..The Senate passed the bill early Saturday in a close 51-48 vote, mostly along party lines. The plan aims to extend the 2017 Trump-era tax cuts, reduce federal spending, and allocate $175 billion each to military funding and immigration enforcement.Democrats strongly opposed the Senate bill. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s policies “a disaster” and warned the current proposal would harm social programmes like social security and Medicaid. Republican leaders argued that the bill is necessary to prevent upcoming tax increases, as many of Trump’s tax cuts are set to expire soon.Senate Republicans pass budget bill as Trump's tariffs spark nationwide protestsThe package sets up a clear political fight in the House, where more conservative Republicans are pushing deeper tax cuts and heavier spending cuts. Fiscal conservatives in the house have already criticised the Senate’s estimates, claiming they downplay the real cost. House speaker Mike Johnson is expected to bring the bill to a vote soon, hoping to strike a deal before the Memorial Day deadline.",
