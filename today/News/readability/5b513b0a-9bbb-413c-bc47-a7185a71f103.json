  "text": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Monday that Iran would be able to survive if ongoing negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program fail to yield a deal. His comments came after US President Trump described weekend talks with Tehran as “very good.”\"It's not like we will die of hunger if they refuse to negotiate with us or impose sanctions,\" Pezeshkian said. “We will find a way to survive.”The high-level negotiations, which began in April, aim to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Trump has threatened Iran with crippling sanctions and military action if a new agreement is not reached.This latest effort represents the most substantial agreement between Washington and Tehran since the US withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which had offered Iran sanctions relief in exchange for strict limits on its nuclear program.Iran continues to insist that its nuclear activities are for civilian purposes only and seeks relief from sanctions that have severely impacted its oil-based economy.Talks in Rome last week marked the fifth round of negotiations. While some signs of limited progress emerged, key disagreements remain — particularly over uranium enrichment.When asked about reports suggesting Iran might agree to freeze enrichment for three years, foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei responded, “Iran will never accept that.”“If there is goodwill from the American side, we are also optimistic,” he added. “But if negotiations are aimed at curbing Iran’s rights then talks will get nowhere.”Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” approach, tightening sanctions and keeping military threats on the table. However, his recent comments suggest a potentially softer tone as both sides consider the costs of continued confrontation.",
