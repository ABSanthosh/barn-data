  "text": "The BBC's Wyre Davies sees urgently needed Gaza aid going through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossingMore than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade.The aid, which included flour, baby food and medical equipment, was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday night and taken to warehouses for distribution. Several bakeries began producing bread with the flour on Thursday.The UN said the delays were due to a lack of security along the single access route approved by Israel's military.Israeli authorities said they allowed an additional 100 lorry loads through Kerem Shalom on Wednesday. However, the UN said it was \"nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza\".About 500 lorries entered the territory on average every day before the war, the UN has said. Humanitarian organisations have warned of acute levels of hunger among the 2.1 million population, amid significant shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices.Palestinian Authority Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told reporters on Thursday that 29 children and elderly people had died from \"starvation-related\" causes in the last couple of days, according to Reuters news agency. Half a million people face starvation in the coming months, an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said.A UN World Food Programme (WFP) official said the UN and its partners had over 140,000 tonnes of food - about 6,000 lorry loads and enough to feed the entire population for two months - in position at aid corridors and ready to be brought into Gaza at scale.Israel stopped all deliveries of aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.Israel has insisted that there has been no shortage of aid and has accused Hamas of stealing supplies to give to its fighters or sell to raise money - an allegation the group denied. The UN also denied that aid had been diverted.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the claim on Thursday, saying in a statement: \"I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer: When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice.\"Netanyahu said the leaders of France, Canada and the UK had \"bought into Hamas's propaganda that says Israel is starving Palestinian children\".He reiterated that Israel and the US would set up their own aid delivery to be done through American companies in Gaza, bypassing the UN and other aid suppliers. Netanyahu had previously said he was allowing in a limited amount of food so that the Israeli military could continue its newly expanded ground offensive and take full control of the Palestinian territory.He said on Thursday that construction of the first distribution zones in the scheme would be completed \"in the coming days\".The UN and other agencies have said they will not co-operate with US-Israeli plan, saying it contradicts fundamental humanitarian principles and appears to \"weaponise aid\".The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had brought in one lorry load of medical supplies for the Red Cross field hospital in the southern city of Rafah, but that more was needed.\"A trickle of trucks is woefully inadequate. Only the rapid, unimpeded, and sustained flow of aid can begin to address the full scope of needs on the ground,\" it said.Mandy Blackman, the nurse in charge of running the charity UK-Med's field hospital in the southern al-Mawasi area, described the situation in Gaza as \"heart-breaking\", with food in perilously short supply.She told the BBC that patients arriving at the hospital were \"visibly thinner\" than during her previous two stints there, and that staff were only able to offer them one meal a day, consisting of rice with some pulses.\"People are having to relocate constantly and are not able to feed their children. No-one knows what's going to happen the next day. There's constant suffering and constant anxiety,\" she said.ReutersPalestinian workers were pictured unloading sacks of flour at a bakery in the southern city of Khan Younis overnightBefore the aid entered Gaza, senior WFP official Antoine Renard had told the BBC that the problems with collecting it arose because the Israeli military wanted lorries to move along a route which aid agencies considered to be dangerous. The route, he said, could leave them at risk of attack by desperately hungry civilians and armed criminal gangs.\"At market prices in Gaza right now, each truck full of flour is worth around $400,000 (£298,000),\" Mr Renard explained.He added that the solution would be \"hundreds of trucks daily\" travelling along a safe route to warehouses, noting \"the less we provide, the greater the risk and more anxiety created\" among the population.Mr Renard said aid agencies on the Gaza side did not employ armed guards to accompany their cargoes because it was considered too dangerous, so a lengthy ceasefire and an extension of the current five-day window for the transfer of food was urgently needed.According to Mr Renard, bringing in at least 100 aid lorries daily would only meet the \"very minimum\" of the population's food needs.ReutersThe UN said the aid was \"nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza\"Meanwhile, Israeli bombardment and ground operations are continuing across Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting on Thursday that 107 people were killed over the previous 24 hours.At least 52 people have been killed since dawn on Thursday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. Palestinian media reported that they included 16 people, most of them members of one extended family, who died when a home was hit in Jabalia, in northern Gaza.The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for Jabalia and 13 other northern neighbourhoods on Thursday, warning residents that it was \"operating with intense force in your areas, as terrorist organisations continue their activities and operations\".According to the UN, about 81% of the territory is now either subject to Israeli evacuation orders or located in militarized \"no-go\" zones.Almost 600,000 people are estimated to have been displaced again since March, including 161,000 who have been forced to flee in the past week.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,762 people, including 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",
