  "text": "A mayoral candidate from Mexico’s ruling Morena party was shot dead during a campaign event in the eastern state of Veracruz on Sunday, as political violence continues to escalate ahead of the country’s June elections.Yesenia Lara Gutiérrez, who was running for mayor of Texistepec, was among four people killed in a hail of gunfire that also left three others wounded.The attack unfolded during a campaign march, with a live stream posted to Lara’s Facebook page capturing the chaos. Supporters were seen smiling and chanting before the sound of automatic gunfire sent the crowd fleeing in panic. Footage showed a parade of motorcycles and Morena flags moments before the shooting began.Veracruz Governor Rocío Nahle condemned the killing on social media, describing it as a \"cowardly murder,\" and vowed justice: \"We will find those responsible. No position or office is worth a person’s life.\"Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum addressed the incident on Monday, saying her government was coordinating with state authorities and had offered federal assistance. She said there was no immediate information on the motive behind the attack.The incident is the latest in a string of violent acts targeting local politicians across Mexico, a pattern that has grown more frequent in the lead-up to national elections. Just days earlier, councillor Cecilia Ruvalcaba was shot dead in a hospital in Jalisco, while several other local officials have also been gunned down in recent months.According to human rights group Data Cívica, over 660 politically-linked attacks were recorded in Mexico last year, most involving candidates or officials at the municipal level. The broader backdrop of cartel violence and political corruption has contributed to nearly half a million murders in the country since 2006.Authorities in Veracruz say an investigation is underway and promised that those responsible will be brought to justice.",
