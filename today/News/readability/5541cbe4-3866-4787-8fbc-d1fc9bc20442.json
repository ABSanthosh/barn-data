Mujib Mashal reported from New Delhi.Jan. 30, 2025, 7:14 a.m. ETThe pre-dawn stampede at the massive Hindu festival in northern India created havoc. But order was restored swiftly in the next few hours.On Wednesday morning, ambulances cut through a swarm of millions of people who had gathered in the city of Prayagraj. They ferried dozens of people to hospitals, some who had been trampled to death.Local officials moved to resume the rites at the Maha Kumbh Mela, relying on thousands of “A.I.-powered” video cameras. Soon, the faithful were doing what they came for: bathing at the confluence of three rivers considered sacred, one of them mythical. A helicopter showered rose petals on seers leading the holy dip.Officials had studied stampedes at earlier iterations of the festival. But as prepared and equipped as they seemed to be, they did not release even an initial death toll for nearly 15 hours after the tragedy.What they kept releasing was good news: regular updates on how many people had completed the bathing ritual.ImageA police official and paramilitary personnel urging Hindu devotees who have completed the rituals to leave, a day after a stampede.Credit...Deepak Sharma/Associated PressThank you for your patience while we verify access.
