In 2016 during his first presidential run, he said of the EPA: \"We are going to get rid of it in almost every form\" and leave \"little tidbits\" in operation.During his first term, the EPA faced considerable restructuring and budget cuts, and many of its regulatory roles were scaled back.Over his own four years in office Biden has tightened environmental limits, including pollution standards for cars and light trucks aimed at reducing carbon emissions.The outgoing Democrat also introduced regulations aimed at reducing industry emissions of planet-warming methane and toxic mercury.Trump has long suggested that if elected his administration would take a hatchet to Biden's more restrictive environmental policies.Zeldin thanked Trump on X, saying he will work to \"restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs... while protecting access to clean air and water.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
