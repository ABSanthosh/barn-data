  "text": "Thomas Massie criticized Trump's Iran attack; the President attacked him scathingly. While the MAGA is massively split over Donald Trump's decision to attack Iran, the president Sunday targeted Kentucky Rep Thomas Massie and said MAGA should drop him. “Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky is not MAGA, even though he likes to say he is,” Trump wrote. “Actually, MAGA doesn’t want him, doesn’t know him, and doesn’t respect him. He is a negative force who almost always Votes ‘NO,’ no matter how good something may be. He’s a simple minded ‘grandstander’ who thinks it’s good politics for Iran to have the highest level Nuclear weapon, while at the same time yelling ‘DEATH TO AMERICA’ at every chance they get.”After Trump announced the successful strike of the US Air Force on Iran and the destruction of the nuclear facilities, Massie denounced it and wrote on X that it was not Constitutional. “It was a good week for the neocons in the military industrial complex who want war all the time,” Massie said on CBS. He added, “What happens when Israel gets bombed again? Is Trump going to sit by and say, no, we’re not going to further engage in this war?”“MAGA should drop this pathetic LOSER, Tom Massie, like the plague!” Trump wrote. “The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I’ll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard. MAGA is not about lazy, grandstanding, nonproductive politicians, of which Thomas Massie is definitely one.”On CBS, Massie appeared with Democrat Ro Khanna and said it was a \"good week for the neocons and the military-industrial complex, who want war all the time\".. Massie said his “side of the MAGA base” is made up of “non-interventionists\" who are \"tired from all these wars.\"Massie and Ro Khanna on June 17 had introduced a resolution to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war without Congressional approval.",
