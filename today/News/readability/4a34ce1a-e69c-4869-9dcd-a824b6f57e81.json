  "text": "“I grew up thinking that romantic love was the ultimate goal to strive for and achieving that was the only true prize in life that mattered,” says Emilia Vuorisalmi, an acclaimed Finnish doctor and self-confessed “love addict”. “I came from a family where my father rode bare-chested on a white horse to go and woo my mother. She, in turn, sacrificed everything to live with him in the countryside and they were together until her death. Our family was open-hearted, passionate, and everything revolved around love.”Given that Brontë-esque example as Dr Vuorisalmi’s blueprint, it’s hardly surprising that as a teenager growing up in the Finnish countryside, then later a medical student in Helsinki, the beautiful blonde was hard-wired to seek romance.But instead of it being like in the movies, or fairy tales, where couples live “happily ever after”, she discovered love could be messy, painful, addictive – and sometimes unhealthy.Dr Vuorisalmi came to realise that hormones were playing a huge role in her behaviour, and particularly dopamine, the “pleasure” hormone that’s responsible for motivation, mood and focus. In some of us – such as Dr Vuorisalmi – dopamine, which also affects how other hormones work, is more dominant. We crave and seek pleasure harder, essentially – in whatever form we find the “reward”. In her case it was love, romance and sex.“Being naturally competitive (which I now realise is because I am ‘dopamine dominant’) I was drawn to medicine – that was what bright, able students did – but in reality it wasn’t like the TV shows I’d grown up on like ER. I never felt it was using my real talents, and I was restless.”The relationship cycleDr Vuorisalmi ended up marrying an actor in her late 20s and had her first baby, a daughter, in 2005. “We went to live in LA for my husband’s work, which I loved. But the marriage failed after a couple of years because we ended up spending a lot of time apart, inevitably growing apart. I returned back to the dark winters of my homeland in Finland, now practically a single mum with a young child. The fun had gone and my life felt in free fall.”Dr Vuorisalmi then treated her unhappiness by doing what many of us may recognise in ourselves – she threw herself into a new relationship with a new man she met, a friend of a friend.“I fell totally, completely in love and it was incredibly intense for a few months, like a drug or an obsession because it was such a dopamine spike,” explains the now 45-year-old doctor. “I felt he was The One and we were meant to be.”When that relationship ended after five months, Dr Vuorisalmi was left heartbroken. When her attempts to “win him back” failed, her mental health was in a worse state even than it had been after her divorce. And soon too was her physical health.“Once that dopamine high (from the romance) had crashed below the baseline, and my feelings of uncertainty and fear of loneliness were ramping stress levels high, I became incredibly anxious and developed such agonising backache I could barely leave the house.“I found myself screaming on the floor in physical pain. I was so heartbroken. Painkillers didn’t help and I didn’t want to take sleep medication as I knew it was highly addictive.  It was like that phase of a break-up where every song on the radio was “our song”, every car I saw seemed to bear his initials on it. It was like it was in my head; I couldn’t escape it – or him.”Once again “the cure” came in the form of another new romance, and then another. “I would repeat the pattern and go through all the highs and lows time and again. I felt alive and energised with a new romance and, for a while, the ripple effect was that my life had a new sense of direction.”Then, when a fling crashed and burned, “my life felt empty and boring without a  man in it”, she admits.Aged 39, Dr Vuorisalmi had a second child, but split from his father after two and a half years, when their son (now six) was 18 months old.Dr Vuorisalmi pinpoints three hormones you need to work to balance to take control of addictive behaviours that may be forming - Olga Poppius“This repetitive pattern of using love to cure a break-up was so destructive on my nervous system, I now realise it was ‘emotional burnout’.When love turns toxic“I was forever chasing the risks, the thrills and the novelty that new romances gave me – but the high never lasted. I fell in love with falling in love, always searching for a new man. I craved everything: the sex, the touch, the dates. Love, for me, had become toxic.”Ultimately, the doctor knew change was needed. “I was a love addict, and like any addiction, it would not end happily unless I got to the root of it and conquered it.” Her medical training meant she could examine her addiction – so common with so many people – from a scientific point of view.Dr Vuorisalmi’s latest book, The Healing Power of Hormones, is the result of 12 years of research into neurochemicals which, she says, ignite our nervous system, informing how we think, feel and behave. Once we understand how these three brain chemicals or “love hormones” – dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin – actually affect all areas (and not just our love lives), transforming them to work in harmony “is where the magic in life starts”, she promises.The scienceBesides their leading roles in romantic love, these three hormones also work as “neuromodulators”, meaning they are chemicals in the brain that also manage how other hormones work.Dr Vuorisalmi explains: “Think of your brain as a complex network, like a bustling city. In this city, the traffic (the messages from and to your brain) is constantly moving along roads (neural pathways) to deliver information from one place (neuron) to another. In a city, traffic flow isn’t just controlled by the cars and roads themselves; there are traffic lights, signs and signals that tell cars when to go, stop or slow down. These are the neuromodulators.”She adds: “Neuromodulators don’t send messages on their own, but they influence how messages are sent, received and processed, by turning the volume up or down. This way they help regulate everything from your mood to stress response – ensuring your brain’s messaging system works efficiently.“I now see dopamine as the hormone of ‘direction’, and looking back at the lowest time of my life, it’s now clear that I had indeed very much lost my direction. I needed to get back to my path of purpose to get my dopamine levels in sustainable balance (and stop chasing the highs). I was relying on other people to fill my life with a sense of meaning and their touch to calm my restless mind.”“The problem is,” she warns, “we become hooked on easy access, quick- fix dopamine and soon crave more – and need more to reach the same level. During the lows we feel empty and from that void addictive behaviour can stem. You feel fatigued and low in energy, and it’s hard for you to stay motivated and engaged in life. Then our bodies can even feel stiff and in pain due to levels crashing and our minds unfocused – which is exactly why I found myself crying on the floor that night.”Dr Vuorisalmi pinpoints the three hormones you need to work to balance to take control of addictive behaviours that may be forming.1. DopamineDr Vuorisalmi likens dopamine – the chemical messenger and hormone which creates an anticipation of pleasure – to the “risk taker that loves standing on the edge and exploring new possibilities”. It’s crucial for motivation, not just for the everyday things like getting up and going to work, but to drive us towards our purpose in life too.“Peak experiences” of dopamine are situations where the hormone levels spike. Examples include sex, getting a promotion or winning a marathon. But often afterwards, she warns, we’re left feeling somewhat empty. Which can then make us crave another reward.In the Finnish doctor’s case, she had begun eternally seeking it out from “unsustainable, even toxic sources, ie different romances with men”, she admits. For other people, of course, the rewards vary.“Most things that give us pleasure (such as food, alcohol, video games or sex) are all things that flood our brains with dopamine, so we develop unconscious patterns and habits to seek and reward ourselves,” she says.It’s good to start being aware of your own early signals of when your dopamine level might be tipping too heavily.“Often for me, the first sign of imbalance was my screen time beginning to spin out of control,” says Dr Vuorisalmi. “Constantly checking my phone for messages from the object of my desire. It’s like when you might find simply being has become almost impossible.”How to fix an imbalanceWhen we have a healthy dopamine “baseline”, we have enough dopamine circulating in our system, making us motivated and well. Meaning drives dopamine, and discovering what your true values are and taking steps towards a life aligned with them is the path to building a healthy dopamine system and creating inner sources of peace. The hard questions to find the answers to are what brings you joy? What gives you purpose in life?According to science, our dopamine systems have the capability to reset themselves by taking a 30-day break from the thing we have become reliant on – from sugar and social media to love. But you should notice a difference after two weeks. In the meantime these tips will help:Eat nutrient-dense food – focusing on whole grains, vegetables, fruits (berries), lean proteins, fermented food, herbs and spices and healthy fats.Prioritise sleep – limit exposure to screens which disrupts your wake/sleep cycle, avoid caffeine before bed and during the first hour after waking up, and consider taking vitamin B6, magnesium, glycinate and L-theanine which can all help us wind down.Try to get morning sunlight in the first 30 minutes after waking up and avoid blue light during night time; try walking without listening to music.Avoid ‘dopamine piling’ by scrolling phones while watching a film.Find an exercise you enjoy and want to regularly do.If meditation doesn’t suit you, try an app or yoga nidra or Tai Chi.Cold swimming boosts your dopamine levels and helps to balance your arousal level.Break up with your phone – put a sticky note on it to deter yourself from picking it up.2. SerotoninDopamine and serotonin are two sides of the same coin. Serotonin also acts as a neuromodulator, meaning it not only sends signals from one neuron to another, but also influences the overall tone (or mood) of the brain and is responsible for long-lasting feelings of wellbeing.“Serotonin is dopamine’s counterpart – it’s about safety, familiarity and feeling valued, like a protective shield,” says Dr Vuorisalmi. When we feel safe, our body shifts from fight-or-flight to a state of rest-and-digest, which is essential for repair and healing.So serotonin is crucial for our wellbeing, hence it’s nicknamed the “happy hormone”. It also regulates sleep and modulates our appetite. As she explains in the book: “When our serotonin levels are not balanced, it causes leaks in our energy. We might feel more anxious, or low, so it can prevent us from enjoying our lives wholeheartedly. For example, you might not leave your soul-sucking job as you fear losing the guaranteed income. Or stay in a withered relationship fearing you can’t afford to live alone.”Dr Vuorisalmi, for example, explains that when she felt off kilter in her own life (with a serotonin imbalance), she was craving that security through her relationships.“My relationship with my ex-boyfriend felt strong initially but over time I found myself living in hell. My fear of losing my freedom and his fear of abandonment brought out the worst in both of us. He would control me, restrict me from seeing people and the verbal abuse was excruciating. I found myself screaming and fighting like an animal – and then that became ‘normal’.”In the end, the doctor and her ex gravitated towards both their fears, in that she ended up losing her freedom and he was abandoned.How to fix an imbalanceWorking on our fears, traumas and self-worth is crucial for long-lasting and sustainable serotonin balance, says Dr Vuorisalmi. It’s common to see an imbalance result in unhealthy relationships but it can also present in other ways, such as struggling with weight issues, feeling trapped in work and having no money. For immediate serotonin support – and, crucially, shifting your nervous system from fear to safety – Dr Vuorisalmi offers the following tips:Spending just six minutes in nature improves our mental health.When practical, walk in bare feet – yes it sounds mad but touching the soil connects us to the earth and supports our skin’s microbiome.Pre and probiotics are live bacteria that really do support our digestive health – look for fibrous foods that provide them, or consider supplements. Try to eat slowly and mindfully.Limit alcohol consumption (as alcohol negatively affects serotonin levels and it increases an inflammatory response).Physical activity boosts serotonin and improves sleep.Use your body to calm your mind – whether through meditation or breathing (it’s worth trying apps for this).3. Oxytocin“Oxytocin is a hormone released naturally when we are in physical contact – even a cuddle with a pet can release it,” says Dr Vuorisalmi.“Oxytocin is mainly produced in the hypothalamus in the brain and is secreted into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland through things such as physical touch, positive interactions and emotional intimacy,” she adds.It acts as a “master regulator” of other key hormones, sitting on top of the “survival hormones” – cortisol, insulin and adrenalin – which help the body respond to stress and threats. And under the survival hormones we have our sex hormones (such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone) in charge of reproductive health and overall wellbeing. Recent studies propose that oxytocin can also lead to an increase of dopamine in the brain. Oxytocin interacts with serotonin pathways in the brain, contributing to a sense of safety and connection.“The relation between oxytocin and other hormones is complex,” admits Dr Vuorisalmi. “But it coordinates these different hormone systems, ensuring they work in harmony to maintain overall physiological balance.”The hormone’s “dark side”, she explains, “is when it doesn’t come from sustainable sources”. “That’s when we can feel lonely and cling to everything hoping for connection. This can be material things, a new purse, or a relationship. When our levels aren’t balanced, life can feel lonely, unfair and heavy.How to fix an imbalancePracticing gratitude, connecting to our true selves is the key. But the immediate ways to support it are:Strengthen the bond with your partner; oxytocin plays a significant role in our sex life (it’s the feeling that washes over us after orgasm) and emotions. Skin-to-skin contact, spending quality time together, being mindfully affectionate with eye contact and sincere complimentsTake a warm bath or sauna.Practice micro-moments of connection – smile at the cashier, chat with a neighbour, watch the sunrise or sunset.Try a digital detox – disconnecting from our digital lives and being with others helps make us feel we belong and matter in real life.The Healing Power of Hormones by Dr Emilia Vuorisalmi is published on January 23Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Serotonin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDopamine and serotonin are two sides of the same coin. Serotonin also acts as a neuromodulator, meaning it not only sends signals from one neuron to another, but also influences the overall tone (or mood) of the brain and is responsible for long-lasting feelings of wellbeing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Serotonin is dopamine’s counterpart – it’s about safety, familiarity and feeling valued, like a protective shield,” says Dr Vuorisalmi. When we feel safe, our body shifts from fight-or-flight to a state of rest-and-digest, which is essential for repair and healing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo serotonin is crucial for our wellbeing, hence it’s nicknamed the “happy hormone”. It also regulates sleep and modulates our appetite. As she explains in the book: “When our serotonin levels are not balanced, it causes leaks in our energy. We might feel more anxious, or low, so it can prevent us from enjoying our lives wholeheartedly. For example, you might not leave your soul-sucking job as you fear losing the guaranteed income. Or stay in a withered relationship fearing you can’t afford to live alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr Vuorisalmi, for example, explains that when she felt off kilter in her own life (with a serotonin imbalance), she was craving that security through her relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My relationship with my ex-boyfriend felt strong initially but over time I found myself living in hell. My fear of losing my freedom and his fear of abandonment brought out the worst in both of us. He would control me, restrict me from seeing people and the verbal abuse was excruciating. I found myself screaming and fighting like an animal – and then that became ‘normal’.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the doctor and her ex gravitated towards both their fears, in that \u003cem\u003eshe \u003c/em\u003eended up losing her freedom and \u003cem\u003ehe \u003c/em\u003ewas abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to fix an imbalance\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking on our fears, traumas and self-worth is crucial for long-lasting and sustainable serotonin balance, says Dr Vuorisalmi. It’s common to see an imbalance result in unhealthy relationships but it can also present in other ways, such as struggling with weight issues, feeling trapped in work and having no money. For immediate serotonin support – and, crucially, shifting your nervous system from fear to safety – Dr Vuorisalmi offers the following tips:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpending just six minutes in nature improves our mental health.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen practical, walk in bare feet – yes it sounds mad but touching the soil connects us to the earth and supports our skin’s microbiome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003ePre and probiotics are live bacteria that really do support our digestive health – look for fibrous foods that provide them, or consider supplements.

Oxytocin\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Oxytocin is a hormone released naturally when we are in physical contact – even a cuddle with a pet can release it,” says Dr Vuorisalmi.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Oxytocin is mainly produced in the hypothalamus in the brain and is secreted into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland through things such as physical touch, positive interactions and emotional intimacy,” she adds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt acts as a “master regulator” of other key hormones, sitting on top of the “survival hormones” – cortisol, insulin and adrenalin – which help the body respond to stress and threats. And under the survival hormones we have our sex hormones (such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone) in charge of reproductive health and overall wellbeing. Recent studies propose that oxytocin can also lead to an increase of dopamine in the brain. Oxytocin interacts with serotonin pathways in the brain, contributing to a sense of safety and connection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The relation between oxytocin and other hormones is complex,” admits Dr Vuorisalmi. “But it coordinates these different hormone systems, ensuring they work in harmony to maintain overall physiological balance.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hormone’s “dark side”, she explains, “is when it doesn’t come from sustainable sources”. “That’s when we can feel lonely and cling to everything hoping for connection. This can be material things, a new purse, or a relationship. When our levels aren’t balanced, life can feel lonely, unfair and heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to fix an imbalance\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePracticing gratitude, connecting to our true selves is the key.
