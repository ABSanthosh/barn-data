  "text": "The first vote of the conclave - the secretive process to choose a new pope - has failed to reach a decision. After a lengthy wait, black smoke emerged from the Sistine Chapel's chimney at around 9pm local time - meaning the 133 cardinals inside have not been able to choose a new pontiff. Crowds gathered in their tens of thousands in St Peter's Square for the first vote of conclave - the results of which took more than two hours to announce. Cardinals will return on Thursday morning to a closed-door Sistine Chapel for more rounds of voting. The BBC's Laura Gozzi was in Vatican City alongside the waiting crowds.
