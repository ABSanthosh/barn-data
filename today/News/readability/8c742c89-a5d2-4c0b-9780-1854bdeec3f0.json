Some in the audience applauded and gave a standing ovation when a new image of the rarely photographed Mr. Ocalan appeared on a screen.The rare message from Mr. Ocalan raised the possibility that a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people over four decades could finally end.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
