  "text": "LONDON — European leaders are straining to maintain a delicate diplomatic balance as attempts to reach a peace deal in Ukraine near a critical juncture, expressing full-throated backing for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky even as they try to edge him closer to accepting some of the controversial terms being pushed by President Donald Trump.French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, in particular, have backed Zelensky’s demands for an unconditional ceasefire, which Macron said this week the Kremlin “must accept.” To date, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who on Friday met for roughly three hours with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, has rejected a full truce.Europe also is supporting Zelensky’s insistence that a deal must include significant security guarantees for Ukraine. This steadfast support for Ukraine has given Kyiv, which is reluctant to set off a new round of tensions with Washington, some much-needed space to push back on the White House. The support comes even as Europe acknowledges privately that it will not be able to fully make up for U.S. support if the White House pulls the plug on Ukraine.Europe this week proposed a new set of terms to counter a U.S. proposal given to Ukraine last week, which had been described as the final U.S. offer for a deal. Those terms were widely viewed by Ukrainians and Europeans as heavily favoring Russia. The deal would have involved U.S. recognition of Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the handover to Moscow the areas it controls in exchange for stopping further attacks, as well as the immediately lifting of sanctions on Russia.European leaders, who were set to host high-level talks in London on Wednesday, before two of three top U.S. officials dropped out, added many different elements to the deal, including a full ceasefire to start and “robust security guarantees” specifically from the United States. Europe also wants frozen Russian assets to fund reconstruction in Ukraine and only the “gradual” lifting of sanctions on Moscow if the peace deal is honored.The details of both offers were first reported by Reuters on Friday. The Washington Post confirmed their accuracy with two officials briefed on negotiations.Europe’s counteroffer represents a broader fear across the continent that an unpredictable White House could suddenly cancel all support to Ukraine, sending Europe scrambling to help Ukraine stave off the Russian advance on its own. Despite widespread European support for Kyiv’s cause, Europe is not immediately able to replace the flow of all weaponry and intelligence that Ukraine needs to avoid major battlefield losses.Europe would especially struggle to replace U.S. air defense systems that are the most effective at intercepting Russian missiles, officials said. Ukraine is already without adequate supplies to defend its cities, as demonstrated in deadly attacks on Kyiv, Sumy, Kryvyi Rih and other major cities in recent weeks.For Europe and Ukraine, one Western official said, “it is not only reasonable but necessary to push back on some elements of the U.S. proposal, as it gives Ukraine practically very, very little. And Russia a lot.”European officials are trying to edge Washington toward a more reasonable agreement for Ukraine — and to sign onto the idea that a ceasefire is an essential first step. Calls for such a ceasefire were amplified after a Russian missile strike hit an apartment building in Kyiv on Thursday, killing at least 12 people.Britain’s Starmer has pushed back on Trump’s efforts to pin snags in the peace process on Ukraine, and he has refused to endorse any formal recognition of Crimea as Russian. Britain also announced Thursday a new round of sanctions on Russia, banning the transfer of energy software and even video game controllers that can be used to pilot drones.Mediators are struggling to keep the sides talking. On the Ukrainian side, the key requirements of any deal are strong security guarantees and minimizing any territorial concessions.“We’re trying to find a very very narrow landing strip here,” said one diplomat directly involved in discussions, who like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations. “We have to avoid a position where Ukrainian red lines are so breached they walk away. We think we’re getting there.”An official briefed on the talks said Ukraine is “worried about what the U.S. will do.” Europeans see Moscow’s influence on Washington and its tendency to make ancient territorial claims to justify modern military aggression as a looming threat. “Maybe it sounds like old fairy tale to some Americans, but here in Europe it means that Russia has not forgotten how to divide,” the official said. “Europeans help [Ukraine] a lot, but they are worried, too.”At the same time, Europeans are urging Zelensky to acknowledge the likelihood that Ukraine will have to give up territory as part of an accord. They made progress in that effort Wednesday, one official said.There is a growing sense among negotiators that Ukraine may be willing to endure effective Russian control of Crimea if Kyiv is not required to recognize it legally. Many Ukrainians do not want to rule out the possibility of retaking the territory, even in the distant future.But even such a compromise remains distasteful to Ukraine, which sees it as setting a dangerous precedent for Putin to expect eventual similar recognition for other Ukrainian regions he has illegally seized.The official briefed on the talks said Europe is trying to help “engage everyone with Trump normally … and speed up their military production, but it takes time.” He added that while U.S. support is necessary, it doesn’t mean that Ukraine will accede to Russian demands “because Americans are blackmailing that they won’t help.”But all sides are confronting the reality that sustaining the fight will be significantly harder without direct American support.“We urgently need to maintain and develop transatlantic solidarity and cooperation,” said Oleksandr Merezhko, a top Ukrainian parliamentarian. “From a geopolitical and geoeconomics standpoint, the U.S. is truly an indispensable country for Europe and Ukraine.”Still, many in Europe have warned that Washington is pursuing a “policy of appeasement.”To that end, a Kremlin aid on Friday said after Putin’s meeting with Witkoff that Moscow and Washington were “closer together, not only on Ukraine but also on a number of other international issues.” The aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters that the discussion centered in part on restarting direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, though there was no indication that would happen imminently.Witkoff’s team did not immediately provide a readout of the meeting. Trump declared on social media that “SUCCESS seems to be in the future!”Though support for Ukraine has cratered among many Republicans as Trump has tightened his control over the party, one GOP leader, Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), warned the president on Friday that Putin is “playing America as a patsy” — imploring him to enact “the toughest of sanctions” on the Russian leader.In Europe, some officials called for a more aggressive response to the terms Trump is pushing on Ukraine, which conservative German lawmaker Roderich Kiesewetter described as a “deed of surrender.”Gabrielius Landsbergis, a former foreign minister of Lithuania, said European countries should immediately launch new funding for weapons and license European weapons systems to Ukraine’s growing defense industry. He also called for the European Union to fast-track Ukraine’s application to join the body and set specific target dates.“We have to resist,” Landsbergis said. “If this offer really is take or leave it, we have to leave it.”On a bench outside his destroyed apartment in Kyiv on Thursday, Anton Dubyno, 34, sat with what little he had salvaged — his two cats, dog and computer — after a Russian missile struck the building next door, collapsing his walls. He watched rescue workers rush to pull victims from the rubble. By day’s end, 12 of his neighbors had been declared dead.Europeans should realize, Dubyno said, that if they don’t stop the war now, “this is going to be them in a couple of years.”O’Grady reported from Kyiv.
