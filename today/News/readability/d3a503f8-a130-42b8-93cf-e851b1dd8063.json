  "text": "Four months after his arrest on charges of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Luigi Mangione has now claimed in the court that he was tricked by the police into giving his DNA samples as he was offered food and a soda at the police station after his arrest. It was just a way to get Luigi Mangione's DNA samples as till then the police had nothing against him, Luigi's lawyer said in a new filing But why this sudden change in the legal strategy? Mangione's legal team is pushing to get rid of all evidence against Mangione. Mangione's attorney Thomas Dickey claimed that while cops were interrogating him, they gave him food which was a ploy to get his DNA samples. Dickey said the DNA samples were \"poisonous fruits\" as they were obtained illegally. They said the cops who approached Mangione on the morning of December 9, five days after Thompson was murdered, had no proper legal reason to do so, it was just a hunch. Cops called Mangione's personal notebook a manifesto: New defense strategyDickey claimed in the court that the cops illegally took his notebook and bag and then called it a 'manifesto'. Dickey said it was not fair to call Mangione's personal writing a manifesto. It was \"done solely for the purpose to prejudice (Mangione) and put him in a negative light before the public\". What's next?The DNA samples are crucial evidence in the case of Luigi Mangione in Pennsylvania where he faces charges of forgery, giving a fake ID to the police and possession of an unlicensed firearm. If the DNA evidence is cancelled, he would still face federal and New York state charges against him that include first-degree and second-degree murder.",
