  "text": "Ratan Tata, an Indian magnate who grew family business holdings into a sprawling empire spanning from tea to automakers to internet services, and made the Tata name synonymous with power and philanthropy that touched nearly facet of Indian life, died Oct. 9 at a hospital in Mumbai. He was 86.The death was announced by the Tata Group, where Mr. Tata started in the 1960s as shop floor apprentice in the family’s steel subsidiary. No cause was given, but the company issued a statement earlier in the week that Mr. Tata was being treated for “age-related” medical conditions.Mr. Tata and the conglomerate he led from 1991 to 2012 was seen as a crown jewel of India’s rising economic influence, and he drew cheers for using its muscle for what was dubbed “reverse colonialism” — acquiring some of the West’s most venerable brands.The Tata buying spree included nabbing famous names associated with the subcontinent’s former colonial ruler, Britain. Mr. Tata directed the takeover of tea giant Tetley in 2000, and the Jaguar and Land Rover lines, then owned by Ford, in 2008. A year earlier, Tata Group won a bidding war for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus.“I think globalization just made the availability of target companies that much bigger than they were in India,” he once said.In India, the company under Mr. Tata became such a fixture of everyday life that commerce, transportation, entertainment — and even morning tea — could carry the Tata stamp. Tata taxis and cars fill the country’s roads, and passengers travel between cities on Tata airlines.Tata telecom services power mobile phones and computers, and viewers can tune in channels on Tata’s satellite TV for cricket matches, movies and other programs. Tata Consultancy Services helped spearhead India’s IT outsourcing boom in the 2000s.Only rarely did Mr. Tata’s instincts fall short. He made the initial sketches of the Tata Nano, pushing his car company in 2009 to introduce the sub-$2,500 hatchback that he envisioned would become a “people’s car” for lower-income Indians, but sales never took off, and production was halted in 2018.In many ways, Mr. Tata became one of India’s most admired men precisely because he cut an unusual figure in the country’s freewheeling business landscape since the economy began to open with liberal reforms in the early 1990s. Compared to many of his peers atop the Indian business world, Mr. Tata lived modestly, spoke with self-effacing humility, was rarely tainted by rumors of corruption or scandal and avoided the appearance of overtly participating in politics.In 2010, however, leaked recordings revealed that Mr. Tata, like almost all Indian business tycoons, had in fact been lobbying politicians with payments. Mr. Tata managed to move past the scandal with his decades-long reputation mostly unscathed.Mr. Tata gave millions to education and health initiatives through his trusts, backing dozens of companies and groups in India. He said business moguls have an obligation to look 100 years ahead.“For instance, how can we deal with climate change and global warming, right now?” he told authors Sucheta Dalal and Debashis Basu for their book “Pathbreakers 2” (2008). “The effects of it may not be felt now; in fact, we may pay a price for it today, but it will help the generations to follow.”Another initiative, Goodfellows, sought to build cross-generational connections in business and other fields. At an event to launch the group in Mumbai in 2022, Mr. Tata hinted at the need to share knowledge. “You don’t mind getting old until you get old,” he said, “and you find it’s a difficult world.”Among the outpouring of tributes after his death was announced, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Mr. Tata as a “visionary business leader, compassionate soul and extraordinary human.” Mourners gathered in front of Mr. Tata’s Mumbai residence and on the lawn of the National Center for the Performing Arts in south Mumbai, where his casket was kept before the funeral.Ratan Naval Tata was born on Dec. 28, 1937, in what was then known as Bombay (now Mumbai) during British colonial rule.He was raised amid the wealth accumulated by the extended Tata family, members of the relatively small community of Parsis, the followers of the Zoroastrian religion who fled persecution in Persia centuries ago and resettled on India’s western coast. The Tatas amassed a fortune in the 19th century on textiles and opium trade with China. His father rose to become deputy chairman of family’s business networks.After his parents’ divorce, Mr. Tata and his brother were raised by their paternal grandmother in a Mumbai estate known as Tata Palace with servants and chauffeurs. He finished high school at New York’s Riverdale Country School and graduated in 1962 from Cornell University with a bachelor’s degree in architecture. (Mr. Tata later became one of Cornell’s largest international donors.) In 1975, he attended a management program at Harvard Business School.When Mr. Tata took over the Tata business portfolios in 1991 from a distant relative, J.R.D. Tata, the family was already one of India’s most renowned conglomerates, with holdings that included the famous Taj Mahal Hotel on the Mumbai waterfront, steel mills and power plants, the Tata Motors carmaker and the airline that would later be renamed Air India.In 2012, Mr. Tata resigned as group chairman, plunging the Tata clan — which had struggled to name heirs for decades — into a succession crisis that played out in the media and courts.Mr. Tata successful lobbied for his handpicked successor, Cyrus Mistry, whose family were major shareholders in the conglomerate. But their relationship gradually soured over disputes arising from Mistry’s business decisions, leading to Mistry’s ouster in 2016. Mr. Tata briefly returned to the chairman post as a new leader was sought.In 2017, the group’s board named Natarajan Chandrasekaran, a former Tata Consultancy Services employee, to be chairman, the first non-Parsi professional executive to assume the position. (Mistry sued, but India’s Supreme Court in 2021 ruled that his dismissal was legal.)Mr. Tata never married and had no children. His survivors include a brother.In a BBC interview that aired in 2000, journalist Karan Thapar asked Mr. Tata whether he was worried his company was falling behind competitors in the Indian system because “you don’t grease palms, that you don’t facilitate; is that often a burden?”“More than anything else, one is proud of that,” Mr. Tata replied. “Sometimes it is a problem … [but] I really would like to go to bed at night or wake up in the morning saying that we have not succumbed, and yet we’ve been successful.”",
