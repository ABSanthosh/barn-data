  "text": "At least nine people were killed Saturday in strikes on Gaza, authorities there said, as Israel continues to launch operations during its ceasefire with Hamas.Eight of the dead were killed in back-to-back strikes on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. They included seven humanitarian workers with the charity and one from the camp, according to the Al-Khair Foundation, a charity based in Britain and Turkey.At least 150 Palestinians have been killed in such strikes since the fragile truce took effect in mid-January, Hamas said Saturday, including 19 on Friday and Saturday.Israel has said it will continue to target individuals and actions that threaten it. Local news media and civil defense authorities in Gaza have reported the deaths of civilians, including women and children.The ceasefire was envisioned as a three-phase deal, but talks to extend it have stalled.The first phase, during which some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners were released, ended on March 1. The second is supposed to include the release of all living hostages still held by Hamas, Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and the end of the war, but the sides have yet to start negotiations.Nine people were killed in attacks by the Israel Defense Forces in northern Gaza, the health ministry said. Their bodies were taken to the Indonesian hospital.Mohammed Abu Hasna, director of the Al-Khair Foundation’s international offices, said humanitarian workers were opening camps for displaced Gazans when one of their vehicles was bombed. Two photographers, who were documenting the work, were killed.The organization sent another car to evacuate the survivors, Abu Hasna said, but “as soon as they got into the vehicle, they were targeted and all killed.” The dead included seven foundation workers and someone from the camp, he said.The IDF said it launched the first attack after “two terrorists were identified operating a drone that posed a threat to IDF troops.” It struck another group, it said, after “a number of additional terrorists collected the drone operating equipment and entered a vehicle.”Abu Hasna said “the claim that they pose a threat to the army” was “nonsense and unrealistic.”There were no restrictions on setting up camps in the area, he said, the foundation typically documents its work, and the IDF was at least four kilometers away.“This isn’t the first time they’ve targeted humanitarian workers and then leveled false accusations,” he said.Hamas called the attack a “dangerous escalation” that reflected Israel’s “insistence of continuing aggression” and “intention to renounce the ceasefire agreement.”Four boys were killed Friday in an Israeli strike in Gaza City, NBC News reported. Brothers Mahmoud Alerfan, 15, and Yusuf Alerfan, 13, and their friends Malik Althatha, 13, and Salim Hasnin, 15, had stepped outside to procure firewood for the evening meal to break the daily Ramadan fast.Umm Mahmoud Alerfan clutched her sons’ bodies and wailed: “I did not allow them outside, but today I did. Why did they come out today?”",
