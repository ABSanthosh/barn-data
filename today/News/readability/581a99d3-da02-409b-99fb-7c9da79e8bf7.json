  "text": "JAFFA, Israel — Israel on Monday ordered the evacuation of most of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, warning that the military is “returning to combat in great force” in the area, a day after the bodies of more than a dozen emergency personnel, missing for a week after responding to a strike, were recovered from a mass grave in the city.Over the past week, the Israeli military has pushed back into Rafah, launching air and artillery strikes, sending troops into several neighborhoods and forcing Palestinians who had recently returned under a ceasefire to flee once again, according to residents who escaped the bombardments and gunfire.The evacuation order Monday was the largest since Israel resumed military operations in Gaza nearly three weeks ago, covering swaths of Rafah that, while mostly destroyed, hosted many families who returned during a two-month ceasefire that began in January. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee directed Palestinians toward Mawasi in western Gaza, an Israeli-designated “humanitarian zone” that many Rafah residents had left just weeks ago.Israel has long seen the control of Rafah, which sits on the border with Egypt, as crucial to stemming the flow of weapons and goods to Hamas, the militant group that ruled Gaza before the war. But Israeli leaders have also warned of plans to expand operations across the territory, including a much larger ground campaign that could culminate in the long-term occupation of Gaza.The Washington Post spoke to eight residents who recently fled Rafah and described harrowing scenes as intensive strikes began in the city late on March 22, days after Israel broke a two-month ceasefire with Hamas and unleashed strikes that killed more than 400 people in a single night on March 18.“They bombed the house right in front of us,” said Sanaa Abu Taha, 42, who was staying in the rubble of her home in the Saudi neighborhood of Rafah before fleeing on March 23. “Three people on our street were killed. … The shooting did not stop.”Amid the chaos of the first night, the Palestine Red Crescent Society dispatched two ambulances to the scene of a strike in Rafah’s Hashashin area shortly before 4 a.m. on March 23, according to PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh.The dispatchers soon lost contact with one of the ambulances, she said, and paramedics in the other vehicle were sent to search for their missing colleagues. Not long afterward, they relayed what they saw: The ambulance was found near vehicles belonging to the United Nations and Gaza’s civil defense. The paramedics had been shot and were wounded, Farsakh said, and PRCS dispatched two more ambulances to retrieve the injured.The organization also lost contact with those ambulances, but not before one of the medics briefly called the dispatch center and Israeli forces could be heard speaking in the background, Farsakh said.For days, the paramedics were missing, along with a team from Gaza’s civil defense and a staffer with the U.N. But on Sunday, the PRCS, the civil defense force and the U.N. all said they had recovered their colleagues’ bodies in a mass grave in Rafah, including eight paramedics, six civil defense workers and one U.N. staff member. In a statement, PRCS called the incident a “massacre.”“They were killed in their uniforms. Driving their clearly marked vehicles. Wearing their gloves. On their way to save lives,” Jonathan Whittall, head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza and the West Bank, wrote on X.He described the efforts to find the teams, including on the first of day of Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. “This should never have happened,” Whittall wrote.In a statement, the IDF said its forces opened fire at vehicles after they “advanced suspiciously toward the troops … eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.” The IDF said an initial investigation found that “some” of the vehicles had been ambulances and fire trucks. It did not provide evidence of the claim that militants were in the convoy and did not respond when asked why the first responders were buried in a mass grave.The IDF also said that the vehicles were moving “without prior coordination,” though Adraee, the military spokesman, published an evacuation order for the area on his X account several hours after the incident. Farsakh said the area was not a “red zone” when the ambulances were dispatched, as it is the organization’s policy to generally not send first responders to closed military areas where coordination is needed.“We demand answers and justice,” U.N. humanitarian affairs chief Tom Fletcher said Monday.Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. It launched the war in response to the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, a rampage that killed about 1,200 people.Hamas and allied militants also took 251 hostages into Gaza, some of whom are still in captivity. The IDF said Saturday that its “troops located and recovered findings associated with the body of” Menachem Godard, who was killed on Oct. 7, 2023. The IDF said the remains were found in “an outpost area in Rafah” belonging to Islamic Jihad, a Hamas ally.Residents said that as they fled Rafah last week, they were being fired on by the Israeli military or seeing the bodies of people who were shot along the evacuation routes. “It was like a video game,” said Mustafa Jabar, 36, who said he saw more than 10 bodies on the ground as he fled the Saudi neighborhood with his extended family on March 23.Haroun al-Karnab, 29, said “the gunfire was random” as he evacuated from Rafah’s Tel al-Sultan neighborhood the same day, adding that it did not appear that Israeli troops were clashing with militants. In his post on X, Whittall said he and his team “witnessed a woman shot in the back of the head” as they were traveling to the area where the paramedics were buried. “When a young man tried to retrieve her, he too was shot.”In a statement, the military denied firing on civilians leaving Rafah, saying that it “completely rejects the claims.”“The IDF allows the civilian population to evacuate from combat zones in the Gaza Strip to protect noncombatant civilians,” it said.Rafah residents said that the IDF dropped leaflets and sent text messages with an evacuation route but that they had little notice, could take few if any belongings and were fearful of the path provided. The IDF route directed Palestinians to a makeshift checkpoint and inspection cameras set up near an abandoned U.N. warehouse.Haya Abu Labda, 25, said she lost her brother-in-law, 15-year-old Mustafa, in the mayhem of the evacuation. The family had split up because her husband wanted to wait with his grandmother, she said. Neighbors later said they saw Mustafa lying on the ground, shot dead, near a military checkpoint. He had a cart carrying some food and clothes, and it appeared he had taken a route not designated by the IDF, Abu Labda said.With no belongings and nowhere to go, the extended Abu Labda family has fled to Mawasi, which they left only weeks ago.“Until this moment, I still cannot believe what happened,” she said.Harb reported from London. Farouk Mahfouz reported from Cairo.",
