It inspired the Disney castle logo after Walt Disney visited in the 1950s.Bavarian state premier Markus Soeder described the designation as a \"worldwide accolade,\" calling Neuschwanstein \"Bavaria's landmark par excellence.\"\"For our fairy-tale castles, a fairy tale comes true,\" he said in a statement.Neuschwanstein combined great art and culture and also a bit of \"kitsch and cliché,\" he said.\"When seeing the castle, some people worldwide may think of Disney - but no: Neuschwanstein is and remains the original from Bavaria.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",
