  "text": "Palestinians' return on hold as Israel accuses Hamas of breaching truce dealRushdi AbualoufBBC News Gaza correspondentReporting fromIstanbulEPAPalestinians have been waiting on the Al Rashid road, west of the Nuseirat refugee camp, to return to the northern Gaza StripThousands of displaced Palestinians have been prevented from returning to their homes in the north of the Gaza Strip, after Israel blocked a main road, accusing Hamas of breaching the terms of the ceasefire deal.The dispute came after Hamas released four Israeli female soldiers - and Israel freed 200 Palestinian prisoners.But the Israeli government said Gazans would not be allowed to travel north until plans were in place for the release of Israeli civilian Arbel Yehud. Hamas has insisted that she is alive and will be freed next week. According to the deal, Hamas was to release civilians before soldiers. On Saturday evening, as crowds gathered along al-Rashid road in central Gaza to return home, gunshots were reportedly fired.Reuters news agency, citing the Hamas-run health ministry, and Palestinian media reported one person had been killed and some injured.Four gunshots can be heard in a video reportedly of the incident that was posted online. BBC Verify has authenticated the location of footage, but the BBC has not been able to independently verify reports of a casualty.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops in central Gaza had fired shots after \"several gatherings of dozens of suspects were identified who posed a threat to the forces\".\"Contrary to reports emerging in recent hours, all of the shooting in the area was carried out for the purpose of distancing and not aimed at harm. We emphasise that as of this stage, no injuries to the suspects are known to have occurred as a result of the shooting.\"'My beauty, you're home': Israeli women soldiers reunited with familiesWhat we know about the ceasefire dealEarlier on Saturday, Muhammad Emad Al-Din was one of the thousands waiting to return home to northern Gaza.\"I know my house might be destroyed, but I'll pitch a tent over its remains. I just want to go back,\" he told the BBC over the phone.\"I need to reclaim my work. I am a barber in Gaza, and I've been trying to figure out how to repair the damage to my salon and restart my business. I've become indebted to so many people, and I can't afford to buy the simplest things for my children,\" he added.\"All I wish for is for this dispute between Hamas and Israel to end and for us to be allowed to move back to our homes in the north. We haven't seen our loved ones for more than 15 months.\"The Netzarim Corridor is a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the territory.Lubna Nassar arrived with her two daughters and son on a donkey cart in the afternoon, hoping to return to her home and reunite with her husband, Sultan, whom she has not seen in 11 months.\"I will stay here, as close as possible to the Israeli checkpoint. For months, my daughters have been waiting for the moment to meet their father. I want to be among the first to return to Gaza,\" she said.Bring Them Home NowHamas has insisted that Arbel Yehud is alive and will be freed next weekQatari and Egyptian mediators are making progress in their efforts to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return back to the north.But Israeli tanks are still blocking the coastal road where people were supposed to walk into the north.The Israelis have asked the mediators for proof of life from Hamas for Ms Yehud, and it seems that Hamas has given this to the Egyptians.Four female Israeli soldiers taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023 were released on Saturday as part of the ceasefire agreement which also saw 200 Palestinian prisoners freed.Meanwhile, many Gazans watch anxiously for any breakthrough that could allow them to return.For many, the hope of returning outweighs the reality of what awaits them - ruins and destruction.Yet the dream of reclaiming their lives, rebuilding their homes and reuniting with their families are keeping their spirits alive.Watch: West Bank celebrations as freed Palestinian prisoners returnWatch: Emotional reunions as Israeli hostages released by Hamas",
