  "text": "Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (File photo)A senior Israeli official has indicated that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could become a direct target, as Israel intensifies its campaign against Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the unnamed official said assassination of Iran’s top leader is \"not off limits,\" underlining a dramatic escalation in Israel’s strategic posture. The statement signals a shift from solely targeting Iran’s nuclear program to potentially dismantling the regime’s leadership structure.The official claimed that Israel’s recent strikes have already inflicted substantial damage, including at the heavily fortified Natanz enrichment facility, where structural collapse was reported. Israel has also taken responsibility for the assassinations of nine nuclear scientists and several high-ranking military officers in recent months.Additional strikes are expected soon, as part of the ongoing Israeli offensive known as 'Operation Rising Lion'. Meanwhile, Iran’s counter-offensive, 'Operation True Promise III' entered a new phase on Saturday with another wave of missile attacks launched toward Israeli territory.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the attack, stating: \"A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel. Defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.\" Sirens sounded across major cities, including Tel Aviv, as authorities activated emergency protocols.In response, Israeli warplanes struck targets in Tehran overnight, further intensifying a rapidly escalating confrontation that threatens to engulf the region.Addressing the nation earlier, Supreme Leader Khamenei vowed retribution: “We will not permit them to evade consequences for this significant wrongdoing they have perpetrated,” he said in a televised speech.The escalating exchange has raised global concerns, particularly over the potential targeting of political leaders and the vulnerability of deeply buried nuclear facilities. Despite doubts about Israel’s capacity to fully dismantle Iran’s nuclear program, the official insisted the current strikes had already \"set back Iran’s capabilities significantly.\"",
