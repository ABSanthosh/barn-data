An Israeli military vehicle on Sunday near the border with Gaza in southern Israel.Credit...Ariel Schalit/Associated PressMay 18, 2025Updated 4:56 p.m. ETThe Israeli military announced on Sunday that its forces had begun “extensive ground operations” throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip, advancing its plan to move farther into the enclave and seize more land in an intensified campaign aimed at pressuring Hamas amid negotiations for a cease-fire.At the same time, the Israeli government said it would allow “a basic quantity of food” to enter Gaza. The announcement comes 11 weeks after it halted the entry of all goods and humanitarian assistance in an attempt to force Hamas into accepting a temporary extension of an earlier cease-fire deal that had expired. President Trump has been clear about the need to avert a looming famine in Gaza and some Israeli military officials had privately concluded that Palestinians there faced widespread starvation unless aid deliveries were restored soon.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office explained the abrupt reversal in Israeli policy as an “operational need to enable the expansion of the military operation to defeat Hamas,” adding in a statement that the military had recommended the step.The statement did not say exactly when the resumption of aid would begin, or how or where it would be distributed. Plans for a new American-backed system for distributing aid meant to bypass Hamas have not yet been put into action. Details about the renewed offensive were also scarce, and it was not immediately clear how far the Israeli forces would go at this stage, or which areas of Gaza would be most affected.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
