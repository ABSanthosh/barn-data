  "text": "Here’s the latest.Hours after three Israeli women were released from captivity in Gaza on Sunday, roughly 90 Palestinian prisoners were freed, Israel’s prison service said in a statement early Monday morning, as a long-awaited cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas went into effect. The truce prompted celebrations in Gaza and hope for an end to a devastating 15-month war.Al Jazeera, the Qatar-funded Arabic broadcaster, streamed footage of Red Cross buses ferrying prisoners out of Ofer prison near Jerusalem after midnight on Monday, hours after Israel released videos of emotional reunions between the released hostages and their families at a hospital. Sunday’s closely watched exchanges, involving mostly women and minors, were the first of a series of such paired exchanges scheduled over the next six weeks as part of the cease-fire agreement. Thirty-three of the roughly 100 remaining hostages in Gaza, living and dead, are to be released and exchanged for more than 1,000 imprisoned Palestinians held in Israel.In videos released by the Israeli military, the three women released on Sunday — identified as Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher — can be seen walking under their own power as they are handed over from the Red Cross to Israeli troops, and then embracing family members at an Israeli hospital. One hostage, Ms. Damari, has a bandaged left hand, and in a photo later posted online by the military, she appears to have lost two fingers.As the truce took effect on Sunday morning, joyful Palestinians honked car horns and blasted music in the central Gaza city of Deir al Balah, where celebratory gunfire rang out and children ran around in the streets.And as Israeli officers said their forces had begun to withdraw from parts of Gaza, including two towns north of Gaza City, Hamas sought to signal that it was still standing and moving to reassert control in the territory, with masked gunmen taking to the streets in cities devastated by months of war.Achieving the agreement on a delicate, multistage cease-fire required months of talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. The start of an initial, six-week phase on Sunday was delayed by almost three hours, to 11:15 a.m. local time, after Israel said it had not formally received the names of the first three hostages to be released. During the delay, the Israeli military continued striking targets in Gaza.Here’s what we’re covering:Hostage and prisoner releases: As the Gaza cease-fire took hold, one aspect of the agreement was strikingly lopsided: the number of hostages released compared with the number of freed prisoners. Further exchanges will likely follow a similar formula, with tens of Palestinians freed from prisons in Israel for each hostage held in the Gaza Strip. Israeli governments have long been determined to bring back captured civilians and soldiers, including dead ones, even at steep costs. Read more ›Hamas reasserts control: Armed Hamas fighters returned to the streets of Gaza and the Hamas-run police force, whose uniformed officers had all but disappeared to avoid Israeli attacks, said that it was deploying personnel across the territory to “preserve security and order,” according to the government media office. Read more ›Gaza’s destruction: The start of the cease-fire capped a 470-day war that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians and injured more than 110,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Much of Gaza has been destroyed, and most of its roughly two million people have been displaced at least once by the war. “The weight on my chest has lifted,” said Ziad Obeid, a Gazan civil servant displaced several times during the war. “We have survived.” Read more ›Humanitarian aid: United Nations trucks carrying humanitarian supplies began entering Gaza just 15 minutes after the cease-fire took effect, according to Jonathan Whittall, the head of the U.N. humanitarian office for the Palestinian territories. The cease-fire deal calls for 600 trucks to be allowed to bring aid to Gazans daily, although it was not clear how the supplies would be distributed. Read more ›Next phase: Israel and Hamas reached the cease-fire agreement in part by putting off their most intractable disputes until a nebulous “second phase” that neither side is sure it will reach. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza and hold high-profile prisoners. The Israeli government will then likely have to choose whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. Read more ›The release of the 90 Palestinian prisoners appeared to conclude the first of a harrowing series of hostage-for-prisoner swaps over the course of the 42-day truce. Israelis and Palestinians alike are already anticipating the next exchange on Saturday, when four Israeli hostages are expected to be freed for more Palestinian prisoners. In the meantime, Gazans and many Israelis — particularly the families of hostages — are hoping for the fragile deal to hold.The families of Palestinian prisoners caught their first glimpse of the Red Cross buses carrying their loved ones nearly two hours past midnight. Some were holding necklaces made of red and white flowers — colors of the Palestinian flag — while others bore jackets and scarfs for the returning detainees. They did not know in what condition the prisoners would return, given what rights groups and former prisoners have described as increasingly harsh conditions in Israeli prisons.

In a text message, Fares said he had received assurances from Hamas officials that the militant group would seek to condition the next exchange on a simultaneous hostage-for-prisoner swap.Hours after Hamas released the three women hostages, and they returned to joyous reunions with their families, Palestinians are still waiting for Israel to fulfill its side of the exchange: the release of 90 Palestinians, mostly women and minors, jailed for purported militancy or other national security offenses. Neither the Israeli authorities nor the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is expected to ferry the prisoners out by bus, have provided an explanation for the delay.Palestinians have gathered near Ofer prison outside Jerusalem to await their friends and loved ones. The Israeli military has threatened Palestinians in the West Bank not to participate in “riots and armed marches” celebrating the release. “Anyone who participates in such terrorist acts is putting himself in danger,” said Avichay Adraee, an Israeli military spokesman.What’s behind the uneven exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners?ImageIsraelis gathered to watch the release of the hostages on screens at a plaza known as Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Sunday.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesAs the Gaza cease-fire took hold, one aspect of the agreement was strikingly lopsided: Hamas released three Israeli women held in Gaza on Sunday, while Israel was expected to release 90 Palestinian women and minors held in its prisons later in the day.Further exchanges will likely follow a similar formula, with tens of Palestinians freed from prisons in Israel for each hostage held in the Gaza Strip by militants. Over the six-week first phase of the truce, Hamas is expected to release 33 captives and Israel is slated to free about 1,900 Palestinians.Such an uneven swap is not unusual. Israeli governments have long been determined to bring back captured civilians and soldiers, including dead ones, even at steep costs. The terms of such trades have often prompted fierce criticism domestically, much as a hostage release deal in November 2023 — part of an earlier cease-fire — did within Israel’s governing coalition.The exchange of civilian hostages for prisoners, including some whom Israel has accused of terrorism, has also raised the ire of some Israelis. In a statement celebrating the release of the three Israeli hostages on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, hinted at some of that underlying frustration, saying the latest trade was not “a true like-for-like exchange.”Two of the women were abducted from their homes and one from a music festival, and “then brutally held since,” he said. “This is a huge difference when compared to the terrorists who are being released.”Hamas officials have said one of the objectives of the group’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel was to win the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians jailed in Israel, many of them accused of violence against Israeli soldiers and civilians. Many Palestinians say such violence is legitimate resistance to Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and repeated military campaigns in Gaza. And many are also critical of Israel’s justice system, which they say falsely imprisons some Palestinians, including women and children.Yahya Sinwar, the former political chief of Hamas, who was an architect of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war, was intimately familiar with the formulas Israel has accepted in previous exchanges. He had spent years in an Israeli prison but was released in October 2011 along with more than 1,000 others as part of an exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid in 2006.Upon his release in 2011, Mr. Sinwar pledged “to work hard to free all prisoners, especially those who serve high sentences, whatever the price.” At the time, the lopsided trade raised questions of whether the exchange would encourage more abductions of Israelis.Israeli troops killed Mr. Sinwar three months ago in fighting in Gaza.ImagePalestinians overlooking Ofer prison ahead of the prisoners’ release, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Sunday.Credit...Laura Boushnak for The New York TimesThere were also earlier precedents for uneven trades. In 2003, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah exchanged a kidnapped former Israeli colonel and the bodies of three Israeli soldiers killed during a cross-border raid for more than 400 prisoners held in Israel and nearly 60 bodies.Almost two decades earlier, in 1985, the Israeli government traded more than 1,100 prisoners — including some convicted of perpetrating or masterminding attacks on Israelis — for three Israeli soldiers captured during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Some of the released prisoners eventually became senior militant leaders.During the last cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, a one-week truce in November 2023, Israel released roughly three prisoners — women and minors — for each hostage returned to Israel. Ultimately, Hamas freed about 100 hostages — including more than 20 who were not Israeli and were not included in the deal with Israel — in exchange for about 240 prisoners held by Israel.The ratio frustrated some critics in Israel, including some relatives of hostages, while other captives’ family members have demanded that Israel pay any price to bring people back. When Israeli soldiers accidentally killed three hostages in Gaza who had escaped their captors, Itzik Horn, whose adult sons were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, said Israel must immediately reach a deal to free all the captives, even if it means releasing Palestinians held in Israeli jails on terrorism charges.“Let them free all the Palestinian prisoners we have here, all the terrorists — what do I care?” Mr. Horn said more than a year ago. “The most important thing isn’t to defeat Hamas. The only victory here is to bring back all the hostages.” Mr. Horn’s sons are still being held captive.The families of hostages are split over this and other issues; a small minority have opposed a deal. The Tikva Forum, an Israeli group representing some captives’ families, opposed the latest cease-fire agreement. In a statement on Wednesday, when news of the deal emerged, the group said in a statement on social media that it objected to an agreement with Hamas, which it called “a terror organization that should be destroyed.”“This deal leaves dozens of hostages behind in Gaza,” the group said. “It also sets the stage for the next massacre and future kidnappings of Israelis.”Video released by the Israeli government showed the three hostages who returned from Gaza being reunited with members of their families at Sheba Hospital in Israel. In one clip, one of the returned hostages, Romi Gonen, is surrounded in an embrace by members of her family as they tearfully comfort one another. Her sister, Yarden Gonen, who had traveled around the world to lobby for Romi’s release over the last year, jumps up and down as the family embraces. In another clip, another released hostage, Doron Steinbrecher, tearfully embraces members of her family.The mood in the West Bank has been subdued all day as family and friends of the 90 Palestinians set to be released await news of their loved ones. Families of the prisoners have been warned by the Israeli government, which controls the West Bank, against any form of public celebration.Dr. Yael Frenkel Nir, director of the general hospital at Sheba Medical Center, which received the three hostages upon their return from captivity in Gaza, said in a brief, televised statement that their medical condition allowed them to focus on reuniting with their families, suggesting that none of the three women required emergency treatment.Emily Damari, one of the Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza, arrived at Sheba Hospital in Ramat Gan, Israel, on Sunday.ImageCredit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesAs she arrived at the hospital, Damari popped her head out of the vehicle transporting her from the helipad to the private reception area to greet the friends who had come to welcome her home.

But in Ramallah, the West Bank city that is home to many of those imprisoned by Israel, the mood was uneasy.“The people are too exhausted, and their feelings are mixed with sorrow over Gaza,” said one taxi driver, Zuhair Yousef. “So we are waiting until the last minute.”Under the first phase of the deal, Hamas agreed to release 33 of the hostages it seized in Israel during its Oct. 7, 2023 attack. In return, Israel said it would free 1,000 Palestinians being held in Israel.Early Sunday, after the cease-fire took effect, Hamas began releasing its captives, allowing three women to be taken back to Israel and reunited with their families. Israel, in turn, was expected to release 90 Palestinian women and minors from its prisons on Sunday night.Hostage families in Israel awaiting more releases were anxious lest something go wrong. Palestinians in the West Bank said they, too, feared 11th-hour problems as they waited for the first batch of prisoners to be freed.“The release can be stalled for any reason,” Mr. Yousef said.At a cafe in Ramallah, Mohammad al-Khatib, the director of a food factory, sat with his father watching Al Jazeera news as hookah smoke curled around them. They lifted their head when the screen showed video from Ofer Prison, from which Palestinian prisoners were expected to be released.“We have been in consecutive pain for 15 months,” said Mr. al-Khatib, 32. He said, “Despite our pain, we are happy for this day,” he said.Scores of Palestinians gathered near the prison, many lighting fires for warmth as they waited. Another gathering point was a traffic circle located on the route from the prison to Ramallah. There, dozens raised Palestinian flags alongside those of Hamas and other groups.Ahmad Barghouti, 25, a lawyer, stood at the roundabout with friends and relatives, waiting for buses carrying the released prisoners. His imprisoned uncle, also named Ahmad Barghouti, is an adviser to another relative, Marwan Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian leader who has been in Israeli prisons for more than 20 years.“This is a moment of joy we desperately need,” he said. Mr. Barghouti said he hoped his uncle would be released in the coming weeks under the swap deal.It was not just apprehension that explained the subdued mood among West Bank Palestinians. Families of the prisoners have been warned by the Israeli government, which controls the West Bank, against any form of public celebration.“This may have affected people,” Mr. al-Khatib said, “but we will for sure receive them in a very suitable and respectful manner.”“The vast majority” of the 33 hostages to be released in the six-week first phase of the cease-fire are alive, an Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, said in a discussion on social media on Sunday.A military helicopter carrying the hostages landed at a hospital north of Tel Aviv, greeted by cheers from dozens who came to celebrate their return.

Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, and about 250 people kidnapped, Israeli officials said.In loosening the reins on its military so that it could strike more targets in Gaza, Israel severely undermined the system of safeguards that had once existed.The Times disclosed that in an order issued shortly after the Hamas attack, Israeli military leaders raised the threshold for acceptable civilian harm in each pre-emptive strike, as well for each day. They also expanded the list of approved targets in Gaza.The air force raced through much of the so-called target bank list within days, officers and officials said, putting intelligence officers under intense pressure to find new targets. The military was moving so quickly, The Times found, that was not able to properly vet targets.Israel often used a simplistic statistical model to assess the risk of civilian harm that yielded unrealistic assessments of how many people were near a target. And hours could pass between when an officer vetted a target and when the air force launched a strike — meaning that strikes often relied on outdated intelligence.Israel also relied on large, imprecise bombs, and it significantly reduced its use of ”roof knocks” — warnings that gave people in a targeted building time to get out.Video captured by news agencies shows the moment three Israeli hostages were handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas in Gaza earlier on Sunday.

Daniel Hagari, offered details about the timing of future Israeli hostage releases in his briefing with reporters on Sunday. In the first 42 days of the cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas that is now in effect, three to four hostages held in Gaza will be released each week. The next set of captives is set to be freed this Saturday, he said.With fighters on the streets, Hamas tries to show it’s back in charge in Gaza.ImageMembers of Hamas’s military wing, in Deir al Balah, central Gaza, on Sunday.Credit...Bashar Taleb/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesAs the cease-fire in Gaza was coming into effect on Sunday, masked gunmen, crowded into white pickup trucks, paraded through the streets of Gaza while supporters chanted the name of Hamas’s military wing. By sending its fighters out in an unmistakable show of force, Hamas was trying to deliver an unequivocal message to Palestinians in Gaza, to Israel and to the international community: that despite heavy losses during the war among Hamas’s fighters, police officers, political leaders and government administrators, it remains the dominant Palestinian power in Gaza.“The message is that Hamas is ‘the day after’ for the war,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, an analyst close to Hamas based in Turkey, using a phrase that refers to the future administration of Gaza.“They’re conveying that Hamas must be a part of any future arrangements, or at least, be coordinated with,” he added.On Sunday, the Hamas-run government media office announced that thousands of police officers were beginning to deploy throughout the territory to “preserve security and order.” Government ministries and institutions, the media office said, were prepared to start working “according to the government plan to implement all the measures that guarantee bringing back normal life.”At the Nasser Medical Complex in the southern city of Khan Younis, at least three uniformed police officers were standing as the Palestinian national anthem played in the background, according to a video posted on social media and verified by The New York Times.Later on Sunday, dozens of uniformed, gun-toting Hamas militants were seen in Saraya Square in Gaza City next to a car holding Israeli hostages before they were handed over to the Red Cross. The militants were attempting to push away crowds of people pressing toward the car.Even as Hamas attempts to project that it still controls Gaza and plans to play a key role in its administration, its future there remains uncertain. Israeli officials have said they have not given up on their stated war goal of dismantling Hamas’s military wing and government, strongly suggesting that they could resume the war against the militant group after the freeing of some hostages.Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said on Sunday that Hamas’s rule was dangerous for Israel’s security and emphasized that Israel had not agreed to a permanent cease-fire that leaves Hamas in power.“We are determined to achieve the objectives of the war,” he said.While some analysts say Israel could eventually remove Hamas from power, others say it would struggle to resume the war in the face of international pressure. And even if it does, those analysts say, Israeli forces will face immense challenges in uprooting Hamas from Gaza without carrying out a direct occupation.Ali Jarbawi, a political science professor at Birzeit University, said Hamas’s parades through Gaza on Sunday were more than a message to the international community that it was in control. They also reflect the reality on the ground, he said.“Hamas was there before the war and they’re there now,” he said.Aritz Parra contributed reporting.“Romi, Emily, and Doron – so beloved and missed – an entire nation rejoices at your return,” President Isaac Herzog of Israel said in a statement on X about the hostage release, adding that it was “the beginning of a challenging journey of recovery and healing together.” For most hostage families, an agonizing wait for news and reunions goes on.ImageIsraelis gathered in a square in Tel Aviv to watch the release of the hostages on Sunday.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesAs hundreds of people gathered in a Tel Aviv plaza on Sunday to cheer the news that the first three hostages released in the cease-fire deal were being returned to Israel, for some families, an agonizing wait goes on.The initial stage of the cease-fire called for the release on Sunday of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. Thirty more hostages are expected to be freed over a six-week period.“I hope to see my grandfather soon,” said Daniel Lifschitz, 36, whose grandfather, Oded Lifschitz, now 85, was kidnapped from his home in Nir Oz, Israel, and has spent more than a year in Hamas captivity.Standing among a crowd of activists who since the start of the war has pushed for an agreement that included the hostages’ release, Lifschitz shared that his family’s anticipation is clouded by deep fear for their relative’s fate. “We don’t know if we are preparing for a celebration or a funeral,” he said.ImageIsraelis gathered to watch the release of the hostages at the Hostages square in Tel Aviv.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesHis grandmother, who was also kidnapped and was one of the first hostages released in a previous cease-fire deal, initially told the family that Mr. Lifschitz was dead. However, other released hostages later revealed they had seen him alive in late October, the grandson said.Mr. Lifschitz said his grandfather, a former journalist, used to drive Gazan children with cancer to Israeli hospitals as part of his volunteering with an Israeli association that transports Palestinian patients from Gaza for treatment in Israel.Mr. Lifschitz added that his anxiety isn’t only for his grandfather, but also for other hostages he knows intimately from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he grew up.“I hope both sides will keep to the terms of the agreement,” he said. “It might not be a good deal, but it’s the one we’ve got.”Aid trucks began moving into Gaza as part of the cease-fire deal.ImageTrucks carrying humanitarian aid arrived in the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom crossing on Sunday.Credit...Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesConvoys of aid trucks entered Gaza on the first day of the cease-fire on Sunday, as humanitarian workers raced to address the enclave’s dire humanitarian needs after months of restrictions and lawlessness that reduced aid to a trickle. Two convoys carrying ready-to-eat food parcels and wheat flour traveled into the enclave, one through the Kerem Shalom crossing in southeastern Gaza, and another at a crossing in the north, according to Martin Penner, a spokesman for the United Nations’ World Food Program.“The goal is to get food aid to everybody who needs it and to restock bakeries and make sure children get food supplements. If they are malnourished it will help pull them back,” Mr. Penner said.More than 200 trucks carrying aid, including several with fuel, had moved from Egypt to the border crossing at Kerem Shalom in southeastern Gaza, according to an Egyptian government statement. Deliveries of fuel, which have been limited into Gaza because of Israeli concerns that it could fall into the hands of Hamas, are essential to keeping both hospitals and bakeries running.The main United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, UNRWA, said that 4,000 aid trucks had been in the Egyptian city of Rafah, on Egypt’s border with Gaza, on Sunday, waiting to travel into Gaza. Half were carrying food and flour, it said in a post on social media.Under the terms of the cease-fire deal, 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid will be allowed to enter Gaza daily.ImagePeople gather to collect humanitarian aid after trucks arrived Gaza on Sunday.Credit...Eyad Baba/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesBefore the war began 15 months ago, around 500 trucks a day arrived in Gaza, consisting of both humanitarian aid and commercial supplies for sale, but the daily number had dwindled to less than one-fifth of that.Civilians across much of Gaza face malnutrition, and in the territory’s north, the United Nations has warned that conditions border on famine. Almost all of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million has been displaced from their homes and hospitals and schools have been decimated.Stringent inspections of aid trucks by the Israeli authorities and restrictions on the movement of convoys within Gaza have restricted aid deliveries. Looting by armed gangs has also been a major problem, reflecting the desperation and a breakdown of law and order in Gaza.“We need countries with influence over Israel, Hamas and armed groups who have attacked our trucks to insist that we are able to get this lifesaving aid to those who need it,” Tom Fletcher, the United Nations under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, said that attacks on convoys would decline as aid flows into the enclave. Aid workers say that this is in part because the price of looted goods would decline.Preparations are also underway in Egypt to receive injured Palestinians from Gaza, according to the Egyptian state television channel Al-Qahera TV. Aid groups have said that most evacuation requests for critically ill patients from Gaza had been denied.More than 12,000 people remain on waiting lists for treatment abroad, according to Dr. Rik Peeperkorn, the representative for the W.H.O. in Gaza and the West Bank.Israel’s truce with Hamas leaves the big questions unresolved, for now.ImageDisplaced Palestinians walking past rubble in northern Gaza on Sunday.Credit...Dawoud Abu Alkas/ReutersIsrael and Hamas reached an agreement on an initial six-week truce in part by putting off their most intractable disputes to a nebulous second phase — which neither side is sure they will reach.Under the agreement, 16 days into the initial cease-fire, Israeli and Hamas officials are expected to begin negotiating next steps: an end to the war, the release of the remaining living hostages from Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory.Israeli leaders have long insisted that they will not end the war until Hamas is destroyed. That appeared far from reality on Sunday as Hamas militants, some waving rifles, fanned out in parts of Gaza in pickup trucks, in a show of authority to Palestinians and Israelis alike.Israel and Hamas have both preserved some of their bargaining chips. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza, and hold major prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.But as part of the talks, the Israeli government will then probably have to decide whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. And choosing the hostages might threaten Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power in Israel.In the meantime, both sides have agreed to postpone a decisive agreement as to the war’s end and the future of Gaza, and hope the 42-day cease-fire will play to their advantage, said Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli brigadier general. Hamas, in particular, “hopes that the new dynamic will prevent Israel from returning to fighting,” he said.The decision to accept a temporary cease-fire opened deep fissures within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which is stacked with hard-liners. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, resigned in protest from the cabinet and withdrew his Jewish Power party from the coalition on Sunday.The Religious Zionism party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to bolt the coalition, too, if Mr. Netanyahu failed to renew the fighting after the end of the 42-day truce. If Mr. Smotrich’s party also left, Mr. Netanyahu’s government would hold fewer than half of the seats in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, which could cause the government to fall and force new elections.On Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu stressed that the cease-fire was temporary for now. He argued that Israel retained the right to return to the war if “the second stage negotiations are ineffectual,” adding that President-elect Donald J. Trump would support Israel’s decision.“We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.The truce’s fragility was underscored on Sunday morning when Hamas did not immediately hand over a list of hostages to be released to Israel, prompting a nearly three-hour delay in the cease-fire. Analysts say the deal will probably see numerous similar tests over the next few weeks as both sides flex their muscles.The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have called on the Israeli government to bring home the remaining captives by fulfilling all the phases of the deal. Noa Argamani, a freed hostage whose boyfriend, Avinatan Or, remains in captivity, said that it broke her heart that he was not going to be freed in this round.“The progress in the past few days is a very important step, but the deal must go through in full, completely, in all of its stages,” Ms. Argamani said in a speech in Miami on Thursday.Gazans greet the cease-fire with joy, but also sadness for all that was lost.ImageMembers of Gaza’s Civil Defense celebrating in Gaza City on Sunday.Credit...Mahmoud Issa/ReutersHundreds of Palestinians took to the streets across Gaza on Sunday, honking car horns and cheering to celebrate the start of the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.Other people who had fled south collected any belongings they had and headed north for long awaited journeys back to their homes — or whatever was left of them. Many waited anxiously for news of what had become of their old neighborhoods from the first relatives and neighbors to arrive home.Riyadh al-Gharably, 64, said he had hardly slept as he and his family waited to see if the cease-fire would go into effect as planned. He spent Sunday morning watching a clock and listening to sporadic artillery shelling and gunfire echoing from the city’s eastern borders — hoping that they did not signal any scuttling of the long-awaited peace.“All the wives here cried all night,” said Mr. al-Gharably, his voice breaking.In Gaza City, members of Palestinian Civil Defense teams — who carried out rescue operations in response to near-daily Israeli strikes during the war — poured into the streets to celebrate and climbed on top of ambulances to wave Palestinian flags.In Deir al Balah, a city in central Gaza, cars honked their horns and loud music blared from coffee shops.For many, the moment was awash with conflicting emotions: There was the sheer joy that the bombing and bloodshed might finally — finally — be over. But there was also an overwhelming sense of loss resulting from a conflict that has devastated the territory and its population.Many people said they were determined to start to reclaim the lives they had once known despite the huge amount of destruction across the enclave.“The joy of returning home is overwhelming, but it’s mixed with sadness,” said Ahed al-Okka, 52.A construction worker from Gaza City in the north, Mr. al-Okka said that he has spent most of the past year living in a tent on the streets of a city in central Gaza, Deir al-Balah. He planned to return Sunday to his house, which he had heard was partially damaged but still standing.But even if his family could repair a single room and live in it, that would be enough for now, he said: “We’ll rebuild and fix things step by step and finally get some peace of mind.”For others, the resolve to rebuild lives disrupted by war was overshadowed by the grief and pain built up over 15 months of conflict.“I can’t say I’m happy about this truce,” said Suhaila Dawaas, a 55-year-old mother of eight who was displaced to central Gaza from Beit Lahia in the north. “What is left for us after everything — after the endless losses, the destruction, the pain?”Ms. Dawaas said several of her relatives had been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Her home has been mostly destroyed, she said, and she hoped to find a few reminders of the life her family once had in the rubble — maybe in photo albums — when she returns home.She said she was grieving for more than what had been lost. She added that she was also grieving for everything still to be lost — her children’s future and the hardships that would undoubtedly define the next chapter in Gaza as people try to rebuild their lives.“We spent our entire lives building homes for our children, and now, we have lost so much,” Ms. Dawaas said. But, “I am grateful that the survivors will now have a chance at some peace.”‘We have survived’: Gazans and Israelis express elation, shadowed by doubt.ImagePalestinians celebrating on Sunday morning in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.Credit...Mohammed Salem/ReutersAs a truce took hold on Sunday in Gaza, potentially ending the longest and deadliest war in a century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict, two men used the same metaphor to describe how they felt.“The weight on my chest has lifted,” said Ziad Obeid, a Gazan civil servant displaced several times during the war. “We have survived.”“The rock lying on my heart has been removed,” said Dov Weissglas, a former Israeli politician. “We want to see the hostages home, period.”Both men also had a “but.”Mr. Obeid has not seen his damaged house in northern Gaza for more than a year. How bad, he wondered, is the damage? Who will rebuild a decimated Gaza? And will Hamas still run it?Mr. Weissglas worried about the conditions of the hostages set to be freed gradually over the next few weeks from dank quarters in the territory. And he grimaced about exchanging them for hundreds of Palestinian detainees, many of whom are serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis. “There is relief,” he said, “wrapped in caution, fears and concern.”ImageA rally was held on Saturday night in Tel Aviv for the return of the hostages held in Gaza.Credit...Amit Elkayam for The New York TimesIt was an apt summary of the mood on both sides of the divide on Sunday, as Israelis and Palestinians expressed feelings of elation tinged with doubt.For Palestinians, the truce is meant to provide at least six weeks without strikes on Gaza. That offers a window for Gazans to take tentative first steps toward reconstruction; to find relatives still buried in the rubble; and to come to terms with the killing of more than 45,000 people, both civilians and combatants, whose bodies have already been counted by the Gazan health authorities. Scenes of joy were broadcast on Sunday from across the territory, as rescue workers threw confetti; crowds danced and chanted amid the rubble; and journalists symbolically removed their flak jackets.For Israelis, the deal allows for the gradual release of at least 33 of the hostages captured during Hamas’s raid on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — an attack that killed up to 1,200 people and provoked Israel’s devastating 15-month response. For the hostages released alive, that means freedom after 470 days of captivity. For Israelis at large, many of them wracked by a form of survivors’ guilt, it offers qualified catharsis. In the embodiment of that mood, friends of one of the first three hostages released on Sunday were filmed leaping with jubilation after hearing news of her freedom.But the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas mean that both sides still face considerable uncertainty about how the next six weeks will play out, let alone about whether the tentative arrangement will later become permanent. Even the first phase started hours behind schedule on Sunday morning, amid disputes about which hostages would be released in the afternoon. In that time, according to the Gazan authorities, Israeli strikes killed and wounded yet more people.For now, Israel also still controls vast tracts of Gaza and has yet to agree to a full withdrawal, preventing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, like Mr. Obeid, from returning to homes in northern Gaza. It remains to be seen whether Israeli troops will ever entirely leave.“What happens after 42 days?” Mr. Weissglas said. “Nobody knows.”ImageDisplaced Palestinians trying to return home on Sunday in northern Gaza.Credit...Mahmoud Al-Basos/ReutersPalestinians also remain unclear about the fates of several thousand Gazans detained incommunicado during the war and who may not be released during the upcoming exchanges. Reema Diab, a housewife in central Gaza, still has no way of locating her husband, a horse trainer, who she said was taken for interrogation in Israel in December 2023 and never heard from since.“I’m relieved the bloodshed is coming to an end, but my heart aches,” Ms. Diab said. “His absence is unimaginable.”Across the border, Israeli columnists struck a somber tone, with one, Ben Caspit, describing a blend of joy and sadness, “inseparably intertwined.” He wrote that Sunday was a day of reckoning, not celebration, and he emphasized that Israel would now need to come to terms with the scale of its failure on Oct. 7, 2023.“Let us be silent for a moment, let us study our conscience, let us suffer the disaster, let us think about those who were killed and murdered and burned and raped and kidnapped,” Mr. Caspit wrote in Maariv, a right-leaning daily newspaper.Israelis also feared already for the fates of some 65 hostages who may not be released from Gaza if the deal collapses after six weeks. Similarly, there were widespread fears that the initial 33 hostages set to be released over the next 42 days may be emotionally or physically scarred, or even dead. And Israelis generally lamented that the hostages’ freedom would be obtained in exchange for Palestinian detainees, including some convicted of major terrorist attacks as well as teenagers who have never been charged.Palestinians see the soon-to-be released detainees as freedom fighters and political prisoners. For Israelis, it will be a psychological blow to see “this stream of murderers being released,” Mr. Weissglas said.ImageIsraelis looking at the ruins of Beit Hanoun, Gaza, from a hill in Sderot, Israel, on Sunday.Credit...Avishag Shaar-Yashuv for The New York TimesVideos of Hamas fighters re-emerging in triumph from hiding were also a gut-punch for Israelis, who had hoped the war would completely destroy the group’s military abilities. For many Gazans, it was a sight to be celebrated, but for others, it was a reminder of lingering uncertainty about Gaza’s future governance.Mr. Obeid works for the Palestinian Authority, which lost power to Hamas in Gaza 18 years ago but still employs some Gazan civil servants, including Mr. Obeid, and now hopes to play a bigger role in postwar Gaza. Mr. Obeid said he had been liaising in recent days with the authority’s leaders in the West Bank to plan potential cleanup and reconstruction operations in Gaza. It is unclear, he said, whether those efforts will be possible with Hamas still in charge over the next six weeks, and perhaps even beyond.It is also unclear when Israel will allow Mr. Obeid, who fled to Egypt last year after being displaced three times in Gaza, to return home.But all of that can be addressed in time, Mr. Obeid said.For now, he said, “I can breathe oxygen again.”Bilal Shbair contributed reporting from Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip, and Aaron Boxerman from Jerusalem.",

That appeared far from reality on Sunday as Hamas militants, some waving rifles, fanned out in parts of Gaza in pickup trucks, in a show of authority to Palestinians and Israelis alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIsrael and Hamas have both preserved some of their bargaining chips. At the end of the 42-day truce, Hamas will still have around two-thirds of the 98 remaining hostages, including dozens who are believed to be dead. And Israel will still occupy parts of Gaza, and hold major prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as part of the talks, the Israeli government will then probably have to decide whether it is willing to choose one of its war aims, bringing home the hostages, over another, destroying Hamas. And choosing the hostages might threaten Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, both sides have agreed to postpone a decisive agreement as to the war’s end and the future of Gaza, and hope the 42-day cease-fire will play to their advantage, said Shlomo Brom, a retired Israeli brigadier general. Hamas, in particular, “hopes that the new dynamic will prevent Israel from returning to fighting,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decision to accept a temporary cease-fire opened deep fissures within Mr. Netanyahu’s governing coalition, which is stacked with hard-liners. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, resigned in protest from the cabinet and withdrew his Jewish Power party from the coalition on Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Religious Zionism party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, threatened to bolt the coalition, too, if Mr. Netanyahu failed to renew the fighting after the end of the 42-day truce. If Mr. Smotrich’s party also left, Mr. Netanyahu’s government would hold fewer than half of the seats in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, which could cause the government to fall and force new elections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday night, Mr. Netanyahu stressed that the cease-fire was temporary for now. He argued that Israel retained the right to return to the war if “the second stage negotiations are ineffectual,” adding that President-elect Donald J. Trump would support Israel’s decision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We retain the right to return to the war, if necessary, with the backing of the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a televised address.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe truce’s fragility was underscored on Sunday morning when Hamas did not immediately hand over a list of hostages to be released to Israel, prompting a nearly three-hour delay in the cease-fire. Analysts say the deal will probably see numerous similar tests over the next few weeks as both sides flex their muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza have called on the Israeli government to bring home the remaining captives by fulfilling all the phases of the deal.

That offers a window for Gazans to take tentative first steps toward reconstruction; to find relatives still buried in the rubble; and to come to terms with the killing of more than 45,000 people, both civilians and combatants, whose bodies have already been counted by the Gazan health authorities. Scenes of joy were broadcast on Sunday from across the territory, as rescue workers threw confetti; crowds danced and chanted amid the rubble; and journalists symbolically removed their flak jackets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Israelis, the deal allows for the gradual release of at least 33 of the hostages captured during Hamas’s raid on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — an attack that killed up to 1,200 people and provoked Israel’s devastating 15-month response. For the hostages released alive, that means freedom after 470 days of captivity. For Israelis at large, many of them wracked by a form of survivors’ guilt, it offers qualified catharsis. In the embodiment of that mood, friends of one of the first three hostages released on Sunday were filmed leaping with jubilation after hearing news of her freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the details of the deal between Israel and Hamas mean that both sides still face considerable uncertainty about how the next six weeks will play out, let alone about whether the tentative arrangement will later become permanent.
