  "text": "BRASÍLIA — Jair Bolsonaro was surrounded by his own image. It graced most available surfaces at his party’s headquarters, from the walls to the coffee mugs. There was a large painting of Bolsonaro wearing his presidential sash. Photos of Bolsonaro before thousands of supporters, arm reaching into the sky. A golden bust of Bolsonaro, grim-faced, placed before a painting of an even grimmer-faced Bolsonaro.But none of these was the image that Bolsonaro wanted us to see.Bolsonaro, awaiting trial before the Brazilian Supreme Court on accusations he plotted to assassinate his rivals and stay in power after his 2022 election loss, pulled over a thick coffee-table book written and given to him by President Donald Trump.“I didn’t pay anything,” said the 70-year-old Bolsonaro, twice. “Look, he even signed it.”On Page 305, beside a letter Bolsonaro had written to Trump — “You’ll always have a friend in Brazil” — he found a large photo of himself alongside Trump, and another on the next page. He lingered to admire the photos, reliving his political apex, his moment of greatest proximity to a figure he had long sought to emulate. Then he closed the book and returned to a present and very different moment:Out of power. Unable to run for office until 2030. Facing the prospect of four decades in prison. Prohibited from leaving the country.“I couldn’t go to [Trump’s] inauguration,” he mourned. “My passport had been apprehended.”I’ve been reporting on Bolsonaro for six years, from his rise to power through the darkest days of Brazil’s devastating coronavirus outbreak, from his electoral loss to the storming of the capital by thousands of supporters in protest of the result. But our interview last month was my first time sitting down with him. Walking into a conference room at the Liberal Party headquarters with Post reporter Marina Dias and photographer Dan Agostini, I expected to find the brash, aggressive Bolsonaro I’d come to know from his public persona.The Bolsonaro who had mocked the coronavirus. Inflamed calls for a military takeover. Clashed with the Supreme Court. Alleged without evidence that the electoral system was rigged against him. And made a vulgar campaign slogan out of the Portuguese word “imbrochável” — something like “never flaccid” — to tout his supposed virility.In many respects, we found that Bolsonaro. He was physically imposing, irreverent, charismatic, paranoid. Quick to laugh. Quick to anger. He never broke eye contact. He asserted he was “stronger than ever” politically, claimed that the “system” wanted him dead — possibly by sniper attack — and falsely asserted that the coronavirus vaccine, which he said he hadn’t received, “isn’t scientifically proven” to be effective. He said he saw a narrow path back to power: galvanize mass support for another presidential bid and pressure the electoral authorities into overturning his political disqualification.“There is a popular appeal behind me,” he said.But we also saw a man reckoning with his own downfall, scared of prison and death, trying to reconcile how he had quickly gone from perhaps Latin America’s most powerful politician to a criminal defendant facing decades of incarceration. He vacillated between expressing certainty that he’d find a way back to power and moments of doubt.“I’m not anything,” he said at one point.When talking about Trump the day of our meeting, Bolsonaro appeared bereft, orphaned. In the months since Trump’s return to the White House, the U.S. president had yet to mention his Brazilian admirer. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo traveled to the United States to try to win some show of support for his father, but little has come of it.Aides say the former Brazilian president expected more from Trump.“He knows what I’m feeling here,” Bolsonaro told us. “I know he’s much more powerful than us, but if it was the other way around … I always talked about the prosecutions that Trump suffered. If he wants to say something about me, he’ll decide to speak.”He looked at the book Trump had given him, and looked away.A devastating electoral lossBolsonaro, a Catholic closely allied with Brazil’s evangelicals, has a tendency to believe in the miraculous. He was campaigning in Minas Gerais during his 2018 run for president when he was stabbed in the abdomen by a man later found to be mentally ill. He lost 40 percent of his blood. By his own telling, he should have died. But the attack only boosted his poll numbers.Then an even more unlikely occurrence. Bolsonaro, an obscure congressman dismissed by the establishment as a member of the “baixo clero” — “lower clergy” — with almost no money, less allotted time on television and a history of offensive public comments, was elected president.“By God who is in heaven,” he said, “we got there.”So in 2022, when the polls showed him trailing Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the presidential race, Bolsonaro told his aides that he was confident. Something would happen, perhaps divine intervention, that would bring them to victory, aides recalled him saying.“He didn’t think he would lose the election,” said former chief of staff Ciro Nogueira. “He wasn’t prepared to lose.”When voters opted, narrowly, for Lula, the rebuke devastated Bolsonaro. One senior aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe intimate moments, says he found Bolsonaro desolate, unable to face his supporters, unwilling to see anyone, unsure of what he’d say. He suffered a skin rash that left his legs looking like “raw meat,” the aide said. After four years of omnipresence in Brazil, he spent nearly 40 days out of public view. People around him worried about his mental state.“The days after the election were horrible,” said the aide. “We thought he could make an attempt against his own life.”It was during this period, prosecutors allege, that an inchoate plot to subvert democracy came into definition. Authorities say they have discovered an unpublished presidential decree that would have granted Bolsonaro emergency powers. It authorized the takeover of the federal electoral commission to enforce the “fairness and correction” of the election he lost.Bolsonaro, prosecutors charge, edited the document and presented it to military leaders to seek their backing, but he was rebuffed.Bolsonaro has said he printed the document only because he wanted to know what was in it.Authorities say Bolsonaro also signed off on a plan to capture and assassinate political rivals. The list allegedly included Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the electoral commission and has led several probes into the Bolsonaro administration.A document printed at the presidential palace, prosecutors allege, shows speculation on the merits of poison to kill Lula and the use of assault rifles and explosives to assassinate Bolsonaro’s other political foes.Chat messages obtained by police, prosecutors say, indicate that some of the plotters surveilled Moraes and, on Dec. 15, 2022, between Lula’s victory and inauguration, appeared close to carrying out the plan.“The story is ridiculous,” Bolsonaro told us. “How are you going to capture and poison the guy? It’s so infantile that you end up getting embarrassed talking about it. Some crazy guys put something on a computer.”He added: “It had nothing to do with me.”At one point as Bolsonaro fulminated, I told him he didn’t need to convince me. He had to convince the authorities. He needed to convince Moraes, with whom he has clashed for years. The justice — both a target and an investigator of the alleged plot — will now also decide the merits of the government’s case.I asked Bolsonaro whether he thought he could beat the charges. He said he could.He just needed time. Something miraculous might happen.(Days after we spoke, Bolsonaro underwent emergency surgery for an intestinal blockage. He was released from DF Star hospital in Brasilia after three weeks of care.)‘We have the heart of the public’Perhaps the lowest point for Bolsonaro came early last year, aides and advisers said, when federal police confiscated his passport and arrested several of his staff members. Bolsonaro was terrified he would be next. Tearful, he sought counsel from his adviser, the Pentecostal pastor Silas Malafaia.“I said, ‘Do you want to be arrested while crying at home?’” Malafaia recalled. “He kept crying for five minutes without stopping on video call before responding. And then he asked what we should do, and I said I’d start coordinating protests on the streets.”Asked about his tears, Bolsonaro said he had wept for others, not himself.Nogueira, his former chief of staff, says he couldn’t get Bolsonaro to think clearly during that period. But in recent months, he says, the former president has rebounded, even as his legal peril mounted.“This is his best moment,” Nogueira said. “He’s able to think pragmatically again.”Neither his advisers nor Bolsonaro himself say they believe he’ll prevail in court — not with Moraes overseeing the proceedings. But when we met with Bolsonaro, a strategy appeared to be forming, a belief that his arguments were better-suited for the streets than the courtroom. With polls showing broad dissatisfaction with Lula’s governance and a close election if Bolsonaro and Lula were to face off again, Bolsonaro has returned to holding large rallies. He has demanded legal amnesty, contested his political disqualification and, again following Trump’s political lead, announced plans to run again.“I see that we have the heart of the public,” Bolsonaro told us. “Leaving Jair Bolsonaro out of the 2026 election would be a denial of democracy.”We completed the interview and walked into his office, where more pictures of Bolsonaro awaited. He pulled out two daggers that had been given to him. He showed off a medieval sword on display. Handed me a Bible bearing the image of a medieval crusader.He motioned to a map showing the Amazon forest, which suffered extensive deforestation during his tenure, alarming climate scientists and activists. He said he would rather exploit its “riches and minerals” with the United States than with China or Japan.He then asked about my family. I replied that my son had been born in Brazil.He seemed pleased to hear I’d had a boy and, as a gift for him, handed me one of his giveaway coins.“This is only for men,” he said.I would return the coin, but not before I looked at it.“Imbrochável,” it sa",
