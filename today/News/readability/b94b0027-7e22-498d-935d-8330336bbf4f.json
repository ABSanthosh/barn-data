  "text": "As he outlined his jaw-dropping plan for the United States to “own” Gaza, remove its Palestinian population and redevelop the enclave as a new Mediterranean Riviera, President Donald Trump said he had studied the issue “very closely over a lot of months … from every angle.”Repeating “the same process that’s gone on forever and ever and over and over again … you end up in the same place” of death and destruction in Gaza, Trump said in his Tuesday news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“You just can’t keep doing — you have to learn from history,” he said.Trump’s idea of remaking Gaza in the image of a U.S. real estate development is not a complete outlier in the long, troubled history of U.S. intervention in the Middle East amid American dreams of transforming the region.Many of those actions came to grief, including the 1983 suicide bombing deaths of 241 U.S. service members deployed to Beirut on a vaguely defined mission to help the Lebanese government, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq that led to a huge loss of American and Iraqi lives, increased Iranian influence in the region, and expanded Islamist terrorism.In policy terms, the Gaza plan upends decades of U.S. support for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, backed by most of the rest of the world and by past Republican and Democratic administrations.The global response has been overwhelmingly negative, with only Israel voicing strong support. “It’s the first good idea I’ve heard. I think it’s a remarkable idea,” Netanyahu, speaking Wednesday on Fox, said of Trump’s Gaza plan. “It should be pursued and done.” On Thursday, Defense Minister Israel Katz tasked the Israeli military with developing a plan to facilitate what he said would be the voluntary departure of Gazans from their decimated territory to make room for reconstruction.At the news conference with Netanyahu, Trump said he was also “thinking about” support for Israeli sovereignty in the occupied West Bank, home to an additional 3 million Palestinians. “We’ll be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next four weeks,” he said.While many Democratic lawmakers called the plan “ethnic cleansing,” many Republicans temporized. “It’s a conversation starter,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said.On Thursday, Trump backed off at least one part of the plan — a professed willingness to use U.S. troops to facilitate the takeover and reconstruction of Gaza — that had caused consternation even in Republican circles and seemed in direct conflict to his campaign promise of ending overseas military involvements.Israel, he said on social media, would turn over Gaza to the United States “at the conclusion of fighting.” By that time, “Palestinians … would have already been resettled” elsewhere and “the U.S., working with great development teams from all over the World,” would build “one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth.”“No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed!” he said.“Trump’s statement seems like an outlier because it’s so shocking — go in an clean out Gaza, transferring its population,” said Steven A. Cook of the Council on Foreign Relations, author of the recently published book “The End of Ambition: America’s Past, Present, and Future in the Middle East.”“But in the broader context of [the desire] to do ambitious things, to change the region … there is that impulse,” Cook said, citing the U.S. military invasion of Iraq, along with the farther-afield war in Afghanistan, and grandiose but unsuccessful efforts to change the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic through diplomacy and economic development.“What Trump is proposing is just not real,” said Aaron David Miller, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who spent nearly three decades in Republican and Democratic administrations trying to negotiate peace in the region. “If it becomes real, then I think it deserves to take its place with some of the other misadventures that have marked our unfortunate and unhappy experience in this region.”Beyond its implied forced transfer of 2 million Palestinians, Miller said, it “rewards the policies of the Israel government that is the most right-wing, extremist government in the history of the Israeli state.”Asked to describe what the president had in mind when he said “the same process” should not be repeated, national security adviser Michael Waltz told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that “Trump looks at this in very practical terms. … Are we going to repeat the definition of insanity there” and “just have another war in 10 years?”Trump, Waltz said, was “asking in a humane way, ‘What’s going to happen to these people?’ … The key piece is you can’t get to post-construction, you can’t make this the Paris of the Mediterranean … if you’ve got 1.8 million people living in absolute squalor. … President Trump is a builder, he’s the dealmaker in chief.” Waltz invited “anyone, the media included … to come to us with a better plan.”While the overall goal of successive U.S. presidents has been to maintain stability in the region, help protect Israel and move toward two separate states, virtually every angle has been tried short of direct military intervention.During the Clinton administration, the United States contributed considerable resources to both Israel and the Palestinians under the 1993 Oslo accords, which divided the West Bank into separate areas under Israeli or Palestinian control and recognized the governing role of the Palestinian Authority. Much of the agreement collapsed in 1996, following the assassination of then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Israeli extremist that eventually led to Netanyahu’s first election.Clinton’s efforts to put the peace process back on track culminated in a 2000 summit meeting at Camp David with talks he mediated between the newly elected Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. The summit failed over the parties’ inability to resolve differences over the West Bank borders, Gaza and Jerusalem, which both claimed as their capital.Under the presidency of George W. Bush, Palestinian uprisings led to tightened Israeli control over the occupied territories. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza but maintained control of all maritime and land entries into the enclave. Power conflicts between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas led to a Hamas takeover of Gaza in the 2006 elections.Distracted by nation-building and counterterrorism missions launched by Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Obama administration found little success in attempts to bolster the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to prepare it for statehood as Netanyahu returned to power in 2009 with increasingly right-wing governments.Trump ended most of those efforts during his first term in office, recognizing Israel’s ownership of Syria’s Golan Heights, Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and pulling back on U.S. support for the Palestinian Authority and instead pushing for Israel’s normalization of relations with its Arab neighbors that would bypass the Palestinians. In 2020, he introduced a peace plan that would allow Israeli annexation and settlement of most of the West Bank in exchange for economic incentives for the Palestinians, a proposal that died a quiet death with his election loss at the end of that year.As the Biden administration struggled to relaunch a two-state plan, Hamas was preparing for war. Periodic conflicts with Israel had escalated as the militants were stocking their arsenals with homemade and Iranian-provided weaponry and building an extensive network of underground tunnels in Gaza. The culmination came on Oct. 7, 2023, as a brutal Hamas incursion into southern Israel left around 1,200 dead and more than 250 hostages taken by the militants into Gaza.Israeli attacks on the enclave have now left it what Trump has called an uninhabitable “demolition” site, with more than 46,000 Palestinians dead, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. A fragile ceasefire, negotiated by the Biden administration and pushed to fruition by Trump, has led to a temporary halt in the fighting and hostage releases.“It’s strange at the moment to be in a period when statecraft seems to have been replaced by real estate craft,” Tom Fletcher, the United Nations undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, said of Trump’s plan in an interview Sunday after a tour of Gaza. “I was asking a lot of people what they thought and every single one of them said, ‘We’re not going anywhere. We’ll rebuild our homes again and again and again as we always have done.’”",
