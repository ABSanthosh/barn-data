  "text": "Paquita la del Barrio, a pathbreaking Mexican singer whose feminist rancheras and boleros took aim at two-timing lovers, sexist ex-boyfriends and the excesses of machismo culture, died Feb. 17 at her home in the Mexican state of Veracruz. She was 77.Her death was announced on her official social media accounts, which did not cite a cause. She had been hospitalized in 2019 with pulmonary thrombosis, which limited her ability to sing, and had suffered mobility issues in recent years, performing at times from a wheelchair.Praised by the country’s culture ministry as an “icon of ranchera music in Mexico,” Paquita released more than 30 albums, mixing the traditional sounds of ranchera, bolero, banda and norteña music with unconventionally frank and feisty lyrics about love, romance, disappointment and desire. She stood only about 5 feet tall, but with her powerful contralto voice she seemed to channel the anger and frustration of millions of women, performing defiant anthems in which she railed against men who dared to cheat or take her for granted.Her biggest hit, “Rata de Dos Patas,” was directed at a former lover she likened to a snake, a leech, a cockroach and the titular “Two-Legged Rat.” “¿Me estás oyendo, inútil?” she asked, in a line that became her catchphrase: “Are you listening to me, you good-for-nothing?”“We Mexicans have this machismo situation. Women are always hurt by what men do to them,” she said in a 2008 interview with the Miami Herald. “I don’t sing what others sing. I sing the truth, even if the gentlemen don’t like it.”Over time, Paquita drew plenty of men to her concerts, alongside the women who made up the bulk of her audience. “She is the spokeswoman for humble women,” composer Manuel Eduardo Toscano, who wrote “Rata de Dos Patas,” told the Herald. “She says what all of them want to shout to our faces.”Paquita’s songs included the accordion-backed “Tres Veces Te Engañé,” in which she spoke of taking revenge on an unfaithful partner (“Three times I cheated on you/ The first out of anger/ The second on a whim/ The third for pleasure”); “Me Saludas a la Tuya,” about a chance encounter with an obnoxious ex; “Taco Placero,” about a lover who turns out to be “a dud in bed”; and “Hombres Malvados,” in which she threatened “wicked men” with castration.Although she didn’t write her songs, her life offered a wealth of material for the lyricists she worked with. She was about 15 when she eloped with Miguel Gerardo Martínez, who was nearly 30 years her senior. They separated after seven years, when — according to a 2021 profile in USA Today — Paquita discovered he had a separate family and was married to another woman. She later married a second time, only to experience what she described as “the same sacrilege and sacrifice of living with a man you know is being unfaithful.”“It’s difficult because the heart goes where it wants,” she told USA Today. “Those feelings are what guide people to my music.”For many listeners, the best Paquita songs were cathartic and empowering, offering a chance to turn sadness into anger and pain into joy. They were also flexible enough to apply to political opponents, not just philandering husbands: When Honduras’s deposed president Manuel Zelaya returned to the country in 2009, taking refuge at the Brazilian Embassy while trying to lobby for his reinstatement, Honduran soldiers responded by setting up speakers and blasting “Rata De Dos Patas” all night, directing Paquita’s litany of insults — “Filthy rat / Crawling animal / Scum of life” — at the ex-president and his supporters.Raised in a poor family in Alto Lucero, Veracruz, Paquita was born Francisca Viveros Barradas on April 2, 1947. She moved to Mexico City in the 1970s and performed duets with her sister Viola, covering boleros by Julio Jaramillo and Daniel Santos.Eventually, she started a restaurant and concert venue in the Colonia Guerrero neighborhood, where she cooked, sang and became “something of a patron saint” for the area, as the New York Times put it in a 1999 dispatch from the city. Her stage name, which can be translated as “Paquita From the Block,” emphasized her neighborhood roots.Paquita gained national exposure in 1986, when she sang on a Televisa variety show, and soon signed a record deal with CBS. By the late 2000s, she was performing in front of sold-out crowds at Madison Square Garden in New York, opening for fellow ranchera star Vicente Fernández.Amid a nationwide debate over gay rights in Mexico, she made headlines in 2010 when she told a reporter she’d rather see a child die on the streets than be adopted by a same-sex couple. She apologized days later, saying that a majority of her friends were gay and that her comments were the result of her “poor education.” As part of her apology, she arranged to perform at a gay nightclub, Spartacus, that one of her friends owned just outside Mexico City.The controversy seemed to have little effect on her career. She was the subject of a 2017 television show, a drama inspired by her life, and ran for office in 2021, unsuccessfully campaigning for a seat in the Veracruz state legislature as a member of the center-left Citizens’ Movement.Paquita was nominated for two Latin Grammy Awards and three Grammy Awards, most recently in 2013 for her album “Romeo y su Nieta.” In 2021, she was awarded a lifetime achievement prize at the Billboard Latin Music Awards, where she shared the stage with performers including Mexican singer Ana Bárbara, who had praised Paquita as “a woman that’s closed gaps and has carved new paths for artists like me.” The award was presented by Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whom Paquita teasingly called “inútil,” “useless,” as he tried to adjust the microphone during her acceptance speech.Information on survivors was not immediately available. Paquita had two sons from her first marriage, which ended in divorce, and three children from her second, to Alfonso Martínez. The couple separated but remained married for more than 30 years, until Martínez’s death in 2000.For all the spiteful anthems and vengeful lyrics she made famous, Paquita had a soft spot for tender ballads, including traditional songs that she grew up hearing in Veracruz.“There’s a song called ‘A Que Negar’ (Why Deny), which I love to sing,” she told Billboard in 2001. “It says, ‘Why deny that you once loved me? Why do you want to erase our past? You know you still love me. Even though you swear everything is over.’ ”",
