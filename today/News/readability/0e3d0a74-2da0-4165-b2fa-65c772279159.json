South Korea will go to the polls on June 3 to select a new president.The country's export-led economy has also been struck by the trade war turmoil. While U.S. President Donald Trump had temporarily suspended his blanket \"reciprocal tariffs\" on April 9, South Korea is still subject to a 25% tariff on steel and automobiles, which are some of the country's largest exports to the U.S.South Korea's Hyundai and Kia are among the top eight best-selling brands in the U.S. The country is also the fourth largest exporter of steel to the U.S.The GDP release also comes as a South Korean team heads to the U.S. for trade talks, with acting president Han reportedly saying that he expects talks with the U.S to pave the way for a mutually beneficial outcome.South Korea's ministry of trade, industry and economy said on Thursday the agenda for the meeting with the U.S. is being coordinated and not yet finalized.This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",
