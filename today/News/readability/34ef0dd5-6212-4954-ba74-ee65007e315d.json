Residents reported a blackout and sounds of explosions on Friday.Credit...Anindito Mukherjee/Getty ImagesMay 9, 2025Updated 8:53 p.m. ETThe Pakistani military accused India early Saturday of launching air-to-surface missiles that targeted at least three air bases across Pakistan, in what appeared to be a sharp escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors four days into their armed confrontation.Among the bases that came under attack, Pakistan said, was a key installation near the capital, Islamabad. Witnesses in Rawalpindi, a nearby garrison city, reported hearing at least three loud explosions near the Noor Khan air base, with one describing a “large fireball” visible from miles away.“Now, you just wait for our response,” Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s chief spokesman, said in a televised statement. He accused India of pushing the region toward a “dangerous war.”Shortly after the reported Indian strikes, Pakistani officials said they had launched a retaliatory action targeting several locations in India, including air bases and a missile storage facility.“An eye for an eye,” the Pakistani military said in a statement. It said it was calling its campaign against India “Operation Bunyan al-Marsus,” which means a firm and compact structure.After several days of shelling and drone attacks, India and Pakistan, old enemies, are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades. And they are using new tools of war to enhance their ability to attack and spy on each other.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
