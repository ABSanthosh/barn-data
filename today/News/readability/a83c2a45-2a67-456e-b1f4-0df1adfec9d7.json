TikTok / @zaviertorrenceIn the 5-second clip, uploaded on Dec. 2, Torrence covered his nose from the strong scent that took over the plane.“Why are we eating a tuna melt on a flight?!?” he captioned the viral clip with over 706,000 views.The Florida resident didn’t point out who the tuna lover was but said he wished they opted out of eating it during the flight.The passenger ate a tuna sandwich on the flight. chandlervid85 – stock.adobe.comMany travelers resonated with Torrence’s disgust in the fishy meal, while others believe people should eat as long as it doesn’t carry a smell.“I have a 10-hour flight coming up…you expect people not to eat during a flight?” questioned one woman.“Hell yeah, I’m eating. Just not a tuna melt,” admitted another.“Tuna on a plane is crazy, but they can eat whatever they want,” one watcher chimed in.“Fish of any kind on a plane is diabolical,” commented one person.“Imma eat, but like Cheez-Its or jerky. I’m so self-aware on planes I could never,” confessed a traveler.The fishy odor was an unpleasant scent for fellow passengers. andrey – stock.adobe.com“Scented food is a crime, what do you mean a tuna melt?” demanded a TikToker.However, some passengers didn’t seem to care about flight etiquette and chose to eat whatever their appetite deserved.Previously reported by The Post, a female flyer experienced the ultimate inflight faux pas after witnessing her seatmate devour a can of tuna in the air. She detailed the flying fish incident in a TikTok video with over 1.2 million views.“Canned tuna on the plane gotta be up there in terms of crimes against humanity,” lamented the TikTokker, named Ally, in the caption.She was reportedly flying from Anchorage, Alaska to Seattle, Washington, when her neighbor opened a can of tuna 10 minutes into the flight, per a follow-up clip.“I catch it out of the corner of my eye and I’m like ‘That better not be what I think it is,’” she said, but unfortunately it was.Most airlines allow passengers to bring food on the plane, as long as they are solid and purchased after the security check. However, when it comes to the smell, there are no direct guidelines, just the courtesy to be mindful of your fellow passengers.",
