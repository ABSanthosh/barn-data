  "text": "President Trump said he would not deport Harry because he already has enough problems because of his wife Meghan Markle.President Donald Trump unwittingly dropped a major hint about the marital problems of Harry and Meghan Markle as he, in an interview with the New York Post, said he has no interest in pursuing the visa case against Harry. \"I'll leave him alone. He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible,\" Donald Trump said without naming Meghan Markle. A lot has been discussed about Harry and Meghan's marriage problems with insiders claiming that they are on the verge of a divorce.Vanity Fair did a cover story about the ex-royals in which they claimed that Meghan Markle was approached to write a \"post-divorce\" book though there was no such scenario on the horizon. Then there were speculations that they were separating their professional lives -- with Meghan Markle focussing on her shows and entrepreneurial works and Harry remaining busy with his philanthropic works. But Harry and Meghan made several joint appearances since then -- they visited relief centers in Los Angeles to help the fire victims; they appeared together to launch the Invictus Games in Vancouver Saturday. Donald Trump always hated Meghan Markle; his old video with Joe Morgan viralIn 2022, Donald Trump spoke about Harry and Meghan on the Piers Morgan show and said he was never a fan of Meghan Markle.\"I'm not a fan of Meghan, I'm not a fan, and I wasn't right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.,\" Trump said in the old interview.\"Do you think it's going to end?\" Piers Morgan asked. \"I do, I've been a very good predictor, as you know, I've predicted almost everything, it'll end, and it'll end bad,\" the former president replied. \"I wonder if Harry's going to go back on his hands and knees and say please. You know, I think Harry's been led down a path.\"\"I would, the only thing I disagree with the Queen on, probably one of the only things ever, is that I think she should have said, 'If that's your choice fine, but you no longer have titles and frankly don't come around,'\" Trump said. \"He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he's an embarrassment.\"Why could Harry be deported? What is the visa case?After stepping down as royals, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle settled in the US, in Montecito. After Harry's memoir Spare was published, he was accused of lying in his visa form as in his book, he admitted to taking marijuana, cocaine, and psychedelic drugs. Every US visa applicant has to give information about their drug history. Either Harry lied about drugs in the form or he was given preferential treatment, the lawsuit claimed demanding Harry's visa records. But the judge ruled in favor of Harry that his visa records would remain private. Donald Trump could have pursued the case and Harry-Meghan reportedly expected that but Trump said he would leave Harry alone.",
