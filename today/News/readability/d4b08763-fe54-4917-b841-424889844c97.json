  "text": "Tesla CEO and department of government efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk on Tuesday hosted the US President-elect Donald Trump at SpaceX's South Texas facility near the Mexican border. Trump observed attentively as Musk, using a model, explained the test procedures for the Starship rocket launch. The president-elect then watched the lift-off under the bright sunlight.The launch experienced complications when the reusable booster, unlike its previous test last month, failed to return to the launch pad. Instead, it was guided to land in the Gulf of Mexico.The launch event highlighted the growing alliance between them, with potential implications for American politics, governance, foreign policy, and space exploration, including potential human missions to Mars.Having contributed approximately $200 million towards Trump's victory over Democrat Kamala Harris, Musk has gained unprecedented access. He has advised on administration appointments, participated in Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and been selected to co-lead an advisory panel on reducing federal bureaucracy.Musk stands to gain personally from this relationship. His company SpaceX holds government contracts worth billions and aims to establish a Martian colony. As Tesla's CEO, he manages electric vehicle production and has faced regulatory challenges regarding autonomous driving safety.\"Stop the Swamp!\" he wrote on Tuesday as he shared a warning that entrenched Washington interests are trying to undermine Trump before his inauguration.In September, Musk addressed speculation about his support for Trump, posting on X, \"There is no quid pro quo. With a Trump administration, we can execute major government reform, remove bureaucratic paperwork that is smothering the country and unlock a new age of prosperity.\"Their relationship has evolved significantly. Two years ago, Trump criticised Musk at rallies, while Musk suggested Trump should \"hang up his hat \u0026 sail into the sunset.\"Recently, Musk has become integral to Trump's inner circle, appearing more prominent than even Ohio senator JD Vance. Trump now regularly praises Musk's achievements at campaign events.At Mar-a-Lago on election night, Musk's presence was notable. Trump's granddaughter Kai Trump shared a photograph with Musk at a Trump golf resort, noting his \"achieving uncle status.\"At a recent black-tie event at Mar-a-Lago, Trump praised Musk's intelligence and character, highlighting how Musk prioritised campaign support over rocket launches. Trump joked about Musk's frequent presence, saying, \"He likes this place. I can't get him out of here... And you know what, I like having him here.\"Regarding the election outcome, Musk said, \"The public has given us a mandate that could not be more clear.\"",
