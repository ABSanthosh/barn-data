  "text": "Representative image (Picture credit: Copilot AI)A 59-year-old man was killed by a group of dogs on Wednesday evening in Albany, New York, in a backyard next to a house where around two dozen dogs were kept, according to police.The incident occurred at a residence on Central Avenue in Schenectady, where James Provost was fatally attacked by eight to nine mixed-breed pit bull dogs.Albany police arrived at the scene around 6 pm after receiving reports of an active dog attack.Upon arrival, officers found Provost being attacked by the dogs. One officer discharged his weapon, hitting one of the dogs and causing the others to disperse. Despite efforts to stop the attack, Provost was pronounced dead at the scene.A total of 24 dogs, including 15 puppies, were found at the residence and have been taken to the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society. The dogs' owner, who resides in Cohoes, was not present at the time of the attack. Police chief Eric Hawkins mentioned that the dogs were not kept in a traditional family setting, but their exact purpose is still unknown.“There are so many unanswered questions that we’re trying to sift through,” Hawkins said.Provost's connection to the dogs or their owner is unclear. Nearby witnesses reported hearing him shout for help during the attack.The investigation is ongoing as authorities work to understand how Provost ended up in the yard and the overall circumstances surrounding the case. They have also indicated that criminal charges against the owner may be possible.“We’re going to do everything we can to bring justice for this person who was viciously attacked,” Hawkins added.Officials had previously seized dogs from the same residence in May during a search related to drug activity, although the dogs were not the primary focus of that investigation.",
