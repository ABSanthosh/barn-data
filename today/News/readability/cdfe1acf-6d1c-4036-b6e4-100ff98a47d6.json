  "text": "Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Wednesday that US will begin revoking visas of some Chinese students, \"including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.” Rubio announced in a post on X, saying the state department would “aggressively” revoke visas. China is the second-largest source of international students in the US. During the 2023–2024 academic year, over 270,000 Chinese students were enrolled in UAS institutions, nearly a quarter of all international students.Growing uncertainty for international studentsThe announcement follows a series of actions this week that have added to growing uncertainty for international students. On Tuesday, Rubio suspended the scheduling of new visa interviews as the state department drafts stricter guidelines, including increased surveillance of students' social media activity.The crackdown has intensified concerns among international students, who are already facing pressure under US President Donald Trump’s administration. Critics have accused the administration of using national security as a pretext to reduce foreign student presence on US campuses.Trump vs HarvadThe visa revocations come just days after the Trump administration attempted to block Harvard University from enrolling any international students, a move now paused by a federal judge pending litigation. On Wednesday, Trump defended the effort, telling reporters, “Harvard should limit international student enrollment to around 15%. I want to make sure the foreign students are people that can love our country.”The administration has already drawn backlash for earlier immigration actions, including the arrest and attempted deportation of students involved in pro-Palestine campus protests and the abrupt termination and later partial reinstatement of legal protections for thousands of international students.'We’re treated as threats'The evolving policies have left many students in limbo, worried not only about their visas but also about their safety and future in the US.“There’s a growing fear among us,” said one graduate student from China who asked not to be named. “We came here to learn and contribute. Now we’re treated as threats.”Universities, advocacy groups, and immigration experts have voiced concerns that these measures may deter top talent from coming to the US, eroding the country’s status as a global education hub.",
