He can appeal against the sentencing. DNA evidence indicated the two men had an intimate physical relationship, but the court gave no finding on the motive for the killing.During the trial, witnesses testified to hearing the housemates in an argument and later seeing Odhiambo move the metal box.Justice Reuben Nyakundi said during the ruling that Odhiambo had planned the murder, waiting until the two returned home from a nightclub. Chiloba had marks on his hands, showing that he had tried to fight back, Nyakundi said.LGBTQ+ people have decried discrimination and attacks in Kenya, but police ruled out the possibility that the killing was a hate crime.",
