  "text": "Camarillo, California on Thursday (AP)Federal immigration officials said Friday that approximately 200 people suspected of being in the US illegally were arrested during raids on two marijuana farms in California. The operations, which took place on Thursday in Carpinteria and Camarillo, led to a tense standoff between protesters and authorities at one of the sites, according to the Associated Press.The raids were carried out by federal agents, and a chaotic scene unfolded outside Glass House Farms in Camarillo as large crowds gathered to inquire about their loved ones and protest the immigration enforcement. Glass House, which cultivates tomatoes, cucumbers, and licensed marijuana, stated that authorities had valid warrants.“Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,” the farm said in a statement.In a separate statement, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said agents had executed criminal search warrants at both locations. At least 10 immigrant children were reportedly present during the raids.Four US citizens were arrested on charges of “assaulting or resisting officers,” according to the department. Authorities also announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired at federal agents during the operation.The raids began Thursday morning when immigration officers arrived at the farms. Workers alerted their families, prompting relatives and immigrant advocates to travel to the Camarillo location, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Many gathered outside to demand information and protest the operation.Federal agents in camouflage uniforms, helmets, and gas masks set up a roadblock leading to the farm’s greenhouses. Protesters shouted at the agents, and smoke from canisters forced the crowd to retreat. It was unclear whether the agents deployed tear gas or other chemical agents.Ventura County fire authorities reported receiving 911 calls from people struggling to breathe. Several individuals were rushed to local hospitals.The family of Jaime Alanis, a tomato picker who had worked at the farm for over a decade, said he phoned his wife in Mexico during the raid, telling her he was hiding on the property with others as immigration agents arrived.According to his niece, Yesenia, Alanis is suffering from a fractured skull, a broken neck, and a ruptured artery supplying blood to the brain. “They told us he won’t make it and to say goodbye,” she said, as reported by AP.During the operation, several workers were arrested and transported by bus. Others, including US citizens, were detained at the site for several hours as the investigation continued.In its Friday statement, DHS said the investigation into potential immigration and child labor violations at the farm is ongoing. Authorities have not disclosed further details about the specific allegations.Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated, “We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who assaults or doxes federal law enforcement.”",
