The city council recently voted 4-1 to demolish the shopping center in favor of two high-rise apartment buildings.“We all hate it here in Carlsbad, it’s going to make our little village more of a bunch of condos instead of a village, so it’s taking away that community feel, so we’re sad about it,” said Christy Cunningham, a resident of Carlsbad. Lawson-Remer skirts county on superfund site for Tijuana River Valley “Most people are angry, I mean, it seems like the citizens of Carlsbad city don’t want it, but city council said we’re going to do it anyway,” said Randy Sager, who also lives in Carlsbad.The council did not have much of a choice due to state law that requires California cities to provide a certain amount of housing, including low-income.Among other things, Carlsbad Village Plaza has the only grocery store within miles of the area.“In other words, what can you do? Why does it matter? What is city council for if the state can do what they want?” Sager added. 2025 weddings in limbo as Imperial Beach venue’s lease expires next month “It makes me really sad. I live in the area, I work very close, I’m here on a run for the Boys and Girls Club, I work there and this is where we get a lot of stuff for our kids,” said Abby Snyder.“We have a big retirement community here, and this is the only store, a lot of people don’t have cars and this is the only store they can reach,” Benjamin White, another resident, said. “So, if it shuts down, where are they going to shop?”A lot of people will be traveling farther after this place disappears, but not everyone is heartbroken.“You know what? I’m not mad about it, actually,” said Michael Harris, who also lives in Carlsbad. “This place is pretty old now.”“It’s going to affect a lot of people, not just the people who work here but the people who shop here, we have quite a few senior citizens who use this stuff,” said Sager. “The pharmacy, the bakery, the hardware store, the grocery store, and it’s all going away. They’re upset and rightfully so. They call it progress, I guess.”The two apartment buildings going up in place of the shopping complex will include 213 units, with 27 set aside for low-income people. Their leases are expected to end in 2026.Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
