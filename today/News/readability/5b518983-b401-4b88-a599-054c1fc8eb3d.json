  "text": "Bryan Kohberger declined to share his reason behind the horrific killings of the Idaho Four at his Wednesday, July 23, sentencing hearing – but former FBI agent Jennifer Coffindaffer has a theory.Kohberger, 30, killed Ethan Chapin, 20, Xana Kernodle, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, in the early hours of November 13, 2022, but his attacks against Goncalves were particularly gruesome.According to released reports on the case, she was stabbed more than 30 times and the structure of her face itself was left so “extremely damaged” in the attack that one of her surviving roommates misidentified her body to police. Aside from the knife wounds, there was also evidence of blunt force trauma and strangling in the autopsy report.Coffindaffer suggested in an interview with TMZ that Kohberger’s violence against Goncalves was because he’d broken into their home to rape Mogen, but he became enraged when he found Goncalves in bed with her.“Kaylee ruined his plans on how the night would go, that’s why her face was completely disfigured,” she surmised.Latah County Jail/MEGAKohberger was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for the slayings of the four students. At the hearing, Kaylee’s mother, Kristi, issued a scathing statement to her daughter’s killer.“A dead killer doesn’t kill again. So while I’m disappointed that the firing squad won’t take their shots at you, I’m confident the men in prison will have their way with you in more ways than one,” she said in a video that has since been shared to X. “You will finally get what you wanted, physical touch, just probably not how you were expecting it.”“See you haven’t beat the system, you’ve simply entered a new one where the rules are cruel and the consequences will never end,” she continued. “You are entering a place where no one will care about who you are and no one will ever respect you. You will be forgotten, discarded, used and erased. You will always be remembered as a loser and an absolute failure.”Kaylee’s sister Alivea also took aim at Kohberger in court in her own victim impact statement, per CNN.“You want the truth? Here’s the one you’ll hate the most,” she told him. “If you hadn’t attacked them in their sleep, in the middle of the night, like a pedophile, Kaylee would’ve kicked your f**king ass.”Steve Goncalves, Kaylee’s father, also insulted Kohberger’s intelligence for getting caught so easily.“Police officers tell us within minutes they had your DNA. Like a calling card,” he said at the time. “You were that careless. That foolish. That stupid. Master degree? You’re a joke. Complete joke.”",
