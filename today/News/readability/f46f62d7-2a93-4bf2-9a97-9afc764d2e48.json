  "text": "IDF has ordered to stop Gaza-bound aid ship carrying Greta ThunbergIsrael’s foreign ministry on Monday slammed ships heading to Gaza, calling them a \"media gimmick\" disguised as humanitarian aid. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and others are aboard the yacht Madleen, which set sail from Sicily on June 1 aiming to break the naval blockade off Gaza’s coast to deliver what they describe as symbolic aid. However, Israel has called the mission illegal and provocative, warning that the vessel will not be allowed to reach the territory, as the sea route is closed to unauthorised vessels due to security concerns.“With recent reports of a ‘celebrities yacht’ heading to Gaza, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to clarify the following,” the ministry posted on X. “The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law.”“The yacht is claiming that it is delivering humanitarian aid. In fact, it is a media gimmick for publicity (which includes less than a single truckload of aid) – a ‘selfie yacht’.”On board the vessel are 11 activists, including Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament of Palestinian descent who has been barred from entering Israel. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), which is behind the mission, says it aims to highlight the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.Israel claimed that they were in communication with the vessel and instructed it to \"change its course.\"According to a video released on Madleen’s official Telegram channel, the Israeli military had intercepted and boarded the vessel. Activists were seen donning life jackets in preparation for interception.Israeli defence minister Israel Katz had instructed the military to prevent the ship from reaching Gaza’s shores. “I have instructed the IDF to act so that the hate flotilla does not reach the shores of Gaza and to take all necessary measures to that end,” he said in a statement.“To the antisemitic Greta and her friends who echo Hamas propaganda, I say clearly: You’d better turn back – because you will not reach Gaza,\" Katz added.Thunberg said before departing, “We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying. Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity.”The Israeli foreign ministry maintains that aid is already being sent into Gaza through official channels. “Over the past two weeks, more than 1,200 aid trucks have entered Gaza from Israel. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has distributed close to 11 million meals directly to civilians,” it said on X.Critics argue that the aid system is flawed. More than 110 Palestinians have reportedly been killed while trying to access food since 27 May, with thousands more injured, reports the Guardian.",
