  "text": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed renewed interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case, calling it “pretty boring stuff” and saying he didn’t understand why many of his own supporters were so focused on it.Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania after an event, Trump reacted to questions about ongoing uproar within his base following the release of a Justice department and FBI memo last week. The memo said Epstein had no client list and confirmed he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019.“I don’t understand it, why they would be so interested. He’s been dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life. I don’t understand what the interest and what the fascination is. I really don’t. And the credible information has been given,” Trump said.He added, “I don’t understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It’s pretty boring stuff. It’s sordid, but it’s boring. And I don’t understand why it keeps going. I think really only pretty bad people, including fake news, want to keep something like that going.”Despite Trump's remarks, many within the MAGA movement remain unsatisfied with the government’s findings. The absence of a \"client list\" in the memo has fuelled speculation among conspiracy theorists, who have long believed that high-profile Democrats and celebrities were connected to pedophile Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking network.Anger has also been directed at US attorney general Pam Bondi, with people for her removal over what they claim is a lack of transparency around the Epstein files. Bondi had previously said in a February interview that an Epstein client list was “sitting on” her “desk” for review. She has since clarified that she was referring more broadly to files connected to the case.On Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi but said she should move forward with any disclosures that can be verified.“But she’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her whatever she thinks is credible, she should release,” Trump said.In early June, tech billionaire Elon Musk and Trump's former right-hand man reignited controversy by suggesting that the MAGA chief's name appears in the unreleased Epstein files, claiming this was the real reason they had not been made public. Musk first made the allegation on X, saying ,“Time to drop the really big bomb… @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” before later deleting the post. He has since called on the White House to release all related documents, demanding full transparency.Epstein had faced multiple accusations of trafficking underage girls and was known to associate with powerful figures such as Trump, former US President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew of Britain, and several wealthy elites. His long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the abuse. His death is still debated by many, with conspiracy theories claiming he was murdered to protect high-profile individuals. Despite official rulings that he died by suicide in his New York jail cell in 2019, questions around security failures and missing footage have fuelled public suspicion and kept the controversy alive.",
