  "text": "President Donald Trump’s return to the White House is already generating turbulence at the Pentagon, where newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth got to work Monday on a mission to shake up the U.S. military and align it more closely with the returning president’s “America First” agenda.Hegseth, just days after his historically narrow confirmation vote, promised to roll back diversity programs, use the military to block migrants from entering the United States illegally and hold the Biden administration accountable for perceived foreign policy failures. He begins his assignment as what the White House has lauded as a long-overdue “disrupter.”“There are more executive orders coming,” Hegseth said, referencing measures to eliminate diversity efforts and to reinstate military personnel fired during the Biden years for rejecting a coronavirus vaccine mandate. “Our job is lethality and readiness and warfighting.”Hegseth, a former National Guard soldier and Fox News host, is already demonstrating that intent, posting a handwritten note on defense secretary stationery Sunday vowing there would be “no exceptions, name-changes, or delays” in the Pentagon’s enforcement of an administration-wide effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. “Those who do not comply will no longer work here,” he wrote.He spoke as the new administration plunges ahead with steps already pulling America’s armed forces more deeply into politically charged issues, including decisions to deploy troops to secure the southern border to counter what Trump has called an “invasion” of immigrants and his move to fire the first woman to lead the U.S. Coast Guard for, among other cited grievances, an “excessive focus” on diversity issues.Hegseth rose to prominence championing some of Trump’s preferred military causes, advocating for lenient treatment of service members accused of war crimes and pushing back against what he has decried as “woke” military policies. Now he takes charge at the Pentagon after a divisive confirmation process that aired allegations of heavy drinking, sexual assault and mismanagement of the veterans advocacy organizations he once led. Hegseth vehemently denied wrongdoing and during his confirmation hearing blamed “anonymous smears” in addressing some of the accusations.How far Hegseth will go in pushing his previously voiced views remains unclear. While he has been an ardent opponent of the 2015 decision to let women serve in combat units, Hegseth appeared to mute those views after being tapped by Trump.Speaking outside the Pentagon, Hegseth, 44, said that “every moment that I’m here” he would be thinking about the “guys and gals in Guam and Germany, in Fort Benning, in Fort Bragg,” using the former titles of Army installations that were renamed during the Biden administration because they honored Confederate generals.Aspects of the administration’s agenda are already creating uneasiness in the ranks as military officials, as they have done in the past, seek to adapt to their new elected leaders and, in this case, attempt to interpret new diversity and personnel guidance that is accompanied by the threat of discipline or dismissal.Among those most affected could be Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who welcomed Hegseth to the building Monday and whom the new secretary criticized at length before Trump chose Hegseth for the defense secretary role. Asked by a reporter if he would fire the veteran Air Force officer, who stood next to him, the new secretary patted Brown’s arm.“Standing with him right now,” Hegseth said. “Look forward to working with him.”The Trump administration is also expected to issue an executive order addressing the role of transgender troops in the military, the president said in remarks Monday evening, vowing “we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military.” The New York Post reported on Trump’s plans earlier.The early effects of the nascent anti-diversity drive were also evident in the military services, where officials remained uncertain of which programs and topics would be off-limits in the Hegseth-era Pentagon.Officials in the Army temporarily removed the service’s sexual assault prevention policy from its home online Thursday, in what appeared to be a confused attempt to comply with orders to remove diversity-related content from public-facing websites. The policy was later restored after queries by Military.com.On Friday, an unofficial Facebook group frequented by Air Force members posted an excerpt from a message that showed service officials had pulled blocks of training for recruits that included videos about the Tuskegee Airmen and the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), trailblazing groups typically celebrated by U.S. military officials. The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of mostly African American pilots who fought in World War II, while the WASP was a group of female pilots who tested aircraft in the United States, freeing male counterparts to fight in the war.Air Force officials acknowledged Saturday that the videos had been removed from the training curriculum, citing the way they were intertwined in courses now under review. The videos “were not the direct focus of course removal actions,” said a service official who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the issue’s sensitivity.As backlash grew, Lt. Gen. Brian S. Robinson, commander of Air Education and Training Command, denied in a separate statement Sunday that any content “highlighting the honor and valor” of the Tuskegee Airmen or WASP had been removed from recruit training. Rather, Robinson said, the block of training “included DEI material which was directed to be removed,” and the recruits involved will now receive revised training that still includes information about the Tuskegee Airmen and WASP, but with other changes made.No recruits “will miss this block of instruction due to the revision, however one group of trainees had the training delayed,” Robinson said in his statement, adding that revised training would begin Monday.Supporters of the Trump administration responded angrily to the flurry of negative stories, accusing Air Force officials attempting to make Trump look bad.Sen. Katie Boyd Britt (R-Alabama), a staunch Trump backer, posted on social media Sunday evening that she had “no doubt Secretary Hegseth will correct and get to the bottom of the malicious compliance we’ve seen in recent days.” She noted that Trump recognized the Tuskegee Airmen during his first term in office, promoting one of its members, Charles McGee, to the rank of brigadier general during a ceremony in the Oval Office.Within minutes, Hegseth responded to Britt with a post of his own, saying: “Amen! We’re all over it Senator. This will not stand.” Hours later, he said in another post that the decision had been reversed.Underscoring the sensitivity, the Air Force’s top officer, Gen. David Allvin, weighed in with a statement Monday, saying that he wanted to “dispel a rumor” and stress that lessons about the Tuskegee Airmen and WASPs had not been removed from basic training. “From day one,” Allvin said, he directed Air Force officials to implement directives from the new president “swiftly and professionally — no equivocation, no slow-rolling, no foot dragging.”One defense official familiar with the Air Force matter voiced exasperation over how the situation has played out. In attempting to adhere to the incoming administration’s murky policy, this official said, commanders ran afoul of political appointees’ desires.“It’s almost like you’re danged if you do, and you’re danged if you don’t,” the official said.Even before Trump’s swearing-in, many military leaders — cognizant of his record of bucking norms governing presidential treatment of the armed forces — were preparing for a disruptive period.As comments from those around Trump in the lead-up to the inauguration suggested the potential for a personnel purge, senior military officials approached Pentagon leaders to ask whether they should prepare a contingency plan in case they were fired, according to an official with knowledge of the matter. They were told to focus on their normal activities.Also ahead of the inauguration, before the Trump transition team signed memos officially launching the transition process, at least three four-star officers approached the transition team, said a person directly familiar with the outreach. The moves were interpreted by the transition team as jockeying for favor in the event that firings of senior officials created opportunities for advancement.Trump’s unorthodox way of doing business — including his decision to make the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, a key informal adviser and the head of a pseudo-governmental efficiency initiative — has likewise generated unusual dynamics at the Pentagon and opportunities for speculation.After Musk posted on his social media platform, X, about a Nov. 25 meeting with “senior military officials,” the identity of the officials remained a mystery, with the Pentagon’s then-press secretary professing ignorance and noting that the transition process had not officially begun.Gen. Randy George, the Army’s top officer, chose not to disclose that it was he who had met with Musk — whose businesses, including SpaceX, do extensive work with the military — to then-Army Secretary Christine Wormuth or to then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, according to officials familiar with the matter.Col. Dave Butler, a spokesman for George, said that Army leaders “often meet with defense industry leaders.”“Our meeting with Musk was scheduled well before the election and focused on issues related to maintaining the most capable army in the world,” Butler said.Musk could not be immediately reached for comment.Such incidents reflect the atypical nature of the transition period following Trump’s Nov. 5 electoral win, which included the president-elect issuing policy pronouncements on social media, hosting foreign leaders at his Mar-a-Lago residence and announcing Cabinet picks before subjecting them to standard vetting procedures.Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University, said that while every administration brings a degree of suspicion to the military and government employees it inherits, the Trump team’s promises to shake up the Defense Department and potentially fire individual officers “is causing the military to be extra special careful … in terms of ‘You can trust us.’”“So there’s a little more pressure than there would be in other situations,” he said.",
