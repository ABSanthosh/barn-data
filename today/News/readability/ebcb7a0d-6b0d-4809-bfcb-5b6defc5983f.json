  "text": "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and her French counterpart, Jean-Noël Barrot, met in Damascus on Friday with Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in one of the highest-level Western diplomatic engagements with the fledgling government since President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster last month.Baerbock said in a statement earlier Friday that their talks with Sharaa, on behalf of the European Union, would set conditions for Syria to resume relations with Germany and the European Union. The statement mentioned the inclusion of all Syrians in the political process regardless of gender, ethnicity or religion, among other conditions.“We know where HTS comes from ideologically, what it has done in the past,” she said, referring to Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamist former rebel group that Sharaa leads, and a former al-Qaeda affiliate. “But we also hear and see the desire for moderation and for understanding with other important actors.” The two ministers were also expected to meet with representatives of Syrian civil society.“Despite all our skepticism, we must not let the opportunity to support the people of Syria at this important crossroads slip away,” Baerbock added.The E.U. considers HTS to be a terrorist organization — as does the United States — although Washington lifted a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, shortly after the rebel takeover in early December. But the group has sought to assure other nations since it took power, including in the West, that it is a leadership partner they can work with. The interim government seeks the lifting of Western sanctions imposed on the Assad government and international aid to rebuild vast areas of the country destroyed during a nearly 13-year civil war.The two ministers also visited Sednaya, an Assad-era military prison notorious for torture and the disappearance of thousands of inmates.“A little less than a month ago, new hope was born thanks to the mobilization of Syrians, the hope of a sovereign, stable and peaceful Syria,” Barrot said during a visit to the French Embassy in Damascus, which closed during the early days of Syria’s civil war, according to the Associated Press. “It is a real hope, but it is a fragile hope.”Here’s what else to knowIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Thursday that he has authorized a delegation of the Israel Defense Forces, the Mossad intelligence agency and the Shin Bet internal security agency to continue negotiations in Doha, Qatar, on a Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged Israel to speed up approval for medical evacuations from Gaza, noting that just 5,383 people have been allowed to leave the besieged enclave since the war began. “At this rate, it would take 5-10 years” to evacuate the more than 12,000 critically ill patients still requiring medical evacuation, he posted on X.Basic services such as education, water and health care have been severely disrupted in the city of Jenin, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, for nearly a month since Palestinian forces began operations targeting militants there, the United Nations humanitarian affairs office said. Eleven were killed in clashes, including two children, between Dec. 24 and 30, the office said.The Israeli police and IDF said Friday that they had apprehended a person who appeared to be smuggling drugs from Israel into Gaza via drone. In the joint announcement, the police and IDF said “a number” of similar attempts had been “recently observed.”",
