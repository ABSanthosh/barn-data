  "text": "Representative Image (Picture Credit: X)BrucePac, a US based ready-to-eat meat and poultry items producer, has recalled 9.9 million pounds of food due to possible listeria contamination, the US Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday, as reported by CNN.The contamination was discovered by the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service during routine testing of finished poultry products.BrucePac’s ready-to-eat chicken was identified as the source of the listeria, potentially affecting other meat and poultry products produced between June 19 and October 8.Listeria bacteria can cause listeriosis (a type of food poisoning), which is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the US. Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, and fatigue, and in more severe cases, it can cause a stiff neck, confusion, headaches, or seizures. People most vulnerable to severe illness are older adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.So far, no confirmed cases of illness have been linked to the recalled products, but the USDA said that symptoms can take up to 10 weeks to appear, and some people may recover without ever being tested for listeria.The recalled products were distributed to restaurants and institutions all over the country and may have been used in ready-to-eat items which are currently \"on store shelves or in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers,\" according to the USDA.“Restaurants, institutions, and other establishments are urged not to serve or use these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase,” the USDA said. “Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.”This recall comes after a deadly listeria outbreak linked to Boar’s Head deli meats, which has resulted in 59 hospitalisations and 10 deaths since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began investigating in July, making it the largest listeria outbreak in over a decade.",
