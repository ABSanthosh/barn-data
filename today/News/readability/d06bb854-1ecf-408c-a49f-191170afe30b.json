Putin revealed no breakthroughs after a two-hour call with President Trump on Monday, telling reporters that he was ready to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine but repeating his demand for broad concessions before Russia stops fighting.Mr. Putin said he had told Mr. Trump that Russia was “ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace agreement.” Mr. Putin said the conversation, the third known call between the presidents since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, was “very meaningful and quite frank.”But the Russian president made it clear that he was not budging from his basic resistance to an immediate cease-fire if it is not accompanied by concessions to Russia. At the end of his three-minute statement, Putin repeated his mantra that a peace deal needs to “remove the root causes of this crisis,” a reference to Russia’s demand for wide-ranging influence over Ukraine.“Russia is also in favor of a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine crisis,” Mr. Putin said in his brief statement to reporters in Sochi, Russia. “We just need to identify the most effective ways of moving toward peace.”Shortly after Mr. Putin’s statement, Mr. Trump offered a more optimistic take on the call in a social media post, saying it “went very well,” and that Russia and Ukraine would “immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.”Mr. Putin said his aides might disclose more details of the call later in the day. The Russian president spoke to reporters at a center for gifted children that he was visiting on Monday and where he held the call with Mr. Trump.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
