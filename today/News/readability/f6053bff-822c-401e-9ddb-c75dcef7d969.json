That much was clear from the thunderous applause and cheers on Sunday as Pope Francis made his first public appearance since leaving a Rome hospital two weeks ago.Francis arrived, unannounced, on the dais in St. Peter’s Square near the end of a Mass that was part of a pilgrimage by health care workers and their patients.The pope said very few words, his voice still strained after a six-week hospital stay for pneumonia and other problems that his doctors said twice brought him close to death.“Happy Sunday to everyone, many thanks,” Francis said, waving his hands. A nasal cannula was visible in both nostrils; Francis continues to rely on supplemental oxygen, the Vatican has said.Sitting on a wheelchair pushed by his trusted nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, Francis moved through groups of pilgrims — including dozens of doctors and nurses from around the world — who had come the Vatican on Sunday for this weekend’s Jubilee of the Sick and Health Care Workers.“What a wonderful surprise — the pope still has health problems but he wanted to give a gift to the faithful,” said Lamberto Rosa, a businessman who volunteers with the Order of Malta at some Vatican events. “He has a fighting spirit and wants to be present.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
