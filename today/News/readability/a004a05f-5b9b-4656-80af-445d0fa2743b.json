They launched a missile at Israel overnight.A cloud of smoke billowed on Tuesday after an airstrike on Yemen’s capital, Sana.Credit...Mohammed Huwais/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDec. 31, 2024Updated 12:47 p.m. ETThe U.S. military said on Tuesday that it had carried out a series of strikes on the Houthis, the Iranian-backed group in Yemen, as the group suggested it would continue attacking Israel and ships in the Red Sea if there was no cease-fire in Gaza.It was not immediately clear whether the strikes would be a setback for the Houthis, who have remained undeterred even as they have come under attack from the United States and Israel.The Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and attacking commercial vessels they claim are headed for Israel in solidarity with their ally, Hamas, in Gaza.The U.S. military’s Central Command said on X that it had conducted “multiple precision strikes” on Houthi targets in Sana, Yemen’s capital, and coastal sites on Monday and Tuesday. It said the targets included a command and control facility and centers for weapons production and storage.A video posted by the command, which directs U.S. military combat forces in the Middle East, showed F/A-18 Hornets and a F-35 Joint Strike Fighter carrying bombs under their wings, launching at night from an aircraft carrier. It also showed the daytime launch of two missiles from an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, which typically carries Tomahawk cruise missiles for strikes on targets ashore.Al-Masirah, a TV channel affiliated with the Houthis, reported two complexes in Sana were struck on Tuesday.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
