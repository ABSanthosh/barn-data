  "text": "Outgoing German chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) was defeated in Germany’s national elections, recording their worst postwar result with just 16% of the vote.Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance secured victory with over 28%, positioning him as the next chancellor. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to second place with more than 20%, marking its strongest performance in history.Scholz has decried historic gains by the AfD. He told followers that “this is a bitter election result” for his center-left Social Democrats and “this is an election defeat.” Scholz said that he \"bears responsibility\" for the result while congratulating the CDU/CSU for forming the upcoming government. Furthermore, he reiterated his stance against the AfD, stating no cooperation will be done with the far-right party.Coalition pushMerz, 69, promised to form a new government by Easter, saying global events—like Donald Trump’s return to the White House—made quick action necessary. “The world isn’t waiting for us,” he said, urging Europe to boost its defence. He also said Germany should rely less on the US, especially with Trump warming up to Russia.It’s unclear how Merz will form a government. He could partner with the SPD without Scholz or work with the Greens, who got 12% of the vote. However, his Bavarian allies, the CSU, are hesitant about this. The pro-business FDP, which helped bring down Scholz’s government last year, barely passed the 5% mark needed to stay in parliament. Meanwhile, the left-wing BSW was just below the threshold, making coalition talks even trickier.AfD’s riseAfD nearly doubled its support from the last election, driven by concerns over immigration and security following a series of deadly attacks linked to asylum seekers. The party’s co-leader Alice Weidel celebrated the “historic” result and reiterated her willingness to govern with the CDU/CSU. However, Merz and other mainstream parties have maintained a strict “firewall” against working with AfD.AfD’s rise has alarmed many across Germany. Josef Schuster, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called the result “deeply concerning,” warning that a party with ideological links to far-right extremism now holds significant power.Trump’s influence on the electionDonald Trump, now in his second term and reshaping US foreign policy, called the result a “great day for Germany” on Truth Social. Trump's allies Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have openly supported AfD. Trump’s outreach to Vladimir Putin and his Nato comments have added to Europe’s concerns.Merz recognised these challenges and urged European unity. “We are under massive pressure from both Washington and Moscow,” he said. “Our absolute priority must be to strengthen Europe’s independence.”Furthermore, Merz faces the challenge of balancing coalition negotiations while addressing voter concerns over migration and the economy. Political analyst Michael Broening warned that mainstream parties must act decisively: “If they fail to deliver this time, they may not be the establishment for much longer.”",
