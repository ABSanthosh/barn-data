  "text": "In a dramatic escalation of tensions in the Middle East, US President Donald Trump announced that the American military had struck three Iran’s nuclear sites early Sunday morning local time. The air strikes targeted Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, facilities at the heart of Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and marked a direct US entry into the war between Israel and Iran.“All planes are now outside of Iran air space,” Trump said on Truth Social. “A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The president is expected to address the nation at 10pm ET.The strikes signal a historic and risky US intervention in support of Israel’s goal to dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump’s decision reverses his earlier stance on avoiding costly foreign wars and opens the door to potential retaliation from Iran against US forces across the region.Here are the top developments:Targeted sites: The attacks focused on Iran’s heavily fortified nuclear facilities. Trump claimed success in striking all three locations — Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan — with a full payload dropped on Fordow, considered Iran’s most secure enrichment site.US used B-2 stealth bombers: US officials told news agency Reuters that B-2 stealth bombers were used in the strike. These aircraft are capable of carrying 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, which were seen as necessary to penetrate Iran’s deeply buried nuclear sites.Coordination with Israel: Israel was informed in advance of the strikes, an Israeli official was quoted as saying to Axios. The attack took place on the ninth day of Israel’s offensive against Iran, which has included efforts to destroy Iranian air defences and missile systems.'Fordow gone': Trump said on his Truth Social account that Iran's primary nuclear site, Fordow, was destroyed in the US attacks.'Clear reminder to adversaries': Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Mike Johnson says, \"The military operations in Iran should serve as a clear reminder to our adversaries and allies that President Trump means what he says.\"Tensions boil over: The air strikes come after more than a week of Israeli attacks on Iran and Tehran’s retaliatory measures. Trump had earlier suggested diplomacy might still work, saying a decision would come “in the next two weeks.” But by the weekend, preparations for a military strike had intensified.Shifting stance: Despite deep divides within his “America First” support base, Trump has been clear in his position that “Iran must never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon.” He had recently expressed doubt over Israel’s ability to destroy Fordow alone, saying, “They can break through a little section, but they can't go down very deep.”Failed diplomacy: Behind the scenes, Trump had made a last attempt to avoid war. He considered sending a White House envoy or even attending a secret meeting himself in Istanbul, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan offering to mediate. However, the talks fell through when Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, said to be in hiding due to assassination fears, could not be reached to approve the meeting.",
