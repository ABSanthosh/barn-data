  "text": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — Two women who robbed and killed a man in his Las Vegas Strip hotel room could serve 10 years in prison as part of a plea deal, the 8 News Now Investigators have learned.Erika Covington, 21; and Arionna Taylor, 22, agreed to plead guilty to charges of second-degree murder for the May 2023 shooting death of Bryan Altamirano-Solano, 25, records said. Police initially said the women killed Altamirano-Solano inside the room at Caesars Palace and then stole his wallet.According to the court documents, a surveillance camera recorded Altamirano-Solano at around 2:14 a.m. talking with two women in a valet area.Another camera then captured the trio walking to Altamirano-Solano’s room around 2:35 a.m. The video shows a bag slung over Altamirano-Solano’s chest. Less than 15 minutes later, another camera captured Covington and Taylor running through a hallway, prosecutors said. One of the women was carrying Altamirano-Solano’s bag, they said.According to the court documents, a surveillance camera recorded Altamirano-Solano at around 2:14 a.m. talking with two women in a valet area. (KLAS)Detectives later located two explicit videos on Altamirano-Solano’s phone, which they said included Covington and Taylor.Police have never publicly said which woman they suspect pulled the trigger.The deal plea stipulated a judge could sentence the women to life with the possibility of parole beginning after 10 years or a term of 25 years with parole beginning after 10 years, records said. Any additional sentence on the robbery charge would run concurrent to the murder charge, bringing the aggregate sentence to 10-25 years.A friend of Altamirano-Solano’s told police he did not speak English and was seeking asylum from Nicaragua.Covington and Taylor initially pleaded not guilty and were scheduled to go on trial next year. Their sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 23.Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
