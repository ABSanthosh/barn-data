  "text": "Kilmar Abrego García, a father and husband who was mistakenly deported to a megaprison in El Salvador, was transferred to a different facility nine days ago after spending weeks in a cell with 25 other migrants, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) said on Friday.Van Hollen spoke from Washington Dulles International Airport upon his return from El Salvador, where he was able to meet with Abrego García on Thursday after being rebuffed by the Salvadoran government multiple times. The senator said the meeting at his hotel was the first time Abrego García — a longtime Maryland resident whose wife and children are U.S. citizens — had spoken to anyone from the outside world since being deported.“He’s experienced trauma, he said he’s sad every day,” Van Hollen said. “But I think this persistence resulted in having this chance to meet with him, to begin to get a little bit of his story, and I think it is the first step to ultimately bringing him home, as the Constitution requires.”The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Abrego García, 29, to the United States, after the government acknowledged in court filings that a 2019 court order forbade his removal to El Salvador. But Trump administration officials have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the order, a lower court judge ruled this week.The president and his top immigration enforcement officials have repeatedly accused Abrego García of gang membership — even though his family denies it and his attorneys say he has never been charged with a crime — and have said he does not belong back in the U.S.In a strongly worded decision this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld Judge Paula Xinis’s order that the government facilitate Abrego García’s return. The decision said the Trump administration’s contention that it did not need to proactively enable Abrego García’s release “would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.”The sheet metal apprentice has become the best-known of the nearly 300 migrants who have been sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, a megaprison referred to by its Spanish initials, CECOT. The U.S. government has offered to pay El Salvador $15 million to hold its migrants in the Salvadoran prison, Van Hollen said Friday. So far, $4 million has been spent.Van Hollen said he directly asked Salvadoran Vice President Félix Ulloa during his visit why Abrego García was sent to CECOT, whether Abrego García had violated any laws in El Salvador and whether there’s any proof he had committed a crime.The senator said Ulloa responded, “No … he’s here because the Trump administration is paying us to keep him here.”After his first attempts to visit Abrego García were rebuffed, “I asked if I returned the following week whether I could meet with him. The answer was no,” Van Hollen said. “I asked if I could call him on the phone. The answer was no. I asked if his wife, Jennifer, could call him on the phone. The answer was no. No to his wife. No to his mother. No to his lawyers.”On Thursday, Van Hollen said, he “decided to give it another try by driving directly” to CECOT, the notorious Salvadoran prison where Abrego García was detained, accompanied by a lawyer.“About three kilometers outside of CECOT, we were pulled over by soldiers. … I was told that they had orders not to allow us to go any further. When I asked them if they knew anything about the condition of Mr. García, they said no,” he added.As he was preparing to fly back to Washington later Thursday, “all of a sudden, I got word that I would be allowed to meet with Kilmer Abrego García.”They met for about an hour in Van Hollen’s hotel, the senator said. Van Hollen told Abrego García that his situation had been ruled on by multiple federal courts and that his story had become a national symbol for the human toll of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.Abrego García “was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen said.“I told him his brothers and sisters in his unit, the sheet metal workers union, were fighting to bring him home. That brought a smile to his face. I told him that millions of Americans understand that what is happening to him is a threat to their own constitutional rights,” Van Hollen said.Abrego García told Van Hollen that the new detention facility where he had been brought had “better conditions” than CECOT, the senator continued.The senator discussed what he called “margarita-gate” — a reference to a social media post by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele showing two glasses garnished with cherries and rimmed with salt or sugar on the table where Van Hollen and Abrego García sat.Bukele’s post said the two men were “sipping margaritas.” President Donald Trump joined in on the jab, as did other Republicans.Van Hollen said the glasses were part of a setup, added to the table in addition to water glasses in an effort to distort what was happening.“As we were talking, one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses at the table. … Let me just be very clear, neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us,” Van Hollen said. The glass in front of Abrego García held less liquid, Van Hollen added, making it appear as if the deported man had taken a drink.He also said the Salvadoran government initially wanted to hold the meeting by the side of the hotel swimming pool.“This is the lengths that President Bukele will [go] to deceive people about what’s going on,” he said.Van Hollen said there are things that Americans can do to hold the Salvadoran government accountable, including choosing not to visit the country for tourism. He said states could also decide not to invest pension funds in companies in El Salvador. He said Democrats in Congress will examine how the government accounts for the $15 million it is purportedly spending to house deportees in Salvadoran prisons.“You can be sure we’re going to be looking for where it is, because that wasn’t authorized in previous appropriations,” Van Hollen said. “I won’t support the use of one penny of taxpayer dollars to keep Abrego García illegally detained in El Salvador.”The senator said he talked with Abrego García about his family. After the meeting ended, Van Hollen called Abrego García’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, a U.S. citizen.“I told her what he said to me, which was first and foremost that he missed her and his family, and as he said that, you could see a tear come down his cheek,” Van Hollen said at the news conference, where he was joined by Vasquez Sura, along with Abrego García’s brother and other family members and immigrant advocates.In an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday, Vasquez had said it was “very overwhelming” to see the images of her husband at the table with her home senator.“It’s been 37 days since March 12, since my husband was abducted. It’s been an emotional, emotional roller coaster honestly. But just knowing right now that he’s alive …” she said in the interview. “Our faith has grown. And I keep him in my prayers to bring him back home.”Democratic lawmakers publicly thanked Van Hollen on Friday for securing the meeting with Abrego García, including Sens. Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Amy Klobuchar (Minnesota).But several Republicans took issue with the trip. Sen. John Cornyn (Texas) called it a “political stunt,” and Sen. Tim Sheehy (Montana) said Abrego García’s situation should be part of Republicans’ midterm messaging.“Remember that the Democrats will bend over backward for illegal immigrants while they sell you out,” he said.",
