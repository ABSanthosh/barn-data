  "text": "TORONTO — Former central bank chief Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada’s prime minister Friday, calling it a “time of great consequence” as the country faces a trade war with the United States and annexation threats from President Donald Trump.Carney won the Liberal leadership contest Sunday in a landslide. The new prime minister might not be in the job for long. He is expected to call a snap election before a new session of Parliament begins on March 24 to capitalize on his party’s resurgence in a tight race with the Conservatives.Speaking to reporters after the swearing-in ceremony, Carney said that one of his government’s top priorities will be to protect Canadian workers “in the face of unjustified foreign trade actions.”Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on March 14 rejected Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s claim that Canada would be better off as a U.S. state. (Video: Reuters)A new cabinet was also sworn in. It includes the ministers who have in recent months played an important role in managing U.S.-Canada relations.Carney has no political experience and does not have a seat in Parliament. He ascended to power in a Liberal Party leadership race that was organized after Justin Trudeau — facing the loss of his top lieutenant, a caucus revolt and cratering poll numbers — announced his intention to resign as party leader and prime minister on Jan. 6.Since his victory Sunday, Carney has met with Trudeau and several top officials, including the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada’s chief of the defense staff and the country’s ambassador to the United States.On Wednesday, he visited a steel factory in Hamilton, Ontario, as Canada slapped retaliatory tariffs on $20 billion worth of U.S. goods. The move came after Trump escalated a trade war by levying 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum. He has promised more tariffs on April 2.Carney has said that he supports the use of dollar-for-dollar retaliation. He said Friday that he doesn’t have plans to go to the United States and would speak with Trump “at the appropriate moment.”“C’est fou,” he said — French for “it’s crazy” — when asked about Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s comments on Canadian soil Friday that Trump believes Canada would be “better off” becoming the 51st state.“We will never, ever, in any way, shape or form be part of the United States,” he added.Handling Trump — and defending Canada — will be at the top of his priorities.Carney, a former Goldman Sachs banker and proponent of green investing, was the governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and the head of the Bank of England during Britain’s divorce from the European Union.His experience navigating that upheaval is key to his pitch that he is the leader the country needs as it faces a generational crisis: A U.S. president taking a wrecking ball to the free-trade deal at the heart of U.S.-Canada ties and threatening to use “economic” force to annex its northern neighbor and bend it to his will.“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First state,” Trump said in a social media post this week. “This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”Trump and his aides have offered myriad — and, at times, conflicting — justifications for the tariffs.Few here believe they are about fentanyl, as he initially claimed. Less than 1 percent of fentanyl seized by U.S. border agents at the land border in the 2024 fiscal year was confiscated at or near the northern border.“The only constant in this unjustifiable trade war seems to be President Trump’s talks of annexing our country through economic coercion,” Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said this week.In a Feb. 3 call with Trudeau, the president said he had in front of him a document outlining a list of grievances with Canada, said a senior government official who was not authorized to talk publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Trump mentioned previously uncontroversial treaties, the official said, including the 1908 treaty finalizing the U.S.-Canada border and a deal regulating flood control and hydroelectric power in the Columbia River, which flows from British Columbia to the Pacific Northwest.In one call with Trudeau, Trump also asked if Canada was part of NORAD, the joint U.S.-Canada command created during the Cold War to defend the continent against Soviet aggression. When Trudeau replied that it was, the official said Trump moved on.Canadian officials have said that their U.S. interlocutors say that even they don’t know what Trump will ultimately do and that they have not been able to articulate to them what more they want Canada to do on fentanyl and irregular immigration to end the trade war.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, told reporters Thursday that he believed a change in prime minister could offer an opportunity to “reset” U.S.-Canada ties.Wilbur Ross, Trump’s commerce secretary during his first term, agreed.“[Carney] knows a lot more about the nuts and bolts of government finance probably than any elected official that Canada has ever had,” he told The Washington Post. “I think Carney’s personality is well-suited to trying to negotiate a satisfactory resolution.”Trudeau had sought to arrange one last call with Trump before the end of his time as prime minister, but the call did not materialize, a senior Canadian government official said.Carney plans to travel to Europe early next week to meet with the leaders of France and Britain.A federal election must be held by the end of October, but Carney is expected to call one shortly.At the start of the year, the Liberals trailed Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives by 20 points. Trudeau’s resignation, coupled with Trump’s return to the White House, have helped the Liberals nearly close that gap. Some polls show Canadians trust Carney more than Poilievre to handle Trump.Poilievre provides a stark contrast to Carney. He is a lifelong politician and a populist with a combative, caustic style and a penchant for short, snappy slogans. Carney is a measured technocrat and political neophyte.In his victory speech Sunday, Carney previewed his attacks on Poilievre, casting him as similar to Trump and “the type of lifelong politician … who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having made a payroll himself.”Poilievre on Friday said there wasn’t much difference between Trudeau’s government and Carney’s.“Mark Carney thinks Canadians are stupid,” he said at a news conference in Ottawa. “He thinks that a little bit of cosmetic surgery will allow the Liberals to disguise who they are. … But it’s the same Liberal gang, with the same Liberal agenda, the same Liberal results.”",
