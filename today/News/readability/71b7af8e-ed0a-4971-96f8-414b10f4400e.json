  "text": "TEL AVIV — Israel plans to take control of the Gaza Strip while restarting “minimal” aid deliveries to the enclave, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday, describing potential mass starvation there as a “red line” that could cost Israel its support from the United States.In a video posted on social media, Netanyahu said that although Israel was deploying “massive force to take control of all of the Gaza Strip … we cannot reach a point of starvation, for practical and diplomatic reasons.”He said Israel’s “closest friends in the world,” including U.S. politicians, told him they were unwavering in their support but could not “handle pictures of mass starvation.” Other Western allies, including Britain, Canada and France, condemned Israel’s decision to expand military operations in Gaza and threatened “concrete actions” if it did not cease its offensive and lift restrictions on aid, which Israel halted on March 2.In a joint statement Monday, officials from the three countries said “the level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable” and that Israel’s move to allow only a basic quantity of food in was “wholly inadequate.”“We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions,” the statement said. “If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.”Netanyahu’s address was the first time an Israeli official has publicly acknowledged the threat of hunger in the territory, despite repeated warnings from global hunger experts, including this month, that the population was at risk of famine.Israel blocked food, fuel and aid from entering Gaza following an eight-week ceasefire with Hamas, imposing the longest siege of a war that started with the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023. Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said that in talks with Hamas, the United States guaranteed that Israel would allow some relief to enter Gaza if Hamas released American Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, 21.On Monday, Hamas official Basem Naim said the group welcomed the resumption of aid but did not say whether it was linked to Alexander’s release. In a statement on Facebook, he acknowledged that the amount of aid would be “insufficient … compared to the real needs of the people.” But, he said, Israel’s decision to allow some trucks in could “only be seen as a break in its will.”Videos filmed early on May 19 show smoke billowing over Khan Younis in southern Gaza as explosions echo in the background. (Video: The Washington Post)The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Monday that it was approached by Israeli authorities to “resume limited aid delivery” and that discussions around logistics were ongoing because of the rapidly changing situation on the ground, including in Khan Younis, where the Israeli military ordered residents to evacuate ahead of an “unprecedented attack.”Aid agencies said they were informed overnight that from Monday through Friday, about 100 aid trucks per day would be allowed to enter. Late on Monday, COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry unit that coordinates civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, said that five trucks of aid, including “food for babies,” had crossed into Gaza.At a briefing earlier in the day, foreign ministry official Edan Bar Tal said that only baby food would enter on Monday, and aid officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said the trucks had entered the Kerem Shalom crossing but had not yet reached the other side.“A drop in the ocean,” Tom Fletcher, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement on X. “It must reach the civilians who need it so urgently, and we must be allowed to scale up.”In Israel, Netanyahu’s sharp pivot followed new public and behind-the-scenes pressure from the Trump administration. During a tour of Persian Gulf nations last week, Trump said that “a lot of people are starving” in Gaza. Israel was excluded from the trip, during which Trump visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.“Trump’s people are letting Israel know, ‘We will abandon you if you do not end this war,’” said a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.Netanyahu said that the move gives Israel leverage against Hamas while also laying the groundwork for a more substantial military campaign in case ceasefire talks, underway in Qatar, hit a dead end.The prime minister said Monday that Israel would launch an alternative, U.S.-backed humanitarian aid mechanism in the coming days, through which the Israeli military would secure distribution centers run by private American contractors and bypass the U.N. organizations that have so far handled most of the relief.The centers, he said, were intended for civilians but not for Hamas, which Israel has repeatedly accused of pillaging and profiting from the inflow of humanitarian aid while claiming that the risk of famine was “engineered by Hamas.” (Aid groups and some U.S. officials dispute the claim, and Israel has not provided evidence of such large-scale theft.)In another joint statement, officials from more than two dozen donor nations — including Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain — said their humanitarian partners would not participate in the new aid mechanism.“It places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the UN and our trusted partners and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,” the statement said. “ Humanitarian aid should never be politicized, and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change.”Netanyahu’s decision also drew furious accusations of capitulation to Hamas during the Sunday night cabinet meeting convened about the issue, including from National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, who said Netanyahu was making “a grave mistake.”But the prime minister’s other coalition partners publicly supported the move, echoing the Israeli leader’s claims in the video statement that it would not affect Israel’s “interconnected” war aims of destroying Hamas and returning the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, 23 of whom Israeli authorities believe are alive.The aid entering Gaza “will not reach Hamas,” far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Monday. “It will allow civilians to eat, our friends around the world to continue providing us with international protection at the U.N. Security Council and The Hague, and us to keep fighting, with God’s help, until victory.”He “sold the idea of resuming aid in the Sunday night cabinet meeting by saying it was only a technicality,” said the person familiar with the discussions.More than 53,300 people in Gaza have been killed over 19 months of war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says most of the dead are women and children. In recent days, Israel has intensified aerial bombardments, killing hundreds more.On Monday, the Israeli military said residents of Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, should leave for the coastal area of Mawasi, a sprawling tent encampment hosting many of the enclave’s displaced.Israeli forces had staged an overnight attack in the city that included fighter jets, helicopters and dozens of airstrikes, residents said. Israel did not comment specifically on the strikes, but the Popular Resistance Committees, a militant group allied with Hamas, said one of its commanders was killed during a morning raid in Khan Younis.“The scene is terrifying, like the horrors of Judgment Day,” said Malik Shibari, an architect who said he fled the city to Mawasi with his children.“All of the people are now evacuating toward us, but there are no empty places,” he said, adding that residents have been arriving on foot, carrying only basic belongings and without tents to sleep in.Cheeseman reported from Beirut and Parker from Jerusalem.",
