The others are Chad, the Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The ban goes into effect on Monday.Mr. Edjang had hoped to one day study medicine in the United States, where, he said, training was much better than in Equatorial Guinea, a country that is rich in oil but mired in pervasive poverty and inequality.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
