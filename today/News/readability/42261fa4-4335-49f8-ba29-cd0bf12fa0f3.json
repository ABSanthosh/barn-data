  "text": "Two public safety officers were injured on Wednesday during chaotic scenes at Columbia Universityafter pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied the university’s Butler Library. The protesters, most wearing masks and keffiyehs, stormed the building’s main reading room, renaming it “the Basel Al-Araj Popular University,” and unfurled banners, including some with Palestinian flags.Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said the students refused repeated requests to identify themselves or leave the premises, prompting the university to call in the New York Police Department.Videos circulated on social media showed NYPD officers in riot helmets entering the library around 7pm, several hours after the protest began. They were seen removing demonstrators, with at least 21 being escorted out in flex cuffs. Protesters had earlier forced their way past campus security, some reportedly shouting slogans and hanging banners declaring the space a \"Liberated Zone.\" Graffiti, including the phrase \"Columbia will burn,\" was seen scrawled on framed pictures in the reading room.The clash marks the latest flashpoint in an ongoing dispute between Columbia University and pro-Palestinian student groups, who have accused the institution of supporting \"imperialist violence\" through its investments. The Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold more than \\$400 million in federal research funding from the university, citing its alleged failure to protect Jewish students from harassment.The university has since implemented stricter protest policies, including a ban on face coverings and a requirement for students to show ID when protesting on campus.New York City Mayor Eric Adams defended the police response, stating that the city supports peaceful protest but will not tolerate “lawlessness.” He reaffirmed support for Jewish students on campus and said any non-student protester would be arrested.Here are the key developments:Demonstrators affiliated with Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) flooded Butler Library just after 3 p.m., chanting pro-Palestinian slogans and carrying signs. CUAD called the protest a disruption against Columbia's ties to \"imperialist violence.\"NYPD officers entered the building after requests from Columbia officials. The decision was made amid safety concerns due to a growing crowd and resistance from those inside the library.Two university public safety officers were injured in what Shipman described as a \"crowd surge\" when individuals attempted to break into the building.Protesters clashed with public safety officers, with pushing and shoving on both sides. Protesters attempting to exit the library were blocked by officers. At one point, officers secured interior doors using handcuffs to prevent further entry.CUAD demanded full divestment from companies tied to the Israeli state and military. In an online post, they declared their intention to continue disrupting campus life until Columbia meets their demands.The protest coincided with federal hate crime charges being brought against 20-year-old Tarek Bazrouk, accused of assaults during previous pro-Palestinian protests in New York, including one near Columbia. He remains in custody awaiting a bail hearing.The university has faced mounting pressure from the Trump administration and conservative lawmakers to crack down on what they claim is rising antisemitism on campus. In April, student demonstrators barricaded themselves in Hamilton Hall, resulting in arrests and disciplinary action.Following previous unrest, Columbia hired new security personnel authorised to make arrests and tightened protest regulations in line with federal demands.Mayor Adams reiterated the city's commitment to safety and lawful protest, stating on social media that Columbia students must be able to study without intimidation or violence.",
