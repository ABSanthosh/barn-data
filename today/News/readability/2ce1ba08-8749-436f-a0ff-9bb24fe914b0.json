  "text": "Netanyahu’s house damaged by drone, Israeli media reports Return to menuHezbollah, in a statement Tuesday, claimed responsibility for a Saturday drone strike targeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in the Caesarea area. Netanyahu’s office had reported the attack over the weekend and said neither Netanyahu nor his wife was present at the time, and that no one was hurt.The Israeli Military Censor on Tuesday allowed Israeli outlets to publish that a UAV directly hit the prime minister’s residence in Caesarea. (Non-Israeli outlets are not bound by the Israeli military censor.) That day, Israeli media published photos of an apparent cracked window at the residence, citing new permissions for publication by the military censor. Israeli Army Radio also tweeted a photo of the residence’s window.The Times of Israel on Tuesday reported that the drone cracked the glass of a bedroom window but did not enter the home, reportedly due to reinforced glass.Hezbollah said it declared the “full, complete and exclusive responsibility” for the targeting of Netanyahu’s home. “The eyes of the resistance fighters see and their ears hear, if our hands do not reach you this time, then between us and you are days, nights and the field,” the group said in a statement.After the incident Saturday, Netanyahu tweeted that “the attempt by Iran’s proxy Hezbollah to assassinate me and my wife today was a grave mistake.” He said it would not deter him or Israel from continuing its “just war against our enemies” and that anyone who harms Israeli citizens will “pay a heavy price.”After Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, the Israeli prime minister’s office released a readout of the talks saying Blinken “expressed America’s deep shock at Iran’s attempt, through Hezbollah, to assassinate\" Netanyahu, \"emphasizing that this is an extreme and exceptional event.” It said Netanyahu thanked Blinken, “noting that this is an issue with dramatic implications and should not be overlooked.”A senior State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks, later said Blinken merely expressed “concern.” Blinken’s remarks about the incident were in the “context of Hezbollah actions” and he did not directly attribute the attack directly to Iran, said the official.IDF says Hashem Safieddine, Hezbollah official seen as Nasrallah successor, was killed weeks agoReturn to menuHashem Safieddine, the Hezbollah official who was widely seen as the likely successor to Hasan Nasrallah as the group’s leader, was killed by the Israeli military about three weeks ago in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces said Tuesday.The Israeli Air Force struck Hezbollah’s intelligence headquarters in Beirut’s southern suburbs a few weeks ago, the IDF said. The attack killed several Hezbollah commanders, including Safieddine.Safieddine headed Hezbollah’s executive council, which oversees the group’s political, organizational, social and educational activities, according to the State Department. He was considered “Nasrallah’s designated but undeclared successor,” according to L’Orient Today, a French- and English-language newspaper in Lebanon, which cited experts and figures close to Hezbollah in a 2023 article about the official. Safieddine was also Nasrallah’s cousin.The IDF said Tuesday that Safieddine’s ties to Nasrallah meant that he “greatly influenced” decision-making within Hezbollah. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27 in Beirut in an Israeli strike.Safieddine, who was the first Hezbollah official to give a statement after Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, said Hezbollah is “not neutral in this battle.”“Our hearts are with you. Our minds are with you. Our souls are with you. Our history and guns and our rockets are with you,” Safieddine said that day at a rally in Beirut, referring to Hamas. The U.S. State Department listed him among “specially designated global terrorists” in May 2017.In remarks on Oct. 8, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that besides killing Nasrallah, Israel had killed his “successor” and “the successor of the successor.” At the time, he did not identify those figures.Hezbollah has not named a formal successor to Nasrallah.Blinken meets with Netanyahu, urges Israel to ramp down conflictReturn to menuIn a meeting with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel should “capitalize” on its “successful action to bring Yahya Sinwar to justice” by ending the conflict in Gaza, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.Netanyahu said that killing the Hamas leader could lead to a hostage deal, but did not explicitly raise a truce, according to a statement from his office. The meeting lasted well over two hours.Blinken embarked on the trip with plans to follow up on his warning that the United States could withdraw military assistance to Israel if it does not improve access to humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, a senior State Department official said, before Blinken arrived in Israel.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secretary’s planning, said Blinken would review the steps Israel took to improve access after the letter he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin sent to Israeli officials this month. Blinken also plans to discuss other steps Israel needs to take.Israel has sharply curtailed aid to Gaza in recent months, resulting in a 50 percent decrease, Blinken and Austin said in their letter. Federal law requires that Washington withdraw military assistance to countries that block the flow of U.S. humanitarian aid, a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act that critics say the Biden administration has ignored for much of this war.Blinken is set to travel Wednesday to Jordan, where U.N. offices direct large amounts of aid into Gaza. While in Amman, Blinken will discuss how the key aid route through Jordan is functioning and what additional steps Israel needs to take, the official said.Other Blinken objectives include discussing how to end the war in Gaza, exploring a diplomatic resolution to Israel’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and forging consensus on an Israeli-Arab plan for governing Gaza after hostilities end.For Lebanon, Blinken plans to work toward a diplomatic resolution, the official said.Blinken will also talk to Israeli officials about their expected response to Iran’s missile strike this month. Israeli officials have promised a “powerful” retaliation, prompting fears they might strike Iran’s oil, gas or nuclear infrastructure, potentially destabilizing the global economy. Blinken plans to relay the U.S. goal that an Israeli response not escalate the conflict, the official said.Palestinians recount scenes of desperation in northern Gaza amid offensiveReturn to menuDisplaced Palestinians were seen fleeing Beit Lahia on Oct. 22, as Israel's military ramped up operations in northern Gaza. (Video: Obtained by Reuters)Palestinians in northern Gaza reported severe food shortages, hospitals at a breaking point after months of operating beyond capacity with scant supplies and a breakdown in communications preventing local health officials from ascertaining death tolls, more than two weeks after Israel began its offensive in the area.Local media outlets reported that three schools established by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and housing displaced people were hit by airstrikes on Monday in northern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the strikes.The number of those killed in northern Gaza cannot be ascertained, with communication from the region difficult or impossible, Zaher al-Wahidi, director of the Information Systems Network at the Ministry of Health, told The Washington Post on Tuesday. Wahidi said 85 injured people arrived at Beit Lahia’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in the past day.“The number of wounded exceeds the hospital’s capacity,” said Moataz Ayoub, an emergency worker in northern Gaza, in an audio message Tuesday, referring to the hospital. “Anyone who is injured now in the north will continue to bleed until he dies, and we as paramedics cannot reach those cases.”Others in northern Gaza described scenes of desperation. “The difficulty of the days cannot be described,” 31-year-old Islam Ahmed told The Post. “We have no hope of survival. We are all here preparing our shrouds.”Ahmed was sheltering at a refugee camp in Jabalya when a quadcopter arrived at the Palestine School at about 9 a.m. Monday. A voice over a loudspeaker ordered displaced people to evacuate the school within an hour.“At exactly 10 a.m., when people started moving, we were surprised by the bombing of the school. We did not know what had happened. Suddenly, we found bodies everywhere,” said Ahmed. Some people’s limbs were severed, he said.Lior Soroka contributed to this report.Israeli forces strike Beirut suburb and southern LebanonReturn to menuExplosions illuminated the night sky and rocked Baabda, south of Beirut, on Oct. 21, amid ongoing hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. (Video: Reuters)Israel’s military said on Tuesday that it continued to target Hezbollah militants across Lebanon, including south of Beirut around Rafiq Hariri University Hospital, where health officials said more than a dozen people were killed.The strikes came as Hezbollah said its militants targeted Israel with more rocket attacks on Tuesday, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces said around 80 projectiles were fired across the border from Lebanon on Tuesday, injuring two people in northern Israel, according to local officials.In southern Lebanon, the IDF said it struck three Hezbollah aerial command units and a Hezbollah operations room. In Beirut, the IDF said its forces hit a central base of Hezbollah’s naval unit as well as a number of weapons storage facilities, destroying aerial and naval equipment.Video recorded late Monday in Baabda, south of Beirut, showed the night sky lit up by explosions, as smoke billowed overhead. It was not immediately clear what caused the explosions.On Tuesday, the Israeli military warned residents to evacuate their homes in Beirut’s southern suburbs, which Israel has referred to as Dahieh, and in Al-Hawsh, a town near the southern city of Tyre.“The IDF is operating within your town and has no intention of harming you,” IDF spokesman Avichay Adraee said in a post shared on X.The IDF said it struck an estimated total of 230 Hezbollah and Hamas targets in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip over the past day.Lior Soroka contributed reporting.Israeli airstrikes hit near Beirut hospitalReturn to menuVideo published to Telegram on Oct. 21 shows the immediate aftermath of Israeli airstrikes near Rafik Hariri University Hospital in Beirut. (Video: Telegram)BEIRUT — Israeli airstrikes hit near Rafik Hariri University Hospital, killing at least 13 people, including a child, and injuring 57 others, Lebanon’s Health Ministry said in an updated toll Tuesday.Rescue workers were still searching Tuesday morning for survivors in the remains of an apartment block opposite Beirut’s major public hospital. Two apartment buildings have been leveled. It is still unclear how many people may be missing beneath the rubble. Doctors said they expected at least 10.The explosion was powerful, hospital staff said, terrifying doctors and patients inside as windows at the front and back of the facility shattered.In a video verified by The Washington Post, a layer of smoke blurs the bright lights from the building across from the hospital’s entrance. The narrator of the video backs down the road. He speaks frantically, keeping the camera pointed toward the hospital.“The main entrance is here,” he says, referring to the Hariri hospital. “There’s the smoke, several hits, one of them is on the entrance of the hospital.”The IDF told The Post it “struck a Hezbollah terrorist target” near the hospital. The hospital itself and its operation were not affected, the IDF said, adding it was not hit nor was it the target.The hospital has more than 400 beds and 14 operating rooms, according to its website.Kelly reported from Washington, El Chamaa from Beirut and Kasulis Cho from Seoul.",
