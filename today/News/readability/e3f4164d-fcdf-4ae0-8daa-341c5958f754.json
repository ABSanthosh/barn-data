CNBC has reached out to the Japanese government for comment.A worker prepares to tie up the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp.'s (JOGMEC) marine resources research vessel, Hakurei, at a pier in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, March 21, 2012.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.Western officials have repeatedly flagged Beijing's supply chain dominance as a strategic challenge, particularly given that critical mineral demand is expected to grow exponentially, as the clean energy transition picks up pace.Japan's supply chain transformation is seen as both a template for Western nations — and a stark reminder of just how difficult it is to escape China's critical mineral orbit.Further to go?Japan has enjoyed success through Lynas and its international supply chains by not only investing in rare earth mining but also in the facilities needed to process and refine the materials into usable goods, according to Nils Backeberg, founder and director at consultancy Project Blue.Still, the country has a long way to go to cut its dependency on China in some key areas, Backeberg told CNBC. This is especially true for heavy rare earth elements, which are generally less abundant in the Earth's crust, elevating their value.The Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. processing plant in Kalgoorlie, Australia, on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024. Lynas Rare Earths explores and mines for rare earth minerals such as cerium and neodymium.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"Not a lot of heavy rare earths come out of Lynas, and most of the ones that do actually get sent to China for further refinement,\" Backeberg said, adding that China's latest export ban underscores Beijing's importance in heavy rare earths.But Lynas has continued to make progress in this area. Over the past month or so, the company has announced breakthroughs in two heavy rare earths, claiming to have produced them outside China for the first time.'A real problem'China's latest rare earth export curbs were implemented as part of a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's products.\"When the tariff war started and tariffs were put on China, the first thing that China did was say 'we're going to stop exporting rare earths.' A few weeks later, we couldn't manufacture a car in America or in Europe, so it is a real problem,\" Eldur Olafsson, CEO of Greenland-focused mining company Amaroq, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Thursday.\"No country in the Western world wants one country to corner the market,\" Olafsson said.Western auto industry groups have been hit particularly hard by the export curbs, with many increasingly concerned about production outages.Ivan Espinosa, chief executive officer of Nissan Motor Co., speaks during an interview at the company's headquarters in Yokohama, Japan, on Thursday, May 15, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe disruption also extended to Japanese automakers. Suzuki Motor suspended production of its popular Swift car model earlier this month, with local media attributing the step to China's rare earth export restrictions. A Suzuki Motor spokesperson did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.Meanwhile, Japanese car giant Nissan said it was exploring ways to minimize the impact of China's export controls by working with Japan's government and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.\"We need to continue finding alternatives for the future, keeping flexibility and keeping our options open,\" Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa told CNBC earlier this month.A push for alternativesLooking ahead, Niron Magnetics's Rowntree said an all-encompassing government and industry approach would be needed to tackle China's mineral dominance, from accelerating permits for domestic mines to investing in new alternatives to provide sufficient magnet supplies.\"Everyone has seen that this supply bottleneck is an issue. We've all known for a long time that this could happen, but now it has actually happened,\" Rowntree said.\"I think many customers share my view — that this issue is unlikely to disappear and that we need to have alternatives in the West to address it.\"Europe's domestic production of rare earths is limited. Just like the U.S., the region heavily relies on imports, particularly from China, although plans are underway to develop domestic resources and processing capabilities.For instance, Belgian chemical group Solvay, which operates the largest rare earths processing plant outside of China in La Rochelle, France, aims to supply 30% of Europe's processed rare earths demand for permanent magnets by 2030.
