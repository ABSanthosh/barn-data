  "text": "On the day before his inauguration, US President-elect Donald Trump addressed a jubilant crowd, highlighting his electoral triumph and expressing confidence about the nation's future, despite existing political rifts. \"Tomorrow, at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand-new day of American strength and prosperity, dignity and pride,\" Trump declared to his supporters, adding, \"We not only won a mandate, but we built a new American majority that will lead our country to success for generations to come.\"The Capital One Arena, with its 20,000-plus capacity, was nearly full as Kid Rock performed \"All Summer Long\", despite a cold mix of rain and snow falling outside.Lee Greenwood performed his signature song \"God Bless the USA\", which had become synonymous with Trump's re-election campaign.Actor Jon Voight addressed the gathering, saying, \"Our hero. A man who never gave up on the American people, and we the people never gave up on him.\"Stephen Miller, the incoming deputy chief of staff, promised significant changes, emphasising the administration's commitment to stringent immigration policies.Trump's agenda included signing several executive orders, particularly regarding US-Mexico border policies.His first complete day back in Washington included a private breakfast with Republican senators at Blair House, followed by a photograph with ten Republican female senators and his incoming chief-of-staff, Susie Wiles.Unlike the Capitol attack in 2021 following Trump's loss to Biden, authorities anticipated a peaceful transition. Supporters celebrated Trump's second term and MAGA's influence within the Republican Party.Attendees travelled from across the country, dressed formally, including some in fur coats.Trump supporters gathered at various Washington venues for celebrations. The phrase \"MAGA\" was frequently heard as both a chant and greeting amongst attendees.The positive atmosphere contrasted sharply with four years prior, when Trump departed Washington in controversy, avoiding Biden's inauguration.",
