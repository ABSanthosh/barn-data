  "text": "The death toll from a massive explosion at a port in southern Iran has risen to 40, with more than 900 people injured, the country’s state-run IRNA news agency reported Sunday. Officials declared a public health emergency and warned of airborne toxic pollutants.The explosion rocked the Shahid Rajaee port in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on Saturday. In video of the disaster published by the BBC, an enormous fiery plume can be seen erupting into a bigger, darker pillar of smoke. Hossein Zafari, the spokesman for the country’s crisis management unit, told Iranian news site ILNA that the blast could be felt more than 30 miles away.The cause of the explosion is not yet clear, but government officials have suggested it could have been from improperly stored chemicals. President Masoud Pezeshkian described it as an “accident,” and IRNA said “recklessness in storing flammable material” had been discussed as a possibility. Authorities did not suggest terrorism or a military strike.Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik, a spokesman for Iran’s Defense Ministry, denied that there was any “for-import or for-export fuel batch with military use in the area of the fire accident,” according to state news.Zafari told ILNA the explosion was caused by chemicals stored in a number of containers. “Previously, the director general of crisis management had given warnings to this port during their visits and had pointed out the possibility of danger,” he added.Schools in the region are to be closed temporarily because of pollution from the explosion, and people have been asked not to leave their homes, according to state media. Local officials warned people to close their windows against the possible spread of “ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.” They advised vulnerable people to wear masks.By Sunday afternoon, about 80 percent of the fire had been contained, Iran’s Interior Ministry told the semiofficial Fars news agency.Pezeshkian expressed “deep regret and sympathy for the victims” and said he had ordered an investigation into the “accident.” In a statement on X, he said he dispatched Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni to the region.Pezeshkian called for all available resources to be mobilized to help those injured in the blast.The explosion happened against the backdrop of preliminary talks between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program. The sides met for four hours in Oman on Saturday and described the talks as positive.",
