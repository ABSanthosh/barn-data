  "text": "An Israeli air strike killed three journalists as they slept at a guesthouse in southeast Lebanon at dawn on Friday. It was a rare air strike on an area that had so far been spared and has been used by the media as a base for covering the war. The 3am air strike turned the site - a series of chalets nestled among trees that had been rented by various media outlets - into rubble, with cars marked \"PRESS\" overturned and covered in dust and debris and at least one satellite dish for live broadcasting totally destroyed. The Israeli army did not issue a warning prior to the strike, and later said it was looking into it. Those killed were camera operator Ghassan Najjar and broadcast technician Mohammed Rida of the Beirut-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV, and camera operator Wissam Qassim, who worked for Al-Manar TV of Lebanon's Hezbollah group.",
