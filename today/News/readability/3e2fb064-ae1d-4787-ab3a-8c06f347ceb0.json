  "text": "File photo: Former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)An old video of Joe Biden seemingly admitting to having cancer in 2022 has gone viral on social media, after the former US president was recently diagnosed with an “aggressive” form of prostate cancer. The resurfaced footage has reignited conspiracy theories among right-wing figures, who accuse Biden’s team of covering up his health condition for political reasons.The clip, from a press conference on July 20, 2022, in Somerset, Massachusetts, shows Biden discussing the environmental impact of oil pollution in Delaware. “That’s why I, and so damn many other people I grew up with, have cancer,” Biden said at the time. The White House had later dismissed the statement as a “gaffe,” clarifying he had been referring to past skin cancer treatments, not an active diagnosis.However, as news of his current diagnosis spreads, the video has gained renewed attention. On Tuesday, Biden’s team revealed that the 82-year-old has prostate cancer that has metastasised to his bones and is now reviewing treatment options with doctors. The disease was identified after Biden showed urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was detected. The cancer is said to be hormone-sensitive and has a Gleason score of 9, indicating an advanced stage.Amid the announcement, critics online questioned how such a severe illness could have gone unnoticed. Donald Trump Jr posted, “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???”Other users echoed similar sentiments. One viral post accused the administration of lying, claiming: “Advanced prostate cancer takes +10 years to develop… You’re telling me that the best doctors… did not find Biden’s cancer in all these years of testing? Bullshit. This is the worst coverup in the history of the Presidency.”Another added, “Joe Biden had the best medical doctors on planet Earth, taking care of him 24/7… they knew about it and participated in the cover-up until after the election.”Biden’s health had already been a major topic during his presidency and reelection campaign before he dropped out in July 2024 following a poor debate performance against Donald Trump.Doctor breaks down Biden's cancer diagnosisDespite reassurances from the White House physician last summer that Biden was “completely fit for the Presidency,” many supporters and critics alike had expressed concern over his age and cognitive abilities.Former US Vice President Kamala Harris, who stepped in as the Democratic nominee, said Biden would face this challenge with “strength, resilience, and optimism.” Former US President Barack Obama added, “Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe.”Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden had spearheaded the “cancer moonshot” initiative under the Obama administration, calling the fight “personal.”",
