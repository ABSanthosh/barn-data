    "description": "Four years down the road, the Triumph Tiger 900 gets a significant midlife update that aims to fix most of the existing 900’s issues. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: engine, performance, refinement The main improvements are within the 888cc three-cylinder engine, and multiple changes have resulted in not just more power and torque but also the promise of more efficiency. The previous Tiger 900 was far from slow, but the jump from 95hp/87Nm to 108hp/90Nm makes the bike feel even more potent and reactive. It looks familiar, but the side panels have been redesigned. But it’s not just about speed because this engine is also really lovely to ride at a relaxed pace. It’s torquey and very flexible with the gears, so you can ride over speed breakers in third and use sixth as low as 40kph. The fuelling is also beautifully smooth, and you can open the accelerator at very low revs without any signs of protest. This means less clutch use – both off the road and in heavy city traffic, and that’s always nice, even though this clutch isn’t particularly heavy to operate. I’m also a fan of the sound and feel of this engine with its deep, raspy growl. That said, while it’s characterful, it’s also far from perfect. The big complaint with the 900 engine was its high-rpm vibration, and Triumph has tried to improve that. Heavier bar-end weights and rubber-damped handlebar mounts have made some very clear improvements, but this is still not the smoothest engine in its class at high speeds. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: comfort, ride \u0026 handling Wind protection is usually based on your height and helmet, but I find that this height-adjustable windscreen results in some uncomfortable helmet buffeting at high speeds. Thankfully, the rest of the ergos are beautiful. Despite having gone up by 10mm, the 820-840mm seat height is very low for an ADV of this size and capability, and even tall riders will be comfy here. The seat is also new, and the comfort is fantastic. Seat and suspension comfort are both superb. The highly impressive chassis remains unchanged, and some fantastic suspension allows this bike to tear effortlessly through any form of terrible road. Like before, there’s a 45mm USD fork with 180mm of travel and a monoshock with 170mm of travel. The suspension is adjustable, but not fully – compression and rebound at the front and preload and rebound at the rear. The stock settings are good enough, but with a remote rear preload adjuster, you can easily make any changes you need. Even though the GT is the road-biased bike in the line-up, it’s fun to ride off-road and will easily get you through one of those Ladakh adventures. But you must remember that it’s running road tyres on alloy wheels and has no crash protection; Triumph has even removed the earlier GT’s plastic sump guard. For most casual ADV riders, this will be more than capable enough off-road, and I’d only recommend going for the Rally if you really want that hardcore capability or taller seat. Despite being the road-biased 900, it’s still surprisingly capable off-road. Road handling is neutral and easy but not particularly sporty, and you won’t have to work too hard to scrape its footpegs. It’s definitely no Multistrada V2 in the corners, but it’s still good enough that you’ll have fun. The impressive braking hardware is the same, but there’s a new linked-braking system that adds in some rear brake when you use the front. It feels quite natural while bringing some more stability to the braking. Triumph Tiger 900 GT: verdict, price, service cost As for features, the biggest change is the new 7-inch TFT from the Tiger 1200. This one has a great layout and, thankfully, gets rid of those weird layouts from the old Tiger 900. But, like in the Tiger 1200, it takes an eternity to boot up and feels laggy to operate. Triumph really should have fixed this. New TFT looks great, but very slow to boot up. But what’s most frustrating is that Triumph still expects you to pay an additional Rs 43,531 if you want a quickshifter. It’s a feature I really missed, and not getting one in this day and age on a Rs 14 lakh motorcycle is quite annoying. Thankfully, you get most of the essentials you’d want on a big ADV, such as two power outlets, cruise control and heated grips; you can even opt for heated seats. The Tiger 900 has always been the sweet spot in the big ADV segment in India, and this latest update only sweetens that package, especially since it costs just Rs 20,000 more than before. Tigers have also built a great reputation for reliability over the years, and they run fine on regular petrol. However, there are some cost concerns. The first is that the Tiger 900 GT is a CBU, so the on-road price gets very high in certain states that heavily tax CBUs – it’s nearly Rs 18 lakh in Mumbai. The other disappointment is that spares and service costs for the big bikes actually went up instead of down and are now about 20-30 percent more expensive than before since Bajaj took over Triumph’s operations in India. Nevertheless, the Triumph Tiger 900 GT is a fantastic all-round motorcycle, and it continues to be my go-to recommendation for the casual adventure rider looking for a premium midsize ADV.

    "description": "The monsoon is a tough time for any motorcycle helmet. Even the best lids in the world eventually succumb to the odour buildup that comes from having wet interiors for prolonged periods of time. Fogging is another issue, and it can happen even in a hot city like Mumbai if the visor is closed in heavy rain and you’re stuck in a traffic jam. This is the ideal time to try out some helmet-specific care products, and Big Bad Bikes sells a little kit from Muc-Off for just that purpose. Helpfully named the Helmet Care Kit, you get three products and two fancy microfibre cleaning cloths. The products include an anti-fog spray, a foam cleaner and another small spray bottle for cleaning your helmet, goggles and visor. Let’s start with the foam cleaner, which shoots out a thick blast of foam that you are supposed to fill your helmet (or gloves/boots) with. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe away the excess before leaving the helmet to dry. The foam does a really good job of getting rid of the odours and giving the helmet a fresh feel, and it’s something I’ll make sure to have around every monsoon. The anti-fog spray also worked a treat, and the effect lasts for quite a few days as long as you don’t touch or wipe down the surface. It’s also claimed to help water bead away if you spray it onto the outside of your visor, but this effect wasn’t as impressive as I’d like. My go-to product for that hydrophobic coating on a visor remains the Motosolutions Rain Coat cream that we reviewed a few years ago. As for the little bottle of helmet and visor cleaner, it works as advertised and is helpful at getting stubborn stains or dead bugs off. Then again, I usually get the same job done with a mild soap solution, and while the Muc-Off cleaner takes a little less effort, it’s not a game-changer. Muc-Off makes some really interesting products, and many of them are biodegradable, which is always a nice thing. On the other hand, its products are also expensive, and this kit will cost you just over Rs 2,700. Happily, you don’t need to buy the whole kit, and if you’d like just one or two products in particular, they’re all also sold separately by Big Bad Bikes.

    "description": "BMW’s CE 02 is an electric two-wheeler that straddles the line between an electric scooter and a motorcycle. It's aimed at urban riders looking for a more stylish way to get around town and unlike the recently launched CE 04, this one is made in India at TVS’ Hosur plant. We got to spend a short time in Delhi’s traffic with this EV and this is our first impression. A full review will come later. BMW CE 02 design and features The BMW CE 02 breaks from traditional scooter and motorcycle design, offering a minimalistic yet futuristic look. The CE 02 we rode was equipped with the Highline Pack, which included bits like a gold anodised USD fork, teal stickering, tri-coloured seat, heated grips and a smartphone holder. The overall design features minimal bodywork, sharp angles, a single-sided swingarm and fat tyres that give it a unique look. The clean, flat surfaces combined with a simple-looking frame create a distinctive aesthetic that BMW hopes will appeal to younger riders. The CE 02 has a friendly face, with LED elements on the headlight, indicators and DRL creating a unique light signature. Our test bike also came with a unique teal-tinted visor sold as an optional  extra. During our short stint, the CE 02 stood out on our streets and looks like a concept bike. While the rest of the design feels quite cohesive, the front footpegs and their mount do look like a bit of an afterthought. BMW, though, says it's designed this way to accommodate a snow/skateboard. While some may find its playful design too polarising, I found it unique and funky. The CE 02 is equipped with a 3.5-inch TFT screen that may seem small on paper, but it does a pretty good job and has a crisp and clear layout. Additionally, BMW also allows you to mount your phone onto the bike and connect it via BMW’s app, giving you control of features on the app using the switchgear – your smartphone screen becomes an extension of the infotainment. What seemed odd to me was the heated grips, which seemed rather unnecessary in India. I would have preferred the windscreen or comfort seats instead. Speaking of which, with a seat height of 745mm, the CE 02 is quite friendly for shorter riders. However, the standard seat is narrow and will accommodate skinny passengers at best. In the real world, the CE 02 seems better suited for just a rider but a pillion would be a snug fit. As of now, BMW is offering the CE 02 in standard trim and the Highline Package with just one colour option. As part of the Highline Package, BMW will offer a 1.5kW fast charger that will fully charge the CE 02 in under 3.5 hours. BMW CE 02 performance The CE 02 is powered by two 1.96kWh batteries that have a combined capacity of 3.92kWh. The motors have a peak output of 11kW (15hp) and 55Nm. BMW claims the CE 02 is positioned as an electric alternative to a 200cc motorcycle, but its numbers put it more on pace with a sporty 160cc bike. While 15hp may not seem like a lot, the CE 02 picks up pace rather quickly and can effortlessly climb to its 95kph claimed top speed. There are three riding modes: Flow, Surf and Flash. The latter is only available as part of the Highline package and all three modes tweak the throttle response and regen levels. Flow has mild regen, Surf turns off regen entirely whereas Flash puts regen and throttle response on max giving you the most engaging experience. However, all three modes felt quite similar with the difference feeling rather negligible in the real world. BMW also claims that the CE 02 has a range of about 108km, which should make it an effective city commuter. However, we’d need more time with the CE 02 before we can verify those claims. BMW CE 02 ride and handling The CE 02 shines when it comes to ease of handling and urban practicality. Despite weighing a hefty 142kg, it feels rather light and darting through traffic is quite effortless. The thick Michelin City Grip tyres provide great grip and the brakes provide ample stopping power. The lack of rear ABS may seem daunting to newer riders as it’s rather easy to lock up the rear wheel, which may be cause for concern. Another issue I have is the suspension setup, which allows you to feel every imperfection in the road and may not feel as plush as one would come to expect from a thoroughbred city commuter like the CE 02. BMW’s most affordable electric two-wheeler loves to attack corners and it’s not hard to get it to scrap its pegs. BMW says riders can alternate between a more relaxed or a more engaging riding position based on what footpegs they use. While both felt comfortable, I preferred the forward-set position for most part of my journey. BMW CE 02 verdict Priced at Rs 4.50 lakh, it's one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers on sale, second only to its older sibling. However, the CE 02 still remains a niche EV for premium buyers that care more about brand image and futuristic design. While our time with it was short, the CE 02 has made a positive impression with all its credentials. We look forward to bringing you a more detailed review of this electric two-wheeler and testing it over a longer period in the future. Until then, stick around for further updates.",

    "description": "When we rode the TVS Apache RTR 310 in Thailand last year, we had some complaints, which the company has now addressed via its ‘Carecraft’ service camp. Much to my chagrin, we did not experience the updated RTR 310 on dry, well-paved Thai roads. Instead, the setting was Mumbai during the peak of monsoon, which is when the roads start to go the way of the Dodo. To be fair, a bike tackling such roads in torrential rain is one of the best litmus tests there is, so let’s dive in.    Our main complaints last year were excessive vibration, an erratic quickshifter and an uncomfortable climate-controlled seat, and TVS now has fixes for all these issues. In a bid to quell the RTR 310’s buzz, the bike has been given larger bar-end weights and a revised tank mounting. The cooled seat’s padding has been changed to improve comfort. Finally, a revised throttle map and new routing for the quickshifter’s wiring eliminate random cut-offs. 5-inch TFT display is well laid out and has a myriad of customisations. But before we get down to brass tacks, let me refresh your memory about this handsome yellow bike. TVS has pulled out all the stops when it comes to features. Even the base variant comes standard with a TFT display, four riding modes (Track, Sport, Urban and Rain), an automatic LED headlight (which is very bright), traction control, switchable dual-channel ABS and cruise control, too! Bright LED headlight has good throw; adaptive function is standard. Further, TVS’ accessory catalogue brings in a bidirectional quickshifter, climate-controlled seat, fully adjustable suspension, brass-coated chain, and more. The RTR 310 we tested missed out only on adjustable suspension and the brass-coated chain, so it was pretty well-specced.  Switchgear feels tactile, but the left-hand cube is a little busy.   So, have the changes made by TVS ironed out the chinks in the RTR 310’s armour? The short answer is yes (mostly). The vibrations are now better contained, and while the bike still isn’t ultra-smooth, the buzz is no longer a deal-breaker. The one area which still feels vibey is the grey rubber piece on the pillion seat, which gets buzzy at various rpms and sends a tingle up your back. The RTR 310’s quickshifter was already a pretty slick unit, and now it works seamlessly at all rpms. Cooled seat has more padding, but still not comfy for long periods. The one issue that persists is the climate-controlled seat’s comfort. As innovative as it is, in under an hour, you’ll start to feel discomfort due to its stiffness. I respect TVS for trying something ingenious like this, but I have to recommend going with the standard seat. We also encountered a few stray instances of the bike stalling while taking off from a stop with gentle throttle inputs, which can get a little tiresome in big-city traffic. Michelin Road 5 tyres are superb and inspire loads of confidence. Beyond that, the Apache RTR 310 remains an engaging yet reasonably comfortable bike to ride. A special mention must go to the excellent Michelin Road 5 rubber, which inspired loads of confidence in every scenario. The non-adjustable suspension struck a good balance between comfort and sportiness, and you don’t need the adjustable suspension, although it will help you fine-tune the setup to your liking.   The RTR 310 is the only model among the five TVS-BMW products on sale that makes 35.6hp and 28.7Nm of torque, compared to the other models’ 34hp/28Nm. TVS has also dramatically shortened the gearing on the RTR 310 compared to the RR, adding four more teeth to the rear sprocket. Strong performance and better refinement, but engine still buzzy. The result? Punchy acceleration and a 0-100kph time that was narrowly quicker than the 40hp Triumph Speed 400’s. If you find yourself on a long enough stretch of road, you’ll see a speedo-indicated 160kph, maybe more if you’re lighter than me (I weigh 80kg without gear). Suspension strikes a good balance between comfort and sportiness. While Sport and Track modes give you the full juice, Rain and Urban temper down peak output to 27.1hp/27.3Nm, with gentler power delivery and more cautious intervention from the riding aids. The Rain and Urban settings should come in handy for newer riders or if you’re riding in inclement weather. Brakes are progressive and feelsome, have enough power. Thankfully, if you ever have to ride in less-than-ideal conditions, the brakes are strong and feedback-rich. The RTR 310 has one of the shortest stopping distances in this category (the superb Road 5s helping here, too). They have a gentle initial bite, but once you give the lever a firm tug, the bike slows down quickly. What’s pleasantly surprising is that the shorter gearing hasn’t impacted fuel economy much, and you can realistically get 300km on a tankful.   Thanks to the updates, the Apache RTR 310 now has noticeable improvements that make it more appealing. However, the top variant with all the bells and whistles is priced too close to the feisty KTM 390 Duke, so the RTR continues to feel a little out of its depth. That’s exactly why the Apache RTR 310 is one of the few motorcycles where the version we recommend is the base variant. The RTR is an agile handler with enough power to entertain. At Rs 2.50 lakh, the base (but still feature-rich) RTR 310 is now a very strong alternative to the likes of the Triumph Speed 400, KTM 250 Duke and Honda CB300R because you get much stronger performance along with fantastic style and more features at a comparable price.",

    "description": "The new Speed T4 has some significant mechanical changes from the Speed 400 and it's rare to see something so different come out just a year after the birth of a new platform. As it turns out, this was one of the iterations in the development stage of the Bajaj-Triumph 400 platform and that’s why Bajaj was able to bring it out so soon. At its core, this is the same 399cc single cylinder unit, but power has seen a big drop from 40hp to 31hp. There’s also a small 1.5Nm reduction in torque, but it’s still a healthy 36Nm that is now produced 1,500rpm lower at 5,000rpm. These changes have been executed through a new airbox, a smaller throttle body (no ride-by-wire here) and new camshafts. More significantly, crank inertia has increased by a sizeable 31 percent. The idea behind all these changes is to create a more Indian-city-friendly riding experience and the Speed T4 scores well here. Ride it back to back with a Speed 400 and you’ll notice that the T4’s throttle response is smoother and more mellow. The torque now feels more widely spread and easily accessible – you can hold third gear as low as 20kph without complaint. The engine isn’t as rev-happy, and as a result, it’s a motor that doesn’t want to be revved as much as the Speed 400, which means vibrations are even less of an issue here. Within the city, the T4 feels more enjoyable than the Speed 400, but it does sacrifice some of the latter’s outright performance. The T4 doesn’t feel slow by any means and I suspect it will clock a sub-8-second 0-100kph time, but it lacks the same energetic high-rpm acceleration as its bigger brother. On the highway, a 100kph cruise feels fairly relaxed at around 5,500rpm and the bike has enough in reserve to surge up to 120kph. Progress above that is slow and you should see a top speed between 140kph and 150kph on the speedometer. There are quite a few changes with the chassis as well, the most obvious being the move to a telescopic front fork. The front brakes now use an axial caliper with organic brake pads and the T4 gets the same MRF bias ply tyres as the Pulsar NS400Z. Naturally, none of this sounds very appealing, but I found the tyres, brakes and suspension to be more than adequate for the generally calm way this bike enjoys being ridden. Nevertheless, perhaps sticking with the USD fork would have been wise because the new suspension setup makes the T4 easy to spot as the ‘budget option’ and it also makes an already skinny bike look even more so. The taller tires have also raised the seat height from 790mm to 804mm and this is something that folks shorter than 5’7” will notice. Other cost-saving measures can be seen in the move from aluminium to steel for things like the handlebar, foot levers and headlamp mounts. The T4 also misses out on adjustable levers, traction control and engine immobiliser. All this results in a lower price of Rs 2.17 lakh (ex-showroom, India), which is Rs 23,000 less than the 2025 Speed 400. On the one hand, that price highlights how the Speed 400 is still phenomenal value, but on the other, it also brings the T4 right into the space occupied by the popular 350cc Royal Enfields as well as the new Jawa 42FJ. Within a Triumph showroom, the Speed 400 will surely seem more appealing for ‘just’ Rs 23,000 extra. But the new T4 has a rather endearing riding experience to offer that I found more fitting in a bike like this – it will certainly appeal more strongly to the hordes of 350cc RE buyers that Triumph is trying to tempt away. If, like many others, you find yourself a bit underwhelmed by what this bike looks like on paper, give it a test ride. It might just surprise you.

    "title": "Yamaha Aerox Version S review: Subtle updates",

    "description": "At one point, it seemed unlikely that the Yamaha Aerox would come to India – it has the liquid-cooled engine from the R15, which makes it expensive, and a big spine section that makes it impractical. But Yamaha was brave enough to launch it here in 2021, and at that point, we at Autocar India praised it quite highly. But, we also questioned if the Indian market was ready for such a scooter. A few years down the line, it’s safe to say that the Aerox has been a success, and has done even better than Yamaha initially expected, to the point where the Japanese brand has now rolled out an update to try and sweeten the deal, and make it a little more India-friendly. Yamaha Aerox Version S: changes to standard model You now get a top-spec variant called Version S, which comes with a keyless system. The international Aerox has had this feature for a while now – it was removed as a cost-cutting measure when the scooter first came to India, but is now being offered if you’re willing to pay for it. The Aerox was already a fairly convenient scooter – it had a combination keyslot, which you still get on the other variants, and a fuel-filler conveniently placed in front of you. Now, it’s even more convenient – you can open the seat and the fuel filler, lock and unlock the handlebar and operate the scooter, all without the key fob leaving your pocket. New keyless system adds convenience. The other change here is suspension – Yamaha says it has tweaked the suspension to make it a little better suited to our roads. This is important, because one of the biggest drawbacks of the Aerox when we first rode it was its very stiff and unforgiving ride quality. Has this new setup improved things? Possibly. Marginally. In some situations. We’d really have to ride both versions back to back to be sure, because that’s how small the differences are. But is this now suddenly a plush and comfortable scooter? No. The ride still feels rather firm and stiff, and this is not the scooter you would want to be on over poor stretches of road. The final change here is the addition of a traction control system, which is unlikely to come into play often, but still a good safety net to have.  Revised shocks still feel quite firm. Yamaha Aerox Version S: price and verdict   Considering the subtleness of these changes, it’s unsurprising that the essence of the Aerox has remained largely unchanged. At the heart of the experience is a quick and entertaining engine that outclasses anything else in this price range. Backing it up is a capable and rewarding handling package that really allows you to have some fun. It’s still very much an enthusiast’s offering, and isn’t the most practical or comfortable scooter around, especially if you’re on the taller side. But the market has shown that there are enough takers for this flavour of scooter. We still continue to like the Aerox for what it is, and we hope Yamaha and other manufacturers draw encouragement from this.

    "description": "There are many, many similarities between the two motorcycles that we have here today. For example, they both wear very old British badges but are actually thoroughly modern, made-in-India machines. Both produce exactly 40 horsepower from their liquid-cooled single-cylinder engines, and both have a starting price of under Rs 2.4 lakh. Having ridden them intensively for a few days, I can tell you that there’s no simple answer as to which is better because both have many appealing pros as well as a few significant cons. The first impression Starting with the pros, design is a big one on the Triumph, and it has the best attention to detail of any made-in-India motorcycle, including the new-age Royal Enfield seen here. There’s only one downside that becomes apparent when parked next to most other 350-400cc bikes – it doesn’t really have that much presence. The Speed 400 is not a small bike, and even tall riders will fit on it well, but it does look and feel a little too slender. The Enfield has a more quirky design in comparison, which will be more polarising, but there’s no doubt that it has more presence with its fat tyres, Himalayan-style rear panels and wider-looking fuel tank. That last element is ironic given that it actually has a smaller fuel capacity of 11 litres compared to 13 on the Speed. The Guerrilla’s rear with that fat exposed tyre looks nicer than the rather practical rear of the Triumph, but the trade-off is that it flings more road muck onto the rider in wet conditions. At 185kg, the RE is heavier than the Triumph (176kg), but its 780mm tall seat is the lowest in the segment, while the Speed 400’s is just 10mm higher. On the move Both have comfy riding positions, but the Guerrilla’s feels a little more engaged with a wider, higher handlebar and higher-set footpegs. I find the Guerrilla’s position to be nicer, but the Triumph’s seat is more comfortable over longer durations. Both also take different approaches to comfort in their suspension setups. The Guerrilla is noticeably stiffer, but thankfully, it isn’t harsh like the Hunter. It actually deals with bad roads quite well. It always feels firm but never uncomfortable, and it absorbs bumps without pitching you out of the seat. The Speed is softer, and this is nice at slower speeds and on smooth surfaces. However, when compared with the Guerrilla, it quickly  gets bouncy over less-than-ideal surfaces. Guerrilla’s telescopic fork works well. The Guerrilla’s suspension and general chassis setup are designed to be fun on a winding road. Despite carrying nine extra kilos, it feels lighter-steering, more agile and far more enthusiastic about diving into a set of corners. The Speed is very competent, but while it comes across as being able to do it, the Guerrilla was built to enjoy doing it. The same goes for the brakes, with the Triumph’s being strong and reassuring, but the RE’s are better, both in terms of feel and performance. Change of pace The tides turn when it comes to the engine. On paper, both make 40hp and the Enfield – with its 54cc advantage – produces a little more torque at slightly lower revs. In reality, both perform quite differently, and in many ways, the Triumph’s engine is better. For one, it’s more tractable in the city, and you can hold a gear higher than the RE without protest. It also has a lighter clutch and, coupled with its slim proportions, it is the nicer city bike. The Speed is also smoother on the highway, and while the vibrations do build up from 120kph, you’ll start to feel them from 100kph on the Guerrilla. Looks good, but rev counter a bit hard to read. Then there’s the fact that it’s also a little more fuel efficient than the Royal Enfield, both in the city and out on the highway, and it’ll have better highway range thanks to the larger fuel tank. As for actual performance, the tested numbers are almost identical, with the Enfield a little faster in acceleration, while the Triumph had a tiny advantage in roll-on test figures. It was very close, but the Guerrilla was tested in damp conditions, which could make a small difference. Where the Enfield motor claws back some points is in sound and character. The Sherpa 450 engine is the more flawed motor here but also the more engaging one. It produces a nicer intake sound and has a more revvy, fun-to-ride feeling. In fact, its response can be surprisingly eager, especially when you shift from first to second gear and cross the 3,000rpm mark. For the few folks who won’t like this, there’s the option of changing to Eco mode, which significantly dumbs down the performance. What you get Before we wrap up, let’s just talk about features, and once again, there’s a bit of give and take. The Speed 400 gets a simpler analogue-digital display, but you do get the USD fork, traction control and an engine immobiliser. The Enfield gives you a simpler telescopic fork, but you get a centre stand, two engine power modes and the option of the TFT display from the Himalayan. Classy TFT screen on top two Guerrilla variants. As for quality, some Triumph owners have complained about rusty bolts in a few areas and heavy condensation in the indicators – both were visible on our bike. Our bike also sometimes took up to five cranks to start up. The Guerrilla is based on the Himalayan platform, which has its fair share of issues as well, the most infamous being the chassis failure, which Royal Enfield says was due to incorrectly installed aftermarket crash guards. It also has the same fiddly toggle button that has recently completely failed on our long-term Himalayan. Clearly, both manufacturers need to iron out some issues in these brand-new platforms. USD fork adds to the Speed’s visual appeal. At the end of it all, I don’t think there is a clear winner here. It boils down to which plus points are more important to you and which negatives you are more willing to live with. For example, the Triumph is the more grown-up and sophisticated motorcycle here, and it has the more desirable badge on its fuel tank. It also has a smoother engine and is the nicer bike to commute on. The RE counters with a higher fun factor and better suspension comfort, and it looks and feels like a more comprehensive motorcycle. I’d like both bikes to have been better in certain areas, but I find myself slightly inclined towards the Guerrilla. I like my motorcycles to look and feel special, and they have to be special in the way they ride. The Guerrilla ticks what are the most important boxes for me, but that doesn’t have to be the case with you. Also See: RE Guerrilla 450 vs Triumph Speed 400 comparison video",

    "description": "It is almost impossible to get hold of our long-term Skoda Slavia’s key, which Shapur has been clinging onto ever since it arrived in the Autocar India fleet. It isn’t hard to see why, though – the combination of 150hp turbo petrol and dual-clutch transmission, along with the very European driving dynamics, make it a hoot to drive. Luckily for me, his packed schedule with back-to-back travel for all the special stories for our (previous) 300th issue and (this) anniversary issue resulted in the Slavia being left uncommissioned in one of the corners of our office parking lot. And with a full tank of fuel, too! Good: Excellent SUV-like 179mm ground clearance. Straight up, finding an ideal driving position is a breeze thanks to the electric driver’s seat controls and multiple steering adjustments. And I can’t applaud the 10-inch touchscreen’s seamless connectivity enough, especially with wireless Android Auto. Also, while the sound system isn’t branded, the quality is impressive, with clear vocals and strong bass.  Bad: Poor camera quality and low-res display need improvement. Enough has been said by Shapur about its strong 150hp 1.5 TSI turbo-petrol engine. So I won’t repeat it. It is quick, and the mid-range pull is strong, but because of its linear nature, I miss the drama of yesteryear’s turbo-petrol mills, wherein turbo lag was followed by manic boost; those had a charm of their own. Also, at high revs, the 1.5 TSI sounds quite boomy.  Good: Impressive sound quality with clear vocals and strong bass from the subwoofer that's mounted inside the spare tyre.  The seven-speed dual-clutch isn’t very smooth in stop-go traffic either. It makes the car lurch ahead while rolling off from a standstill. While decelerating, the downshifts occasionally feel jerky. The overenthusiastic auto stop-start system kicks in even before the car comes to a full halt, which gets very annoying at crawling speeds. Finally, enthusiasts who want to unlock more out of this engine will be disappointed as most tuners haven’t been able to crack its ECU. City fuel efficiency is usually in single digits. This, however, is the best I've managed One evening, I drove the Slavia at my docile best and tried to induce its cylinder deactivation technology as often as possible. It was a smooth-flowing 22-minute journey from office to home, with the usual traffic signals and auto stop-start feature doing its thing, and the best I managed to achieve was 13kpl as per the instrument cluster display, which is quite accurate. But bring in bumper-to-bumper traffic and high ambient temperatures into the mix, and after just a few minutes of idling, like any other turbo-petrol car, fuel efficiency nosedives to single digits – which is what we’ve been averaging to date. Bad: Stop-start feature turns off the engine even before the car halts. After spending a couple of weeks with the Slavia, I revisited our road test and can relate to every little detail mentioned, especially this statement, which summarises my experience perfectly: “The Slavia is so good, it is one of the most rounded offerings in the segment, and with its practical yet fun-to-drive nature, this sedan has got serious potential to sway SUV buyers in its direction.” Also see:  Skoda Slavia DSG long term review, 5,700km report 2022 Skoda Slavia review, road test",

    "description": "Replace the fetching new Sakhir Gold paint shade for a more conventional black, white or silver, and you’d be hard pressed to identify this Audi Q8 as the 2024 Audi Q8. Fact is, the list of changes on Audi’s glamorous big SUV isn’t a long one. Yet, it’s a model you can’t help but be charmed by.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift exterior design  For starters, the way it looks. To me, the Q8 is the best looking of the German SUV-coupes. The balanced proportions and in particular, the flow of the C-pillar and exaggerated haunches that link to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s give the Q8 standout appeal. It's not a shape I'd tinker with much, to be honest.  The exaggerated haunches link the Q8 to Audi's hero rally cars of the 80s.  As for what’s changed, the headlights are familiar in shape but have been upgraded to HD Matrix LED units with powerful laser lights for high beam. What's also cool is the option to toggle between four DRL light signatures. The bold octagonal grille gets a facelift of its own with the incorporation of chrome teardrop detailing that adds in a bit of bling. Also, the Q8 makes the move to Audi's new 2D logo. The front bumper has been revised with a new intake design and chin spoiler.  At the sides, it's the new 21-inch rims finished in graphite grey and red brake calipers that are your only cues to this being the 2024 Q8. Frameless windows remain a detail that'll leave an impression at the hotel lobby. At the back, the latest Q8 carries forward the full-width LED lighting, with a redone scuff plate completing this mildest of makeovers.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift interior and features Even less has changed inside. It’s a high quality space but there’s a feeling of familiarity thanks to a three screen layout. The 10.1-inch touchscreen on the upper portion of the dash is very slick but still misses on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The lower 8.8-inch touchscreen for the climate control system is more contentious. While you do get used to it over time and haptic feedback helps, for anything but the basic temperature controls you’ll need to take your eyes off the road. The third screen is for the digital dials. While informative, they lack the vibrancy that we've seen in the screens on the latest lot of BMWs and Mercs. Still misses out on wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Features-wise the Q8 packs in soft close for the doors, a sweet-sounding Bang \u0026 Olufsen sound system, four-zone climate control and a panoramic sunroof. There's ambient lighting too, park assist, and a 360-degree camera with maneuver assist that'll apply the brakes if the system senses an impending collision when you're parking your vehicle. However, a full suite of ADAS features is missed, which is something you'd expect on a car of this price. Also, there's no seat ventilation and even steering adjust is manual. Individuals just under 6 feet can manage with reasonable headroom.  Rear seat passengers have it good with lots of legroom and (not a speciality on SUV-coupes) too. There's also the option to drop the rear seat backrest by a few degrees for added comfort and you also get powered sunshades. Luggage space remains unchanged at 605 litres. Folding down the rear seats takes that figure to 1755 litres. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift powertrain There are no changes under the hood. We get the Q8 in 55 TFSI form, which means power comes courtesy a 3.0-litre V6 turbo-petrol engine. The engine makes 340hp and 500Nm and power is channeled to all four wheels via Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system. V6 turbo-petrol only show its full might when you really provoke it. It's a familiar experience behind the wheel, but also a very likeable one. This is not the kind of engine that makes a song and dance of the power that it has. Power delivery is smooth throughout and you have this feeling of a reserve of power that you can always tap into. The engine will only show its full might when you really provoke it. 0-100 kph takes a claimed 5.6 seconds and top speed is limited to 250 kph.  2024 Audi Q8 facelift ride and handling  Thing is, the Q8 is the kind of car that has a calming effect on you, which is also a function of its excellent refinement. Refinement is really good, you won't hear much from the engine bay at average city speeds and even road and wind noise are really well contained. There is one notable change under the skin though. The Q8 is now only available with steel springs, you don't get an option of air suspension as you did before. Does that mean ride comfort is a compromise? Absolutely not. It rounds off the bumps really well, it doesn't feel as stiff-kneed as some of the other European luxury rivals and mind you that it's doing all that it does on large 21-inch rims. The Q8 prioritises comfort over driver engagement and there's really nothing wrong with that approach. Even with steel springs, it rounds off the bumps really well. The Q8 comes across as a smooth operator in the corners as well, it's not the most dynamic SUV even with its steering and suspension set to their sportiest, but for something so large and so heavy, you still will have quite a bit of fun in the corners. Body control is good and so are grip levels, helped in no small measure by Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system. For max driver thrills, you'll have to wait for the updated version of the fire-breathing RS Q8 that should come to India early next year. 2024 Audi Q8 facelift price and verdict So that, in a nutshell, is the 2024 Audi Q8. Priced at 1.17 crore rupees ex-showroom, it slots in between the outgoing Q8 and Q8 Celebration variant. Also, with the BMW X6 currently not on sale in India and the Mercedes GLE Coupe only sold in AMG form at a much higher price point, the Q8 sits in a sweet spot in the luxury SUV market. The right way to look at a Q8 would be as a fashionable alternative to a BMW X5 or Mercedes GLE. Yes, the update should have filled in the blanks with added features, but the rest of the package remains likeable as ever. So, just as before, for an SUV that's all about size and glamour, the Q8 still offers much to win you over. Also see:   Audi Q8 facelift launched at Rs 1.17 crore",

    "title": "Ferrari 12Cilindri review: the ultimate V12",
    "link": "https://www.autocarindia.com/car-reviews/ferrari-12cilindri-review-the-ultimate-v12-433056#utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss\u0026utm_campaign=Autocar+India+All+Car+Reviews+feed",
    "description": "12Cilindri or “doe-dee-chee-chill-in-dree” translates to 12 cylinders in Italian. That’s also the name of the latest Ferrari. Now you might think that’s quite an unimaginative name (though it sounds so much nicer pronounced in Italian) but it’s actually a celebration of 12 cylinders in their purest form. This 6.5-litre V12, carried over from the 812 Competizione, the 12 Cilindri’s predecessor, is the last of a breed. It has no turbos, no hybrid tech, just pure natural aspiration, and it still manages to crank out 830hp at a screaming 9,250rpm. For Ferrari, the V12 is iconic and deeply rooted in its history. The legendary Italian brand has always had a 12-cylinder in its portfolio since 1947 and Enzo Ferrari has always believed that the V12 engine is the only one that can give a car a soul. The 12Cilindri is the last of its breed in a long line of iconic Ferrari GTs.  But not even in his wildest dreams could Enzo ever have foreseen that the V12 would be under threat, on the verge of becoming extinct. In today’s world of electrons, volts and lithium-ion, the naturally-aspirated V12 is a rarity and, fittingly, it is Ferrari that remains as the last big sportscar maker in the world to offer one uncorrupted by turbos or e-motors. The lineage of the 12Cilindri goes back to the 550 Maranello which was followed by the 575, 599, F12 and 812 Superfast. Each of these models was faster and more aggressive than its predecessor with the 812 being particularly extreme. But now there’s been a shift in the positioning of Ferrari’s V12 flagship. The company says the 12Cilindri has a different goal. It’s not to be the fastest or most powerful Ferrari (that mantle has been given to the SF90) but to be the most complete GT or Grand Touring car. That means it’s no more a knife edge (like the 812) but a more rounded car with a wider range of talents. And it’s a car that harks back to tradition, to a bygone era of great design of the 1970s. Ferrarri 12Cilindri: exterior design  The styling is clearly inspired by the 365 GTB/4, the original Ferrari Daytona. The black band across the nose (you can’t have it in body colour) and the set-back headlights pay homage to the original Daytona’s smooth and almost faceless nose. The clean and relatively uncluttered surfaces, the incredibly long bonnet with voluptuous fenders wrapping themselves around massive 21-inch wheels and a cabin that looks like its perched on the rear axle are also strong Daytona influences. Dark front strip and hidden lights hark back to the first Daytona. Modern touches are abundant in the 12Cilindri like the flush door handles, a sharp front lip that protrudes far forward (a worry on Indian roads) and subtle aero bits. The delta-wing roof motif – an innovative design element that combines a part glass roof with a sleek hardtop – looks quite radical, especially from the rear, and may split opinion. The small rear screen does look a touch odd and the large surrounds for the rectangular exhausts looks out of proportion.  Two discreet winglets on either side of the rear deploy between 60 and 300kph, generating up to 50kg of downforce. If you’re wondering why Ferrari didn’t opt for a large rear wing, it’s because that would have compromised the 270-litre boot space – surprisingly generous for a 830hp super coupé. After all, you’ll need room for your designer luggage on those long-distance drives. Two winglets at the outer edges pop up between 50kph and 300kph. The front-hinged clamshell bonnet is an impressive single piece of aluminum that integrates both the front wings and the engine cover. It’s a remarkable engineering feat, designed to fit tightly around the 21-inch front wheels. Lifting this massive bonnet nicely exposes the chunky 275/35 front tyres and also reveals how far behind the front axle the V12 sits – like it’s buried under the windscreen. The 12Cilindri is effectively a ‘front mid-engined car with a near perfect 48.5:51.5 weight distribution biased marginally to the rear. Speaking of weight, the 12Cilindri uses a mix of lightweight materials, largely aluminium and some carbon fibre, to tip the scales at a relatively lightweight 1,560kg dry.  The delta-wing roof motif looks quite radical, and may split opinion.   Ferrari 12Cilindri: interior and features  The 12Cilindri’s cabin uses the same design theme as its front engine siblings, the Roma and Purosangue. There are two distinct ‘zones’ – one for the driver and the passenger. A 15.6-inch digital instrument cluster greets the driver, whilst the passenger gets an 8.8-inch screen which displays the kind of data you’d want to see like speed, revs and g-forces. What’s new is a central 10.2-inch screen which now houses the aircon and seat functions. It sits low down and blends with the dashboard when its off, so it doesn’t distract you, but you have to take your eyes off the road to operate it. Also, the nose lift function is assigned to the central screen. In the Indian context that’s a function that should ideally be on the steering wheel so you can quickly raise the nose when a monstrous speed breaker springs up at you. Dual-zone cockpit looks distinctive; central screen placed low down to avoid distractions.  All other major controls and functions like the turn indicators, wipers, lights and the ‘Mannetino’ drive modes are all housed on the steering wheel. The haptic touch pads, which are common features on modern Ferraris, are fiddly to use even with indents designed to let you ‘feel’ the controls without having to take your eyes off the road. You have all the connectivity features, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (which is wired) as well as a whole suite of ADAS features. Again, like in all newer Ferraris, there’s no in-built navigation system in the 12Cilindri because Ferrari assumes that most owners will plot their route using Google Maps off their phones. 15.6-inch digital instrument cluster has superb clarity. The cabin of the 12Cilindri is impeccably crafted, with premium materials that exude true luxury, without being deliberately minimal in the name of weight saving. The electrically adjustable ‘Goldrake’ seats fitted in this test car are supremely comfortable and a far more practical option than the sportier ‘Daytona’ racing buckets. The transmission ‘gate’ again harks back to a Ferrari tradition, but of course it’s not a manual but operates a new eight-speed DCT gearbox and the launch control function. Transmission 'gate' design a nod to Ferraris of old Sadly, tradition isn’t carried over to the first point of contact with the V12. Instead of a solid, tactile starter button, a haptic touch pad on the steering wheel fires up the engine, which I have to say takes the thrill out of the ignition sequence. Ferrari 12Cilindri: powertrain, performance  Press the haptic button on the steering wheel and the V12 bursts in into life but quickly settles down to a subdued idle. The first thing you notice is that this is not a very loud engine, like it was in the 812. At low revs, it’s certainly softer, with more mechanical and induction sound than a loud exhaust bellow. To hear the 12-cylinder symphony in all its glory, you have to rev the engine all the way to the 9,500rpm redline. V12 placed far behind front axle line for optimal weight distribution. The challenge on the narrow public roads of rural Luxembourg’s test route is finding a stretch where you can safely (and legally) hit the rev limiter beyond the first two gears. However, the shorter ratios of the eight-speed DCT make it easier to redline the engine. Though this smooth and refined V12 loves headbutting the limiter, it’s not something you can do all the time. Most owners will be driving at relaxed revs and that’s where the engine impresses too with its remarkable flexibility. It pulls cleanly and forcefully from as low as 2,000rpm, with power building like a giant wave all the way to the redline. Revving it to 9,500rpm unleashes a spine-tingling crescendo, creating a sensation of endless acceleration. The engine sounds epic when you floor the throttle, its pitch climbing to a high-pitched shriek at max revs. A lot of work has gone into redesigning the exhaust system to make it as sweet sounding as possible. However, some owners might find the aural drama not quite loud enough for their liking. It’s likely that aftermarket exhausts will become a popular upgrade for this car. Driving position is spot on, with all controls at your finger tips. The 12Cilindri is nothing short of shockingly fast too, as the claimed 0-100kph time of 2.9 seconds and a 340kph top speed would suggest. On country roads in Luxembourg, the ferocious pace is amplified and it turns any stretch of tarmac into a blur. The eight-speed DCT is possibly the best twin-clutch auto transmission on the market. It is lightning quick with upshifts that are 30 percent faster than the previous seven-speed DCT. It works quite well in Auto mode too for expressway ‘grand touring’ and, for a gearbox that’s mated to a high strung engine, is remarkably smooth. But then who wants to drive a Ferrari like an automatic? The 12Cilindri is a nicely rounded grand tourer.   Ferrari 12Cilindri: ride and handling  On single-lane country roads, the 12Cilindri feels big, especially with that long bonnet stretching out in front of you. I can imagine this 4.73-metre long and 2.0-metre wide car testing your judgement (and nerves) in the motley mix of Mumbai traffic. The large turning circle doesn’t help whilst parking and its essential to spec the car with the camera system. The steering, geared with under two turns lock-to-lock, is very quick off centre. Maybe too quick, with zero slack, and it takes some getting used to. This is an incredibly agile car that’s brilliantly balanced and is best driven with small and precise steering inputs. The rear-wheel steering makes the 12Cilindri super sensitive to direction changes and it feels like it’s pivoting around the driver, and unlike its mid-engine siblings, it doesn’t feel nervous or edgy. It feels incredibly agile for its size. Ride quality on some of the rare and mildly bumpy roads in Luxembourg was impressive but the true test will be on Indian roads. However, having driven quite a few Ferraris in both kinds of conditions, you can expect the 12Cilindri to soak up mild imperfections without a protest. The magic formula is the  magnetorheological, semi-active dampers which have a ‘bumpy road’ setting and can be activated by merely giving the Manettino dial a simple push. The brake-by-wire system has good bite and a short-travel pedal, which instils huge confidence when you’re driving quickly and something darts in your way. Ferrari 12Cilindri: verdict The 12 Cilindri is surprisingly easy to drive for a car that can otherwise be overwhelming. It’s unquestionably fast and refined at the same time. It’s a bold mix of cutting edge tech and heritage design, which some may find a bit too radical, but it’s undeniably Ferrari’s best GT car, a car that can thrill on both road and track. It’s coming to India next year, and with a price tag of around Rs 7.5 crore, you might want to start saving now. Also See: Ferrari 12 Cilindri video review",

    "description": "The Mini Cooper was one of the first cars to introduce the concept of an affordable, fun-to-drive small car. As time passed, affordability reduced as the new Mini models climbed up into the premium end. But, of course, the fun element remained. In a similar vein, albeit at the other end of the spectrum, is the Maruti Swift. The first generation Swift was fun, and in keeping with Maruti’s ethos, affordable too. However, since the launch of the fourth-generation Swift, there has been a lot of talk about the smaller three-cylinder engine – lacking in power and grunt – and the price climbing higher, reaching levels of its elder sibling, the Baleno. Yes, the price has climbed higher for sure, but as for performance, it hasn’t been an issue for me at all. I say this after using the new Swift as my daily driver for around a month now.  A full-fledged dead-pedal adds to comfort, especially in stop-go traffic. The shape and size are just right for the city, the seats are soft and comfy, and the engine – well, it’s efficient. And that’s always a higher priority when I’m paying fuel bills. Since I got the Swift, I’ve clocked over 1,000km and the average efficiency has always been above 14kpl. And no, I do not drive it with a light foot. To be fair, on many occasions, I can’t. In peak-hour traffic, the engine is more than adequate, but as soon as a few overtakes are on the cards, it needs to be wrung hard. The linear power delivery just doesn’t cut it, and the only quick fix is downshifting. Speaking of which, I had hoped for an automatic after driving the manual Exter for over three months, but the Swift is yet another manual. I would have sulked if it were any other car, but on the Swift, having a manual gearbox is fun. The clutch is superlight and absolutely effortless, the gears slot in well, and you almost forget about the lack of pep from the engine. The seating position is also bang on, and there is a dedicated dead pedal for added comfort. Rear camera quality is average and worsens in the dark. Guidelines not dynamic. What’s a bit of an annoyance is the auto start/stop, which helps save fuel, but in stop-go traffic, the constant shutting off and on will add to the suffering. Thankfully, it just takes a press of a button to turn it off. The other negative is the camera quality. Given the price at which the new Swift has been launched, you would expect a decent parking camera. However, the resolution is poor on the new Swift, and even basics like dynamic guidelines are missing. In the dark, and while it is raining, you cannot rely too much on it. Speaking of darkness, there is no rear cabin light, which I’m guessing helps save some costs, but it is essential. I end up storing shopping bags or small items in the back seat and in case they roll off or I can’t find them, I have to use the phone flashlight. A lamp at the rear would have helped. With an average efficiency of over 14kpl, there’s no range or financial anxiety. The rest of the car, though, has been perfect in the city. The steering is light enough to allow zipping through narrow streets and parking in tight spaces, especially in and around the crowded suburb of Bandra. The boot is more than adequate for a weekend out of the city, the rear seats get dedicated USB-A and type-C charging ports as well as AC vents. LED lights work well in the dark, the ground clearance is plenty, and there is nothing to complain about the ride comfort from the 15-inch wheels. Honestly, the more I drive it, the more I like it. No cabin light in the rear makes it difficult to look for items in the back at night. As an introduction, it has been very positive, and most apprehensions about the dull engine performance fade away. However, once this anniversary issue closes, I’ve planned a getaway out of town, which will involve a whole lot more overtaking and triple-digit speeds. How the engine fares there is what the next report will be on. Also see: 2024 Maruti Swift road test, review Maruti Swift vs Baleno comparison video Maruti Swift CNG launched at Rs 8.20 lakh",

    "description": "For years, the 3 Series has been the highest selling BMW in the world. And it still is – in some ways – especially if you include the 3 Series estate. However, BMW’s current global bestseller, according to its own metrics, is the X3 SUV; even in its runout year. Thing is, the X3 isn’t really a big seller in India. Easily outsold by the Mercedes GLC, one of Merc’s bestsellers here, BMW will be hoping that this fresh new X3 (G45 as it is known internally), will appeal to a wider section of Indian customers. BMW X3 design, exterior That the new fourth generation X3 looks fresh comes as little surprise – it sees the introduction of a new design language. Almost monolithic in appearance, the new X3 is full of large, clean surfaces and minimal cuts and creases. The focal point of the design is the high cowl and big bonnet – the latter only has a single crease that runs around the edge. Have to say that the manner in which the big grille is incorporated into the design looks good, and it is illuminated with LEDs. Fourth-gen X3 gets BMW's new, swoopier design language. Also new is the grille, which consists of both diagonal and horizontal slats. Alongside it are dagger-shaped headlights with double LED ‘ticks’ that remind you of the ‘Angry Birds’ game. This is supported by wide, well-fleshed-out wheel arches (to help lend a bit of muscle), and no cladding – something BMWs have traditionally had on its SUVs. Around the rear, the stance is even sportier. The base has been made to look wider, the rear windshield is smaller and tucked in and there are no exhaust pipes visible under the diffuser. Also nicely done and evolved are the arrow-like tail-lights. While the X3 is built around the CLAR platform, as all rear-wheel-drive based BMWs are, the engineers have reduced its weight, increased body rigidity and worked on the suspension in a bid to improve the manner in which it tackles corners. They’ve also used braces at the front and rear– on the strut towers and rear suspension mounts – that further improve the location of the suspension points when the SUV is loaded up in corners. The X3 20 driven here (notice no ‘i’ suffix now) also gets four-wheel-drive – xDrive in BMW parlance – and an electronically locking rear differential. The X3 also has a 45mm wider track for a more planted stance, and frequency-selective dampers. No exhaust pipes visible at the rear.   BMW X3 interior, features As with many new BMW SUVs, the new X3 cabin takes a leaf out of the iX and gets a sloping dash, wide curved display, and a very modern, minimalist look. BMW’s designers have avoided making it look very generic, and the new X3 gets a large central stowage area as well as unique doorpads with electrically controlled air volume adjusters (to control the airflow of the side vents). Also quite different is the material the cabin comes with.The meshed fabric on the dash, for example, is quite porous, and while we’ll have to see how well it handles our dusty conditions, it does stand out. You can get vegan or artificial leather inside the entire cabin if you so wish, even on the steering wheel. The large screen is now built around an Android operating system, so features like Google Maps are seamlessly integrated and constantly updated. Apple CarPlay works seamlessly, and BMW's system even allows you to download a multitude of new apps; like any ’droid system would. There’s also a square digital ‘assistant’ on the left of the screen and you can scroll through all sorts of information and features vertically. The assistant helps you with the features inside the cabin, and even plays mini tutorial videos that make using some of the features – like park assist – easy. Front seats are quite comfortable and offer good support. To give the interiors a bit of a lift, there are multiple LED bands that line the front of the cabin and the doors. You can not only change colours as you please but these bands also flash warnings if you open a door and there’s a car approaching. What’s cool is that they also adjust according to the temperature – light up blue when you reduce the temperature and go red when you warm up the cabin. Below the dash, the new X3 gets a large central stowage area, sure to be very popular in the USA. You get an angled wireless charger, twin USB C ports, big cup holders and a band of cool-looking LEDs that surround it. Further back, the gear selector switch sits on a piano black pod that also houses a crystalline iDrive controller, a knurled metal volume adjuster and various shortcut buttons. However, BMW’s shift to ‘My Modes’ instead of comfort and sport buttons, shifts a lot of the selection process to the screen. And this is a pain when on the move. The side vents, with the haptic touch controls and illuminated scale, are fun to use. The only shortcomings are possibly quality levels on the door pads, and ordinary-looking plastics on some areas of the cabin. While the new X3’s cabin is forward-looking and built of quality materials, it doesn’t feel quite as plush or luxurious as the GLC. The rear seat reclines and there's more space here than the outgoing model. Space and comfort are very impressive, though. The driver’s seat is large and very supportive, the seats are very nicely put together, and in addition, the cushioning also seems just right. Despite the wheelbase being almost identical, space and comfort at the rear are better too. A back-to-back comparison showed that the new car has more width, more legroom, and much better thigh support as well. The backrest can also be reclined a few degrees, but this now has to be done from over your shoulder rather than beside your seat. You also get a huge, fixed panoramic sunroof and touch controls for the rear HVAC controls. Also impressive is the large 570-litre boot with space under the floor to keep a space-saver tyre. There’s also a handy parcel tray, hooks for bags and a 12V socket. 570-litre boot is more than enough for most. BMW X3 performance, ride quality  With its 2.0-litre petrol engine and electric motor putting out a combined 208hp, you don’t expect the X3 to accelerate crisply from low- and medium-engine speeds. But this is just what it does – you have the 18hp and 200Nm from the e-motor to thank. And this smooth pull continues well into the midrange, with the engine providing a nice, linear pull. It’s not easy to manage the boost of the turbocharged engine, spike of torque from the electric motor and a set of gears together, but BMW’s familiarity with the 8-speed torque converter gearbox makes this feel more like a ballet and less like a break dance. Stepping off the line is effortless and the gearbox is quick to downshift but flat-out acceleration isn’t strong – the engine gets loud at higher speeds and 0-100kph comes up in a claimed 7.8 seconds. Progress is seamless and smooth and the X3 doesn’t feel its weight (the scale reads 1,930kg). This doesn't feel like a near-2-tonne SUV. The new X3 does feel much more agile and willing to turn into corners. The steering is lighter at low speeds and the new X3 is also much happier to dart into corners, especially in comparison to the model currently on sale in India. With the rear-biased four-wheel-drive system providing plenty of grip and some stellar body control, you can really enjoy a winding road. However, a bit more weight and connect from the steering would have been nice. With not too many poor roads to contend with in Bavaria, it was difficult to judge the ride of the new X3. What few bad patches we encountered were swallowed silently and comfortably, with only a hint of initial stiffness.The ride at speed was also pretty flat and devoid of pitching, but we’ll only get a good idea once we run the X3 on our ‘specially curated’ roads. It darts into corners with much more aplomb than its predecessor.   BMW X3 verdict The new fourth-generation X3 is a big improvement over the SUV currently sold here. The new styling works well, the cabin is more spacious and comfortable, and BMW has also upped its game when it comes to fun features and cabin look and feel. The new X3 also feels more agile and confidence inspiring from behind the wheel – it’s lighter and easier to drive, and the engine and e-motor deliver plenty of smoothness and pep at low and medium speeds. Yes, more power and performance at this price would have been nice, the cabin isn’t quite as plush as Merc’s GLC and some plastics on the inside could have been better built. However, what’s clear is that the fourth-generation X3 is a fresh new take on midsize luxury, one that seems nicely aligned with what Indian luxury SUV buyers are looking for. Headed to a BMW showroom near you early next year? Don’t sign on the dotted line until you have seen and experienced this one. It has some real aces up its sleeve.

    "description": "KTM will take the covers off the next-gen 390 Adventure at the EICMA, and most of the changes done to it will also trickle down to the 250 Adventure, as this spy shot reveals. Engine, main frame to be carried over from 250 Duke Same display, switchgear as KTM-Husqvarna 250s Test mule seen running on spoked wheels The next-gen 250 Adventure will use the new design philosophy that we have seen in the spy shots of the upcoming 390 ADV. That means a slim, almost enduro-like design with a typical KTM insect-like headlight. To differentiate the 250 and 390 models, Bajaj will adopt a strategy similar to the one for the Duke models. While the mirror stalks look identical to the ones seen on the Dominar and Pulsar NS400Z, the lenses seem to have a new design, similar to the international, large-capacity KTMs.  Also See: 2024 KTM 250 Duke review: 31hp never felt this good The 390 Adventure will use LED daytime running lights, while the 250 will forego them. The 250 Adventure will have the same LCD dash and switchgear as the 250 Duke and Vitpilen 250. This is an interesting strategy of bestowing equipment because now even the 200 Duke gets a TFT dash, but the bigger and newer 250s still make do with a simpler LCD unit.  What is also interesting is that this test mule is seen running on wire-spoke wheels, which means it is shod with tubed tyres. The 250 Adventure has never been offered with spoked wheels in India, even as an option, and it seems like the next-gen model will change that. It remains to be seen if the bike will come standard with it or if the spoked wheels will be an optional extra. Just like the current 250 Adventure, the next-gen model will come with non-adjustable suspension, although the units will likely be new.  When the Gen 3 250 Duke was launched, the bike received a nominal price bump of under Rs 1,000, and it remains to be seen whether Bajaj would follow that competitive strategy for the ADV. Currently, the KTM 250 Adventure is priced at Rs 2.49 lakh (ex-showroom, India). With the new 390s slated to be shown at EICMA early next month, we expect the 250 Adventure to follow suit shortly as well.  Also See: Husqvarna Vitpilen 250 review: Style and substance Image Source",

The engine appears stock from the outside, including the OEM radiator guard – the only visible change being a full-system Akrapovic exhaust. However, it is quite likely that there are significant internal engine upgrades and this rally bike is likely to be producing well over 50hp. Visually, the Himalayan rally bike looks like a stripped-down version of the stock motorcycle with RE’s rally kit. The cage around the fuel tank has been removed and there’s a rally tower at the front to hold things like the road book and other rally essentials. The look of this motorcycle is another hint at the fact that this project is only in its infancy and we expect to see a more complete version at its next appearance in the coming months.

    "description": "BYD India has launched the new eMax 7 MPV, priced from Rs 26.9 lakh for the entry-level Premium trim to Rs 29.9 lakh for the top-spec Superior trim. The eMax 7 is a 3-row electric MPV that is aimed squarely at the Toyota Innova Hycross Hybrid (Rs 25.97 lakh-30.98 lakh) in the Indian market. Deliveries are expected to begin in the coming weeks. BYD eMax 7 is the facelift for the e6 MPV Top-spec Superior trim gets ADAS suite, panoramic glass roof Premium trim gets 55.4kWh battery (420km range) Superior trim gets 71.8kWh battery (530km range) BYD eMax 7: what exactly is it? BYD eMax 7 prices (ex-showroom, India; in Rs, lakh)PremiumSuperior6-seat26.929.37-seat27.529.9 Essentially a heavily updated iteration of the e6 electric MPV that has been around since 2021, the eMax 7 gets a subtle facelift on the outside, powertrain updates, and a long list of features. It effectively replaces the e6 in BYD India’s line-up and has gone on sale in two trims, each with 6- and 7-seat layouts. Bookings opened on September 20 for a token amount of Rs 51,000. On the outside, the eMax 7 sports mildly altered headlamps and tail-lamps, while the bumpers get a completely new design, with added chrome elements at both ends. There are also new design 17-inch alloys, shod in 225/55 R17 tyres. It's available in four colour options: Quartz Blue, Harbour Grey, Crystal White, and Cosmos Black. Inside, the biggest update is the larger 12.8-inch floating touchscreen, up from 10.1-inch on the e6. The eMax 7 has soft-touch materials all around, including on the dashboard panels. The centre console has been slightly revised and features two wireless charging pads, some new switchgear, and a new drive selector lever. It also gets a new steering wheel but retains analogue dials with a 5-inch LCD MID for the instrument cluster. Of the two variants, the top-spec eMax 7 Superior comes with Level 2 ADAS tech, a fixed panoramic glass roof, powered and ventilated front seats, frameless front wipers, and roof rails, among other bits. Six airbags, front and rear disc brakes, and a 360-degree camera are standard on both trims. BYD eMax 7: battery, range Each variant of the eMax 7 comes with a battery pack option: the Premium gets a 55.4kWh unit with an NEDC range of 420km, while the Superior has a 71.8kWh unit with 530km of range. While the Premium trim gets 163hp and a claimed 0-100kph time of 10.1 seconds, the Superior has 204hp and a claimed 0-100kph time of 8.6 seconds; however, both get 310Nm. That’s quite a significant step up from the 95hp and 180Nm outputs of the outgoing e6 MPV. BYD claims a top speed of 180kph for both variants of the eMax 7. While both trims get a 7kW AC charger as standard, the Premium's battery is capable of 89kW DC fast charging, while the Superior's pack is rated at 115kW. Like the rest of BYD's range, the eMax 7 is capable of vehicle-to-load charging.  BYD provides an 8-year/1.6 lakh km standard battery warranty, while the motors get an 8-year/1/5 lakh km warranty.

    "description": "Ola Electric has been facing the heat for the past few months. After drastic drops in sales figures, spiralling service issues and falling share prices, the latest challenge comes in the form of a show cause notice from the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA). This notice has been issued over nearly ten thousand customer complaints registered with the CCPA over multiple categories, including delays in providing service, delays in deliveries of new vehicles and promised services not being provided.  It is worth noting that the actual number of customer issues is likely to be vastly higher, with media reports stating that the company has received as many as 80,000 customer complaints in a month. With mounting product quality issues as well as social media buzzing with images of dusty scooters filling the parking spaces at Ola service centres, the company has witnessed a heavy drop in sales numbers.  Also See: Bajaj Chetak outsells the TVS iQube for the first time With less than 24,000 scooters sold in September, Ola’s market share has plummeted to 27 percent from a peak of nearly 50 percent a few months back. The company responded with a huge discount on its S1 scooters, with a starting price of just Rs 50,000. The effect of this discounting will be seen at the end of the month, but as of October 8, the company has sold 5,453 scooters, according to the VAHAN dashboard. The company’s shares have also seen a sizeable fall in the past few days, with a 9 percent drop in their price after its founder engaged in a public spat with a comedian on social media. The show cause notice from CCPA is likely to have an impact as well. In its acknowledgement letter to the BSE and NSE, the company states that it will respond to the notice within the stipulated 15-day timeline with supporting documents. Ola Electric also states, “the show cause notice currently has no impact on the financial, operational or other activities of the company.” Also See: Opinion: Ola Electric and the uncomfortable facts",

    "description": "Ducati has introduced two new Scrambler models for 2025 called the Full Throttle and Icon Dark. While the Scrambler Full Throttle has been on sale for a bit, Ducati has revamped it with new colours that are inspired by the ones used in racing back in the 1970s. The Icon Dark, on the other hand, goes monotone and features a blacked-out aesthetic. Available on sale in 2025 Remain mechanically identical to outgoing models Ducati Scrambler Full Throttle, Icon Dark details As before, the Scrambler Full Throttle is designed to blend flat-tracker aesthetics with street motorcycles. What’s new is the black and bronze colour scheme and livery along with numbered plates on its sides. Ducati Scrambler Full Throttle These plates come bearing the number ‘62’ as a homage to the first Scrambler model that debuted in 1962. While the motorcycle remains mechanically identical as before, Ducati has equipped the 2025 Full Throttle with a Termignoni exhaust and a bi-directional quickshifter to add some flair to the package. Ducati Scrambler Icon Dark The Scrambler Icon Dark get matte black finish on the fuel tank, tank covers, mudguard and headlight covers. Both motorcycles largely get the same features, but a bi-directional quickshifter is an optional extra on this model. Ducati Scrambler Icon Dark Both motorcycles are powered by the same 803cc L-Twin that produces a peak output of 73hp at 8,250rpm and 65.2Nm at 7,000rpm. Both motorcycles weigh in at 176kg and have a standard seat height of 795mm. Ducati offers an optional taller or lower seat accessory, which changes the seat height to 810mm or 780mm, respectively. While Ducati has showcased both these models, the company intends to have them on sale sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for further updates on the Scrambler line-up.

    "description": "The Mahindra Thar 3-door has seen a slight sales slowdown thanks to the introduction of the larger Thar Roxx, which is essentially a 5-door version of the SUV.  A good amount of customers who were awaiting deliveries of the Thar 3-door have been switching to the Thar Roxx, which has resulted a decrease in demand for the smaller model. In order to push sales during this festive season, Mahindra dealers are offering tempting discounts on the retro-styled off-roader. Along with dealer level discounts, all variants get a free Mahindra accessory kit worth Rs 25,000. Thar 3-door lower variants of get up to Rs 1.25 lakh off Other variants get discounts up to Rs 1.3 lakh Thar Earth edition gets Rs 1.6 lakh in benefits Mahindra Thar discounts during Dusshera, Diwali 2024 The Thar variant with the lowest amount of discounts is the AX diesel-manual 2WD with the Hardtop. Next up are the the Thar LX petrol-automatic 2WD with Hardtop and the LX diesel-manual 2WD with Hardtop, which get discounts in the range of Rs 1.25 lakh. Other variants in the Thar AX and LX line-up, including manual and automatic gearbox options, are available at discounts to the tune of Rs 1.3 lakh.   Mahindra Thar Earth edition gets Rs 1.6 lakh discount The Thar Earth Edition comes with 4WD as standard and is available with petrol and diesel engine options, each with their respective manual or automatic transmissions. The Thar Earth Edition is finished in a special matte shade that the company calls ‘Desert Fury’, and also gets special ‘Earth Edition’ badges on the B-pillars and rear fenders. It gets a similar colour scheme on the inside, with the leatherette upholstery finished in dual-tone shades of beige and black.

    "description": "The motorcycle, scooter and moped market witnessed a sizeable 8.51 percent sales decline, to 1.20 million units YoY (September 2023: 1.31 million units) and a 10 percent decline month on month (August 2024: 1.33 million units). According to the FADA president, two-wheeler sales were impacted by low consumer sentiment, poor inquiries and reduced walk-ins. Seasonal factors like the Shraddh period, Pitrapaksha, and heavy rains further impacted demand, resulting in delayed purchases and a subdued market environment. These numbers are from the VAHAN database, which reports actual vehicle registrations while the numbers we reported yesterday are dispatches from the factory.  The big news is Honda Motorcycle \u0026 Scooter India outselling market leader Hero MotoCorp. While Honda sold 3,34,034 units, Hero MotoCorp registered sales of 2,71,465 units. This puts HMSI in the market leadership position for September 2024, with a 27.73 percent share (up from 26.57 percent a year ago) compared to Hero MotoCorp, whose share for the month has dropped to 22.24 percent versus 26.76 percent in September 2023. Nevertheless, with aggressive marketing in the festive season, Hero MotoCorp is expected to achieve strong numbers in October and beyond.

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mini-convertible-brings-201bhp-31k",
    "description": "Performance of the new Convertible slightly trails the equivalent Cooper hatchback UK-built soft-top arrives with a pair of petrol engines – but no electric option Production of the Mini Convertible has returned to the UK with the introduction of the new fourth-generation car. The soft-top will soon begin rolling off the line at the historic Oxford factory, marking its homecoming after a nine-year run at the VDL Nedcar plant in the Netherlands. This means it will be offered exclusively with petrol engines, as Oxford paused production of electric cars with the introduction of the fourth-generation Mini hatchback last year. It will be offered in two guises: the Cooper Convertible C, with a 161bhp 1.5-litre turbo triple, and the Cooper Convertible S, packing a 201bhp 2.0-litre turbo four. Both engines are mated to a dual-clutch automatic gearbox as standard, after Mini dropped manual 'boxes last year. The Cooper Convertible S takes 6.9sec to complete the 0-62mph sprin – 0.3sec slower than the Cooper S hatchback. Similarly, the Cooper Convertible C takes 0.5sec longer than the Cooper C hatchback, hitting 62mph in 8.2sec.  The lag in performance is a result of the additional 40kg added by the fabric roof and its electrical folding mechanism. The roof takes 18sec to fully open and 15sec to close at vehicle speeds of up to 19mph. There's also the option to partially drop the top (by 40cm) to mimic a sunroof. With the roof up, boot space is actually up by five litres compared with the Cooper hatchback, at 215 litres. It shrinks to just 160 litres with the roof down, however. A wind deflector and hidden rollover-protection system are fitted as standard. Inside, the new Convertible mirrors its hatchback sibling with a centrally mounted, circular 9.5in infotainment touchscreen hosting the controls for most of the car’s functions. Three trim levels are offered. Classic gets 16in wheels, part-faux-leather seats and a black cloth dashboard. Exclusive bumps the alloys up to 17in, extends the faux leather to the full seat and wraps the dashboard in beige cloth. Sport apes the look of the John Cooper Works hot hatch with 18in wheels, an aggressive bodykit and seats trimmed in faux leather and corduroy. It also adds gearshift paddles to the steering wheel. On-the-road prices start at £27,240 for the Cooper Convertible C and £31,640 for the Cooper Convertible S. Deliveries will begin early next year.",

    "title": "Honda 0 Series: prototype drive and new technical details",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/honda-0-series-prototype-drive-and-new-technical-details",
    "description": "0 Series concept is said to be 90% ready for production in 2026 First model on bold new EV platform is set for 2026 launch - and Autocar has had a first taste of a prototype The production version of the Honda 0 Series Saloon will offer around 482bhp and a range of more than 300 miles when it arrives in 2026 – and Autocar has had a first taste of its all-new electric powertrain. The 0 Series Saloon concept, shown at CES in January and described as being close to production ready, previewed the first of seven planned 0 Series models that will use a new bespoke EV platform developed from a clean sheet of paper. Honda will reveral a model that will be “the embodiment” of the technologies at CES next year. The Japanese manufacturer has now revealed early technical details at a special preview event, which included the chance to drive an Accord test mule fitted with a development version of the new powertrain and sample some of the new technology and features that are being developed. Honda 0 Series: powertrain, chassis and technology The 0 Series Saloon will be offered with both single- and dual-motor powertrains, featuring newly developed compact e-axles that Honda claims can be mounted lower in the car, freeing up space and allowing for a smaller frontal area to improve aerodynamic efficiency. The reduced size of the e-axle motors has been achieved in part by repositioning the inverter to make the units shorter. At least initially, 0 Series models will feature two different e-axle units in three different combinations. Entry-level models will feature a 241bhp motor on the rear axle and offer rear-wheel drive. There will also be two dual-motor, four-wheel-drive versions. The top-end models will feature the same motor on the front axle, giving a system output of 482bhp (although Honda has yet to confirm if this will be the maximum output). There will also be a 4WD version that mates the 241bhp rear motor with a smaller 67bhp unit on the front axle. That smaller e-axle will be shared with Honda’s next-generation hybrid models. The battery pack will fit under the floor as in other EVs, although Honda said the focus is on making it as thin as possible, claiming it's around 8mm thinner than EV batteries from rival firms. As a result, Honda says the platform allows for the 0 Series Saloon to be less than 1400mm in height while offering more interior space than current EVs. Key to the thinner battery design will be the use of a new mega-casting tool to produce the battery pack case in three parts, rather than around 60 separate pieces previously. Casting it in three sections rather than a single unit will allow two different sizes of battery pack (for medium- and large-size models) to be produced on the same production line. While mega-casting will initially be used only for the battery casing, Honda is aiming to eventually use it to produce the front and rear assemblies of the car as single pieces. That will likely be introduced when a planned new EV-only assembly plant in Canada is opened near the end of the decade. While Honda has yet to give full details, the 0 Series Saloon and other medium-size models will feature a battery using nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry with a capacity of between 80kWh and 90kWh, giving an estimated range of more than 300 miles. Meanwhile, large models will feature a pack offering around 100kWh. It's unclear if different battery options will be offered on each model. As well as extensive use of mega-casting, Honda will use a number of new production techniques designed to increase the new platform’s rigidity while reducing weight. That includes expanded use of a system called '3D friction stir welding', which can join metals without melting them, along with 'constant DC chopping' (CDC) spot welding, which controls the heat used to weld joints better. The use of both manufacturing techniques is claimed to result in greater rigidity and decreased deformation. In addition, Honda said it has developed the body structure of the 0 Series platform to disperse the impact of a collision to the side of the structure, which reduces the space at the front and rear required for protection for the battery. Overall, Honda claims the 0 Series Saloon will weigh around 100kg less than a current EV of its size, which is also key to a promise to offer an enjoyable driving experience. It will feature a steer-by-wire throttle, suggesting that the yoke offered on the concept car could reach production. The control for the system will be integrated with those for the suspension, brakes and regen system to aid handling. The 0 Series Saloon will feature active aerodynamics that can channel air underneath through sculpted bodywork, adding up to six miles of range, as well as creating downforce. 3D gyro sensors, developed for Honda’s humanoid robots, will be used to automatically stabilise the car. Notably, the lightweight aluminium frame has actually been designed to flex when cornering at speeds, pushing load onto the outside of the wheels to improve cornering balance. All 0 Series models will be software-defined vehicles, able to accept over-the-air software updates to gain new features or upgrades. They will be designed to offer up to level-three (‘eyes-off’) autonomy in certain situations, thanks to a range of camera, radar and lidar sensors.  Honda has indicated that the 0 Series Saloon will be joined in 2026 by mid-size and entry-level SUVs, then a large SUV the following year. A compact SUV, a small SUV and a smaller saloon are then due by 2030. Production of the 0 Series models will initially begin at Honda’s plant in Ohio, the US, which will be adapted so that ICE and EV cars can be made on the same line. That will be achieved by the use of a new flex cell production system, which makes greater use of decentralised production stations with chassis and parts moved via autonomous robots. This means Honda will be able to constantly adapt ICE and EV output based on demand. A new plant dedicated to EV production, along with a battery plant, will be built in Ontario, Canada by 2028. First drive: sampling the 0 Series powertrain and technology The first chance to sample the new technology Honda has developed for its 0 Series models not in the bold body of the Saloon concept but in a 2024 Accord saloon, which alongside a converted CR-V is one of two prototype mules the firm has shown in public. Because this was a test hack, we couldn’t experience many of Honda’s claims about the new platform and chassis technology, such as experiencing the flexing chassis, the packaging benefits or the weight reduction push. But it was a chance to sample the new powertrain some two years before the production version of the 0 Series Saloon is due to go on sale. Our brief run came with a few laps of a short course laid out on the test track at Honda’s R\u0026D base in Tochigi, Japan, with the route featuring a reasonably long straight, a tight chicane and a short, winding hill section.  While it wasn’t long enough to gain true driving impressions, what the outing did suggest is how well refined the new powertrain is at this stage in the development cycle. The engineer accompanying us indicated that this was the most powerful dual-motor system, and it certainly felt well-sorted, with predictably good levels of response, as you’d expect from an electric car. It was quick and quiet to accelerate on the straight, and there was always torque instantly available coming out of corners. Notably, we could feel the regen kick in when we lifted off, and if we further applied the brakes, the two systems felt well-integrated, which isn’t always the case with EVs. Certainly, even at this stage, it felt nimbler, lighter and more responsive than, say, the disappointing Honda e:Ny1. But given that much of the promise about the 0 Series centres on in-car technology and space, any real judgement will have to wait. Separately at the event, we did get to sample some of the digital technology that Honda is working on for the 0 Series. Most notably, this included a Honda E that had been converted to run a new software system that allowed it to emulate classic Honda models from the past.  The touchscreen allowed us to select from a number of classic Honda performance cars, including a Civic Type R and an NSX Type R. The dashboard then switched to a digital recreation of the dials in the car selected, with a surprisingly authentic throttle noise added in matching each of the machines.  Unlike the system in the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, there was no synthetic gearing, and this was purely for entertainment: you could even select the sounds and dash from the Honda Jet. Notably, the options includes a number of ‘locked’ models, including a Honda Formula 1 car, suggesting that new models could be offered as updates for download. Another technology we had the chance to sample was a new facial recognition system that could recognise owners as they approach the car and react differently in certain situations. For example. if you approach alone, it will open the front door for you, but approach with a child in a pushchair and it will open the rear seat, then the boot and finally the driver's door as it detects you approach each. Honda is also developing a virtual ride-along system that will allow people to use an augmented-reality headset to see the view out of a 360deg camera mounted inside the car.",

    "description": "VAN.EA platform is built around the advantages of electric powertrains Next V-Class enters testing on public roads and is set to offer full autonomy by 2030 Mercedes-Benz is preparing to radically reinvent the V-Class as it makes the switch to electric power. New images released by the firm show two prototypes that, although heavily camouflaged, reveal key details of the new model. Its roofline is much more rakish than that of the current van, for example, hinting that aerodynamics have taken greater priority in the switch to electric power. Mercedes previously confirmed that the V-Class and Vito delivery van will be moving onto a bespoke architecture for electric load-carriers, named VAN.EA. This has been designed for greater flexibility than the outgoing models’ platform, which should allow “clear differentiation” between delivery van, MPV and luxurious shuttle variants, Mercedes said. VAN.EA is fitted with 800V electricals and a 22kW AC charger. Front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive powertrains will be offered, and the longest-legged variants will top 311 miles of range between charges.  Level-two autonomy (requiring driver supervision at all times) will be included at launch, with level three (allowing the van to drive itself under specific circumstances, such as low-speed traffic jams) promised for the V-Class by the end of the decade. Mercedes said it is also planning to introduce level-four autonomy (allowing the van to drive itself without driver input) for the Vito by 2030. The new V-Class comes as the luxury van segment undergoes rapid growth in China and other East Asian markets. Geely-owned Zeekr launched its 009 van last year and followed it with the Mix, a Volkswagen ID Buzz rival. Volvo sells a restyled 009 as the EM90 and Lexus offers the hybrid LM. “Substantial growth potential is being seen in the US for premium commercial large vans and in China for luxury private vans,” Mercedes said in a statement last year.",

    "description": "New Mustique Blue paint's hue is inspired by the eponymous island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Update comes as the average Ghost buyer spends 10% of the car’s price on customisation Rolls-Royce has updated its Ghost limousine, introducing new materials and technologies in response to increasing demand for personalisation. The average Ghost buyer spends an additional 10% of the car’s retail price – roughly £30,000 – on customisation, Rolls-Royce said. To that end, it has introduced several new material options, including Grey Stained Ash and Duality Twill. Grey Stained Ash is a hand-stained ash wood that's finished with microscopic metallic particles, which are said to create a shimmering effect. Duality Twill, meanwhile, is a textile woven from bamboo into a graphic inspired by the ropes on sailing yachts. Rolls-Royce said a full Duality Twill interior comprises 2.2 million stitches and 11 miles of thread and takes 20 hours to complete. Inside, a revised glass panel spans the width of the dashboard, and the software for the digital instrument panel can now be colour-matched to the car. In-car connectivity is said to have been drastically improved, with rear passengers now able to connect up to two streaming devices to their corresponding screens. The rear infotainment system can also be paired with wireless headphones and there are USB-C ports hidden in the centre console. The amplifier for the Ghost’s sound system has been upgraded from 1300W to 1400W too.  The new car also gains blockier styling, in line with the new Series II Cullinan. The lower grille area of the front bumper is smaller, for instance, and the daytime-running lights now wrap around the outer corners of the main projector lenses. Meanwhile, the rear lights receive a new banded design said to be inspired by the Spectre. Under the skin, the latest Ghost uses the same planar suspension system and twin-turbocharged 6.75-litre V12 as the outgoing version. The engine is available with two power outputs, 563bhp and 592bhp, with the latter reserved for the more driver-focused Black Badge car. That model also gets a raised brake bite point, decreased pedal travel and a ‘Low’ drive mode with 50%-quicker gearchanges when the throttle is 90% open. Prices are expected to fall broadly into line with the existing outgoing Ghost, which is priced from £278,000. However, the transaction price of most cars will be significantly higher. Former Rolls-Royce chief Torsten Müller-Ötvös noted in the company’s 2022 results that the average commission for its Bespoke division took a car's cost €500,000 (then £430,000) and that some examples of the more opulent Phantom limousine cost more than €2 million (£1.8m).",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/long-term-reviews/land-rover-defender-130-2024-long-term-test",
    "description": "Did this extra-long, extra-plush 130 convince our classic 90 owner? Why we ran it: To see if an extra-long, diesel 4x4 can still justify its place in daily motoring life in 2024 Month 1 - Month 2 - Month 3 - Final report - Specs Life with a Land Rover Defender 130: Final Report Did this extra-long, extra-plush 130 convince our classic 90 owner?  The Defender 130 has departed Autocar Towers and returned to JLR. It was the second new-generation Defender we’d run, following a 90, but the first one I’d looked after since a classic Defender in 2016, around the time that production of that line ended. At the time, Defender owners waved to one another as they passed each other (owning an old 90, I can confirm that many still do), and I’d wondered if the same would be true of this replacement model. I don’t think it’s a huge surprise to learn that they don’t. The new Defender is a different kind of car, selling in much higher numbers than the original did at a time when one farmer seeing another prompted them to give another a cheery wave and begin a trend that lasted decades. This car isn’t like that – and I mean that as absolutely no criticism whatsoever. The new Defender is a terrific car. And I can’t actually recall anyone seriously complaining that you can’t hose out its interior. If you did want to hose the inside of a new Defender, this Outbound trim level is the one you would pick, because it comes with deep-sided rubber mats, making it eminently suitable for dirtying and washing, even though our one was made more upmarket than standard. At 5358mm long (including the spare wheel), the Defender 130 is a big car by any standard – longer than the standard-wheelbase Range Rover and the Land Rover Discovery 5, whose toes I think it treads on, feeling as it does like a car made for adventures and as an accommodating family wagon. Our Outbound had five seats, but a Defender can seat more with the optional third row. And while it can go places that most drivers could scarcely imagine, it’s also exceptionally smooth and refined when covering long distances. The next Discovery will get a different slant to differentiate it better, I hear. Long-distance cruising, more than plunging into the wilderness, is how I’m almost embarrassed to say I used this car. Almost but not quite, because I did take it green-laning when the opportunity arose and I carried enough horse feed around during the past few months to create a sizeable haystack. Snowy the pony would be thinner if it wasn’t for this Defender. The D300 is a 3.0-litre straight-six mild-hybrid diesel making 296bhp, driving through an eight-speed automatic gearbox. There are no shift paddles, but you can take control via the stick. I rarely did. I never needed the low range, occasionally put the suspension into a high mode and rarely touched the Terrain Response system. That’s a bit like getting a supercar and just doing a little messing around on a track day, but it’s better than not using what it can do at all, as is the fate of a lot of 4x4s. I can take some comfort from the fact that although this is a large car, it needn’t be that consumptive if driven well. Its aerodynamics are the biggest obstruction to good economy, and the faster one goes, the more drag it creates. So if you routinely cruise at fast motorway speeds, it can burn fuel at closer to 30mpg than the nearer 40mpg that I got by deciding to chill out and maintain a speed in the 60s rather than the 70s. It’s more efficient at a relaxed cruise than in town too. Trying really hard on one journey, I managed to push it past 50mpg – although I will confess that upon entering my nearest town, I stopped to snap a pic of the trip computer before it dipped back into the 40s. The 130 didn’t need any AdBlue during its time here, so I can’t tell you what consumption of that is like, and nor did it need a service, so I can’t comment on the dealer experience. But it did receive a security update that necessitated a very nice man coming round to plug a laptop into it, which I’m told disables the ‘can bus’ if the car is deadlocked. If you have a similar car, you can expect a call from JLR Assist to arrange it. And bar one low tyre pressure warning (an accurate one) and an occasional refusal to pair my iPhone with the infotainment to activate Apple CarPlay, which nearly all cars do from time to time, nothing else troubled me. I sometimes wonder what I’d buy to drive day in, day out, if I had a proper job. The Defender makes it on to the shortest of shortlists. Second Opinion The 130 moved my partner and me into our first house so effortlessly and capably that what should have been an obscenely stressful day was one of the most enjoyable. It’s effectively a warehouse that you can take across the Cairngorms and then leave outside the Co-op. I was pretty happy with 27mpg too, before Matt beat it by almost 100%. I miss it every day. Felix Page Back to the top Love it: Set up for success Driving position is commanding and forward visibility is excellent, helping to make the Defender an exceptionally relaxing drive. Easy to banish ADAS Its ADAS are among the more unobtrusive, but a push of a single steering wheel button to enable or disable them is great. Space to spare The 130’s rear accommodation is really generous. Unsurprising, of course, but the seats are big and give you a good view out. Still looking good The Defender is ageing nicely. It takes enough cues from the old one that you know what it is without veering into retro.  Loathe it: Urban sprawl At 5358mm long, it’s not easy to park and overhangs some bays. At least there’s a great all-round camera and huge wing mirrors. Final mileage: 11,591 Back to the top Life with a Land Rover Defender 130: Month 3 Even when the Defender is working hard, it makes sure you don’t have to - 28 August My local area isn't served well for byways. But there is one nearby, next to a busy hobbyists' airfield and just off a route I drive often, which means it's a quick and easy diversion to get a cup of tea while being buzzed by parachutists, and then to head for a chilled spot of green-laning The byway isn't all that long and it's not overly challenging, at least in the warmer months when it's open. (It's closed from November to March as it would be easily damaged when wet. Even earlier this summer I avoided it for that reason.) So it's not going to trouble a Land Rover Defender but it is a good opportunity to test some of the car's systems. The 'off-road' screen on the central display is particularly good, I think - showing how compressed or extended each suspension corner is, the angle of the front wheels, and whether the centre or rear differentials have needed to lock. 'Not often' will be the state in most Defender use cases. Very much useful in any kinds of terrain, though, are the all-round cameras, which can show close-ups of individual corners and even a virtual look underneath the car. This is not a live camera angle but one based on what the cameras saw on approach to its current position. When it comes to placing the Defender precisely where you want it, even on modest green lanes that will give you no more than a wet boot if you step out of the vehicle, the camera view is great for steering around, rather than into, objects like rocks or tree stumps. I know from previous experience that in very serious off-road situations it's invaluable for placing the tyres where you need to. Did I need to raise the ride height? No, but it probably kept the underside of the car cleaner. Did I need to engage low ratio? No, so I didn't bother. If this sounds like I've taken a Ferrari to a track day and then pootled around it at no more than 4000pm before sitting with a coffee and looking at it beaming with pride, then, well, probably guilty as charged. But I take what limited opportunities I get. And it comes out the other end with some grime on the flanks, so it at least looks like I've tried. Love it Bump proof All-round cameras are also great for reversing into car park bays – this is a wide, long car Loathe it Black ops Very personal, but black wheels are sufficiently not my thing that I’ll get them and keep them dirty. Mileage: £11,100 Back to the top Gary and his laptop go places that an over-the-air update simply can’t - 14 August A nice man arrives one morning after a few phone calls and an \"I'm half an hour away\" text to carry out what has variously been described as an 'update' and a 'recall' to the Land Rover Defender 130. Most of its updates happen over the air, but not this one, which requires plugging in a diagnostic laptop to a 16-pin socket in the driver's footwell, because it's a security update. It disables the 'can bus' when the car is locked, to make it harder to steal. Gary says theft isn't a Land Rover-specific problem but is an issue for all premium car makers, so updates/recalls/whatever like this are just part of the game of cat and mouse with increasingly sophisticated criminals. I wondered if a lot of pinched cars end up in Russia, given sanctions mean they can't officially be sold there (though some unscrupulous neighbouring countries are experiencing a curiously unexpected sales volume boost), but I'm told the UAE is a more typical end point. The job of reinforcing this Defender starts at 0825hr and is all done by 0835hr, after a couple of checks that the windows still work; the update occasionally upsets a few supplementary systems, necessitating a second reboot, but all is well here. While the work's being done, I'm also advised not to use a Land Rover Remote app - which I had to download as part of the insurance requirements - to lock the car if I've inadvertently left the keys inside it (if, say, I remember while standing in line at a filling station). The app won't then unlock it, and my keys will be inside, which is suboptimal. Duly noted. Anyway, 10 minutes after Gary arrives, he's on his way again and the Defender feels no different to me but is more secure. Happy days. I thought I might have to wait longer so I've been clearing and tidying the car up while the update has been happening. A colleague might need to use it without much notice, and handing over a filthy car to somebody important is seldom advisable. And yet the Outbound spec is a rufty-tufty lifestyley variant so I've been trying to use it like one as much as possible and have a boot sullied by hay and horse feed. So I pull the brushable, hoseable, rubber mat onto the floor and set about it. It has a small flap too, which can have a dual purpose of protecting the bumper if you're loading a potentially scratchy object into the boot or, more likely, protecting you from grime on the bumper if you're sitting on the boot lip to change your wellies. The front and rear footwells have similarly utilitarian mats. Incidentally, inside the boot lip is a button that can lower or raise the cars ride height while stationary to boot floor, which is good if the boot is full, and there's also a storage cubby in the door that would be handy for hi-vis vests, or cleaning kit, gloves, dog leads, whatever. JLR may well think of itself as a luxury design house these days, but credit to the designers and engineers who still think of utility things like this in a car like this. It's an expensive wagon, certainly, but still an exceptionally useful one. I've yet to tow anything with this Defender - there's an electrically deploying towbar and you have no idea at all that it's there when it's stowed - but having pulled stuff with them before, I know they are terrific at it. I'll have to think of a reason to try it. Meantime, I get back into the tidied, and now apparently more secure, driver's seat of one of the most practical and easygoing cars on the market, and have it melt into my life as easily as it ever does. Love it Utility belter So many cubbies and pockets that none of my car cleaning gear rattles around the cabin. Loathe it Knee-jerk questions People asking me if it has broken (no) or been nicked (obviously not). Mileage: 10,700 Back to the top Life with a Land Rover Defender 130: Month 2 Economy is more impressive than you might think - 31 July I did it. Not for long, and it took motorway cruising at a leisurely pace and treating the throttle like there was a hamster loose in the footwell, but still, I did it: averaging 52mpg for more than 50 miles, between Bracknell and Bicester. You can’t keep it up once junctions arrive but, still, I’m impressed. Mileage: 10,017 Back to the top Accurate tyre readouts are handy - 17 July The tyre pressure monitor threw up a warning and has incredibly accurate readouts for the current pressure, plus recommended settings. All tyres were slightly under recommended, presumably deliberately set that way, with the rear right flagging lower still. I pumped them all to their recommended setting and they have all stayed that way since. Mileage: 10,479 Back to the top Our go-anywhere, do-anything 4x4 is finally taken out of its comfort zone. Or is it? - 10 July Matt Prior texts me a couple of hours after I tried to call him. \"I missed you. You’ll want something,” he says. Offended by his unwarranted(ish) cynicism, I reply that I only wanted to offer him a week or two in my Abarth 500e, because I know how much of a fan of small cars he is. “When do you need the Defender?” comes the blunt reply. Ah, now there’s a thought. I had completely forgotten you were running the van-backed 130, Matt, but now you mention it, I do have two sofas, some desks and a chest of drawers that need collecting. Oh, and I’ve got a couple of long weekends on the road coming up where a punchy yet frugal diesel straight six would be most useful… Funny how things work out. And so it is, with a luminescent electric city car and a slightly miffed editor-at-large shrinking in the 130’s colossal mirrors a couple of days later, that I come to reacquaint myself with one of the largest cars currently available in the UK. I first drove a mega-Defender last year, on a mix of wide, sweeping B-roads and tough but spacious off-road trails – both environments where the 130 can relax into some personal space and it’s quite easy to forget about the extra 340mm of metal that it carries over the already colossal 110. I don’t live halfway up Ben Nevis, though, so now I’ll be able to try taking the 130 well and truly out of its comfort zone with a few long motorway schleps, a fortnight of Ikea runs, tip trips and commuting through the tight, twisting, traffic-choked veins of suburban London. In fact, I’m not sure I haven’t found this car’s limit. I was expecting to achieve 16mpg and get stuck at every T-junction. Instead, it consumes about as much as I would expect of a Volkswagen Golf GTI over 400 miles and proves itself as manoeuvrable as your average estate car (with a bit of practice and a lot of help from the parking aids). It’s whisper-quiet at motorway speeds and hassle-free in city traffic; it sneaks under every height restrictor and comfortably accommodates untold quantities of flat-pack flotsam; it reverses down my tight cul-de-sac and slots into the tiny space outside my house (while blocking all natural light to my living room); and it saves me hundreds of pounds in moving costs by doubling up as a mid-sized van. Our 130’s particularly sinister specification does nothing to ease the glares and tuts that such large and darkened vehicles attract in urban areas. And yet, even when I fire up the grumbly diesel, even when I remind its detractors that the alternative is a screaming supercharged petrol V8. But if you can stomach the quite obvious dissent from some quarters and you’re especially careful not to inadvertently run over any Smart cars (or supermarkets) on the commute, it really is a surprisingly docile and malleable beast. Rear-wheel steering would make it easier to parallel park and negotiate helter-skelter multi-storey ramps, and I wouldn’t mind some meatier rubber to protect the 20in alloys from kerb rash, but ultimately I can’t help but wonder at this 4x4 behemoth’s almost inconceivable duality. Something so brash and brawny has no right to be so easy to live with in town, but then maybe that’s why every third car inside the M25 seems to be a Defender: they just work. It’s not the politically correct choice of runaround for anyone, except perhaps if you’re one of those hardy volunteers who look after small islands in the Outer Hebrides, but there’s no denying its fitness for multiple purposes. Felix Page Love it  Torque of the town I'm down to driving just a handful of big diesels a year, and the creamy brute force of the D300 reminds me what a shame that is. Loathe it Back in full swing The tailgate being side-hinged means you need to leave a big gap behind you when reverse parking, but the 130 already takes up every inch of a space. Mileage: 10,030 Back to the top Life with a Land Rover Defender 130: Month 1 Our XXL Defender is surprisingly economical - 16 June Having said in the car’s introduction that 40mpg was in the offing and smarting from an acquaintance saying that he wouldn’t get in a car as consumptive as the Defender, I thought I’d see what it could do. This 44.8mpg was let down by some roadworks, so now I’m wondering if I can get 50mpg out of it. Probably not. Mileage: 9992 Back to the top Welcoming the Defender 130 to the fleet - 5 June 2024 No sooner had I written that the Ford Ranger Raptor had left Autocar's long-term fleet (to join Steve Cropley's personal fleet, and fair play to him), a similarly large vehicle has arrived to replace it. It's a Land Rover Defender 130, the longest variant yet of JLR's most rugged 4x4, the car that represented the final peg of a \"three-legged stool\" when it was launched in 2020, alongside the Discovery and Range Rover. (And given there are multiples of Discovery and Range Rover, I still wonder if there's room for more than one Defender type.) The 130 lives on the same 3022mm wheelbase as the Defender 110 but has had 340mm added behind the back axle, with a slight lower-body lift back there at the same time to reduce compromise to the car's departure angle. The Defender was a pretty big car already, and now it's a really big one, at 5099mm long without a spare wheel and 5358mm long with it, as here. Like a 110 it can be optioned with a third row of seats, although in that form it can't also be specified with the jump seat in the front, because nine seats are too many for a passenger car. The last time a Defender joined Autocar's long-term fleet, a very pleasant 90, I had the pleasure of working through the configurator and picking the choice options: steel wheels, blue paint, white root, chunky tyres. It's one of life's simple pleasures (I can recommend the Indian motorcycle configurator as my current deadline dodging obsession). But then somebody else ended up running that Defender. This time around, it's different: I'm looking after the car, but it arrived pre-specced. The 130 has come to us in Outbound trim, with a 3.0-litre six-cylinder twin-turbo mild-hybrid diesel making 296bhp.  (This D300 was registered a few months ago; now this trim comes with a minimum D350 diesel.) As you might expect, given the name, the Outbound is one of the more lifestyley variants of the Defender. If you want to get deeply involved in the model range, it has the basic specification of an X-Dynamic SE but with added gloss black wheels, mats and extended rubber flooring inside, a body-coloured exterior panel and a powder-coated cross-car beam. Crucially, the Outbound is avallable only with five seats, rather than eight, to prioritise load bay capacity over passenger carrying. A 130 with all eight seats raised has 400 litres of room behind the third row. The volume on this five-seater is at least 1329 litres, rising to 2516 litres with the back seats folded. I haven't raised a six-a-side football team, so five seats suits me fine, as does the Outbound's easily cleanable rubber flooring, for when I fill the back with hay and the front with mud. Which, with due apologies to colleagues who will borrow the car from me, I will. There are some options, of course, on top of a £80,390 base price when it was registered. The Defender in standard specification comes very well covered, but this car has a few packs and standalone options as well, most notably upgraded leather seats (£920), an upgrade for the interior (£2275), a towing pack (£1415), an electronic active rear differential (£1020) and more besides, including a tracker with a three-year subscription (£530). The grey paint adds £1800 and the priciest option is the £4000 satin protective film over that, so that I look like an extra from a Guy Ritchie film. In all, £16,355's worth of kit takes the price to £96,745. When the new Defender arrived, Commercial versions started at £35,000 but it was just about possible to spend £100,000 on a heavily optioned five-door. Now a Defender Hard Top is £57,420 and you can get pretty close to £140,000. JLR isn't alone here, though. Everything has quickly become more expensive. Besides, the Defender has found its feet as a luxury car. And the most expensive ones now get a petrol V8. Goody gumdrops. Anyway, back to this one: it's settling into my routine very easily. I will take it off road, or at least onto green lanes, but during its initial miles, I've been using it as a daily wagon. I know it's big and tall and heavy, but it's such a good motorway car, with great visibility, big comfortable seats, a relaxed driving position and exceptional stability and isolation, even in bad conditions. And sure, it's a 4x4, but ease off and relax and it can return 40mpg on a long cruise. Not many years ago, a 1.4-litre petrol supermini wouldn't have done that. Like the Raptor that went before it, it's not the simplest thing to park, but I can be in a Suzuki Swift and I will still head to a quiet car park bay right at the end of a row and then scooch up against the wall or kerb, so it doesn't make much difference. And there's a really good reversing camera that shows how much room the spare wheel requires, plus the space needed if you want to still open the rear door. There are lots of little niche features like that around the Defender. More on them in the weeks to come. Second Opinion We’ve all seen a lot of new Defenders, yet never one as well specced as the 90 we ran a few years ago (well done, Matt). It was memorable and is still missed; a bigger, more accessible boot was its only real weakness. The 130 takes a sledgehammer (or is that a shipping container?) to that problem, so I’m intrigued to see if it retains the 90’s charm.

    "description": "Demand for the electric GV60 provides Genesis with a baseline to work from Personal assistants, electric vehicles and Hyundai fleet strength offer new opportunities with company car drivers Korean luxury brand Genesis is aiming to raise its profile with company car drivers and mark itself out from other newcomers by using the fleet infrastructure of parent company Hyundai, according to brand director Jonny Miller.  The firm became a stand-alone business within Hyundai Motor UK in February, having operated independently since it launched in the UK in 2021. Miller said this provides access to a nationwide aftersales network and an established database of fleet customers, enabling targeted cross-selling of Genesis products where they fit operators’ price-grading structures.  However, he added, the driver-facing elements of that proposition are unchanged. Company car drivers will continue to get the same service as retail customers, including a Genesis Personal Assistant as their single point of contact for everything from initial enquiries and ordering to the detailed handover process and service bookings.  Vehicles will also still be collected and delivered fully valeted if they need to visit the workshop and customers will be provided with courtesy cars in the meantime. Feedback suggests customers value that experience, Miller said. “That mechanism is how we’re trying to cut through the noise,” said Miller, referring to Genesis's bid to gain attention in a market that has lots of new brands. “Where applicable, everything that we offer [retail customers] has been offered to our corporate clients, because we realise that’s probably going to make us stand out.” Genesis launched with five petrol and diesel vehicles, but recently axed the G70 saloon and estate and GV80 SUV in Europe. Against the backdrop of a smaller model range and softer retail demand, its UK registrations were down 24.5% for the year to date in August, from 920 to 695 vehicles, according to the latest SMMT data. Although Miller stressed the brand isn’t targeting large fleet volumes, it now has three electric models and a bedrock of director-level demand for both the GV60 and GV70 in a market where more than 60% of total volume and 80% of electric vehicles are registered to fleets and businesses.  To drive awareness, Genesis has expanded its company car demonstrator fleet and organised a programme of events throughout October, giving leasing companies, key industry partners and SME and corporate customers a chance to try the latest products and meet the team. Miller said there could also be opportunities to pursue solus supply deals with Hyundai, leveraging a combined line-up spanning from city cars to premium electric SUVs. “We have seen that the moment we get a Genesis into a large organisation – once it's in the car park, once people have seen it and talked about it – we then see that flurry,\" he said. “We just need that early adopter to understand and think about Genesis. “Once they've done that, we then really see that snowball effect of more people going into Genesis because we've delivered a great experience [from] the point of final order confirmation through to handover.”",

    "description": "Battery is thought to be the same unit as in the Model Y Long Range RWD Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive version is added to the line-up priced at £44,990 The new Tesla Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive has been revealed as the longest-ranged iteration of the electric saloon to date, offering 436 miles per charge. That eclipses its 406-mile Polestar 2 rival, and puts it on par with much pricier premium models, such as the Mercedes-Benz EQS. The new Model 3 is also the most efficient Tesla model ever produced, and one of the most efficient cars on sale, yielding an efficiency figure of 4.96mpkWh. The American brand has yet to confirm the size of the battery in the new variant, but it is thought to have adopted the same pack as the recently revealed Model Y Long Range RWD, which offers 373 miles of range. Those extra miles have been achieved through “continued engineering efforts focused on energy efficiency”, said Tesla. Tesla has set a price of £44,990 for the Model 3 Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, which sits between the £39,990 entry-level Model 3 Rear-Wheel Drive and Long Range All-Wheel drive.

    "title": "DS 8 fastback to underpin brand's hopes of sales revival",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ds-8-fastback-underpin-brands-hopes-sales-revival",
    "description": "The new DS 8 will share its STLA Medium structure with the Peugeot 3008 New luxury range-topper set to follow styling lead of SM Tribute concept The new DS 8 will be launched next year as a segment-straddling luxury flagship charged with reinvigorating the French premium brand and kickstarting its electric era. The high-riding fastback will spearhead a totally overhauled line-up for DS, which is working to electrify each of its cars and increase its share of the market, 10 years on from its foundation as a stand-alone brand. The new range-topper has been conceived as a replacement for today’s DS 9 saloon and will arrive at a crucial moment for the marque, which is still struggling to get a foothold in the European market. To the end of August, sales were down 33% year on year across the region, to 26,173 cars, and fewer than 800 of those were sold in the UK. The flagship DS 9 – based on the Peugeot 508, which is due to be pulled from sale – sold just 234 units in Europe until August this year, and only three in the UK. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has been vocal in his backing of each of the company’s 14 brands – most notably Maserati, which has been under intense scrutiny for its lacklustre financial performance. The company is also standing by its pledge made in 2021 to give each marque 10 years of financial support before making any decisions on its future within the group. That gives DS seven years to become more competitive in the upper mainstream segment, during which time it will also undertake a complete revamp of its product range in line with an ambition to go all-electric from 2027. The radical new DS 8 is set to serve as a statement of intent for this new era. It helps to establish bold new design practices while introducing new powertrains and taking the brand into a new segment, in which it will compete with the likes of the Genesis GV60 and Audi Q6 E-tron. The DS 8 will be built at Stellantis’s factory in Melfi, Italy, alongside a similarly shaped successor to the Vauxhall Insignia and Lancia’s new Gamma crossover. Camouflaged prototypes suggest that DS is aiming to bolster its competitive credentials by ensuring that it has as broad a market reach as possible. It will feature elements of saloon, fastback and SUV in its styling, which is not dissimilar from that of the C5 X that crowns sibling brand Citroën’s line-up.  DS is predominantly a manufacturer of crossovers (with the exception of the slow-selling 9 saloon), and the continued dominance of SUVs in the European sales charts means the brand will most likely look to retain a raised driving position and roomy cockpit for its upcoming models. However, the forthcoming flagship 8 suggests the marque is making a departure from conventional crossover styling cues in favour of a more distinct and easily identifiable look. The DS 8 is expected to be heavily influenced by the recently revealed DS SM Tribute. The rakish, ground-hugging saloon concept was billed as looking ahead to the brand’s future while nodding to the eponymous Citroën GT car of the 1970s. DS design boss Thierry Métroz suggested aspects of the SM Tribute concept’s retro-futuristic design treatment will be carried over to production cars. “We have done a transcript and reinterpretation of the SM,” he said. “But as it is not our habit to disconnect from our other work, we included a lot of details about DS Automobiles models and our future projects.” In this context, the SM Tribute concept’s sleek, wind-cheating silhouette suggests DS will move to put aero efficiency at the centre of its design direction. It seems the brand’s relatively conventional Aero Sport Lounge SUV concept from 2020 can no longer be considered a reliable preview of the future, and DS could move away from traditionally shaped SUVs altogether. Technically the DS 8 will be a close relation to the Peugeot 3008, Vauxhall Grandland and next-generation Citroën C5 Aircross. It will share with those models Stellantis’s new STLA Medium platform, which can accommodate hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric powertrains. No doubt the electric 8 – likely to be badged E-Tense – will match those cars in offering either 73kWh or 98kWh of battery capacity for a maximum range of around 435 miles, and it will be sold with a choice of single- or dual-motor powertrains, the latter packing 316bhp for hot hatch levels of performance. Tavares has previously indicated that each of the group’s brands will take a “flexible” approach to powertrains in the run-up to going all-electric, so the 8 is also likely to be offered initially with a big-battery, 192bhp PHEV and a 48V petrol hybrid. Inside, it is expected to follow the SM Tribute’s lead by embracing an airier and more minimalist treatment than that of the firm’s current models, with a projector display – rather than touchscreen – for the infotainment, plus extensive use of ambient lighting and upmarket materials. Notably, the SM concept featured a yoke-controlled steer-by-wire system, which, if it makes production, could be a first for a Stellantis brand – although Peugeot has also announced plans to bring one to market. The chief advantages of such a system are that it can be programmed easily to adapt its performance for different scenarios, it’s cheaper to produce because it requires fewer components and it frees up more packaging space for a ‘frunk’. Full details will be revealed at the car’s unveiling, which is likely to take place by the end of the year given that 2024 is the 10th anniversary of DS operating as a stand-alone brand.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/foxtron-model-d-unveiled-high-tech-mpv-410-mile-range",
    "description": "Foxtron Model D is designed to prioritise aerodynamic performance Automotive division of Taiwanese tech giant to build radical seven-seater with on-board iPhones and iPads Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn’s automotive division has revealed a radical electric MPV designed by Pininfarina. Majoring on connectivity and aerodynamics, it's called the Foxtron Model D after its positioning in the D-segment, measuring 5.13m long and 1.99m wide. Foxconn claims that it will achieve a range of more than 410 miles on the WLTP test cycle and that it will do so using a 100-120kWh lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery. That would make it the longest-range electric seven-seater on sale, pipping the Peugeot e-5008, which gets exactly 410 miles from its 98kWh battery. Key to this range is aerodynamic efficiency, claims Foxtron: there’s a variety of holes and creases in the bodywork in order to smooth the flow of air through and around it. A gap in the front grille flows through to the scuttle, for example. This shrinks the frontal area and helps to channel air over the roof, contributing to a drag coefficient of just 0.23Cd.  The Model D's electrical architecture also plays a key role, having been designed around one centralised computer with several ‘zonal’ modules for parts such as the infotainment system. This design helps to improve energy efficiency and – given it's to be used in all the company’s cars – reduces costs, Foxtron said.  The car's platform has been developed by ZF Chassis Modules, which Foxconn acquired a 50% share of earlier this year. Inside, the Model D is designed to make the most of other products manufactured by Foxconn: the armchairs in the six-seat version have charging pads that fit an iPhone and each front seatback has a slot for an iPad. Mass production is set to begin in two years’ time – although it won’t be badged as a Foxtron. The firm’s business model is to license cars to other firms, even letting them redesign them slightly to suit their needs. Foxtron’s Model C is currently sold by Taiwanese brand Luxgen, for instance, and future models will be sold by Saudi Arabian EV start-up Ceer.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/electric-alpine-a110-wont-copy-hyundai-ioniq-5-ns-fake-engine",
    "description": "New A110 will be based on a bespoke platform French brand will lean into the character of electric powertrains rather than try to replicate an engine Alpine won’t fit the upcoming A110 EV with “fake” gearing, as Hyundai has with the Ioniq 5 N, or pump the cabin with synthetic engine noise, the French brand’s CEO has said. In the Ioniq 5 N - the first purpose-built electric hot hatch – an artificial gearbox can be operated through paddles, accurately simulating the power delivery of an internal combustion engine (ICE). Simulated engine noise is also played through the speakers. When asked if the A110 EV could adopt a similar set-up, especially in light of the Ioniq 5 N’s positive reception, Alpine CEO Philippe Krief said: “This is fake. This is really fake. I don’t like fake things like that.” He added that the next A110 should not sound like it has an ICE because it “is an electric car”, although he added that “we could make electric cars have the sound or things of ICE cars” if customers demanded it. It's possible that Alpine will use a man-made sound instead of simulated engine noise, as in its new A290 hot hatch. “We could find something that is not the same but [similar],” said Krief. “It is very easy to do that.” Due in 2026, the new A110 will be Alpine's third electric car, following the A290 (derived from the new Renault 5) and the production version of the A390_B concept being unveiled at the upcoming Paris motor show. Although Alpine has previously tested an electric powertrain in the existing A110 structure, the new car will sit on a bespoke platform. This will be shared with a Porsche 911-style 2+2 called the A310, earmarked for launch later this decade.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/kia-unveils-electric-pride-107bhp-and-manual-box",
    "description": "Uprated headlights and White Pearl paint distinguish Pride EV from the original Company’s 80th birthday present to itself is overhaul of the first car it brought to the UK Kia UK has unveiled an electric restomod of the first car it sold here, the Pride hatchback, with almost twice as much power as the original. Based on a 1996 Pride LX from the company’s heritage fleet, it has been converted to electric power by Oxfordshire-based firm Electrogenic. The 60bhp 1.3-litre petrol engine has been swapped for a 107bhp electric motor, which remains mated to the original five-speed manual gearbox “to ensure maximum driver engagement”.  Kia UK expects the Pride EV to dispatch the 0-62mph sprint in around 8.0sec and said it will independently verify the car’s acceleration and performance later this year. The 37-litre fuel tank has been swapped for two 10kWh battery packs – one fitted under the bonnet and one under the boot floor – combining for a total 20kWh in capacity. That yields a range of around 120 miles per charge in the car’s Eco driving mode, Kia said, although Sport mode naturally reduces this figure. The Pride EV can be recharged at up to 3.3kW via a Type 2 connector fitted under the fuel filler door, taking around six hours to go from 1-100%. Inside, it retains its original instrumentation, with the fuel level dial adapted to show the battery's state of charge.  The conversion to electric power has meant that the Pride has put on an extra 20kg (going from 850kg to 870kg), but Kia UK said the gains in power make up for the extra heft.  Visually, the Pride EV is almost indistinguishable from the original Pride, wearing its original 12in steel wheels and plastic bumpers. It has been resprayed from Kingfisher Blue to the White Pearl finish offered on the Kia EV3, EV6, EV9 and Niro EV and the lights at both ends have been uprated. Inside, it's trimmed in grey cloth with lime-green piping referencing the shade used on the flagship EV6 GT. The Pride EV is intended as a celebration of Kia’s 80th birthday, the Korean company having been established as a bicycle component manufacturer in 1944. It began building cars in 1974 and first exported one to the UK in 1991.",

    "description": "The Alpine A390 Beta will be one of the biggest launches at Paris – Autocar's render shows how it might look Renault takes centre stage at the next edition of France's big show – here’s what to look out for The biennial Paris motor show returns on 14 October, and it’s shaping up to have been worth the wait. The show floor will be dominated by the Renault Group, which is revealing no fewer than six new cars. They will range from the next evolution of Alpine’s hydrogen-combustion supercar to Dacia’s Ford Kuga killer and the reborn Renault 4. Stellantis will be out in greater force than in 2022, with Citroën set to unveil the facelifted C4 and an update to the Ami.  The likes of Alfa Romeo, Kia and Mini will also be in Paris, although they’ve yet to announce the extent of their presence. As with the 2022 Paris show, Chinese brands including BYD, GAC and Xpeng will be out in full force too. Welcome to our guide to this year’s Paris show, covering everything new to keep an eye out for. Alfa Romeo Junior Ibrida The hybrid version of Alfa Romeo’s new crossover will make its public debut at the Paris show. Named the Junior Ibrida, it’s fitted with the same 134bhp mild-hybrid powertrain as the related Fiat 600 and Jeep Avenger. Read our Alfa Romeo Junior review Alfa Romeo Tonale Alfa Romeo will unveil the 2025-model-year Tonale at the Paris motor show. The company has yet to detail the changes it has made to the Tonale, but the car is most likely to receive a software upgrade, potentially updating the infotainment system and extracting extra range from the plug-in hybrid powertrain. Read our Alfa Romeo Tonale review Alpine A390 Beta The Alpine A390 Beta concept will provide a tantalising first look at the French brand’s upcoming Porsche Macan Electric rival, an electric SUV with a rakish, coupé-like silhouette. As with the previous A290 Beta and Alpine A290, it’s set to very closely resemble the road-going car, due next year, but could feature a twist such as a novel interior layout or futuristic on-board technologies.  Alpine to unveil electric Porsche Macan rival on 11 October Alpine Alpenglow Hy6 Alpine’s testbed for hydrogen combustion engines will undergo its next evolution at this year’s Paris show. It was first unveiled at the 2022 show and hit the track for the first time earlier this year using a modified Oreca four-cylinder engine, but it’s now making the switch to a bespoke V6. Alpine has prioritising improved efficiency (it reckoned the four-pot could drive 62 miles between fill-ups at racing pace), but it’s likely to boost power beyond the existing unit’s 335bhp too. Alpine's hydrogen V6 hypercar could make production Citroën Ami update “We are going to extend the Ami line-up and do many changes”, Citroën CEO Thierry Koskas recently told Autocar. He wouldn’t be drawn on what those changes would be, but it’s possible that he meant new variants in the vein of the Ami Buggy or technical upgrades to boost its appeal. “We will reveal everything in the Paris motor show,” concluded Koskas. Citroën C4 facelift Asked about the future of the Citroën C4, Koskas replied: “We will update the design; you will have to come to the Paris motor show.” Images of new C4 prototypes spotted testing reveal it will get front and rear lighting signatures inspired by the Citroën Oli concept, and the interior is expected to receive an upgraded infotainment system to boot. Citroën concept Citroën will unveil a concept car “in a major segment”. It’s thought to preview either the next C4 or C5 Aircross, with the latter car set to arrive next year. It will doubtless take inspiration from the Oli concept that the brand revealed two years ago, but could evolve it a step further. Citroen to unveil radical new concept car at Paris motor show Dacia Bigster Dacia will unveil its biggest and most expensive model yet, a Ford Kuga and Nissan Qashqai rival called the Bigster. A 4.6-metre-long five-seat SUV, it’s set to undercut its key rivals on price while majoring on utility. Dacia Bigster: First pictures of rugged sub-£40k family SUV Leapmotor B10 Chinese Dacia rival Leapmotor has just landed in the UK with its C10 SUV and T03 city car (pictured above), which the firm claims to be the best-value EVs in their respective segments. It's already adding to that line-up with the new B10 SUV, which will be revealed at the Paris show. It's expected to be a smaller foil to the C10, rivalling the likes of the Kia EV3 and Volkswagen ID 3. Leapmotor T03 launched as UK’s second-cheapest electric car Mini John Cooper Works Mini's go-faster divison, John Cooper Works, will reveal its first electric cars at the Paris motor show. Details published by the Chinese government reveal that the Aceman crossover and Cooper hatchback have been fitted with a more potent 255bhp motor, which should bring a decent boost in performance for both models. They also get more aggressive-looking styling, with blacked-out grilles, more prominent skirting and bigger alloy wheels. Electric Mini John Cooper Works gets 255bhp motor, sportier styling Mobilize Bento and Mobilize Duo The effective replacement for the Renault Twizy will be unveiled in production-ready form at the Paris motor show. The Mobilize-branded quadricycle will be available in two forms: Bento cargo van and Duo two-seater. Both are expected to launch in the UK next year. Renault readying Twizy successor for UK launch Peugeot E-3008 Long Range and Peugeot E-5008 Long Range Peugeot will launch Long Range variants of its new e-3008 and new e-5008 at the Paris motor show, with the SUVs offering ranges of 435 miles and 415 miles, respectively.  That's thanks to a new 96.9kWh battery pack – 23.9kWh bigger than the existing 73kWh one, which yields 327 miles of range in the E-3008 and 315 miles in the E-5008. Read our Peugeot E-3008 and E-5008 reviews Peugeot E-408 Peugeot will complete its electric car line-up with the unveiling of the new E-408. It's expected to use the same 54kWh battery and 148bhp motor as the smaller E-308 and could get subtle design tweaks such as a blanked-off front grille. Peugeot E-408 to be unveiled at Paris motor show Renault 4 Having been shown in 4Ever concept form at the previous Paris show, the reborn Renault 4 is now ready to make its debut. The EV is expected to share much of its technical make-up with the smaller Renault 5 but sit higher and wider, in a bid to capture the ever-popular compact crossover market.  Reborn Renault 4 shows off boxy look ahead of October debut Renault 17 Electric Restomod x Ora Ito Bemused by the Ford Capri’s metamorphosis from bold coupé to conformist SUV? This Renault 17 might just be the answer, bringing the Capri’s contemporary rival up to date with a 270bhp electric motor and a carbonfibre chassis. Penned in collaboration with French designer Ora Ito, it’s slightly wider and lower than the original 17 but retains its cabin, door, windows, glass and underbody. Renault 17 reborn with 270bhp, RWD and carbonfibre chassis Renault Embleme This coupé SUV is Renault’s idea of how hydrogen-fuel-cell power could offer long-range transport while slicing carbon emissions by 90% compared with today’s petrol Captur. Its exterior will be shown at Paris, but we’ll have to wait until later this month to see the Embleme in full. Renault Embleme revealed as hydrogen coupé-SUV for 2030 Renault Twingo Renault’s next retro revival after the 4 is the cute new Twingo, which is scheduled to go on sale in 2026. The Paris show will mark its public debut. Renault Twingo to return in 2026 as sub-£17,000 EV THK LSR-05 We'll forgive you if you've never heard of Japanese parts supplier THK, but its latest concept is well worth paying attention to. Penned by Nissan GT-R designer Shiro Nakamura, it is a showcase of the company's latest technological developments, including in-wheel motors and wireless car charging. It'll be making its European debut at Paris. Japanese firm shows high-tech SUV penned by Nissan GT-R designer",

    "description": "Teaser sketch reveals Compass will share cues with the smaller Jeep Avenger Next generation of American brand's mainstream SUV is confirmed to begin production in Italy from 2025 Jeep has confirmed that the next-generation Compass SUV will enter production next year. It will be built on parent company Stellantis’s STLA Medium platform, suggesting that it will be closely related to the Peugeot 3008 and Vauxhall Grandland. Like those cars, it will be available with hybrid and electric powertrains. These will most likely comprise a 134bhp mild-hybrid with a dual-clutch automatic gearbox and a 207bhp single-motor powertrain with a 73kWh battery pack. The Compass will also be offered with a pure-combustion powertrain, unlike the 3008 and Grandland. This suggests that it may be positioned below those two models, potentially undercutting the Vauxhall’s starting price of £34,700. For reference, the outgoing Compass is priced from £34,150 in mild-hybrid form. The new Compass is expected to be revealed next month. Jeep UK boss Kris Cholmondeley recently told Autocar that the American brand will unveil a third car (in addition to the upcoming Recon and Wagoneer S) in November. Although he stopped short of confirming that it would be the Compass, he said the new car would be “key to achieving the market share ambitions that we have”. The Compass will sit above the Jeep Avenger in the future line-up, allowing Jeep to tap Britain’s most popular class of car: the C-segment. Production of the new car will begin at Stellantis’s plant in Melfi, Italy, next year, alongside new models from Alfa Romeo, DS and Lancia.  It’s set to be followed by a new Jeep Renegade, positioned below the Avenger at around £20,000.",

    "description": "We pick the very finest hybrid SUVs on the road, with compact, family and luxury models all making the cut For the perfect balance of power, efficiency and eco-friendliness in an SUV, a hybrid makes a lot of sense  In a world split by combustion and electric power, hybrid SUVs offer the best of both worlds.  They combine the fuel-saving benefits of electric power with the easy usability and performance of a traditional combustion engine, plus they continue to attract preferential benefit-in-kind taxation rates for company car drivers, which usually makes them a far more wallet-friendly alternative to a traditional company car.  Plug-in powertrains are also well suited to SUVs, where the bulk of the battery and extra electric motors can usually be accommodated without any loss in space and practicality. Whether you're prioritising fuel efficiency, cutting emissions or simply seeking a smoother drive, we've compiled a list of the top 10 hybrid SUVs that excel in technology, versatility and style. Our number-one hybrid SUV is the Mercedes-Benz GLC 300e, but why is that, and what other options are on the market? Our list has all the answers.  Read on to discover which hybrid SUV best suits your lifestyle and driving needs.",

    "title": "'The RS E-tron GT left me gasping for breath in a way ICE cars don't'",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/rs-e-tron-gt-left-me-gasping-breath-way-ice-cars-dont",
    "description": "The sustained acceleration of this Audi gives it a brutality that few others possess Three weeks ago something inside me felt as though it may have broken. Something visceral, in the literal sense. It happened on the launch event of the very capable new Audi E-tron GT. And it wasn’t a result of dinner – often the scene of plutocratic, manufacturer-underwritten expansiveness but which here consisted of a burger van laid up in a dimly lit car park outside Heilbronn. If anything, that made it all nicely familiar – a bit like being on a group test in Wales but in a parallel corporate universe. Whatever it was that broke, it happened as a consequence of Carsten Jablonowski pointing the most comically over-endowed RS Audi since the Quattro S1 E2 down a damp slope and popping off a launch-control start. It wasn’t an especially clean start, but considering the slickness of the surface underwheel, it was still frighteningly effective – and with 912bhp on tap, neither was it slow. As if to goad less mature owners into using the launch-control feature at any opportunity, a stopwatch can be called up in the instrument binnacle. It read 2.8sec for 0-100kph – not slow but not exactly supersonic by today’s standards either. And yet I felt like I’d just downed two steins of the local brew then pegged it up three flights of stairs while wearing a corset and a respirator. I was at that moment unexpectedly wrecked. Jablonowski – wiry, laconic and every bit chassis engineering’s answer to Clint Eastwood – looked at me, his face wearing the veneer of a smirk in which I detected traces of guilt. I should hope so.  Two things stood out. First, the uneasy and lingering sensation that one of my vertebrae had nicked an artery on the back of my liver. This persisted for a couple of hours. I’ve never had anything like that before, despite being flung around race tracks by Frank Biela and Walter Röhrl (in fairness, both men were indescribably economical at the helm) and through a seven-foot snow bank then down into a Finnish forest by an apologetic Bentley engineer (less smooth). The odd pulled muscle and bruised rib? Sure. The feeling that something anatomically a little untoward had just happened? Never – until now. The second thing was the double whammy of faint vertigo and the sense of the stomach in freefall, either of which can be desirable in a performance car if delivered to just the right magnitude. Not so here: too much of both. This was odd, because I hadn’t felt either sensation in years. In this job, you become a bit immune to speed, to the extent that I was perturbed on the road test of the current Porsche 911 Turbo S, during which repeated 2.5sec runs to 60mph weren’t eliciting the speech-stunting excitement I know they once would have. The teenage me would have found this incomprehensible; I found it a bit sad. The tangential point here is that when it comes to speed, it’s good to safeguard your innocence. Going fast is laugh-out-loud fun in a primal sense, and if an Alpine A110 still feels rapid to you, you’re winning the wider petrolhead game.  Getting back to the main point, the Audi left me gasping for breath in a way that ICE cars simply don’t any more. But why was it so discombobulating and unpleasant despite being not uniquely quick? I suspect that being a passenger didn’t help, rather than being at the wheel. When you’re in control, 2.8sec to 62mph probably feels like 3.5sec; if you’re not, it feels more like 1.8sec. The nature of the acceleration is also unrelenting, and this really made the difference. An ICE car hurls you forward then takes a breath to engage second before going again. Engine speed rising, as well as some shape in the rate of acceleration, gives valuable context to what your cerebellum and vestibular system are logging. It grounds the experience. A near-1000bhp, four-wheel-drive EV is by comparison a form of sensory deprivation.  Interestingly, it was at about 60mph, when second gear would normally arrive but at which point the Audi just kept slogging onwards, that the show reached its zenith, or perhaps its nadir. The cumulative effect seems important. One second of being rammed back into your seat and pinned there is fine. Two seconds is okay. Three seconds feels like an eternity and was the point at which I started to feel like an ant rapidly circling a plughole, or a waxwork starting to melt. The Audi’s official 0-62mph time, by the way, is 2.5sec.  Word to the wise for would-be owners keen to show mates its potential: be sure to have some waivers printed off and stored in the glovebox for your unwitting victims to sign.",

    "title": "How Magna developed cameras to allow cars to see in the dark",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/technology/how-magna-developed-cameras-allow-cars-see-dark",
    "description": "Wildlife can see in the dark better than us, but cars are catching up Exceptional night vision isn’t something humans are gifted with. Some of our friends in the animal kingdom, such as deer, are far better at seeing at night. See-in-the-dark tech was used first by the military, before automotive supplier Magna developed its first thermal imaging system in 2003. Called Night Vision, it was introduced in the BMW 7 Series in 2005 and has since been used by 13 car makers across 40 models. Today's systems have improved coverage, enhanced detection capability and a sharp image even in complete darkness.  Yet among the current portfolio of ADAS systems, it’s still relatively rare, which is odd, considering accident rates at night are far higher than daytime. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), more than 76% of pedestrian fatalities happen in the dark, while in the UK, Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa) statistics show that 40% of accidents occur when it’s dark. Not all of these are due to reduced vision, but decreased vision is said to be the most obvious danger.  As we age, our night vision worsens. According to Rospa, between the ages of 15 and 65, the time taken to recover from glare increases from between one to 19 seconds. The way the eye detects light becomes less effective, too. There are two main types of receptor in the eye: rod cells, which detect light, and cone cells, which mainly detect colour. A deer’s eyes have a large proportion of rod cells, and while it’s not a nocturnal animal, its night vision is exceptional compared with ours. Human rod cells thin out with age, so driving at night becomes more of a challenge. Magna’s latest thermal imaging camera has shrunk to the size of a golf ball today, when in 2000 it was closer to a medium-size dinner plate. Mounted on the front of a vehicle, the camera is connected to an ECU, which sends alerts to the driver via the instrument panel. Magna is aiming to eventually reduce the camera to sugar-cube size and is continually working on software to improve detection algorithms and enhance image clarity.  Magna is also working on a 360deg system aimed at reducing the number of reversing accidents involving pedestrians. This will enhance visibility not only all around the car but also underneath it. The next-generation tech will have its debut at the end of this year, and while the current version can see four times farther than a headlight, the new set-up will let the driver see the length of three football fields. That should allow a driver up to 30 seconds to bring the car to a standstill if necessary.",

    "title": "How reality blew apart the agency sales model dream, even for Tesla",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-car-sales/how-reality-blew-apart-agency-sales-model-dream-even-tesla",
    "description": "BMW/Mini was among the brands that set in motion plans to switch to agency 'Legacy' makers wanted to take revenue back from the middleman, but it hasn't gone according to plan for all Blame Tesla for opening car makers’ eyes to the possibility of direct sales. The EV specialist chucked out the old sales model, bypassed established dealers and owned the retail process by seamlessly integrating a slick online showroom with physical locations. The ‘legacy’ makers meanwhile were giving away around 10% of their revenue to the dealers. These independent middlemen bought new cars much cheaper wholesale and lured customers by sharing some of their good fortune in the form of cash off the recommended price. But what if there was a different way? Tesla seemed to point the direction. Most established brands were too big to go the whole hog and swallow the cost of owning their sales points, so the agency model was born.  Instead of the new car being sold twice, car makers would sell direct to the customer, with dealers facilitating the sale as their ‘agents’ and being paid a flat fee for doing so. Car makers hoped that this way, they would have complete control of the whole sales ‘funnel’, from the moment the customer started idly browsing for a new car to them taking delivery and even beyond.  Haggling would disappear, because customers just paid one price set by the car maker. Not everyone was convinced, but Volkswagen, Stellantis, JLR, Mercedes-Benz, BMW/Mini, Ford and many smaller brands all set in motion plans to make the switch to agency. Now, however, many – including Ford, Stellantis, JLR and Polestar – are cancelling or postponing their agency plans. Even Tesla, the brand that kicked off the whole process for many, is finding it hard to maintain the purity of its direct sales model as it grows bigger.  “Tesla probably did have a much lower cost of distribution until around 2021,” Steve Young, head of automotive retail consultancy ICDP, wrote in a recent report. “That has now changed.” That change, and perhaps the death of true agency altogether, has been triggered by the return of cut-throat competition. When many agency plans were being drawn up three or four years ago, vehicle production was curtailed by first Covid then the post-Covid chip shortage. Ca rmakers could sell all their limited output at the price they wanted. It proved the worst conditions for testing agency. Tesla’s ultra-ambitious growth plan called for increasing sales to fill its factories and achieve the economies of scale it dreamed of. But as rivals caught up and EV sales grew at a slower pace, it need to stimulate demand.  At first, Tesla turned to the method prescribed by the pure, transparent direct sales model: it cut prices. However, as the company found in China and to a limited extent in Europe, pricing cutting forces competitors to do the same, negating the benefit and sparking price wars. It also damages the all-important residual values. Dutch leasing giant Ayvens earlier this year described Tesla’s practice of cutting its list prices as “poison” after getting hit financially from falling used prices. Never one to learn a lesson from others, Tesla found out the hard way the secret to stimulating demand with giveaways: do it quietly. “The more opaque the new-car pricing support, the better it is to protect residuals down the line,” Young said. In the run-up to the end of the third quarter, Tesla hit upon a new plan: cheap, limited-time lease rates. It offered the Model Y for £299 a month for three years, lower than much smaller EVs, such as the Hyundai Kona Electric. It also sells pre-registered cars at a discount – another way of stimulating demand.  Tesla is feeling its way to unlock the advantage of the wholesale model: highly reactive price elasticity. “Pricing is the key tool to balance supply and demand in any market,” Young said. Because they can set their own pricing, dealers are very good at finding the exact level needed to get customers to buy cars. Under the wholesale model, they are also given more financial motivation to actively sell, crucial in times like now when competition is fierce, prices have risen and customers are behind the curve on expected EV demand.  Ford UK head Lisa Brankin cited the power of the dealer under the current system to make sales as one reason Ford decided not to roll out the agency model following a trial in the Netherlands. “The dealer's job is to go and find customers, and they do that really well,” she told Autocar.  Like Tesla, Polestar is another realising that the agency model represents a straitjacket in times when flexibility is needed. The embattled Geely-owned company has now moved to a system whereby it still owns the car until bought by the customer, but it now incentivises the dealer to make the sale. This replaces its launch policy of having low-pressure ‘product experts’ instead of salespeople, in the style of Apple. Ineos Automotive is another to back away from direct sales. “It was an example of us thinking we can do something better than dealers who’ve been doing it for over 100 years,” CEO Lynn Calder told The Telegraph earlier this month. “Let’s just let the people with decades of sales experience do their job.” Mercedes too is morphing its agency model, which it introduced in 2023. Recognising the need to push EVs in the face of legislation, it gave dealers an additional 1% fee for selling them, then incentivised dealers to sell from a pool of cars it made available. The company has shown more flexibility in its business lease rates for all models.  Dealer group Sytner reported healthy prices for Mercedes cars under the agency scheme, but others reported sales were well down. The Eastern Western Motor Group recorded a drop in revenue of £50 million at its four Mercedes sites in 2023. The jargon for this looser way of applying the direct sales model is ‘non-genuine agency’ – something that riles Young. “This is a fairly clear definition, and any arrangement which fails to meet this test is not agency, and the [manufacturer] cannot set prices,” he said. Having said that, car makers are still committed to changing the way they sell cars. Everything they didn’t like about the franchise model still stands: the haggling, the discounting, the competition for customers within their own network, the severing of ties with the customer once they move from online research to ordering at the dealer. “We learned a huge amount,” Brankin said of Ford's Netherlands agency test. “The franchise model that we've got in Europe will evolve over the next five years.” She referenced the data connection with the customer as one area that Ford wants to strengthen – an imperative for every car maker as they look to sell digital adds-on to the car over the air. Many original agency implementations were flawed however, suggested Young. “A few [manufacturers] carefully planned and considered their switch, but many rushed into it, seduced by a message from big consulting firms that this would allow them to slash the cost of distribution,” he said. Young cited incomplete IT systems – something that afflicted Stellantis in its pilot programmes in Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands. That forced a change in plans, Uwe Hochgeschurtz, chief operating officer of Stellantis’s Enlarged Europe region, told Automotive News Europe. Now Stellantis plans to move country by country, instead of brand by brand, with 10 markets switching by 2026. In 2022, the company pledged to slash its distribution costs in Europe by half by 2030. The overall problem is not agency per se but coping with the drop in demand. “The almost universal problem with agency implementations to date is that [manufacturers] continue to push excess supply into the market,” Young said. “They have not developed new pricing mechanisms that allow them, or the retailers on their behalf, to achieve a matching demand.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mclaren-w1-succeeds-p1-1258bhp-v8-hybrid-powertrain",
    "description": "The W1 uses a new, mid-mounted 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 for a staggering 1258bhp McLaren P1 successor combines Formula 1 aerodynamics with a mighty new V8 hybrid drivetrain The successor to the McLaren P1 mixes Formula 1 aerodynamics with a mighty new V8 hybrid drivetrain that sends all of its 1258bhp to the rear wheels. Although the McLaren Senna and Speedtail have followed in the decade since the P1, the £2 million McLaren W1 is considered by its maker to be the true successor to that hypercar, which was itself a follow-up to the seminal McLaren F1. The W1 breaks all records for the company in terms of power and performance. It laps circuits quicker than the aero-focused Senna and accelerates faster than the speed-focused Speedtail, all in a package that weighs 1399kg thanks to a forensic approach to weight-saving for every component, from the engine to the sun visors. The P1 was famously launched at the same time as the LaFerrari and Porsche 918 Spyder to create a ‘holy trinity’ of hypercars and Ferrari is understood to be readying its own LaFerrari successor for an imminent launch as a rival to the W1. McLaren W1 engine and performance At the heart of the W1 is an in-house-engineered twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre flat-plane-crank V8 engine. McLaren says the engine is new from the ground up and designed specifically to work with hybrid systems. The engine, which uses both direct injection and port fuel injection, produces 915bhp on its own to give the highest output per litre of any McLaren engine yet Codenamed MHP-8, the engine works in conjunction with an e-module, which comprises a motor control unit and a 342bhp radial flux electric motor with performance aping a Formula E car’s motor. This is used primarily to add more performance via a small, 1.4kWh battery (the car is not a plug-in hybrid) but it also acts as a reverse gear for the eight-speed dual-clutch transmission, enables silent start-up and allows for 1.6 miles of EV range. An e-differential also features. McLaren says the W1’s hybrid components weigh 40% less than those in the P1 but offer 40% more power. The combined peak torque is 988lb ft, a huge rise from the 903bhp P1’s 664lb ft. The 0-62mph time is 2.7sec, 0-124mph is 5.8sec and 0-186mph is 12.7sec. Top speed is limited to 217mph and McLaren promises a “crescendo” from the exhaust note that builds towards the engine’s 9200rpm redline. Different powertrain modes allow for varying levels of electric assistance, from a Sprint mode that gives maximum e-power over one lap to a GP mode that manages its assistance on a longer track run. A Boost setting gives instant full power, mimicking a race-style push-to-pass system, and this can be combined with an F1-style drag reduction system (DRS) on the rear wing to increase straight-line speed further. Both of these systems are accessed using the only two buttons on the steering wheel. Four-wheel drive was not deemed necessary for the W1 due to the grip and load afforded by the aerodynamic package and suspension. Managing that amount of power and torque through the rear wheels was achieved by “Formula 1 know-how”, according to McLaren, whose F1 team currently leads the 2024 constructors’ championship. McLaren W1 aerodynamics The W1 follows only the Aston Martin Valkyrie in being a road car with true ground-effect aerodynamics thanks to its underbody design. There are active front and rear wings, including the W1’s signature feature of an Active Long Tail rear wing, which extends 300mm rearwards rather than upwards to work with the underfloor and rear diffuser to create extra downforce without adding drag. This function is available on track only. In the aero’s most extreme setting, Race mode, the W1 produces 350kg of front downforce and 650kg at the rear for a total of 1000kg. Yet, as chief aero engineer Robin Algoo explained, what’s different about the W1 beyond the headline numbers is its stability and predictability while cornering at such high speeds, which allows it to lap the Nardò handling circuit (McLaren’s reference track) 3sec quicker than a Senna. The starting point for the aero package on the W1 is the central Aerocell carbonfibre monocoque, which the car is built around and integrates the two seats for the cabin to allow for a shorter wheelbase. Almost every component and installation in the W1, from the mounting of the engine to the suspension design, has been done with aero performance in mind. For that reason, the doors are anhedral rather than dihedral, a McLaren first, and the scoop on the roof, recognisable from the F1 and P1, acts as a flow diverter to the rear. In road mode, the active front wing lifts and the Active Long Tail rear wing integrates into the body.  McLaren W1 chassis McLaren says a key part of the W1’s story is the civility with which it can be driven at everyday speeds and road conditions. The continuously active race-bred double-wishbone suspension design, called McLaren Race Active Chassis Control III, is new and its operating range has been engineered to span comfortable road driving and blistering track performance. Comfort, Sport, Race and Race+ modes are selectable. Comfort puts the focus on a “smooth ride quality” while Race and Race+ provide stability for the aerodynamic package to unlock the full performance potential on track. The ride height adjusts between modes. Pushrods are another McLaren first and work with inboard dampers using F1 expertise at the front to channel airflow, while outboard springs and dampers are used at the rear. Titanium is among the materials used for construction and 3D printing is one of the production methods used for suspension components in the pursuit of lightness. McLaren has retained hydraulic steering for the W1 and has fitted Carbon Ceramic Racing+ brake discs with an extra ceramic layer over previous discs to further boost stopping power. The W1 will go from 62mph to a standstill in 29m and 124-0mph in 100m. Bespoke tyres from Pirelli have been designed for the W1, including track-focused yet road-legal P Zero Trofeo RS rubber and more road- “In Race mode, it produces 350kg of front downforce and 650kg at the rear for a total of 1000kg” focused P Zero R and P Zero Winter 2. The alloy wheels are made from magnesium. McLaren W1 design and interior The W1 is 4635mm long, 2074mm wide and 1182mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2680mm, which makes it marginally bigger than a P1. Extensive use of carbon fibre helps to enable a 1399kg dry weight that’s almost at parity with the P1. The design is more an evolution of the Senna than the Speedtail but it also has plenty in common with the current 750S supercar, albeit with that quite aerodynamic overhaul. McLaren says the W1’s interior has “unmatched supercar ergonomics and best-in-class visibility”. It also talks up the comfort and spaciousness of the car by supercar standards. Particular focus has been placed on making ingress and egress as easy as possible and the engine quiet when a more civilised driving manner is called for. The pedals, as well as the steering wheel and primary controls, are adjustable, while the fixed seats are fully upholstered and more reclined than normal to improve comfort. The A-pillars are McLaren’s thinnest yet to aid visibility. The steering wheel is smaller than is typical for a McLaren and optionally incorporates shift lights to show when the redline is approaching. Key switchgear is used for major chassis and powertrain controls but there is a central 8in touchscreen that runs Apple CarPlay. Android Auto isn’t offered. There is storage for two-weekend bags (or helmets) behind the rear seats, a sliding cupholder and an extra central storage area. All 399 examples of the W1 have already been sold ahead of production starting in Woking in 2026. The transaction prices are expected to be far higher than £2m as a result of the “unlimited” customisation options that are available. As part of the usability pledge for the W1, a four-year service plan is included with the car. It has 12-month service intervals and similar service requirements to one of McLaren’s V6 hybrids, which is atypical for a track-focused machine.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/flat-out-mclarens-ultimate-trio-f1-meets-p1-and-senna",
    "description": "It's a rare occasion when this 200mph-plus trio is reunited With the unveiling of the new McLaren W1, join us as we revisit our 2019 test of its forebears The sight alone is enough to elicit involuntary laughter. F1, P1, McLaren Senna. All on the same slice of Tarmac, dihedral doors flipped up awaiting further instruction. They have been together before of course, most notably and recently at the Goodwood Members’ Meeting in the spring, but never for a purpose like this. We have them and this track, including its near-two-mile runway, for the day. They are ours. Despite the P1 being worth £5 million (it’s a prototype and the most filmed and famous P1 in existence) and the F1 valued at five times more than that, no one is saying ‘don’t go there, don’t do that’ with any of them. McLaren people are everywhere, appearing more than anything else pleased that we’ve been able to make this thing happen. So, at the risk of repeating myself: F1, P1, Senna. Which would you take first? If I didn’t have a story to write afterwards, I’d have left the F1 until last. Of course you would. It’s a McLaren F1 for goodness sake, and the number of those in anything approaching regular use in the world can be counted on the fingers of one hand, probably without needing the thumb. But it’s the benchmark, the inspiration, the one without which the others might have existed but surely not as they are. It is the origin. It has to go first. It seems hardly believable that the car is 25 years old, but the truth is that age manifests itself in primarily positive ways: the car’s compactness, its manual gearbox, analogue dials, normally aspirated engine and so on. For those of us who love the simple business of driving, the transition of such one-time staples from rule to exception is not something that is necessarily to be celebrated. There is that central driving position, so mad in theory but so effective in practice. It needs zero acclimatisation for it feels natural at once. I’m glad it’s coming back on McLaren’s Speedtail. Visibility all round is sensational, the antithesis of the Lamborghini letterbox approach to cockpit design. Confidence grows. The V12 is smooth, the gearbox on this 58,000-mile car loose and easy to operate. So because there is time, you can tootle about for a bit. My goodness, it rides well. No anti-roll bars here or ‘anti-traction devices’ as they used to be called at McLaren. The unassisted steering communicates like that of a Lotus and no wonder: there are Lotus Exiges you can buy that weigh more than this. And then you can resist no longer so, pausing only to remind yourself that this is 627bhp in 1164kg of car and that it has no safety systems of any kind at all, you give it the boot. Which is when part of you that somehow and stupidly filed this car under ‘nice old thing’ loses all comprehension of what happens next; and it will only be regained when you remember the old dear has a better power-to-weight ratio than a Bugatti Veyron. Really. In the cockpit, all your limbs are busy changing gear after gear and holding it straight. By the time you feel you can afford to glance down, an insane number is already on the speedometer, like 150mph. Then something else happens or, more accurately, doesn’t happen: the rate of acceleration scarcely slows, because compared with modern cars whose bodies generate downforce, the F1 has no drag. Out of deference to its age and value, I don’t press on much further, but this very car once did over 240mph, which is way faster than either of its younger, far more powerful descendants could manage. But while the F1 feels utterly mighty in a straight line, around the rest of the lap, the years start to show. This is by no means all bad news because on new Michelins (the only components on the car not to period spec as the original Goodyears are no longer available), the car has surprisingly good grip and a nice balance near the limit. But I don’t want to throw it around and that has nothing to do with its value: F1s tend not to react brilliantly when pushed further than they care to go and I’m very happy to leave that aspect of its character unexplored. But there’s no avoiding the brakes: and by both modern standards and those of any car with this level of performance they are, frankly, terrible. What will the P1 feel like after that? There’s so much about it that seems less, well, good. It has a small turbo V8, not an enormous atmospheric V12. You shift gears via paddles, not a lever. You can get only two people on board and there’s not much room for luggage. And, yes, it’s far more powerful thanks to its hybridassisted 903bhp engine but so, too, does that very system make it heavier – 300-odd kilograms heavier. When it originally appeared alongside the LaFerrari and Porsche 918, hybrids were a novelty, so much so in cars like this that a new term was coined that was never applied to the F1 in period: these were ‘hypercars’. But is it really such a leap? Well, and in a word, yes. For the avoidance of doubt, I’d have the F1 powertrain over the P1 equivalent every day of the week, month and year but that doesn’t make the P1 less than one hell of a car, and capable in ways the F1 simply cannot be. But let’s look first at what they share, beyond a badge, all-carbon construction and very funky doors. And the curious thing is that despite the 20 years that separate them and the fact that very few of the people who worked on the F1 were still around in Woking to work on the P1, they still feel related. And it’s that sense of light and space in the cabin that does it. This is a massively more complex car, bristling with driving modes for the powertrain and chassis, push-to-pass power boost and DRS buttons, but it still manages to make you feel at home. The difference is that here the chassis is no longer cast in a supporting role to the engine. They get equal billing and provide a double act of what, even today, is rare ability. The P1 actually feels quicker in a straight line than the F1 because the hybrid system fills in all the holes in the torque delivery, providing turbocharged shove with zero lag. It doesn’t sound beautiful like the F1 – in fact, it sounds quite ugly – but it somehow fits the maniacal rate at which it gathers speed. But while you’re conservative with the F1’s entry speed into corners and downright cautious with its brakes, you can treat the P1 almost like a racing car. You can brake from 190mph, feel the carbon brakes shed 100mph like they’re shrugging off a coat and then fling it into a corner while still hard on the stoppers. Try that in the F1 and you’d be in the trees. It has massively more grip yet, despite that, the limit is not something to be carefully skirted as you would in the F1: it’s a place to seek out and enjoy. With proper downforce, active aero, (relatively) modern tyres and one of the world’s most sophisticated suspension systems, the P1 is actually a far easier and more accessible car to drive fast than the F1, and that fact stands as a powerful riposte to the many and varied ways in which the older car proves that not all progress is always in the right direction. But it is the Senna that shows how McLaren hypercar philosophy has evolved over a quarter of a century. The F1 was a pure road car and always intended as such. The P1 is a finely judged balance between road and track and uses its suspension to prove itself very plausible in both environments. But the Senna? I once spent a long day on the road in one and it was thrilling. So, too, was it hard. Really hard. The car is noisy and it is uncomfortable. You never know what reaction you’re going to get when you nail the throttle because you’ll almost always instantly trigger a traction control system so sophisticated that all you usually notice is a reduction in engine power. You can, of course, turn it off but get ready to get busy if you do. More than anything, the Senna feels like a caged beast on the road because, unlike the others here, unless you’re driving it as fast as you can, there’s not much point being on board. And you can’t do that in public. But on the track? Oh my goodness. The Senna is so good it actually makes the P1 feel if not actually clumsy then certainly its age. It feels like a racing car, or as much like a racing car as a street-legal tyre will permit in 2019. Its composure in quick corners is utterly unlike that of any other road car I’ve driven. Its precision, speed and feel at big speeds is simply sublime. If it has a problem, it is only that the car is so much better than its Pirelli Trofeo R tyres, which are themselves state of the art. In high-speed corners, when there’s 800kg of downforce nailing the car to the road, it’s mesmerising, in a different world even from that inhabited by the P1. In the slow stuff, when it can only rely on mechanical grip, there is understeer that needs a degree of management. Happily, being closer in weight to the F1 than the P1 and more chuckable than either, there’s much fun to be had sorting it out. And it is utterly viceless, too. I don’t much like ‘horses for courses’ verdicts, but it seems iniquitous to come up with a one, two, three order for these cars, separated as they are not just in time, but concept, too. While the F1 is entirely established as perhaps the automotive icon of the last generation, neither the Senna nor even the P1 have yet had time to find their place in history, but the progression from road car to track car is clear. How interesting, then, that the next car in McLaren’s Ultimate Series is the Speedtail, a car billed as more luxurious and road oriented even than the F1. So it seems the circle will be complete. Is history about to repeat itself?  No one ever called the F1 a hypercar – at least to my recollection – largely because this exceptionally ugly word was not in remotely common parlance, even if it existed at all. But, in retrospect, was it the first? Probably, although I’d listen to the case for the Jaguar XJ220, which itself produced a quantum leap forward in road car performance only a year before the F1. It took an age – nearly 20 years, in fact – for the standard of street car performance to return to F1 levels, with the likes of the P1, LaFerrari and Porsche 918. But now it seems as though it’s going to leap again. Twenty-five years after the F1, the Aston Martin Valkyrie and Mercedes-Benz Project One may take a similarly long leap forward, however hard that is to imagine. Nor should we forget the T50 of F1 creator Gordon Murray. And then there are the electric cars: the Rimac Concept 2, Pininfarina Battista and Lotus Evija, to name just three. Their plan appears to be to replace the sound and feel of the internal combustion engine with ever increasing amounts of raw power. Quite what 2000bhp feels like in a road car, not to mention quite how or where it will be usable, remains to be seen. This article was originally published on 19 October 2019. We're revisiting it to celebrate the unveiling of the new W1, the successor to the P1 and F1.",

    "description": "Motorists weren't onboard with the idea of registrations plates when they arrived in the early 1900s Nobody today gives a second thought to their car needing registration plates, but initially this was a very unpopular imposition. In 1900, Autocar opined in reply to an article in the County Council Times: “We cannot understand, except on the assumption that autocarists are less amenable to the law than all other of Her Majesty’s liege subjects – which is absurd – why they alone should be chosen for having numbers painted on their vehicles. \"Why should they above all users of the highway be subjected to the indignity of having to bear, as it were, upon their foreheads the mark of Cain?” In 1901, the Automobile Club issued a manifesto signed by 99% of its members to county councils, stating: “English gentlemen have the greatest repugnance to having their private vehicles identified and disfigured by numbers. Enjoy full acccess to the complete Autocar archive at themagazineshop.com \"[This] would be such a departure from the accepted conditions of life in this country that it would lead the public to believe that a man who prefers to use a vehicle propelled by an engine to one drawn by a horse is, in the eyes of the authorities, a person who is likely to misconduct himself. \"The stigma implied would prevent gentlemen from purchasing motor vehicles.” It also hosted police chief constables in London to experience a car and discuss motoring matters. At the time, motorists frequently accused police and magistrates of treating them unfairly – as did Autocar. We even printed maps of police speed traps. Not all the chief constables were in favour of cars being numbered, but a great majority of them were. Captain Drummond opined that “constables were numbered, and motorists must not object if constables gently suggest in return that motorists should be numbered”. Mr Paynton Piggott suggested that “numbering would be an advantage to motorists who were gentlemen and drove with consideration, as it would show that they were not driving in such a way as to make them ashamed of identification”. Lieutenant Colonel Daniell said “steam launches were numbered for the purposes of identification and he could not see why [cars] should not be similarly numbered”. After MPs concluded that motor legislation had become “absolutely ineffective” by 1902, the Automobile Club stated: “It is necessary to accept identification or allow the 12mph limit to remain. Methods of identification would at once secure punishment of the offenders who are now bringing [drivers] generally into the worst repute. The attitude of the authorities gives reason for believing that he who uses his automobile as a gentleman would have no reason to fear that he would be the victim of injustice.” However, many Autocar readers were highly opposed. “The proposal is monstrous. Is my private carriage to appear in the station yard among [the horse-drawn equivalents] of my friends disfigured by a placard proper to a cab? Such a regulation will naturally be considered offensive and derogatory by all quiet and decent people,” protested Bertram Blount. “Motorists who are advocating the affixing of numbers or other conspicuous marks of identification upon private motor cars are not only digging their own graves but sealing the doom of the industry as well,” furthered Leopold Canning. “‘Black-listing’ would have a far greater effect on ‘scorchers’ than the wholesale numbering of cars. If careful and considerate motorists were allowed to drive [unidentified], a large number would advertise that the driver of that car was not a man to be trusted to consider the feelings or safety of other users of the road,” posited Mr G de Freville. An anonymous correspondent was worried about “the perpetual nuisances” of “practical jokers” and “contemptibly nervous old women” reporting his number unjustifiably. “It will be easy to get restrictions passed, but to remove them is the work of a lifetime,” warned another. But of course the police got their way: from 1 January 1904, “every motor car should be registered with the council of a county, and a separate number assigned to each car. The fee will be £1. The car must not be used without its registered number, and the owner will be held responsible for this.”",

    "title": "Correcting the record: When did Autocar's road tests really begin?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/correcting-record-when-did-autocars-road-tests-really-begin",
    "description": "Autocar invented the road test back in 1928 – or did we? We trawl the past to find the true starting point Few phrases illustrate language’s evolution as succinctly as ‘road test’. Free from the constraints of its earlier, literal limitations, nowadays it’s applied to myriad scenarios where products or situations are sampled before making informed decisions about whether they warrant our commitment. Over recent months we have witnessed smartphones, kettles and even databases being subjected to the notion of being ‘road tested’. Denominalisation’s march is relentless. As the road test’s originators, Autocar defined the concept of reviewing cars in an as-standardised-as-possible manner, amplifying its readers’ ability to compare different models’ virtues, or lack of. Combined with the series’ stoic longevity, its worthiness as a focus for a geeky reference work resonated with me, so a couple of years ago I began working on the Road Test Record. Autocar cites 13 April 1928 as its road testing legacy’s commencement, making it the logical point from which to record data. But was it? Mining the online Autocar Archive’s depths confirmed those early Road Tests lacked sequential reference numbers: this development appeared 34 months later, in the 13 February 1931 issue, bearing the number 619. Enjoy full access to the complete Autocar archive at themagazineshop.com That sounded too high, but an editorial explainer confirmed an inconvenient truth: that 619 tally was the post-WW1 total, not only those since spring 1928. Proving the 619 figure’s accuracy is impossible owing to a lack of definitive records, but nevertheless it became a fixed point from which to anchor the research, reasoning the series’ relative newness should prevent extreme discrepancies. Title aside, pre-Road Test road tests employed one of two routes, including Brooklands when availability permitted, and featured stat-laden ‘Data for the Driver’ panels. Scouring all post-Armistice issues, the 27 March 1920 review of Rover’s 8hp was the earliest one to tick all the relevant boxes, although reasonably persuasive cases could be argued for a brace of older examples. Had 618 unnumbered tests been revealed? No – 44 shy. Combining research experience and fortuitous inspiration, I then included models recorded in occasionally published lists of recently tested cars that otherwise hadn’t met the applied criteria. It appeared to be the same methodology used by that 1931 pioneer; for purity’s sake perhaps those 44 shouldn’t be included, but the tally matched Autocar’s. Any harboured hopes of trouble-free research were unceremoniously scuttled by 16 occasions on which the test number skipped hither or thither, not always with subsequent correction. By 17 July 1969, the published tally was a net five short of that calculated – albeit an improvement from briefly being eight out in 1962. Starting from the following week’s issue and continuing for a quarter-century is the Dark Age of Autocar’s Road Test history, with no published tally. Inevitably this fosters conjecture over what should be included, but by maintaining the rationale and following patterns of what was typically regarded as part of the sequence either side of the lengthy numerical void, it was possible to determine how it should have developed. While far from the scale of mental leap required to accept that today’s reborn Ford Capri could have evolved from the lineage that disappeared in 1987, a mindset shift is necessary to absorb the assertion that when reintroduced on 21 September 1994, the Road Test tally of 4081 was 52 short. Eleven further sequence blips registered before 2001’s close, increasing the net deficit to 61. Plaudits to everyone involved since then for maintaining the sequence’s most consistent run. So, does it really matter? When people are involved, despite their very best intentions, mistakes inevitably occur, especially across 100 years of a fast-paced weekly magazine’s storied history. At worst, it creates a degree of inelegance from an editorial standpoint. It would have been advantageous if the origin date was definite, aligning perfectly with an unwavering tally, but those responsible for creating and nurturing the series were rightly concentrating on its success, not chronicling every discussion and decision along the way. Autocar’s Road Tests have always set the standard others can only hope to emulate, and they have generated a trove of automotive data unsurpassed in breadth and legacy. That remains undiminished and worthy of celebration.",

Like the new Bentley Continental GT Speed (with which it shares a platform and a drivetrain), it also becomes a plug-in hybrid. So in a way, it is more company car friendly than before.Clearly, the 37-mile pure-electric range and low on-paper CO2 output aren’t the result of Lamborghini wanting to save the planet.

    "title": "Best-selling cars in the UK of 2024 so far",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/best-selling-cars-uk",
    "description": "Ford Puma has extended its lead atop the UK sales rankings. What could stop it being number one this year? Last year was a positive one for the automotive industry, with the UK experiencing its best year for car sales since the pandemic. More than 1.9 million new cars were registered – but one stood out among the rest. The Ford Puma was the best-selling car in the UK in 2023, becoming the first Ford to top the charts since the Ford Fiesta’s 12-year run ended in 2020.  It fought off stiff competition from the Nissan Qashqai, Vauxhall Corsa and Volkswagen T-Roc to reach the summit. A full eight months into the 2024 and the Puma still reigns supreme, topping the list ahead of its rivals - but only just. The Kia Sportage and Qashqai are hot on its heels.  So, which cars are the top 10 best-sellers in the UK so far? See the year-to-date list below, starting from January 2024 and using data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Best-selling cars in the UK in 2024 1. Ford Puma – 38,944 units Last year's best-selling car is continuing its success in 2024. The compact crossover still impresses us – and new car buyers – with its fun driving dynamics and attractive pricing, as well as the hot Puma STT variant. It may not be the Fiesta we all know and love, but it’s a good, capable alternative nonetheless. It even outsold the Ford Transit and Transit Custom vans, which is no mean feat. The recent facelift has kept things fresh with a new grille and an improved infotainment system, too. Read our Ford Puma review 2. Kia Sportage - 37,582 units The Kia Sportage had a good year in 2023, finishing fourth in the UK sales charts, and it's having an even stronger showing in 2024, hovering close to the very top of the table. Consistency is key for this family SUV, which entered its fifth generation at the tail end of 2022, sporting an eye-catching design, on-trend powertrains and compelling value for money. Read our Kia Sportage review 3. Nissan Qashqai – 32,923 units The Nissan Qashqai was the UK's best-seller in 2022, then it finished 2023 in second place, and it continues to appeal to buyers here with its excellent practicality. The British-built family crossover's appeal has also no doubt been bolstered by the addition of electrified powertrains for its third generation.  Read our Nissan Qashqai review 4. Nissan Juke - 28,727 units The Nissan Juke remains a popular car among UK buyers, having finished 2023 in eighth place. The small SUV went on sale with a brand-new design in 2020, then a facelifted version arrived in the middle of last year, along with hybrid power for the first time. A big sales jump in September continues healthy sales growth: the Juke has moved up four places in two months. Read our Nissan Juke review 5. Volkswagen Golf – 27,454 units The Volkswagen Golf isn’t quite as popular as it once was, but it’s still a top pick for drivers on the hunt for a good all-round family hatchback or estate. In fact, it's slowly creeping its way back up the charts, now sitting in fifth place. This could be a hugely important time for the Golf, which has just gone on sale in facelifted 'Mk8.5' form.  The German stalwart has been kept fresh with a wide-reaching technology update, a design revamp, a more powerful GTI and a longer-range plug-in hybrid, so it could climb higher still.  Read our Volkswagen Golf review  6. Hyundai Tucson - 26,096 units The Hyundai Tucson is one of the UK’s most popular SUVs, having regularly appeared in the top 10 in 2023. It was renewed in 2021 with a fresh front end that featured a unique, eye-catching lighting arrangement. Its plush interior and range of electrified powertrains are also attractive propositions for many Brits. Read our Hyundai Tucson review 7. Audi A3 - 24,957 units The Audi A3 is one of just three cars on this list that isn't an SUV, which makes us feel slightly sad. Its popularity remains strong, and it even outsold the Volkswagen Golf, its Volkswagen Group sibling, last year.  Updated in 2024, the A3 is certainly worthy of its spot in the top 10, offering a comfortable ride and good body control, plus a plush, roomy interior. The fact that it's also substantially cheaper than the rival Mercedes-Benz A-Class also helps its case. Read our Audi A3 Sportback review 8. Volkswagen Polo - 23,758 Despite its price (and size) increasing over the years, the Volkswagen Polo is a still a brilliant small car. It's comfortable, refined, well-built and spacious, while also offering some of the best economy rates in the class. The latest version is the best to drive yet and is packed with technology. But how long will it stick around for? That we're not sure of, so make the most of it before it goes the way of the Ford Fiesta.  Read our Volkswagen Polo review  9. Tesla Model Y - 23,495 The Tesla Model Y is a seriously popular electric car. It finished 2023 as Europe's best-selling car overall, which is a seriously impressive feat after such a short time on sale. A recent update gave it more range (up to 373 miles) while retaining its spacious interior and excellent performance. Its ride still isn't the best, though, and its interior will be liked or loathed, depending on how button-averse you might be.  Read our Tesla Model Y review 10. MG HS - 23,115 The MG HS offers class-leading value for money, and it entered a second generation this year, putting it in line for even more mainstream success in 2024 and beyond. Available with a petrol engine or a more frugal plug-in hybrid, the family crossover also comes with good levels of equipment as standard, including a 10.1in touchscreen, a 360deg parking camera and smartphone mirroring.  Read our MG HS review",

    "title": "Diesel demand more than EVs for private buyers in September",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/diesel-demand-more-evs-private-buyers-september",
    "description": "New car sales figures and waning EV market prompt call for urgent government support amid “serious concerns” Demand from private buyers for diesel cars was more than for EVs in September, leading industry bosses to renew calls for urgent government support amid “serious concerns” that a waning electric car market “is putting environmental ambitions at risk”. During the month, private diesel sales increased 17.1% compared with September 2023 – a volume uplift of 1367 cars – which was in contrast to the powertrain's 7% year-on-year sales drop. Private EV demand also rose – driven by “unprecedented” mandate-chasing manufacturer discounting -  albeit by only 3.6%, equivalent to just 410 additional registrations.  This rise comes despite a record month for EV sales, which increased 36.8% year on year to 56,387 sales - 76% of which were made by fleets.  “September’s record EV performance is good news, but look under the bonnet and there are serious concerns as the market is not growing quickly enough to meet mandated targets,” said Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) boss Mike Hawes. Those mandated targets reference the UK government's new emissions regulations that will heavily fine car makers if they fail to meet a 22% EV sales mix – a figure that will rise each year.  Hawes added: “Despite manufacturers spending billions on both product and market support – support that the industry cannot sustain indefinitely – market weakness is putting environmental ambitions at risk and jeopardising future investment.  “While we appreciate the pressures on the public purse, the chancellor must use the forthcoming Budget to introduce bold measures on consumer support and infrastructure to get the transition back on track, and with it the economic growth and environmental benefits we all crave.” Ahead of new chancellor Rachel Reeves' Budget later this month, the SMMT and “12 major manufacturers” have called for: temporarily halving VAT on new EV purchases; scrapping the VED ‘expensive car’ tax supplement for EVs; equalising VAT on public charging to match the 5% home-charging rate; and maintaining and extending business incentives. Overall, the UK new car market bounced back following a lacklustre August, recording the best figure for a September in post-Covid Britain. In what is always a bumper month for the market, given the arrival of new registration plates (now '74’), 275,239 cars were sold, according to SMMT figures. This represents a slight rise (1%) on 2023’s 272,610, but is still 20% down on pre-Covid 2019. So far this year, 1,514,094 cars have been sold, up 4.3% on the same point in 2023.",

    "description": "World's best-selling car receives an improved battery in entry-level form for a 373-mile range The car industry had never seen a rise like that of Tesla and probably never will see another. Just a decade ago, this was a new firm introducing a car with a novel propulsion method and minimal supporting infrastructure. Today, it’s the maker of the world’s best-selling car: the Model Y.Rivals never rest, though, and so for 2024 Tesla has replaced the 60kWh battery in the single-motor version of its electric crossover. We think it’s the 75kWh pack from the AWD Long Range but Tesla always refuses to discuss capacity, annoyingly.Whatever it is, it has increased the starting price slightly from £44,990 to £46,990 but enhanced the official range from 283 miles right up to 373 miles (or 351 miles on the bigger alloys), with official efficiency remaining at 4.0mpkWh.Meanwhile, the Long Range All Wheel Drive (£52,990, 331 miles) and Performance All Wheel Drive (£59,990, 319 miles) remain as they were – as does the rest of the entry-level package, now named the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive.The Tesla Model Y line-up at a glanceThe Model Y was launched in the UK with two dual-motor versions only: the Long Range and the Performance. In 2023, a cheaper rear-wheel-drive model was added to the range – and now in 2024, it has been upgraded.There are no trim levels; the Model Y just comes with lots of equipment as standard.EnginesPowerLong Range Rear Wheel Drive342bhpLong Range All Wheel Drive389bhpPerformance All Wheel Drive426bhpThe Model Y competes in an increasingly crowded corner of the market: the mid-size electric SUV class. In terms of size and practicality, it goes toe to toe with EVs such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Audi Q4 E-tron and Stellantis's new Leapmotor C10.There's a choice of two power outputs, and even the entry-level RWD model packs a hefty 342bhp, which is good for a claimed 0-60mph time of 5.9sec. Move up to the Performance and this benchmark figure tumbles to a supercar-humbling 3.5sec, thanks to its muscular 426bhp output.Thanks to the instant torque and high-revving nature of an electric motor, there’s no need for multiple ratios, as in an ICE car. However, the gearing used for the front and rear motors in AWD Model Ys is slightly different, with one having a shorter ratio for acceleration and the other slightly longer for more efficient high-speed cruising.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/renault-embleme-revealed-hydrogen-coup%C3%A9-suv-2030",
    "description": "Cameras are integrated into the wings to reduce drag Striking concept car is a 4.8m-long coupé SUV claimed to emit 90% less carbon over its lifetime than today's Captur The new Renault Embleme concept shows how hydrogen fuel cell technology could offer long-range transport while emitting 90% fewer lifetime emissions than today’s petrol Captur and even 80% fewer emissions than the Megane BEV. The follow-up to the Scenic Vision, it’s powered by a similar hydrogen-fuelled range-extender powertrain, pairing a 30kW fuel cell with a nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) battery.  Unlike the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai Nexo, whose batteries are smaller than 2kWh, the Emblème is designed to minimise the use of its fuel cell. Battery power is used around town, while hydrogen is consumed to refill its reserves as needed. Renault said the system would allow the Emblème to do 1000km (621 miles) in the same time as a current ICE car, assuming two five-minute stops to brim the 2.8kg hydrogen tank. It added that on a journey from Paris to Marseille (think Aberdeen to London), some 75% of the electricity used would come from hydrogen. While the Embleme is officially a concept, it is built on the Ampr Medium platform used for the Megane and Scenic BEVs. The Scenic was first revealed as a hydrogen concept before the production version, so it is possible a production version of the Embleme could eventually arrive with an electric powertrain. It’s powered by a single electric motor mounted on the rear axle, which puts out 215bhp. Renault claims that the Emblème weighs 1750kg, making it around 100kg lighter than the Scenic. Aerodynamics were prioritised in the design, with Renault borrowing methods and equipment from the Alpine Formula 1 team. Cameras replace drag-inducing mirrors, for example, while the underside is sealed flat and has an active diffuser. To that end, Renault claims a drag coefficient of 0.25 – markedly better than the Megane’s 0.29.  The sum of the developments is a lifetime carbon emissions figure of five tonnes, down from the 24-tonne forecast for the Megane and 49 tonnes for the petrol Captur. The Emblème will make its debut at next week’s Paris motor show, albeit without an interior.  Renault said that its EV development arm Ampere will unveil the car “in full” at the end of October.",

    "description": "The iconic hot hatch took on a harder edge with its eighth generation, at the expense of its intoxicating blend of everyday performance. Can this facelift make it a better GTI? The new Volkswagen Golf GTI is not electric and it’s not a hybrid, not even a mild one.In fact, it seems to carry on in much the same way it has done for nearly 50 years, being a simple but sensible take on the hot hatch that’s received incremental, pointed updates with every new generation and mid-cycle facelift. Viewed logically, this latest GTI should be the best there has yet been.Of course, the ‘new’ Golf GTI isn’t entirely new. The Mk8.5 is the updated version of the Mk8, which arrived in 2021 to hardly universal acclaim. It suffered from the Mk8 Golf’s general cabin tech problems, as well as a suspension tune that was uncharacteristically hardcore for what has always been a more grown-up take on the hot hatch.A face-off with the Toyota Corolla and Peugeot 308 showed that the standard Golf has returned to the top of the class – even if the Corolla won on penalties. Can the GTI manage the same?",

    "title": "Skoda: Tariffs on Chinese EVs will have ‘no effect’",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-electric-vehicles/skoda-tariffs-chinese-evs-will-have-no-effect",
    "description": "Skoda's new Elroq EV is priced to compete with Chinese rivals Czech company’s sales and marketing chief warns China will just set up shop in Europe Any tariffs on Chinese electric cars will have “no effect” in slowing their march into the European market, Skoda’s sales and marketing chief has warned. The EU will today vote to make the temporary tariffs on Chinese manufacturers – including BYD, Chery (owner of Omoda and Jaecoo), Geely (owner of Lotus, Polestar, Smart and Volvo) and SAIC (owner of MG) – permanent.  Currently, SAIC is charged an extra 37.6% on the wholesale price of imported EVs on top of the 10% that it was already required to pay, BYD is charged an extra 17.4% and Geely is hit with an extra 19.9%.  “We don’t think that the tariffs can solve the situation,” Martin Jahn told Autocar at the unveiling of the new Skoda Elroq EV.  He called on the EU to instead follow the Chinese government’s example and fund its home-grown car makers to develop better products. Jahn said: “The Chinese have provided very strong support to [their] automotive industry over the last 15-20 years, and I lived in China myself for four years, so I've seen that – and it's working. “If Europe wants to go electric or CO2-neutral, it should support its [automotive] industry. It's much better to support the industry to be competitive, to have great products, and then compete on the market with the Chinese.” Jahn suggested that the most useful things the EU could do for the industry would be to reduce the cost of energy and to guarantee access to raw materials. He added that the tariffs will have “no effect” because “the Chinese will come anyway, build factories here and sell cars that are produced in Europe”.  Indeed, several major players in the Chinese market have already moved to set up European production bases. BYD was previously linked to the Ford Focus factory in Saarlouis, Germany, and has since announced that it's building a plant in Szeged, Hungary. “[Tariffs] are going to be temporary damage for BYD,” the firm's special European advisor Alfredo Altavilla recently told Autocar. “In less than a year from now, we will become officially a European manufacturer.\" In April, Chery created a joint venture with Spanish firm EV Motors to move into a former Nissan factory in Barcelona. Meanwhile, Leapmotor has started production of the T03 city car alongside the Alfa Romeo Junior, Fiat 600e and Jeep Avenger at Stellantis’s plant in Tychy, Poland. And Volvo will next year begin production of the EX30 in Ghent, Belgium – although it officially said this was to boost output to meet expected demand, rather than to work around tariffs.  Jahn suggested that the EU’s member states should also introduce greater incentives for electric car buyers. “Europe [is saying] people can buy only this technology without supporting it,” he said. He added that Skoda was sacrificing its profit margin on the Elroq to ensure it can compete with Chinese rivals and therefore comply with its 2025 fleet emissions target. “I admit that this is not the most profitable car in our line-up, and we just have to work on the costs, especially on the battery costs, to make the electric cars more profitable in the future,” Jahn said.  “Private customers are hesitating, and we hope that with this car we can persuade them, because there is no difference in price between this car and the Karoq, which is its combustion-engine equivalent. So we hope that this car will move more people towards electric.” BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Skoda owner the Volkswagen Group have all spoken up against the EU's introduction of tariffs on Chinese EVs. Stellantis chief Carlos Tavares is reported to have called the tariffs a “trap”, adding that European firms should “try to be Chinese ourselves”.",

    "title": "Why Ford's European design chief isn't bothered by Capri backlash",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/business-corporate/why-fords-european-design-chief-isnt-bothered-capri-backlash",
    "description": "Ford imagined a lineage from the original Capri through to the new car Amko Leenarts has shouldered criticism of the new Capri – and likes how much conversation it's generated It's easy for high-ranking executives to isolate themselves from more granular public feedback towards their models, but for designers there can be no hiding place. Few of them need to be more in tune with public perception than Ford of Europe design boss Amko Leenarts, who is trying to change so much of what we know about the brand while at the same time bringing back revered nameplates. From “the death knell of Ford” to “sign me up! I can’t wait to be a Capri owner again”, these were the extremes of views just on our own letters page when the new Capri was revealed a few weeks ago. I met Leenarts at the Car of the Year ‘Tannistest’ in Denmark, wearing a bright yellow Capri jacket and matching yellow trainers. “You have to live it!” he says. His exposure to the reaction culminated in the car being taken to a Capri owners’ group meeting. “Out of 30 or so of them, two wanted to order one on the spot,” he adds buoyantly. “If that’s the percentage of the hardcore…” Ford has followed the reaction closely, not just reading it but looking at the profiles of those making the comments online. Older blokes seem to make up the majority of the ‘nay’ camp. “But that’s okay,” says Leenarts, eyes smiling and the outline from his tin hat not quite visible. Comments from the other 28 members of the Capri owners’ club and also the “harsh” crowd at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where the car made its public debut, are clearly still fresh in his mind. “Every time we have people spend time with the car, there’s a flip,” he says. “Some people still might say ‘it’s not a real Capri’ and have the last word on it, but it’s quite balanced in the end.” Part of that design process involved tracking the Capri’s theoretical successors, and Ford imagined a lineage that showed how it would have evolved into today’s car anyway (see the video, below). Obviously that’s conjecture, yet the early decision to call the new car Capri, plus that retrospective design process, shows there’s more to this than a marketing exercise – but it’s clearly no bad thing if everyone is talking about you. “It spurs a lot of conversation,” continues Leenarts. “We like it. We love the passion about it. There are positives, negatives, but at least there is no ‘it looks like another car’.” That said, there were those who said it looked like a Polestar 2, something Leenarts brings up himself unprompted: “I was talking to a guy from Polestar only yesterday. He said: ‘Can I say something?’ I’m like, now it’s coming… But he said to me now he’s seen it in the flesh, it doesn’t look like a Polestar.” Leenarts waves his hands in the air: “Thank you!”",

    "title": "Hyundai Inster is 229-mile city car for £23,495",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hyundai-inster-229-mile-city-car-%C2%A323495",
    "description": "Inster measures 3.8m long, 1.6m wide and 1.6m tall Korean brand aims to broaden appeal of electric cars with new miniature four-seater Hyundai is gearing up for an assault on the mainstream electric car market with the new Inster, priced from £23,495 – or £249 per month on PCP finance. It's based on the Hyundai Casper, a diminutive city car that has so far been sold exclusively with a petrol engine in Korea. Its platform has been stretched by 230mm (with a 180mm of that growth in its wheelbase), improving both practicality and the available space for an underfloor battery pack. The Inster measures 3.8m long, 1.6m wide and 1.6m tall, which positions it between the Dacia Spring and the Citroën ë-C3. Despite the car's smaller footprint, Hyundai insiders are confident that the Inster is as practical as its five-seat rivals, thanks to its efficient packaging and configurable interior. Its wheelbase almost matches that of the larger Hyundai i20, for example, and its four seats are more versatile than those in traditional hatchbacks. Each can be folded completely flat and the two rear seats are also capable of sliding and reclining to open up more leg room or boot space as it’s needed.  The Inster will be offered with two mechanical configurations at launch. Entry-level cars get a 96bhp front-mounted motor that delivers a 0-62mph sprint time of 11.7sec and a top speed of 87mph. It’s paired with a 42kWh battery pack, which is claimed to deliver a range of 186 miles between charges. The flagship ‘long range’ Inster is boosted to 113bhp and 49kWh, taking its range to 217 miles and its top speed to 93mph, while reducing its 0-62mph time to 10.6sec. Both versions use the nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry and all Insters get a heat pump and 85kW (DC) charging capabilities as standard. Although those specifications place the Inster roughly on a par with its classmates, Hyundai believes that it will stand out for its interior connectivity and on-board technologies. Inside, all versions get a pair of 10.25in digital displays (an instrument panel and an infotainment touchscreen), and you can use your smartphone as a ‘key’ to unlock and start the car.  The Inster also gets Hyundai’s full suite of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including a 360deg parking camera, adaptive cruise control and the Korean brand’s novel blindspot monitoring system, which projects a camera image of your rear quarter view onto the instrument panel as you indicate. Deliveries of the Inster are set to start by next spring. UK customers will be offered both battery options and two trim levels, named 01 and 02. Kit including the digital instrument panel, infotainment touchscreen, rear-view camera and automatic headlights are standard. However, to get the sliding rear bench, flat-folding front seats or LED headlights you have to opt for 02 trim, priced from £26,745. “We believe we will start electrification not only for the early adopters but for the mass market,” said Paolo Gnerro, product planning manager for Hyundai Motor Europe. He explained that the company is targeting two new types of customers with the Inster: “very young”, potentially buying their first new cars; and “empty-nesters – families with kids already [moved out of] home, mainly in their 50s”, who want a second car for running errands. Gnerro added that he believed the Inster would operate outside the traditional size-bound segments, pointing to changing customer behaviours with EVs. He explained: “They were not saying 'this is a 3.8m car; it’s A-segment'. They were segmenting the cars depending on the range, no matter the size of the car. For them, a 350km-range [217-mile] car is comparable to another 350km car, no matter what the size is.”",

    "title": "Can Polestar's new management finally right the ship?",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-corporate/polestar-hopes-it-has-scared-2024-bad-news-bears",
    "description": "Sales of the Polestar 2 have fallen Appointment of a former CFO to lead the start-up tells all about its situation but there's hope on the horizon Polestar’s announcement in August that it was switching CEOs provided a window on the ailing condition of the electric car start-up spun out of Volvo.  The CVs of the two CEOs were instructive. Out went former design boss Thomas Ingenlath and in came former chief financial officer Michael Lohscheller.  Ingenlath had been promoted from his role as head of design of Volvo in 2017 to form a new electric subsidiary with aesthetics at its core. Seven years on, Polestar products have the looks and quality to match those of a mature car company. But as the appointment of industry veteran Lohscheller suggests, the company’s finances are as bad as any start-up's. Lohscheller, former CFO and then CEO of Opel, has become a go-to guy for embattled start-ups looking for solid guidance from an wily old industry hand. Since leaving Opel in 2021, he spent seven months as global CEO of Vietnamese brand Vinfast, then 19 months as president and CEO of infamous fuel cell hopeful Nikola.  Lohscheller’s fast cycling between jobs suggests he’s either become a short-term turnaround specialist or didn’t gel with those particular start-ups. Either way, he’s got insight into both ends of the automotive spectrum. Polestar has suffered as badly as any electric start-up without actually hitting the buffers, Fisker-style. It got so bad that in February, Volvo decided it had to reduce its financial exposure to Polestar by cutting its stake from 48% to 18% and handing over the balance of shares to parent Geely. Then in May, Polestar received a deficiency notice from New York tech-focused stock exchange Nasdaq for not having filed its annual report for the previous year on time. It eventually filed in mid-August, showing a net loss of $1.2 billion (£0.9bn) on revenue of $2.4bn (£1.8bn). Sales of its single vehicle – the 2 electric saloon - have fallen, even in the UK where it competes in the EV-friendly corporate market. Registrations to the end of August in 2024 stood at 3863, down from 8981 the year before. More bad news followed in July, when Polestar received a warning that its shares had fallen below the minimum $1 worth and faced delisting from Nasdaq. In August, the company’s value based on its share price was just $1.14bn (£0.87bn), down from a high in 2022 of more than $21bn (£16bn). “Material uncertainty about Polestar's ability to continue as a going concern persists,” the company said in its delayed financial report. Polestar could have fallen into the same doom spiral as Fisker but it is far more fortunate in that it benefits from the support and influence of parent Geely. In February, Polestar announced that it had secured $950 million (£725m) in funding from a range of international banks, keeping the money flowing until such time as it can reliably generate its own.  It also took the chance to shake up its leadership, both executive and non-executive. Along with the exit of Ingenlath, Polestar announced the retirement of chairman Håkan Samuelsson, a former CEO of Volvo, and installed in his place former Skoda CEO and ex-VW heavyweight Winfried Vahland. Meanwhile, a new chief financial officer, Jean-François Mady, was appointed from Stellantis. The company has also been cutting costs in part by reducing headcount by 500 last year through the means of a hiring freeze. That might not sound a lot compared with, say, Volkswagen but Polestar has only 2523 employees, according to the annual report. The reason Polestar has so few workers is that it runs what Geely calls an ‘asset light’ model, whereby it pays other Geely group companies to develop platforms and technology, and also build its cars. Geely group brands tend to have a speciality when it comes to vehicle development, which they can then use to offset their bills by selling to other parts of the company. Polestar’s 650-strong development team, for example, focuses on bonded aluminium architectures, high-power electric motors, bi-directional compatible battery packs and in-car software development. Meanwhile, Polestar pays Volvo to build its new Polestar 3 large SUV, and Zeekr to build the new Polestar 4 coupé-SUV in China. It also pays a licence fee to use Geely platforms, such as Geely’s PMA-1 platform and GEEA2.0 electrical architecture for the 4. The upcoming Polestar 5 sports saloon, planned for 2025, will use Zeekr's new ZEEA2.5 architecture. Theoretically, this method cuts Polestar’s development bill and speeds up the creation of new models. The access to Geely’s global network means it can dodge tariff-related problems that other Chinese rivals such as Nio and Xpeng can’t yet – for example, making the 3 in Volvo’s US plant and eventually the Renault-Geely factory in South Korea for the 4. Polestar appears to be turning a corner. Shares in the company rose in early September to levels not seen for a year, valuing Polestar at the end of September around three times its August figure. On 17 September, Polestar announced it had been told by Nasdaq that the share price was high enough to lift the threat of delisting. Perhaps the biggest boost for the brand is that it now sells three models instead of just one. The pricier 4 and 3 will help cement the brand’s premium positioning, albeit one that brings the likes of Porsche into the competitor pool, along with BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz. The company is targeting positive cash flow (a measure of profitability) for late next year.  Polestar is not about to run out of cash, with the $950m injection earlier this year as well as Volvo’s promise to extend its credit facility to the company to $1bn to the end of 2028. Geely’s network of companies, meanwhile, continue to innovate in platforms, electric tech and manufacturing. Geely’s heft should also secure Polestar good deals on batteries. With the new management team in place, Polestar can now cross the bridge “from a start-up to an established, leading player”, outgoing chair Samuelsson said in August. In doing so, it’ll be hoping the bad news bears of 2024 will have been soundly chased away.",

    "title": "How BMW driver Simon is rethinking electric range",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advertising-promotions-promoted-by-bmw/how-bmw-driver-simon-rethinking-electric-range",
    "description": "The tech in BMW’s electric models has been engineered to put you in charge. That’s why, for BMW iX driver Simon, range isn’t a worry For drivers thinking about making the switch and going electric, it’s often range anxiety – worrying about how far an electric car can go, and whether it will run out of charge before you get there – that is one of the early concerns. As BMW iX driver Simon explains, it’s a fear with little foundation. “Range, it’s always range, whenever you talk to people,” he says. “Obviously, people still do have this range anxiety thing. But, I think, the range doesn’t need to be your issue for not having an electric car.  “We’re a fully electric family, travelling all over the country, and we’ve never struggled with it. We use our electric vehicles on daily commutes to work, the school run. We’ve got family that are spread out all over the country, so we use it for visiting them. We go down on holiday to the south coast where we tow our boat down there.  “So, we use it for everything, really. It’s a mindset change, but it’s something you get used to. And actually, in the long run, it turns out to be easier.” Watch the video above – or read on – to learn more. Learn more about BMW’s electric line-up More range than you think So, how does an all-electric BMW help drivers tackle long journeys with confidence? Well, first and foremost, today’s all-electric BMWs have more range than you might expect.  BMW has long been a leader in electric car design – spearheading the development of ever-better more-advanced next-generation powertrains, with batteries and motors that are being constantly developed to offer more range, more power and enhanced efficiency. As a result, BMW now offers a comprehensive fast-growing line-up of all-electric saloons, estates and SUVs to meet every taste and need – all of which offer plenty of range.  It starts with the sporty BMW iX2 SUV coupé which offers up to 283 miles (WLTP)[1] – enough to get you from Birmingham to Bristol and back on one charge. At the top of the tree is the BMW i7, which offers up to 387 miles (WLTP) of range[1]. That could get you from London to the Lake District on one charge. It’s not just range; it’s how you use it It’s not just how much range you have that matters, though. It’s how you use it. When it comes to day-to-day journeys, for example, we don’t drive nearly as far as we think. In fact, the typical daily mileage for the average UK driver is at most somewhere between 20 to 40 miles[2]. So, any of BMW’s all-electric models could easily cover a healthy batch of days doing work commutes, school runs, trips to the shops, or evenings out with family and friends without needing to use public charging. Equally, since most journeys start and end at home, you can take advantage of the fact that your car will spend a large portion of its time parked up – particularly overnight when you’re not using it anyway. That’s perfect for home charging on lower-cost overnight energy rates that let you start every journey each morning with maximum range at the lowest possible cost, with minimum time and effort. Effectively, it’s like having a petrol station in your house, ensuring you start every journey with a full – or nearly full – electric ‘tank’. A different way to look at long journeys So, that’s short day-to-day journeys sorted. But what about long journeys? Well, as we’ve highlighted, all of the models in BMW’s electric line-up offer more than enough range to do big journeys without worry. But, as Simon points out, who does a journey that long without taking a break? “People say that a car needs to cover 400 to 500 miles to be useful for travelling, but you never really have to do 500 miles in one stint,” he explains. Instead, it’s using natural breaks in your journey to incorporate short bursts of rapid and ultra-rapidtop-up charging at service stations on major UK routes[3] – something electric converts call ‘grazing’ – before finding a more cost-effective and time-effective ‘destination charging’ option at your final halt.  “You start the journey in the morning: wake up, car’s full, unplug it. You are travelling a couple of hundred miles – at which point you probably need to stop for a toilet break or something to eat,” Simon says “So, you go off and do that while your car is charging. 20 minutes later, we come back, jump in the car, and we’ve got another 100 miles of range[3] and we’re off down to the final destination. I think it’s not hard work to travel with an electric vehicle; it’s just a different way of using your time.” More chargers than you think But this brings us to the second part of range anxiety. It isn’t solely the capabilities of an all-electric car. It’s also concern about the capability of the charging network. Are there enough chargers – and enough rapid and ultra-rapid chargers – for us all to keep moving?  Well, according to zap-map.com, as of June 2024 there were over 64,000 devices at 33,800 UK locations. And the network continues to grow fast, with around 2,200 new devices added in June 2024 alone. The way the network has been laid out also makes real sense. Around 20% of chargers are 50kW+ rapid chargers and 150kW+ ultra-rapid chargers that add a lot of miles in short periods of time. These tend to be located at motorway service stations and petrol stations on major A-road routes, where drivers want to do a quick top-up around coffee and lunch breaks. BMW has even made accessing the UK’s fast-growing charging network even easier with BMW Charging. It’s an account with simple tariffs that give you easy one-card access to over 36,000 UK chargers and over 769,000 chargers across Europe – all without having to juggle multiple charging accounts and multiple charging cards, while offering the opportunity to take advantage of preferential rates with selected suppliers.[5]  “The charging infrastructure is good enough for you not to have to worry about it – especially with the charging infrastructure that BMW have coupled up with,” says Simon. “On a major route like this, there are always chargers to go to, and there’s generally destination chargers when you get to your end point.” Smart BMW tech that makes it all easy  So, BMW’s all-electric cars offer more than enough range to do most journeys – short and long. And there are probably more chargers than you might think. But BMW has also focused on how smart always-online connected technology can make navigating all-electric journeys even easier and smarter. The in-car BMW Maps on BMW’s all-electric models uses always-online cloud-based Connected Navigation with Connected Charging and Connected Parking. It can dynamically plot your perfect route: seamlessly syncing the latest real-time traffic information with the best, fastest or most cost-effective charging solutions – whether it’s ultra-rapid chargers on your route or charging options near your destination where you can park your vehicle and charge at a slower, more cost-effective rate. Thanks to the always-online connectivity of all-electric BMWs, they also sync seamlessly with the My BMW App on your smartphone. That means you can view your battery’s range and your car’s charging status remotely from anywhere – whether it’s the comfort of your sofa when your car is plugged into a home charger, or while you’re grabbing a coffee while your car is plugged into a public charger.[4] That helps you control the time and cost of charging. You can even pre-condition your car’s interior while it’s charging, meaning you don’t waste a minute of your time or any of your valuable range ensuring your car is at the right temperature – whether cool or warm – for the next leg of your journey. You can also plan your journey remotely using the My BMW App before syncing it seamlessly with the BMW Maps system in your vehicle. As Simon explains, it all works seamlessly, putting you in charge. “I don’t ever plan a route. I’ll just jump in the car. The BMW will know you’ve left with this amount of charge, it is this far. So, it will start planning your route via charging stations and it will indicate how long you’ll need to be at those charging stations. So, it really takes all the effort out of you having to think about it.” Learn more about BMW’s electric line-up [1] Battery electric vehicle require mains electricity for charging.

    "description": "The Renault 5 is back as a modern recreation of a small car legend – this time, with electric power It’s been almost four years since Renault boss Luca de Meo outlined his 'Renaulution' plan to lift the brand's desirability (and profitability) with a range of new models reimagining some of its much-loved icons from the past.At the heart of it all was a stunning remake of the Renault 5. The brand hopes this returning supermini can do what the original R5 did by bringing affordable mobility to France, but this time using electric power. A starting price of around £23,000 is expected. In business and style terms, the idea is that the new R5 does for Renault what the 500 did for Fiat and Mini did for BMW.The concept version of the 5 looked incredible, and thankfully the production car has fully retained that ‘want’ factor in visual terms despite an expedited development. When something looks that good, you really want it to drive well – and now is a good time to say the reborn 5 truly has been worth the wait.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/kia/ev6",
    "description": "Low-key facelift aims to keep fashionable electric family SUV near the top of the pile Until not long ago, trailblazing electric cars from Kia and Hyundai weren't very exciting. They’ve looked like their conventional counterparts (which was entirely the point), they left keen drivers a little cold and, other than in the broadest sense, they didn’t pioneer any new technology. But the Kia EV6 represented the marque shifting gears with its EV line-up and leaving behind the compromises of platforms that need to also accommodate an engine.Since launching just three years ago, it has sold more than 210,000 units worldwide - and while cheaper alternatives from the likes of Volkswagen, Skoda and Tesla have a bigger share of the UK market, the sheer number of them you see on the road is testament to its popularity. It seems like only recently that we were first getting aquainted with this futuristic saloon-coupé-SUV-fastback, but such is the unrelenting pace of progress in this industry that Kia has already seen fit to treat it to a round of updates.The aim is mostly to bring it into line, technically and visually, with the newer Kia EV9 flagship SUV - and EVs 3, 4 and 5 that will follow over the coming months. But surely bosses will have been nervously mopping their brow as a tidal wave of rivals launched over the past couple of years with comparable charging speeds, ranges and material quality - so there will be an element of attempting to recapture a competitive edge here, too.Plus, like all distinctively styled 'mass-market' cars, the EV6 has become something of a victim of its own popularity, and has arguably lost a smidge of the visual drama that got us all talking when it was revealed, so what harm can zhuzhing up the design do?Not that this is one of the more dramatic facelifts. The Kia EV6’s face has indeed been lifted (full-width light bar, redesigned headlights, tweaked splitter), but that’s your best bet for immediately distinguishing the latest version of this big-selling family EV from the original, aside from the new wheel designs, colour options and even less obviously fettled rear end.The headline of this update, though, is an increase in usable battery capacity from 77.4kWh to 84kWh, giving the most efficient EV6 a commendable official range of 361 miles and making it comfortably one of the longest-range electric crossovers on sale. Charging speed is up a touch, too, from a 239kW maximum to 258kW, theoretically allowing a 10-80% top-up in just 18 minutes.Throw in some subtle but noticeable changes to the cabin and a few technical enhancements, too, and there's reason to suspect that the ever-changing electric SUV market is once again destined for a bit of a shake-up.",

    "title": "Big price cuts for electric Vauxhall Corsa and Astra",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/big-price-cuts-electric-vauxhall-corsa-and-astra",
    "description": "Vauxhall has taken up to £4675 off the electric Astra and £4150 off the top-spec Corsa Nearly £5000 off a top-rung Astra Electric as the brand seeks to make its EVs more affordable Vauxhall is continuing its push to make its electric cars more affordable by slashing the prices of the Astra and Corsa EVs.  The biggest cut is for the range-topping Ultimate-trim version of the Astra Sports Tourer, which has been reduced by £4765 to £40,695. The electric estate’s entry-level trim, Griffin, now starts from £36,195, down by £1000. Meanwhile, the Astra Electric hatchback has been discounted by up to £3865, with the Ultimate trim falling to £39,385. The middle-rung Design and GS versions have been reduced by £2850 and £2905 respectively, while Griffin remains priced from £34,995. Similarly, the Corsa Electric’s starting price is unchanged, at £26,895 – making it one of the UK’s cheapest electric cars – but the more costly grades have received big reductions. Design and GS are £3400 and £2850 cheaper respectively, while range-topping Ultimate has been reduced by £4150. The cuts come shortly after Vauxhall announced that the new Frontera SUV would be priced identically in petrol and electric form, from £23,495. In April, it also reduced the starting price of the Mokka Electric by £7115 to £29,495. Vauxhall managing director James Taylor recently told Autocar that “optics” were a key issue in the battle to boost electric car sales. Referring to the public reaction surrounding the top-rung Corsa’s previous price of £38,585, he said: “One of the challenges we have all faced with electric vehicles is that you end up with a comparison between a [74bhp] base-spec car and a [154bhp] long-range [EV].  “It’s a bit like back in the day when you would have Design as the entry to the range and a [sporting] VXR with 150bhp, but you wouldn’t expect those two things to be the same price. “But obviously in the optics of how people compare and contrast, it does make electric look very expensive. And that’s why we launched the Yes special edition [EV at £26,840].” Meanwhile, Ford of Britain managing director Lisa Brankin has called for VAT on electric cars to be halved because “we are not seeing customer demand for EVs”. Brankin added: “We need incentives to drive demand in the consumer market.”",

    "title": "UK fuel prices falling as oil drops in value",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/consumer/uk-fuel-prices",
    "description": "Petrol dropped by an average of 6.47p per litre during September, according to the RAC Fuel prices fell by 6.5p last month and are set to continue on a downward trajectory, according to the RAC. Petrol cost 134.79p per litre on average at the end of September, down from 141.26ppl at the start of the month. This means that filling up a car with a 55-litre fuel tank is now £3.56 less expensive than it was at the start of September. Diesel, meanwhile, fell from 146.00ppl to 139.5ppl over the same period, meaning a 55-litre fill-up is now £3.58 cheaper. The RAC attributed the reduction to the drop in the price of a barrel of crude oil, from $78 (£59) at the start of September to $72 (£54) by the end. It added that wholesale prices for petrol and diesel currently stand at 99ppl and 103ppl respectively, indicating that retail prices may fall even further. “With analysts predicting oil may continue to fall on the back of a weakened global economy and Saudi Arabia upping its output to regain lost market share, the immediate future on the UK’s forecourts looks considerably brighter for drivers,” said Simon Williams, the RAC’s head of policy. What determines the price of fuel? The price of petrol and diesel you buy at the pump is largely determined by the wholesale price of Brent crude oil.  However, fluctuations in the price of this can take weeks to filter through to the forecourts. The price of crude oil has gone up nearly $12 per barrel since the start of July 2023 to around $96 in October and now fallen to around $78. The long-term cost of petrol In July 2023, a major report from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that drivers paid on average 6p per litre (ppl) more for fuel in 2022 as supermarkets took advantage of weakened competition and inflated pump prices. CMA chief Sarah Cardell, who said supermarkets were usually the cheapest place to buy fuel and market anchors, said the rising of prices would have had “a greater impact on vulnerable people, particularly those in areas with less choice of fuel stations.” The report found the rise was instigated by Asda  – which was also fined £60,000 for not co-operating fully with the CMA investigation – and Morrisons, the two cheapest fuel sellers, which last year each made the decision to target higher margins.  Asda’s fuel margin target in 2023 was more than three times what it had been for 2019, while Morrisons doubled its margin target in the same period.  Other retailers, including Sainsbury’s and Tesco, didn't respond “in the way you would expect in a competitive market” and “instead raised their prices in line with these changes”, the CMA found. “Taken together, this indicates that competition has weakened and reinforces the need for action,” the report added. Diesel prices were also slow to drop in 2023, partially down to Asda ‘feathering’ its prices (reducing them more slowly as wholesale prices fell) and other firms not responding competitively to that.  The CMA estimated that drivers have paid 13ppl more for diesel from January 2023 to the end of May 2023 than if margins had been at their historic average. “Competition at the pump is not working as well as it should be, and something needs to change swiftly to address this,” said Cardell. As such, the CMA recommended a \"fuel finder scheme\" to give drivers access to live, station-by-station fuel prices on their phones or sat-navs. This would “help revitalise competition in the retail road fuel market.” Cardell added: “We need to reignite competition among fuel retailers. This [scheme] would end the need to drive round and look at the prices displayed on the forecourt and would ideally enable live price data on sat-navs and map apps.” The CMA also recommended bringing in a new monitoring body to “hold [the] industry to account.” On this, the RAC's Williams said: “The fact that drivers appear to have lost out to the tune of nearly £1 billion as a result of increased retailer margins on fuel is nothing short of astounding in a cost of living crisis and confirms what we’ve been saying for many years: that supermarkets haven’t been treating drivers fairly at the pumps. “It’s all about action now, and we very much hope the government follows through with both of the CMA’s recommendations.  “While forcing retailers to publish pump prices is a positive step for drivers, what’s of far more significance is the creation of a fuel-monitor function within government which, we very much hope, actively monitors wholesale prices to ensure forecourts don’t overcharge when the cost they pay to buy fuel drops.  “Without this, we fear drivers will continue to get a raw deal.\"",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/best-hot-hatches",
    "description": "There are no hitches with our top 10 hot hatches – but which pocket rocket claims the number one spot? Hot hatches are the Goldilocks performance cars – they're fast, mischievously good fun, whole-heartedly practical and some are even quite affordable. What is not to like? The best hot hatches come from a recipe that has been around for decades: take an otherwise ordinary hatchback, up the performance and upgrade its powertrain and chassis technologies.  Some car makers even hand them over to their own in-house performance sub-brands to work their magic. Think Mercedes-AMG, Hyundai N, Toyota's Gazoo Racing and Ford Performance. Hot hatchbacks are equally capable of zipping through city streets or tackling winding roads, offering exhilarating driving experiences without sacrificing everyday usability.  The first hot hatches originated in Germany, France, Italy and Japan. Even South Korea has been getting involved in recent years.  You should make the most of them while you still can. Increasingly strict emissions regulations mean hot hatches are no longer the overtly affordable performance machines they once were.  Although internal combustion still rules the roost, there’s a definite sense that these petrol-engined machines are the last of the breed. One car on our list is actually electric.  But which should you choose? We think the Toyota GR Yaris is the best hot hatch money can buy today, offering stunning cross-country pace, engaging handling and compact proportions.  Read on for our full top ten list of the best hot hatches on sale today. Whether you're after speed, style, or versatility, these cars have it all.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/citroen-unveil-radical-new-concept-car-paris-motor-show",
    "description": "New concept will sit \"in a major segment\" First look at brand’s future will be shown alongside revised C4 hatchback and new C3 Aircross crossover Citroën will provide a first look at its future when it unveils an all-new concept car at the upcoming Paris motor show. The French brand said the show car will sit “in a major segment”, suggesting that it's most likely a B- or C-segment hatchback or SUV – although Citroën has yet to provide further detail.  It added that the facelifted Citroën C4 hatchback and C4 X saloon will be shown alongside the new concept. As previously reported by Autocar, the duo will receive new lighting signatures and more squared-off bumpers, inspired by the Oli concept that was shown two years ago. It’s possible that the unveiling of the facelifted C4 alongside the new concept is no mere coincidence: it's due for replacement around 2026 or 2027, which would also fit the traditional timeline of taking a concept through to production.  Alternatively, it may be a radical model inspired by the Ami quadricycle. Although Citroën hasn't officially hinted at any such plans, CEO Thierry Koskas previously told Autocar that “we are going to extend the Ami line-up and do many changes”. “We will reveal everything in the Paris motor show,” he added. The new Citroën C3 Aircross will also make its public debut at the show. The crossover is based on the same Stellantis Smart Car platform as the new C3 supermini but has been stretched to 4390mm long to fit a small third row of seats. It’s set to become one of the UK’s cheapest seven-seaters when it arrives next year.",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/value-brand-leapmotor-not-aiming-steal-vauxhall-citro%C3%ABn-sales",
    "description": "New T03 is Leapmotor's £16k rival to the Dacia Spring Stellantis-backed Chinese firm to \"complement\" its sibling brands with a range of affordable EVs New Stellantis brand Leapmotor International won’t cannibalise sales from Citroën, Fiat, Peugeot and Vauxhall, but rather “present new opportunities for cross-shopping”, its CEO said, despite it having broadly similar brand values. “We consider Leapmotor as complementary to the 14 brands we have in the family, for a number of reasons,” Tianshu Xin said. “Number one, Leapmotor is a pure-EV brand and hailing from China. Number two, it's complementary to what the Stellantis group has [in terms of technology]. Number three, how we position the brand in the family is different. “For customers who are technology-savvy, maybe younger customers who enjoy technology, there are a lot of other functions. It’s like operating a mobile phone: you have so many functions. Different customers have different preferences from that perspective.” Stellantis has invested €1.5 billion (£1.2bn) into the Leapmotor International firm that it has jointly formed with nascent Chinese EV maker Leapmotor, and it’s now leveraging its vast global operations to launch the brand across Europe, Oceania, South-East Asia, India, South America, the Middle East and North Africa, with the expectation that it will increase its sales to 250,000 this year and 500,000 in 2030. “State-of-the-art technologies and the rapid growth that Leapmotor has been able to achieve in the past several years, plus its strong in-house vertical R\u0026D capabilities and quality, are why we chose Leapmotor to build up this strategic alliance,” Xin said. Key among this technology is Leapmotor’s ‘cell-to-chassis’ construction method, which, it claims, improves an EV’s battery layout, leaves more space for passengers and increases torsional rigidity (to the benefit of ride and handling), all while reducing production costs – and which, Xin said, could possibly be synergised with other Stellantis brands in the future. The former PSA executive confirmed that Leapmotor International will launch three more EVs in Europe (including the UK by 2028), after the already-launched Leapmotor T03 city car and C10 family SUV: the B10 compact crossover, which is due to be presented at the Paris motor show, and then what are believed to be an E-segment SUV and a C-segment hatchback. It also “has a plan” for bringing its extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) technology here, Xin told Autocar, citing huge demand from potential customers for an EV with a “1000km [620-mile] range”. An EREV version of the C10 is already on sale in China with a 1.5-litre petrol engine and a 739-mile range on the Chinese test cycle – a powertrain shared with the C11 SUV and C01 saloon. While the C10 is made at a Leapmotor factory in China and therefore in line to be hit with an 21% import tariff into the EU, the much cheaper T03 is built at Stellantis’s factory in Poland, on the former Fiat 500 production line, apparently for a similar price to the Chinese-market version. Xin denied that building the T03 within the EU was purely an insurance policy against any future tariffs, saying: “If you look at our target audience, the customer is very price-sensitive. So by localising production, one of the biggest chunks you save is on transportation costs. \"All the decisions made are not just based on one factor but based on a holistic business case assessment. And the end game is to provide a mobility solution to customers around the globe.”",

    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-e-408-arrives-polestar-2-rival-281-mile-range",
    "description": "New electric version of saloon-cum-crossover will hit UK roads early next year Peugeot has revealed the e-408, an electric variant of its saloon-cum-crossover that will take on the Tesla Model 3 and Polestar 2. Its addition means every car available to order in Peugeot’s UK line-up now offers a choice of petrol, hybrid and electric powertrains. Although closely related to the Peugeot e-308, which uses the same modular EMP2 platform, the larger e-408 adopts a slightly different powertrain, notably drawing power from a larger 58.2kWh (usable) NMC battery pack – unique within the Stellantis group. The bigger battery could be accommodated as engineers “had more room to play with” within the fastback’s longer wheelbase, explained Peugeot product director Jérôme Micheron. The rakish 408's slippery design, which achieves a drag coefficient of 0.28 (on par with the 2 and only just beaten by the class-leading Model 3), helps the EV to achieve a range of 281 miles, with 4.6mpkWh efficiency. The battery can accommodate charging speeds of up to 120kW. Despite the 408 being able to accomodate it, Peugeot isn’t offering the e-408 with the 98kWh battery that has just been launched in the Peugeot e-3008 and Peugeot e-5008, offering up to 422 miles of range. Asked why, Micheron said: \"When we looked at the competition of the e-408, we saw we were the right position when it came to range and efficiency. The average daily C-segment customer drives 45km [28 miles] a day.” The new Peugeot’s Polestar and Tesla rivals are both offered in 'Long Range' forms, with ranges of 408 and 390 miles respectively.  The e-408 is fitted with the same synchronous electric motor as the e-3008, which deploys 207bhp and 245lb ft of torque. Official acceleration figures have yet to be released, but it's expected to outpace the 154bhp e-308’s 9.8sec 0-62mph sprint time. The e-408 is nearly indistinguishable from its ICE siblings, with only the additional 'e' badge at the rear marking it out. This is because “we wanted to protect the design and its attractiveness\", said Micheron. The same is true inside, the e-408 having the same i-Cockpit (small steering wheel and raised 10in instrument panel) as the ICE 408, along with a 10in infotainment screen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a separate i-Toggle shortcut touchscreen. The e-408 will make its first public appearance at the Paris motor show later this month. UK orders will be taken from 5 November and deliveries are due begin early next year.  Pricing has yet to be confirmed for the UK, but in Europe it will start at €43,900 (£36,602) in Allure trim and top out at €45,900 (£38,259) in GT trim. Given that the e-408 will top the 408 range, it's expected to start here at above the PHEV's £43,420.",

    "description": "Peugeot's urban sophisticate crossover draws on mild-hybrid petrol engine as an alternative to the electric e-3008 The third-generation Peugeot 3008 feels like telling statement of upwardly mobile intent from its manufacturer, already having impressed us for its style, quality and sophistication - and as a near-£50,000 all-eiectric e-3008 at that. Which bodes well for the rest of this review: because, having already proved that such exotic prices aren't, at least in some ways, out of its reach, we now turn to the more affordable derivatives.The regular combustion-engined versions of this car (which do without the e- prefixes of their zero-emissions siblings) carry the kind of prices you might find easier to stomach of a mid-sized French car. There is a plug-in hybrid due for introduction to the UK market shortly, available from a little over £40,000; and a mild hybrid, which we're dealing with here, that can be secured for less than £35k.The mild hybrid is powered by Peugeot’s familiar three-cylinder, 1.2-litre turbo petrol engine with an electric motor integrated within a six-speed 'e-DSC6' dual-clutch automatic gearbox. It's pretty modestly powerful compared with its rangemates, at 134bhp; but for retail buyers who like the idea of a compact SUV that's well-priced, real-world economical and easy to use, it might have even more appeal than its more hyped and widely electrified equivalents.",

    "title": "Skoda extends small combustion car lifespans in EV slowdown",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-extends-small-combustion-car-lifespans-ev-slowdown",
    "description": "Electric Octavia estate is pushed back by up to two years as brand refocuses on combustion models Skoda has delayed a crucial new electric car and extended the lifespan of its small combustion-engined models in response to waning demand for EVs across Europe. The Czech brand had previously planned to launch six electric cars over the next two years: the new Elroq and Epiq crossovers, the production version of the Vision 7S concept, a 4.7m-long estate and facelifts for the Enyaq and Enyaq Coupé. However, it has now decided to delay the estate – all but confirmed to inherit the Octavia name – until late 2027 or 2028. Skoda CEO Klaus Zellmer told Autocar: “To be totally honest, with the slowdown of the transformation into battery-electric vehicles, we’re revisiting that [timeline]. “We're checking the sequence of those cars. The cadence now is we’ve had the Enyaq Coupé, the Elroq, the next one is the Epiq, and the next one down the line will be the SUV, the 7S you’ve seen the concept car of. After that – it could be 2027, 2028 – we’re aiming for an Octavia estate.” Meanwhile, the petrol-powered Fabia supermini, Kamiq crossover and Scala hatchback have been given a stay of execution until 2030.  Zellmer said: “Originally, we said that we were going to phase out the Fabia, Kamiq and the Scala by 2027, but we have now green-lighted those cars to stay with us until the end of the decade, because the [EV sales] slowdown is happening as we speak.” According to figures from European car industry body ACEA, electric cars’ share of the region’s new car market (including the European Free Trade Association and the UK) fell from 15.1% between January and August 2023 to 14.0% over the same period this year. “We have always said that we would cater to what consumers want and not what we think is the right method of transport or drivetrain,” Zellmer said. “We always said we're going to try and be as flexible as possible.” Zellmer attributed the shortfall in electric car sales to various factors, including failings in the charging infrastructure, range anxiety, the cost of electricity and the significantly higher price of EVs. Indeed, Skoda marketing boss Martin Jahn conceded that the company is sacrificing its profit margin on the new Elroq to ensure it is priced at a level to attract strong sales – and therefore allow Skoda to meet its CO2 emissions targets for 2025. “I admit that this is not the most profitable car in our line-up, and we just have to work on the costs, especially on the battery costs, to make the electric cars more profitable in the future,” said Jahn.  Zellmer also pointed to the lack of variety in bodystyles as a barrier to growing EV sales. He said: “I’ve always said people always buy cars for the least probable cause they need them for. So they buy a combi [estate] because they were at one point in time at Ikea, they had to put this huge box of a wardrobe in the car, so now they need a combi again.  “[Like] with range anxiety, this is totally emotional – it's not rational. Who exceeds a range of 350 miles on a regular basis? And even if you do, you do one charging stop in between, get the car down to 30%, charge it back to 60%, it takes you 15 or less minutes and off you go. It's not a problem. “It's changing the habits, but people still find it difficult to change their behaviour towards battery-electric vehicles so we need to give people time to be ready for that, and this is why we offer alternatives.”",

    "title": "New 2025 Audi Q5 now on sale from £49,950",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2025-audi-q5-now-sale-%C2%A349950",
    "description": "Next generation of Audi's best seller will bridge the gap to it going fully electric in 2033 The new, third-gen Audi Q5 will cost almost twice as much as the Mk1 did at launch in 2008, when first examples hit the road next April. Orders have opened for Audi's revamped best-seller, which starts from £49,950 for a 2.0-litre turbo mild-hybrid petrol four that sends 201bhp and 251lb ft through the front wheels, and £51,600 for a diesel with match capacity and power; the original car started at around £27k.  Opt for the V6-powered SQ5, which has swapped diesel for petrol and outputs 362bhp – an increase of 20bhp, and that pushes you into Porsche Macan territory, with prices starting at £74,400. Unlike the new A5 saloon and A5 Avant estate, the third-generation Audi Q5 won’t be offered with a pure combustion engine. Two plug-in hybrids, with 295bhp and 362bhp plus electric-only ranges of around 50 miles, will follow next year.  The SUV, which made up 17% (334,480) of Audi’s total global sales last year, will be used to anchor the brand as it shifts away from combustion engines and into electric cars. Audi’s renewed investment in hybrid powertrains is because the transition to electric cars is taking longer than had initially been expected. It still plans to phase out ICE cars in eight years, though, meaning this Mk3 will be the last non-electric Q5. It has committed to offering a hybrid option in each segment until then. “We recognised early on that plug-in hybrids were a relevant project technology, and now we see that the bridge is longer than we initially thought,” said Audi CEO Gernot Döllner. Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) that underpins the Q5. Its electrical architecture represents a significant upgrade – a complete wiring overhaul and now using five on-board computers – on the old Q5’s MLB Evo platform. That gives Audi more flexibility to offer hybrids with different configurations and opens the door to key future upgrades. It’s understood, for example, that the PPC can support range-extender powertrains yet can also accommodate a V8 engine, hinting at the future of the larger Q7 and the prospect of a new RS model. Audi says the new platform also brings improvements to both ride comfort and handling. The new Q5 is fitted with steel springs and passive dampers as standard, while air suspension is available as an option. As well as the technical overhaul, the Q5 features a noticeably more modern interior. It follows the A5 and the Q6 in adopting Audi’s new ‘Digital Stage’ set-up: a free-standing OLED panel that comprises an 11.9in digital instrument display and a 14.5in infotainment touchscreen. A 10.9in touchscreen for the front passenger is optional. UK pricing has yet to be announced, but the first cars are scheduled to land in showrooms in March. In mainland Europe, the entry-level petrol car is €52,300 (£44,300) and the diesel is €57,100 (£48,400), while the SQ5 is €82,900 (£70,200). New Audi Q5 Sportback imminent A coupé-roofed Sportback version of the new Q5 will arrive shortly after the regular SUV. Prototypes with plug-in hybrid powertrains have now been spotted testing in Germany, suggesting the new engine and body options could arrive at the same time. Expect slightly better fuel economy and improved electric-only range in exchange for reduced boot space and a modest rise in price.",

    "title": "Caterham Project V sports car to be powered by Yamaha",
    "link": "https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/caterham-project-v-sports-car-be-powered-yamaha",
    "description": "Caterham Project V is due to enter production in 2026 The first Project V prototype will be driving next year, with an ultra-power-dense Yamaha motor on the rear axle Caterham's new Porsche 718 Cayman rival has edged closer to reality with the announcement that Yamaha will develop its electric powertrain - and the first prototype will be running in less than a year. Caterham has today confirmed that the world's third-biggest motorbike manufacturer will equip the sub-£80k Project V sports coupé with a \"cutting edge e-axle\" and provide \"its technology and expertise in vehicle motion control\".  Just over a year after the Project V concept was revealed at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Caterham is \"moving to the next phase of its development\", en route to putting a final product in showrooms in the coming years.  Details of its Yamaha powertrain have yet to be confirmed, but the concept was said to have a single motor giving 268bhp to the rear wheels for a sub-4.5sec 0-62mph time.  Yamaha is already developing motors for cars and describes them as \"featuring industry-leading output density\", courtesy of highly efficient conductors and learnings \"garnered through our engine development efforts to date\".  Notably, it has already installed a quartet of its 'Hyper EV' motors producing 268bhp apiece (matching the Project V concept) in Subaru's wild 1058bhp STI E-RA racer, which is targeting a Nürburgring lap time of just 6min 40sec. Yamaha also recently signed up as a technical partner to the new Lola Formula E team, which will make its debut in the 11th season of the electric single-seater championship from December. Caterham CEO Bob Laishley told Autocar that the decision to collaborate on the Project V was as much Yamaha's as it was his own: \"As you can imagine, global companies like Yamaha do not make decisions without detailed discussion and consideration, our discussions with them for Project V have been maturing for quite a while. We are very honoured to be working with them and it is great news for the Caterham brand that we can make this announcement today. \"In terms of why Yamaha as opposed to other options, they have a long-proven record of supporting OEMs with technology and, through their two-wheel business, clearly understand the need for weight optimisation. In the end, the decision was a mutual one from both sides, rather than us specifically choosing them in a traditional supplier selection.\" The Japanese giant has never put a road car into production itself, but in 2015 it revealed a compact sports car concept designed in partnership with Gordon Murray.  Dubbed the Sports Ride, this relatively realistic proposal for a lightweight two-seater was remarkably similar in size, shape and positioning to the Project V – although had it entered production, it would have used a tiny turbocharged petrol engine.  Before that, in the early 1990s, Yamaha also built a small number of fully functioning prototypes of an outlandish V12-engined supercar called the OX99-11, which was designed effectively as a road-going Formula 1 car.  Neither car ever reached showrooms, but no doubt Yamaha can still draw from learnings around their packaging, construction and engineering as it develops the drivetrain for the Project V. Laishley said Caterham's brief for the Project V's development \"remains the same as always: lightweight, simple and fun-to-drive\".  Caterham has also confirmed that Japanese engineering outfit Tokyo R\u0026D will build the first prototype, which is due to be completed by mid-2025, though Laishley suggests the car may not launch as early as 2026, as was originally planned.  \"I don't want to speculate on the final start-of-production [date] but 2026 will be a challenge,\" he told Autocar.   Tokyo R\u0026D has previously been involved with the development of various experimental prototypes, test mules and concepts for Japanese manufacturers. It also produced its own compact two-seat sports car, the Honda-engined Vemac RD200, from 2004 to 2008. Caterham has given no indication that its partnering with two Japanese companies on the Project V programme means the car will be built in Japan. The Japanese-owned British company has previously confirmed that it won't build the Project V alongside the Seven in its Dartford factory and is in talks with a range of potential candidates to build the car on a contract basis. Laishley has told Autocar that there is still \"no decision on the manufacturing location yet\".",

It was a roller coaster of a month with the most fearsome outlaws that the American blacktop had ever seen, and the photos they produced are a fantastic documentation of these mid-century gunslingers. Though Ray and Bride risked life and limb embedding themselves with the lawless outcasts, the story was never published. However, the photos have been floating in and out of the motorcycling community’s collective consciousness since surfacing and have cast their spell on Greg Hebard of Regatta Garage in Salt Lake City, Utah. Inspired by Bill Ray’s photos, Greg wanted to create a modern version of an early club-style motorcycle.…",

Batman and his myriad motorcycles have captured our imaginations since; just think of how many times you’ve heard the phrase “That looks like something Batman would ride.” That exact phrase was the inspiration behind this brooding custom BMW R nineT. But this isn’t a replica of any one particular Batman motorcycle. Rather, it’s a homage to the aesthetics of The Dark Knight’s vehicles, masterfully executed by Smoked Garage in Jakarta, Indonesia. “A client walked into Smoked Garage with a childhood dream,” says the shop’s founder, Nicko Eigert. “As a boy, he had always been fascinated by the sleek, futuristic bikes of Batman—and now, he sought to bring his fantasy to life in a modern café racer.”…",

Triumph Bobber by Motocrew The story of this slick-looking custom Triumph Bobber began with a call from a good friend of the German custom bike workshop, Motocrew. He had just finished customizing his Porsche 911, and it looked lonely in the garage. The hunt for a stablemate was on—and that’s where Motocrew came in. The bike needed to be long, low, and lithe, just like the Porsche, so Motocrew’s Chris Scholtka chose a 2019-model Triumph Bobber as a donor.…",

This half dirt bike, half ATV hermaphrodite wasn’t agile, had lackluster performance and was generally deemed dangerous before Honda pulled the plug in 1988. Honda Fat Cat’s are relatively collectible now and clean versions can bring upwards of $8,000 USD. Finding one, however, is a bit tricky. So Mike Lilge of Appleton, Wisconsin, decided to build his own. While he was at it, he made a few, shall we say, upgrades? The frame is borrowed from a 1984 Honda 200S ATV, modified and fitted with a custom swing arm and Honda 250R ATV lower tree. The front end lends a little more motorcycle ingenuity, stealing forks from a Suzuki GS450 mated to a custom-fabricated upper tree.…",

Since then, we’ve been wondering when its sibling, the Husqvarna Vitpilen 801, would drop, and what it would look like. Well, it’s here now—and we are decidedly underwhelmed. The new Vitpilen 801 might have knocked our socks off if Husqvarna had released it before the Svartpilen 801. But they’ve made us wait six months for a look at what is essentially a lightly fettled version of the Svartpilen. And that’s left us very little to sink our teeth into. When Husqvarna first released their neo-reto street bike range six years ago, the differences between the Svart- and Vitpilen variants were far more pronounced. The Svartpilen 401 and 701 were clearly styled after flat track bikes, while the Vitpilen 401 and 701 were committed to café racer style, clip-on handlebars and all.…",

Fighting for control, Newcombe was determined to stay in the race as he approached Stowe Corner at uncontrollable speed… Five years earlier, Kim Newcombe, a marine engine mechanic with a penchant for boat and dirt bike racing, teamed up with renowned German outboard motor designer and specialist, Dieter König. Newcombe took over the development of a defunct motorcycle project built around a boat engine Dieter had conceived. The heart of the resulting machine was a powerful 500cc four-cylinder, two-stroke boxer engine cradled in a custom frame design.…",

Riding on the success of the VF750F, Honda introduced the VF1000F to expand their V-four lineup and offer a sport-touring option for riders craving more power and range. But the VF1000F never quite matched the popularity of the 750, and was outgunned by rivals like the Kawasaki GPz900R Ninja. Still, the VF1000F holds a special place in Honda’s history, since it served as a crucial stepping stone to the legendary VFR series. It’s also hard to look at the old Interceptor now, 40 years on, and not feel a wave of nostalgia for this underappreciated machine.

Showing only 21,401 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO I example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example is among the lowest mileage ones in the world. The Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO I was developed from DTM racing to challenge BMW in the German touring car championship. Built to meet Group A homologation requirements, it featured a Cosworth-tuned engine producing 202 hp, along with aerodynamic upgrades like a rear spoiler and wider fender flares for improved downforce and handling. With a revised suspension for racing demands, the EVO I set the stage for Mercedes’ later dominance in DTM and paved the way for the more aggressive EVO II.

Showing only 176.0 kilometers from new, we believe acquiring this EVO II example is an exceptionally rare opportunity, unlikely to be repeated in today’s market. We also believe this example to be the 2nd lowest mileage one in the world, as we are aware of a lower mileage car located inside the borders of Russia. The 1990 Mercedes-Benz 190E EVO II was born out of Mercedes' ambition to dominate the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM), Germany’s premier touring car championship in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As DTM regulations required manufacturers to base their race cars on production models, Mercedes developed the EVO II as a homologation special, producing only 502 units for road use. Furthermore, the EVO II introduced significant upgrades over the EVO I, primarily in aerodynamics, engine performance, and handling. Its bold, wind tunnel-tested body kit featured a larger rear wing and front splitter for improved downforce and high-speed stability. The 2.5-liter engine was also more powerful, delivering 235 horsepower compared to the EVO I’s 204 hp. The EVO II’s adjustable suspension, larger 17-inch wheels, and enhanced chassis provided sharper handling and a more responsive driving experience, making it better suited for both the track and the road. These refinements solidified its dominance in DTM racing. Continue...",

The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, represented the epitome of front-mounted V12 Ferraris from 1968 to 1996. Launched in 1968, it marked the only front-mounted V12, 2-seater Ferrari for almost 30 years. The car featured a 4.4L, 352-horsepower V12 Colombo engine (the penultimate model to utilize this engine), clear-lensed headlights, and circular rear lights. This car, born in stunning Marrone Metallizzato paint (on black interior), benefitted from very special treatment from Ferrari, as it was once owned by a relative of Didier Pirroni (Formula 1 driver for Ferrari in the early 80's), who directly commissioned his employer to perform a nut-and-bolt restoration on this Daytona. This resulted in what is arguably one of the earliest known restoration projects undergone by Ferrari. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona initially featured fixed headlights behind a plexiglass cover (Plexi) for a sleek, streamlined front-end design. However, in 1971, regulatory changes (particularly in the U.S.) required Ferrari to replace these with pop-up headlights to meet new safety standards, as the Plexi setup was deemed less durable. The change created a subtle design shift, with the Plexi version now considered more desirable among collectors due to its rarity and, arguably cleaner, more distinctive look. Continue...",

    "title": "Want to drive a historic race car on the Goodwood track? You can!",
    "link": "",
    "description": "So you’ve been to Goodwood Revival, or lapped up the TV coverage, and of course you’ve loved it. And if you were there in period dress, you’ve truly been part of it already. But how about really living the experience? How about trying a few of the cars on track? Well that’s now possible, with Goodwood offering corporate track experiences in a variety of historic race cars. Participants on one of these new Goodwood Revival Experience days get to try several (typically eight) very different cars, with instructors sat alongside. This seems quite an opportunity, and we were keen to try it out. The days are run by Goodwood’s Ultimate Driving chief instructor David Brise, not only a driver of some repute, but of the same family that gave us Formula 1 star Tony Brise (sadly killed in the same plane crash that ended Graham Hill’s life), and Tony’s father John Brise, multiple World Stock Car Championship winner. David is keen to point out that these are not out-and-out race cars, but in many cases they’re only one step away, and most have a strong race history. ‘We cater for everyone here, for those who’ve never been on a track to experienced racers. Some of the latter might think “I don’t remember a Mk2 understeering that much”, but these cars still provide a fantastic experience that you won’t get anywhere else.’ Crucially, all have full rollcages and harnesses, and all but the Jaguar Mk2 are on race rubber, Avon CR6ZZs. Mostly, the engines have simply been detuned a little for improved longevity and driveability. As much fun as it sounds to be revving a 1960s engine to 8000rpm, that would result in little or no power below 5000rpm, and an engine life of just a few of these corporate days. To further ensure longevity, the engines are fitted with electronic revlimiters, set 1000rpm below the ideal redline for each car. That means that even if someone changes down too soon, which the revlimiter can’t protect against, it’s still unlikely that the mistake will result in mechanical catastrophe. The downside is that most of these engines hit their limiters at a relatively low 5000rpm, but it’s a fair price to pay for the privilege of driving such valuable machinery, and higher gearing is being investigated for some of the cars. There’s a further twist too, that only Goodwood could get away with: breakfast, briefings, tea breaks, lunch and afternoon tea are all interrupted by ‘Viv the spiv’ and the Goodwood road-mending crew, adding a bit of lighthearted period comedy to an occasion that anywhere else would be rather serious. There’s nothing like a few truly terrible jokes or a pair of ‘workmen’ tripping over a tape measure to dispel pre-track nerves. And if that doesn’t work for you, there are also the ever-smiling Glamour Cabs girls… The price for these corporate sessions start at £12,400 for a half day with a group of 12, up to £20,000 for a full day with a group of 20. Understandably pricey, given that every car has its own dedicated instructor, and every car is valuable and requires meticulous maintenance and preparation. So, onto the fleet – or if you want to find out more, see the Goodwood website 1969 Alfa Romeo Giulia 105 Coupé This is the 2-litre version; it’s on race cams and an open diff! explains David. ‘And it sounds lovely!’ He’s not wrong. It sounds sweet even as we sit in the pitlane awaiting the first session. It’s a gorgeous day, the track is dry and the Alfa feels ready and willing, though in typical Italian style it’s a bit of a stretch to the steering wheel even with the seat set slightly too close for leg comfort. A feeling accentuated by being held in tight by the race harness. The gearstick is long, the shift equally so, but the controls are light, and the engine is tractable enough to make a sharp exit onto the circuit a cinch. There’s no-one else on track yet, so straight over to the left side of the track and then into the first corner, Madgwick, with its double apex. Generally it’s best not to bother getting too close to the first apex but concentrate on getting the second apex correct for a fast exit towards Fordwater. My instructor calmly points out braking points, doesn’t cringe when I miss third gear. The change is not just long but a bit rubbery, and it takes some getting used to. And suggests a gentle lift for the usually flat-out Fordwater while the tyres are still cold. Then it’s into St Mary’s, which is so satisfying when tackled correctly, but in this case I’m still battling the gearchange, and down to Lavant for a long smooth turn out onto the Lavant Straight. The Alfa’s steering is light, and although there’s a little bit of play (as is typical of these Alfas) it still feels precise, aided and abetted by wonderfully taut suspension. Down Madgwick straight, a long stretch to persuade the stick into fifth (I heard someone comment later that fifth was ‘virtually between the instructor’s legs!’) and we probably hit 90-100mph before the revlimiter and the rapidly approaching trickiness of Woodcote end the fun. Brake hard, because Woodcote’s double-apex is harder than it looks, a quick squirt up to the chicane, brake hard again, right-left through the chicane, and past the pits for another lap. After a few more laps, confidence is up, I’m finally mastering the gearchange, and my respect for the Alfa has increased significantly. It’s an absolute pleasure to drive on the track, predictable yet exciting, and despite the race cams it pulls cleanly, loudly singing its Latin song. Fantastico! 1969 MGB Roadster ‘People look at this and think “Oh it’s just an MG” but by the end of the day it’s often the car that they all want another go in,’ says David as he shows us round this understated B Roadster, proudly wearing its works-style glassfibre hardtop. This car shows its race credentials not just in a few light battle scars but in the flimsiness of the lightweight doors and plastic windows, and the rorty exhaust note as the engine fires up. As David goes on to confirm, these seemingly basic FIA-spec MGBs are always much-underrated. And yet it’s a model with Le Mans history and current competiveness in all manner of prestigious international historic motorsport. Of all the cars here, it turns out, it’s the MGB that feels the sportiest just to sit in, because you’re seated low in the cockpit, legs stretched out straight ahead. David jokes that the gearshift requires ‘muscle memory’ because the first-second plane is so close to reverse to the left and to third-fourth to the right. And as with any MGB, the minimal movement from side to side contrasts oddly with the relatively long fore-and-aft of the shift. But it snicks in neatly all the same. The B-series engine is tuned enough to rid it of the unwillingness to rev that defines the standard road car. As a consequence it’s not got a lot of torque low down, but the gear ratios are well-spaced enough for that not to be a problem, and third and fourth are fine for all but the chicane, which needs a quick snick down to second gear. In fact, it couldn’t be easier, even when the rear starts to lose grip a little on Madgwick, because the B’s behaviour is so predictable (in a good way). If there’s any downside to it, it’s that the steering is very heavy, which is a typical MGB trait. It’s mostly due to the unusually high castor angles designed into the MGB’s front suspension. And initially it makes it feel as though the steering is completely dead. Until you re-attune to it – and build some forearm muscle. With more time spent in the MGB, it could feasibly become the car I’d be most comfortable in. And perhaps even quickest in, despite the competition. Never under-estimate an MGB. 1965 Lotus Cortina MkI You might be relieved to hear that this isn’t a genuine Lotus Cortina. But a decent replica, built using the conventional rear axle of later MkIs rather than the slightly fragile A-frame system of the first cars. ‘It’s got the 1600 Lotus Twin Cam engine, all the right suspension, all the bits and bobs,’ confirms David, ‘and it’s really stiff, it feels great to drive.’ Do we agree? Certainly first impressions are good, sat in that airy cabin, its thin pillars making for superb visibility. The white-painted dashboard adds to the light, bright feel, and who wouldn’t appreciate those four gauge pods spread across the centre of the fascia? This is an iconic machine, or a damned good replica of one at least. The gearshift is typical rear-wheel-drive Ford. Short, precise, wonderfully mechanical without feeling overly notchy. Slot it into first, thumbs up from the pitlane marshals, and we’re off. Immediately it feels completely natural to drive. All the controls matched in weight, all perfectly placed, and within half a lap this feels like The One. At every turn it does exactly what you’d expect it to do, its stiff suspension keeping everything in line. You know it will bounce a little and slide when pushed hard but there’s never a nasty surprise here. The engine revs freely, sounding wonderful as its twin sidedraughts gobble in air, but the revelation is the steering, which is lighter and more precise than any 1960s steering box has a right to be. Downsides? The gearing. It’s so low, which would work fine if it was running a race engine, capable of revving to 7-8000rpm (and needing a rebuild every few races). But with the limiter knocking back the power at 5000, the four-speed Cortina is best kept in top for much of the circuit. David is considering raising the gearing, though the downside might be to lose some of that sweetness of response. In fact, low gearing is a small price to pay for the chance to experience a Lotus Cortina on track, replica or not. What a superb machine. 1968 Porsche 912 ‘We’ve only just got this one,’ says David. ‘It’s a 912, so has the four-cylinder engine, not the 911’s six-cylinder – a lot of people claim it’s a Beetle engine, but having had this one apart, and seen the parts prices, I can assure you it’s all Porsche!’ Early short-wheelbase 911s are hugely soughtafter for historic racing and rallying, and of course hugely expensive to match. The 912s look identical, and the smaller, lighter four-cylinder engine makes for much better weight distribution and safer handling, at the cost of losing that six-cylinder wail. This one is currently built to quite a basic specification, and I’ll admit it feels tame compared with most of the others. But the chance to drive an early Porsche round a circuit is not to be sniffed at. And the experience is significantly different from the rest. It starts from the driving position. Cab-forward, feet offset to the centre, accelerator pedal hinged from its base, the long gearlever protruding from a near-flat floor. And sporting a dogleg-first shift pattern, meaning that second is where first would normally be, third where second would be, etc. Oh, and the engine fires up with an air-cooled thrum that could only be Porsche. Or Volkswagen… The gearshift movement is long and rubbery, but it’s never a problem to find the right gear. The accelerator action feels heavy and initially a little awkward, but the clutch, brake and steering are delightfully light and feelsome. In fact, that steering could easily be the best here; on track, it feeds back every undulation, every camber change, in a way that only an early Porsche can. We’re making decent progress, circulating the track smoothly and undramatically, with everything working exactly as it should. The handling feels predictable, none of the famous tail-waywardness showing through at these speeds – and in fact, the 912 is far less prone to that – and the grip through corners is tenacious as long as the car is powered through, keeping weight over the rear. The engine feels strong, unburstable, but undramatic, even when revving hard. And it’s this aural effect, along with the sheer competence of the 912, that makes it perhaps the least exciting of all the cars here – but with more time to explore its abilities, I feel that might change. 1968 Mini Cooper MkII And now for something completely different… Though just how different the Mini would feel is astonishing. ‘A Mini Cooper is really the pinnacle of the St Mary’s Trophy,’ says David, ‘and you’ll see them in fantastic David and Goliath battles with Ford Falcons and Mk2 Jaguars. The front tyres do everything, the rears don’t do anything. You could leave them on for 25 years and they wouldn’t wear out.’ This sounds odd in the extreme. Time to find out. Another airy cabin, this one admittedly rather smaller than the Cortina’s, though the speedometer still feels far, far away in the centre of the dash. The steering wheel, famously, is closer to the horizontal than the vertical plane; since (Mini) time began, the position has been compared with that of a London bus. Still, all else is fine, and everything feels perfectly normal as we pull away down the pitlane and buzz onto the circuit, the little A-series – this one bored out to 1310cc – already revving hard. Mindful of David’s advice, I keep steering movements to the minimum to turn into Madgwick, and yet – whoah! – the little car still turns in far more sharply than expecting, seeming to pivot around the engine as if there’s nothing behind it at all. Disconcerting, because I’m behind it… I have to correct the steering to avoid turning into the kerb, which prompts another larger than expected move across the track. Remember when you first tried a driving game console, and watched your virtual car swing from side to side as your thumb/brain struggled to master the required subtlety of movement? Well that’s how this feels. A few corners in, and it becomes clear. There’s no movement in the suspension, just none at all, and the car’s wheelbase is a mere two metres, and so even the tiniest steering input produces a marked change of direction. Back off the power mid-corner and the rear tyres unload and let go, so the technique is to brake lightly, use the tiniest movement of the steering wheel to turn in, then power through the corner. Seasoned Mini racers will set the car sideways on the entry to the corner and half slide, half bounce through, usually nipping past several cars in the process. However you do it, you can’t fail to have fun. That A-series engine may be basic but it keeps revving away as you tear round the circuit, breathless and giddy from the mix of excitement and hilarity of the Mini driving experience. If you’ve never driven a race-spec Mini on a track before, add it to your bucket list now. Right now. 1960 Jaguar Mk2 3.4 From the sublime… to the Mk2, which it would be tempting to say is as far from the Mini as it’s possible to get, except that the huge Ford Falcon looms large in the distance. Still, the Mk2 provides a remarkable contrast with the Mini, particularly with its opulent interior still intact. ‘It’s the oldest car here,’ says David. ‘In the 1960s, these cars turned up to circuits still with all the leather and walnut. By the mid-1960s, the racers had realised how much was to be gained by losing weight, and they started stripping them out. ‘This Mk2 is really heavy, and you’ll notice that the steering feels a little vague, but the engine is like a little Swiss watch.’ Turns out, he’s almost doing the Mk2 an injustice. It’s another of those cars, like the Lotus Cortina, that feels perfectly natural to drive – it’s just in the Mk2, it has to be driven into the corners at lower speeds… What’s most apparent, though, is how smooth everything about the Mk2 feels. The way it rides, the quality of the controls, the seamless revving of that wonderful engine, and even the steering. The Mk2 has had little more than the rollcage fitment in terms of track preparation, and yet it sails around the circuit as if it were made for it. Boy does it need some steering input though, especially after the twitchy Mini. The weight of the Mk2 and comparatively soft suspension pushes it into inevitable understeer, and in the tighter turns it’s a challenge to twirl the steering wheel enough to persuade the car through. The Vredestein tyres (this is the only car not on the grippier Avons, in deference to its wire wheels) squeal in protest but it makes it every time, and just hunkers down again out of the corner to power along the straights on its long-legged gearing. No top speed frustrations with this one. So, different from the rest but good fun regardless. And every time I think of it, I’m reminded of that remarkable engine, so wonderfully, effortlessly smooth. 1964 Ford Falcon Well if the Jaguar was ridiculous after the sublime Mini, how about a 5-litre Yank Tank? David explains that ‘it’s set up like a race car except one thing – it came with an automatic gearbox on a Hurst [aftermarket] shifter, and we’ve left it in.’ He also mentions that ‘the brakes feels like pressing concrete’ and ‘if it starts to slide, it takes a lot to get it back!’. Hmm… Ever used a Hurst shifter? It’s a wonderful thing. Despite the length of the shifter in the Falcon, each gear selects with a short, precise movement, clicking into place, so it would be perfectly feasible to shift between first, second and third. But today, why not make it a bit easier… from Park to Reverse (click) to Neutral (click) and into Drive (click). The V8’s idle drops slightly, the transmission strains to be let off the leash. We’re waved onto the track, and the big Falcon picks up immediately, shifting quickly into second as it powers towards Madgwick. A shove on the brakes (and they really do need a big shove) and a tentative turn into the corner, ready for a rolling, rollicking experience. But no, the Falcon turns in more precisely, and with way less roll than any car weighing one and a half tonnes should ever achieve. In fact, that huge expanse of near-flat bonnet stretching out ahead remains, well, near-flat through the corners, only showing any significant lean through the chicane. Of course, the weight is always apparent, never more so than at Lavant, when an earlier turn-in is needed than for the smaller saloons, and even then the Falcon pushes wide, threatening to run over the kerbing until it powers out the other side, its 302cu-in V8 thundering as it revs out in second gear. And the auto ‘box? Remarkable really. David says that a lot of customers find it a relief to be able to concentrate on the track. And on steering the car, rather than worrying about gears, and it’s very easy to see their point. All you need to remember is that the three-speed Borg-Warner won’t shift up if your foot is flat on the accelerator due to the kickdown function (just lift momentarily and it will quickly change up a gear). Sure it would be more fun with a manual, but if hustling a car the size of a small house around a tight English circuit isn’t fun, I’m not sure what is. 1965 BMW 1800 TI/SA There was just one disappointment of the day, and that was that we didn’t get to drive the BMW. Fear not, this was only because our day was cut short for the interviews. And photoshoot necessary to bring you this very feature, so you’ll get more time. All the same, it’s worth knowing about this car, because it’s a bit special. In the mid-1960s. BMW built homologation specials for touring car racing based around the 1800TI, called the 1800 TI/SA. It had 20bhp extra, thanks to twin Weber carburettors, larger inlet valves, hot camshaft and a higher compression ratio. It was also fitted with a five-speed ZF gearbox in place of the standard car’s four-speeder, uprated suspension and brakes. And a sportier interior. In the hands of Hubert Hahne and Rauno Aaltonen in particular, the TI/SA achieved notable successes. This car isn’t a genuine SA but a replica, good enough to have FIA papers. And accurate right down to having the interior painted a different colour (red) from the exterior, just as the works cars were. ‘When it came to us it was fitted with a full race engine,’ says David. ‘It would rev up to 8500 but there was nothing below 4500. We’ve had to detune it to make it more suitable for our purposes, but it’s still really exciting to drive – and so noisy!’ The Goodwood Revival Experience Wistfully watching the BMW circulate the track as time ticked by, it was clear that it was making swift progress. And all who drove it said how well it performed, though even with the correct dogleg-first ZF gearbox. The low overall gearing meant that it was hitting the revlimiter on the Lavant Straight. If you’re lucky enough to sample the Goodwood Revival Experience. Be sure not to overlook the apparently humble BMW. It may well surprise you.

Whether it be old or new, with a chance to learn and be hands on, is a fantastic opportunity. \"I've been watching racing here at Lime Rock since I was 2 tears old. My stepfather was a racer in the '60s, and now I get the chance to spend time at the race track.\" The inaugural Piston Technician Award winner in 2022 was Mike Marra of Automobile Associates of Canton, Connecticut. In 2023 the award went to Chris Kvaka of Vintage Racing Services in Stratford, Connecticut. Continue...",

    "title": "A restored and remastered Mini by David Brown Automotive",
    "link": "",
    "description": "You can't overstate the importance of the Mini to a certain generation of British drivers. Most often, there was a Mini in the family. It was the car you learned to drive in. Then another – likely more battered – example would have been your first car. That emotional thread runs through your automotive psychology like the stitching in a pair of jeans. Car of the 20th Century: Mini A Mini is ordinary. For the owner of this car, Will Yearsley – and for me come to that – it's the most ordinary vehicle of our youth. Except of course it isn't. It's anything but ordinary. The Mini got itself voted, in more than one authoritative poll, the “Car of the 20th Century”.   With justification. Because of the Coopers, the Monte Carlo Rally wins, and its ability to beat much more powerful cars in track racing. Because of its place in London's swinging ’60s scene. And also for the vastly significant engineering innovations that make it a piece of packaging genius, and – now as then – a particular kind of joy to drive.  So Yearsley has acquired some Minis. Not a barn full of quasi-random examples, but a perfectly curated capsule collection.   It starts with a ‘proper’ 1969 1275cc Cooper S, in almond green with an old english white roof. That was the heyday of the ADO15 Mini's four-decade production span. During the 1980s the Mini frankly became a bit of a laughing stock as a new car: full-featured modern superminis had displaced it in the general public's eyes.  It got a new lease of life during the 1990s as Rover, Mini's owner, saw its potential as a left-field curio and moved it out of the mainstream market. John Cooper returned to add some sparkle. So Yearsley also has one of those, one that actually once belonged to the Cooper family.  He's also got the maddest of the BMW Minis, a John Cooper Works GP3, the wide-arched one with 306HP and a 164mph top speed. But then he wanted a Mini that was truly his own. So he commissioned his fourth, a Mini Remastered by David Brown Automotive. These are ground-up restomods, building an original identity into an entirely new car. (Oh, the name… David Brown is a British industrialist but no relation to David Brown, the late British Industrialist who once owned Aston Martin.)  Yearsley's is registered and chassis-plated as a 1989 Sprite, one of Rover's more feeble limited editions. Its origin is wholly irrelevant to our story, except that the 1989 identity allows it to swerve some bothersome new-car legislative constraints. That time-slipping has also enabled DBA to sell several of its Remastered cars to the Americas. Continue...",

    "title": "Ferrari 330 P4 Chassis 0856: the whereabouts of Miss Universe 1967",
    "link": "",
    "description": "1967: it was the summer of love. And a busy time for the Ferrari 330 P4, arguably the sexiest race car ever designed. The world of motorsport is filled with legendary vehicles, but few can match the allure and mystique of the 1967 Ferrari 330 P4. And more specifically chassis 0856, the only one (among the three built) that never got any damage or modification. In short, the current chassis 0856 is pretty much the same that it was in 1967. One Sexy Beast \"One Sexy Beast\", as we claimed when we created our film about chassis 0856, a few years ago at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Canada. Revered as one of the greatest racing cars ever built, this specific P4 not only represents a pinnacle of engineering excellence but also carries a rich history that includes an array of noteworthy owners. Its story is a testament to Ferrari's ingenuity, competitive spirit, and timeless appeal. But what has happened to this specific unit? In this feature story, we are trying to keep up with Miss Universe 1967. [embed]https://youtu.be/awArTC8iQ3Q?si=XEFCOD6_X6OvFw9j[/embed] Origins of the Ferrari 330 P4 But first, some context. The mid-1960s marked a period of intense rivalry in the world of endurance racing. Ferrari, with its illustrious history and competitive edge, was locked in a fierce battle with Ford, whose GT40 had been making significant strides on the racing circuit. To reclaim its dominance, Ferrari developed the 330 P4, a car designed to be the ultimate racing machine. This vehicle would become one of the most iconic sports prototypes ever created. A Design Masterpiece The Ferrari 330 P4 was an evolution of the 330 P3, with substantial improvements aimed at enhancing performance, handling, and aerodynamics. The body was designed by Pininfarina, featuring an elegant yet aggressive profile. With its sleek lines, low-slung stance, and distinctively wide rear, the P4 exuded an aura of speed even when standing still. Underneath its stunning exterior, the 330 P4 housed a 4.0-liter V12 engine. This engine was a marvel of engineering, producing around 450 horsepower. It incorporated advanced features such as a double overhead camshaft (DOHC), Lucas fuel injection, and a 12:1 compression ratio. Paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, this powertrain enabled the P4 to achieve blistering speeds and impressive agility on the track. Cutting-Edge Aerodynamics and Engineering The chassis of the 330 P4 was crafted from tubular steel, with fiberglass body panels providing a lightweight yet robust frame. The car's suspension system featured independent suspension with wishbones and coil springs, ensuring optimal handling and responsiveness. Ventilated disc brakes offered superior stopping power, a crucial factor in the demanding world of endurance racing. Aerodynamics played a pivotal role in the P4's design. Every curve and contour was meticulously shaped to minimize drag and maximize downforce. The car's streamlined nose, curved windshield, and strategically placed air intakes contributed to its exceptional aerodynamic efficiency, allowing it to glide through the air with minimal resistance. The Glory of Chassis 0856 Among the three Ferrari 330 P4s produced (plus the P3 converted to P4 specs), chassis 0856 is the most celebrated, having played a crucial role in Ferrari's racing triumphs during the 1967 season. Like we mentioned above, its current condition is pristine and to its original specifications. The 1967 season was a critical year for Ferrari. The team aimed to reclaim their status as the undisputed leaders in endurance racing, and the 330 P4 was at the forefront of this mission. Chassis 0856 was a key player in this endeavor, contributing significantly to Ferrari's success. Continue...",

She and Gabriel Perez have won this race before. Now, they are trying to win it again. However, racing 2,000 miles in seven days is tough, with their 1954 Studebaker Commander. Furthermore, mechanical problems might steal their podium, but a team with passion never gives up.

All these conspire to make the Carrera Panamericana seven-day endurance event wild and grueling. The Carrera Panamericana is a Mexican motorsport challenge like no other. It remains the most challenging open road race in the world. Drivers from across the globe come to race through Mexico’s rugged mountains and beautiful cites. Fans throughout Mexico line the roadways to watch the cars go by, and people around the world follow every stage online.

    "link": "",
    "description": "What does the collector car community need more than anything else? Young technicians, of course. There is a severe lack of youths finding themselves in automotive restoration positions. Without the hands needed to repair, maintain, and preserve classic vehicles, car culture has a real employment crisis on its hands. Yet paradoxically, there are more than enough young. And passionate car enthusiasts considering a career with classic cars. So, what’s the problem? Why aren’t these young people ending up in exciting car careers? Unfortunately, overcoming the hurdles required in order to make it as a budding technician is extremely challenging. Not to mention leaving no practical means to enter the trade. This is where the Piston Foundation enters the chat. [avatar user=\"Piston Foundation\" size=\"120\" align=\"left\"  link=\"https://pistonfoundation.org\" target=\"_blank\"][/avatar] Visit the Piston Foundation website The solution The Piston Foundation was founded in 2021 to solve the workforce shortage plaguing the collector car community. We’re creating a career pathway that will support aspiring technicians from the classroom to the car shop floor. Here’s how we aim to do it: The Piston Scholarship provides financial aid to those enrolled in a 2- to 4-year auto tech or restoration program. Technical education is expensive and those tuition costs can pose a real barrier to entry into the world of cars. Students who apply and are accepted for a scholarship may receive up to $5,000 to help fund their automotive education. To date, we’ve granted scholarships to 33 promising students and are looking forward to announcing our 2024 class of scholars later this summer. The Piston Academy Apprenticeship takes hands-on training to the next level by taking qualified restoration graduates and placing them in a full-time job at a Piston-partnered shop. Even graduates from the best restoration programs won’t have gained all the necessary hands-on experience to land a full-time, billable job. As such, the biggest barrier new apprentices face is the disparity between what they can be paid in an entry level role and the cost of living needed to reside in their city of work. The Piston Academy’s apprenticeship program provides a training grant so apprentices can gain the necessary work experience and shops can afford to invest in a new wave of talent. The apprenticeship is currently in a trial stage with a widespread model potentially slated for 2025. [embed]https://youtu.be/XLJkpbIr0Go?si=jc1HHLmiUpk8Vgrz[/embed] How does the Piston Foundation measure the success and impact of its programs and initiatives? Asking the question to Piston Foundation President and COO Jeff Mason: \"The Piston career initiative supports aspiring technicians with both education and job networking. This way, they can learn the skills that earn them a job in the collector car industry. We measure our success by the number of scholarship applications we receive, the number of returning Piston Scholars,  the school-year completion rate of our scholars, and the number of graduated Piston scholars working in the industry. Since our career program began in 2022, Piston has awarded 53 scholarships totaling $197,500 to auto restoration students at schools in Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and our applicants have come from 37 states. In 2024, Piston received its highest number of scholarship applications yet, indicating a strong interest in these careers. Nine of this year’s 20 scholars have earned an award more than once, with one three-time recipient. The completion rate of Piston Scholars since 2022 is 98% and all nine of our scholars who have graduated from their school programs are now working in the industry. The Piston career initiative is making the impact our donors want to see by creating a pipeline of talent who will help the car community continue to thrive.\" Continue...",

    "title": "Jaguar XJR-15 LM: The most radical supercar you've never heard of",
    "link": "",
    "description": "The Jaguar XJR-15 LM was a marvel of engineering that embodies the spirit of Jaguar's racing heritage. Its exclusivity, performance capabilities, and unique design made it a legendary vehicle among automotive aficionados and a true icon of its era. But it was (and still is) so rare than it's almost impossible to find documentation or even photos about this supercar. To tell the story of the Jaguar XJR-15 LM, we need to travel back to the 1980s, a decade when car design was radically taking off. While Japan was innovating with sports car, or in the US which was perfecting boring economy cars, let's focus in on Great Britain. Where the story starts: the 80s and Le Mans The 1980s Le Mans races were a full-on war. Porsche was dominating with the 1985, 1986, and 1987 Le Mans wins under their belt. But slowly, under the surface, you could see Porsche slipping, desperate to stay at the top. In ‘85, Porsche finished first through fifth, all winners running the legendary 962C. Just two short years later, at the 1987 Le Mans, Porsche had lost two spots out of the top five to Cougar and their C20, and Jaguar with their XJR-8. The pivotal moment came in the 1988 race. Jaguar stunned everyone by snatching first place from the infamous king Porsche, with their XJR-9 LM. Tom Walkinshaw racing (TWR) was the team that ran Jaguar’s cars in motorsport, and the road cars under the Jaguar Sport brand, a joint venture between TWR and Jaguar. They were the ones running the XJR-9 LM and so, with the newly gained fame from toppling the Germans from their throne, TWR set out to create a supercar that the XJ220 dreamed of being. Here comes the XJR-15 This led to the development of the XJR-15. The story goes that wealthy enthusiasts approached TWR wanting a road legal XJR-9, which certainly wasn’t a thing. So TWR reused the old engine the XJ220 was supposed to use, a 6.0 liter V12, and stuffed it into the chassis that the XJR-9 used, creating a 490 HP beast. They brought Peter Stevens on board to help design the outside of this raging beast, the same Peter Stevens who designed the holy McLaren F1 later on, and he was given a blank slate to use his magic on. [embed]https://youtu.be/FKbVQEBuemQ?si=02ilW7cRaxQs3QqY[/embed] Well, that's the XJR-15, albeit heavily summarized. Interestingly, it came with a communication system with headsets and a microphone which both the driver and passenger wear to communicate, as that massive screaming V12 behind you isn't the conducive to small talk. Now, let's talk XJR-15 LM. Information regarding this car is scarce online, which is personally makes it so interesting. This is, I feel, the most complete record of the car on the internet, creating a definitive guide. Continue...",

    "description": "Karlo Flores left México when he was sixteen. He came back to race La Carrera Panamericana, the world’s toughest road race. This time, he and his team are challenging tradition. And racing something no one has ever seen at La Carrera, the world-famous Le Mans car, the GT40. It’s a big risk, but if the car survives and the fans like it, it will all be worth it. A they made a film about the whole adventure in Mexico: GT40 Panamericano We are launching our new series \"Classic Racing\" with this first film produced by our partners at Driving La Carrera. This is the first segment of many more to come in this series. And what better way to start that the a legendary car, the Ford GT40, at a legendary event, La Carrera Panamericana. The Classic Racing series is dedicated to the beauty of race vehicles of all ages, and the emotional connection we this still have with them. Only one condition: regardless of their age, those cars and bikes still have to race, no excuse! [embed]https://youtu.be/pJqRXpAmtm0?si=zq5lL7gr03OlOIuw[/embed] The History Of La Carrera Panamericana Twisting roads, uneven surfaces, natural hazards, vertical drop offs, lack of sleep.

La Carrera Panamericana Revival The Carrera Panamericana was revived in 1988 with increased safety requirements. Mandated equipment and clothing rivals that used in Formula One and Indy. Today it is run as a stage race, similar to the original, but with a combination of “speed” stages and “transit” stages. Speed stages are timed, closed-road races that require entrants to get from point A to point B in the shortest amount of time. This requires driving flat out along winding mountain roads that pass through small villages, along cliffs, and through wooded sections of forest. There is a reason the roll-cages used are thicker than in other races - the 500-foot drop offs have something to do with it. Transit stages are run as a time-speed distance (TSD) rally, with driver and navigator attempting to finish a stage at a specific time. The combination of scoring in both types of stages determines the overall winner. More reading about La Carrera Panamericana No Race On Earth Is Like La Carrera Panamericana Continue...",

    "title": "Top 10 Motorsport Films",
    "link": "",
    "description": "Motorsport films captivate audiences by combining high-speed action with dramatic storytelling, offering a thrilling glimpse into the world of racing. Classics like \"Le Mans\" (1971) with Steve McQueen, and \"Grand Prix\" (1966), deliver realistic portrayals of legendary races and drivers. Hits like \"Rush\" (2013) highlight intense rivalries and historical battles in motorsport. Motorsport films such as \"Senna\" (2010) provide an intimate look at the lives of iconic racers. While motorsport films like \"Days of Thunder\" (1990) emphasize the excitement and danger of racing culture. Together, these motorsport films celebrate the passion, competition, and human stories that define the thrilling world of motorsport. 10. Days of Thunder Days of Thunder may have assembled the old band back together. But even with the director, producers and leading man Tom Cruise carrying over, Top Gun did not seamlessly transfer to terre ferme. But in its favour, the NASCAR adrenaline hit is an easy-to-watch Hollywood thriller. It’s by no measure a masterclass in subtlety as young and raw talent Cole Trickle tries to make it on America’s ovals. But with that said, the cast ensemble is impressive and the movie’s pacing spot on. As an appreciation of the USA’s biggest motorsport, it’s a far better production that Talladega Nights. PetroFact: The film lent its name to the short-lived Days of Thunder ASCAR series that raced around Rockingham Motor Speedway in the mid-2000s. 9. McLaren Opening onto the McLaren M8D Can-Am racer and listening to its rumbling Chevrolet V8 is a lesson in how to engage an audience. With plenty of footage and audio to celebrate the life and legacy of company founder Bruce McLaren, the film tracks humble origins through to F1 and Can-Am success. Former mechanics of the company are drafted in to explain what made the man so great and why they had such undivided loyalty to him. The recreation of some scenes is jarring at times but to say this is nitpicking is testament to how good the film is. PetroFact: Footage is used from the classic American Western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 8. Truth in 24 (I and II) In the same year Death Race was released, Jason Statham was back to narrate 2008’s Truth in 24. Another attempt as honing in on what makes the 24 Hours of Le Mans so special. The movie follows Audi Sport in its attempt to take the spoils of glory for a fifth consecutive year despite the threat of newly established rival Team Peugeot. Director Keith Crossrow is open that he was not a racing fan when he took on the role. And it shows, but all for the better as it appeases audiences regardless of their interests. PetroFact: Statham was an Audi brand ambassador following the release of Transporter 3 in which he pilots an A8. 7. 1 1 celebrates F1’s safety crusade. You watch the opening laps of the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as Martin Brundle’s Jordan is launched into the air before coming to a rest upside down. Able to clamber out of the wreckage and run back to the pit-lane. He hops in the spare car to take the race restart. From there, audiences are taken back in time and guided through the landmark fatalities and safety step changes that helped make 200mph crashes survivable. It’s a perfectly judged tone but what makes the film stand out are the interviews. Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley and Sid Watkins all star. PetroFact: 1 is narrated by Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender 6. Ford v Ferrari Ford v Ferrari (2019) is a riveting biographical drama that chronicles the intense rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari, culminating in the historic 1966 Le Mans race. Directed by James Mangold, the film stars Matt Damon as visionary automotive designer Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as fearless driver Ken Miles, capturing their collaboration to create a revolutionary race car, the Ford GT40. The movie excels in its dynamic portrayal of high-speed racing and the personal struggles of its protagonists, though some critics argue it simplifies complex historical events for dramatic effect. Overall, Ford v Ferrari delivers a thrilling and heartfelt exploration of friendship, innovation, and the pursuit of excellence in the face of corporate and personal adversity. PetroFact: To authentically recreate the high-speed action of the Le Mans race, the production team used a mix of practical effects and CGI. However, the actors often found themselves in real cars, racing at significant speeds on the tracks. 5. Ferrari For us, Michael Mann's Ferrari is an instant classic. Released at the end of 2023, this biographical drama delves into the tumultuous life of Enzo Ferrari, during the pivotal summer of 1957. Starring Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari, Penélope Cruz as Laura Ferrari, and Shailene Woodley as Lina Lardi, the film explores Ferrari's personal and professional challenges, including his strained marriage, financial struggles, and the high-stakes world of auto racing. The narrative is set against the backdrop of the Mille Miglia, that becomes a symbol of both Ferrari's ambition and the tragic consequences of his relentless pursuit of success. Mann's direction captures the high-octane energy and the nuanced emotional landscapes of the characters. Critics have praised the performances, particularly Driver's portrayal of Ferrari, for capturing the complexity of a man driven by passion and haunted by loss. \"Ferrari\" offers a visually stunning and compelling glimpse into the world of racing and the man behind the brand, making it a must-watch for car enthusiasts and fans of historical dramas. The only problem we had with the film is that it was too short - we wanted more! PetroFact: During the filming of \"Ferrari\", Michael Mann sought authenticity and realism, especially in the depiction of the famous Mille Miglia race scenes. To achieve this, Mann shot everything in Italy and collaborated with Ferrari enthusiasts and owners who owned vintage Ferraris from the era depicted in the film.

Senna It’s thanks to Senna that many motorsport films have followed in its wake in recent times. Capturing the ill-fated career of one of motorsport’s greatest icons reignited the hunger for delving into racing’s past. It’s not perfect, however. The need to cast a villain in every film results in a scathing and misleading portrayal of Senna’s closest rival Alain Prost. And to those not well-versed in Senna’s driving talents, perhaps the politics he faced outweighs the screen time given to him driving on the limit. Nevertheless, it’s worthy of its place on this list and was received with huge critical and commercial success. PetroFact: The film raked in £375,000 on its opening weekend, a UK box office record for a documentary. 3. Rush Retelling the story of the inimitable 1976 Formula 1 season, Rush follows the championship rivalry between McLaren’s James Hunt and Ferrari driver Niki Lauda. The story of a flawed playboy versus Lauda’s recovery from a near-fatal crash at the Nürburgring and of taking title glory down to the wire was always going to make for a great script. Directed by Ron Howard, of Happy Days and Apollo 13 fame, it’s aimed squarely at the motorsport apathetic. It’s exciting and visually stimulating but takes Hollywood-style liberties in recounting the past. Perhaps it’s not a purist’s favourite, but Rush is undeniably entertaining. PetroFact: Many of the cars featured were prepared and driven by historic racing specialist Hall and Hall. It’s based in the small town of Bourne, home to 1962 F1 constructors champions BRM. 2.

There’s a certain pleasure to be derived in knowing that the main star was a true motoring enthusiast. And that shows throughout the movie as Le Mans captures the scale, emotions and danger of the world’s greatest race. McQueen is as close to perfect in the role as is his co-starring Porsche 917. But like many on this list, it’s definitely a harder sell to mainstream cinema-goers.

Grand Prix It’s far too long and is interspersed with a contrived love story, but nevertheless, Grand Prix is a class act. Its main asset is that it’s the cars and circuits that star, not the actors. Although it was released in 1966, the film still feels remarkably fresh and that’s mostly down to the stunning picture quality and visceral engine notes. There’s fun to be had spotting the cameo appearances from various 1960s grand prix drivers, and there’s plenty of time to get it right with a near three-hour running time. PetroFact: Steve McQueen withdrew his interest from the lead role, which ended up going to James Garner, his next door neighbour. Continue...",

It was misleading, as the luxury convertible embarked on a new generation while the rest of the lineup was considered a refresh . The Cadillac marketing people justified their grandiose claims because in addition to a visual rework, the Eldorado changed its manufacturing location. It moved upmarket (shedding the two-year DeVille association) and joined the exclusive Fleetwood assembly line with the Sixty Special and Seventy-Five models. And part of its new upper-crust lifestyle meant a reduction in chrome trappings in addition to its refreshed corporate appearance.",
