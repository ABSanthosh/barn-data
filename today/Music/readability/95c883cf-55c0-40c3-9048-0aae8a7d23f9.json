  "text": "Last week, Thobbe Englund, returning guitarist of Sabaton, sat down with Brazil's Porque! Metal to discuss the events that led to his return to the band. Englund started off by saying that he had always kept in contact with the guys in Sabaton since his departure back in 2016, \"We even wrote some songs together, and we always made sure to stay in touch, barbecuing, having beers, visiting each other's family and stuff like that.\" And so when Englund got the question nearly a decade \"It was the perfect timing for me,\" because when he originally left, he was tired and burnt out, \"I wanted to slow down a bit, and focus a little bit on my own music and stuff like that, but also have a kid, buy a house, and all that.\" So, when Sabaton asked Englund to return, it \"was a no-brainer\" for him. It felt like a \"full-circle\" moment and that it was \"the best [thing] that could ever happen.\" \"I belong to Sabaton. That's my family, that's my best friends.\" And when Englund confirmed his return, the band felt like \"[giddy] school girls.\" Sabaton debuted their first single with Thobbe Englund as guitarist in late April, \"Templars.\" The single is rumored to be the first off an upcoming record, but the record has yet to be announced. In the meantime, you can check out the \"Templars\" music video below. Want More Metal?
