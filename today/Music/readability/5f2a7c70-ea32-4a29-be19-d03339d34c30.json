  "text": "Following a breakout year filled with sold-out shows and major festival sets, EDM.com Class of 2024 artist Of The Trees is channeling his vision into something deeply personal: a music and nature experience tucked into the heart of the San Juan Mountains.Camp Alderwild comes to Telluride, Colorado, from August 22–23, 2025, blending cinematic bass, sustainability, and natural beauty in a setting unlike any other. The event is co-produced by Planet Bluegrass, Colorado’s leader in eco-conscious events, and AEG Presents, one of North America's top live music promoters.Here’s everything you need to know before making the trip.What Is Camp Alderwild?Camp Alderwild is a curated two-day music and camping experience created by Of The Trees to bring fans closer to nature and each other. Designed as both a communal gathering and a creative statement, the event blurs the line between festival and art installation, reflecting the ethos of Memory Palace—the genre-fluid label and artist collective Of The Trees founded during the pandemic. The result is a destination rooted in atmosphere, sound design, and intentional storytelling.The LocationCamp Alderwild will take place at Telluride Town Park in scenic Telluride, Colorado. With a limited capacity of just 7,500 attendees, including 2,200 campers, the event offers an intimate experience set against a surreal alpine backdrop. The venue is just minutes from downtown Telluride, making it easy for fans staying in town to walk between their accommodations and the festival grounds.How to Get ThereThe most convenient airport for travelers is Montrose Regional Airport (MTJ), which offers direct flights from Denver and other regional hubs. From there, it’s a scenic 90-minute drive or shuttle ride into Telluride. Driving from Denver takes about five to six hours, and while a car may be useful for exploring the surrounding San Juan Mountains, it’s not necessary for navigating town.Once in Telluride, most attendees can walk between the venue, accommodations, and late-night spots. The free Telluride gondola connects the town to Mountain Village and operates late into the evening, offering one of the most unique public transport systems of any festival town in the country.Who’s Performing?This year’s lineup features Of The Trees headlining both nights—one set boasting all-original material, the other rooted in the aesthetic of his Memory Palace imprint. Joining him on Friday are Jade Cicada, Thought Process (Live), Taiki Nulight, and Curra, setting the tone with layered bass, psychedelic textures, and cinematic energy. Saturday’s programming continues that trajectory with performances from Tycho (Live), Ott., EPROM playing a special Underclock set, and Air Castles, culminating in an Of The Trees’ closing set under the stars.Tickets and CampingTickets are available now, with several tiers and camping options to choose from. The current 2-Day General Admission pass is priced at $218.02 and includes access to both days of the festival. The most popular camping package, Lawson Hill Camping, is priced at $332.47 and includes a 2-Day GA pass, shuttle transport to the festival grounds, and a designated campsite just outside town.Town Park and Zone 1 camping—both closer to the main venue—have already sold out, along with all available vehicle camping passes. Travelers not camping will need to explore local lodging options, including hotels, inns, and vacation rentals via platforms like Airbnb and VRBO. Given Telluride’s small size, accommodations are limited, and early booking is strongly encouraged.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesFor those seeking convenience, the entire downtown area is within walking distance of Town Park, allowing fans staying in central Telluride to fully enjoy the event without needing to drive or shuttle in.Late-Night ProgrammingOnce the main stages power down, the music continues in downtown Telluride with a slate of curated afterparties and pop-ups hosted at select venues. Expect underground sets, interactive art, and surprise B2Bs in intimate settings. These late nights are fully walkable from the campground and core hotel zones, making the entire town part of the festival atmosphere.Tips for PreparationSituated at an elevation of 8,750 feet, Telluride’s thin mountain air can affect even seasoned travelers. It’s recommended to arrive a day early if possible, drink plenty of water, and take it easy during the first 24 hours to avoid altitude sickness. Limit alcohol, bring a reusable water bottle, and consider electrolyte tablets for added hydration.Weather can swing dramatically—from warm sunny afternoons to chilly mountain nights. Pack light clothing for the daytime, but don’t forget layers, a hoodie, or an insulated jacket, as well as durable footwear. Conditions can dip into the 40s after sundown.Telluride’s culture is deeply rooted in sustainability. Local bans on single-use plastics mean attendees should bring reusable bags and water bottles and be mindful of waste at all times. Visitors are also encouraged to respect the town’s small but vibrant community—be kind to workers, tip generously, and treat Telluride like the special place it is.Environmental Impact and Community GivingCamp Alderwild puts sustainability at the forefront. Every ticket includes a $1 donation split between the National Parks Foundation and Sierra Club, supporting ongoing environmental and conservation efforts.The festival is also launching a Propeller campaign that rewards fans with exclusive experiences, upgrades, and giveaways in exchange for taking simple climate action ahead of the event.Memory Palace: The Label Behind the VisionCamp Alderwild is the physical embodiment of Of The Trees' Memory Palace label. With a focus on genre-defying bass and immersive storytelling, the imprint has hosted curated events in Brooklyn and Denver and released music from artists like Freddy Todd, BLAAP, and Thought Process. This summer, it all comes to life in the alpine forests of Colorado.You can buy tickets to Camp Alderwild here.Follow Of The Trees:Instagram: instagram.com/ofthetreesmusicTikTok: tiktok.com/@ofthetreesmusicX: x.com/ofthetreesFacebook: facebook.com/ofthetreesSpotify: spoti.fi/2YxTKb9",
