Cardi B attends The 2023 Met Gala Celebrating \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line Of Beauty\" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 01, 2023 in New York City. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Cardi B is sending her love to the Dominican Republic after the tragic collapse of the Jet Set nightclub roof in Santo Domingo left at least 66 people dead and more than 160 injured, at the time of publication. The rapper, whose father is Dominican, wrote a message of mourning to her BG Secret Society community on Instagram Tuesday (April 8), according to a screenshot shared by Complex. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in literal tears scrolling down my timeline seeing my Dominican people being rescued some wit lives and some gone,‚Äù¬†she wrote. ‚Äúl‚Äôm sad seeing families crying desperately in pain looking for love ones ..I feel like every Dominican around the world is in a big hora Santa praying for survivors and praying for the ones that are gone to be in Gods Glory.
