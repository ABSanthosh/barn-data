  "text": "At a Summer Con event in Washington State, Cobra Kai’s Martin Kove was allegedly ejected from the convention after biting his co-star Alicia Hannah-Kim. As TMZ reports, a Puyallup Police Department report reveals that Hannah-Kim saw Kove in the VIP section of the convention; when she said hello in passing, he grabbed her arm and bit her nearly hard enough to draw blood, kissing it afterwards. TMZ quotes Hannah-Kim as saying that Kove “was furious and outraged and visibly angry when I told him calmly not to bite me … he insisted he bit me for fun.” She did choose not to press charges, but requested an “informational report” be taken from her and her husband in case of future occurrences. Photos of the “very noticeable” bite mark were taken. Kove apologized for the incident after being confronted by Hannah-Kim and her husband, before being asked to leave the event. Kove played the villainous John Kreese in 57 episodes of Cobra Kai, reprising his role as the owner of the Cobra Kai dojo from the original Karate Kid trilogy. Hannah-Kim played Kim Da-Eun, a sensei who comes to work at the dojo in Seasons 5 and 6. The series finale of Cobra Kai premiered on Netflix in February 2025. Here’s why the show itself was an unlikely underdog story.",
