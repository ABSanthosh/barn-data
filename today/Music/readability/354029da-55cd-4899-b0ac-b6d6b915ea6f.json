  "text": "After two decades together, Pop Evil have just released their eighth studio record, What Remains via MNRK on March 21st. Vocalist Leigh Kakaty, guitarists Dave Grahs and Nick Fuelling, bassist Joey \"Chicago\" Walser, and drummer Blake Allison are the current lineup for this release, with Kakaty and Grahs serving as the only founding members of the band. Alongside the album release, Pop Evil have also shared the video for the track \"Side Effects\" off of What Remains. Providing a formidable message for those in difficult situations and aching to break free from their current environment, the message is accompanied by a powerful play through performance in the music video.
