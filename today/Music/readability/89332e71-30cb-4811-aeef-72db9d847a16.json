  "text": "Marilyn Manson and the Los Angeles County District Attorney (LADA) George Gascón originally became acquainted in 2021 after Gascón began investigating Manson. While nothing ever publicly surfaced from that investigation, Gascón's office issued a statement on October 9 saying new evidence has been brought to their Sex Crimes Division regarding Manson. The statement thanks the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) for bringing the evidence to their attention, and notes the LADA is meeting with the alleged victims to gather more information. \"The LADA's Sex Crimes Division is currently reviewing a case involving Brian Warner, aka Marilyn Manson \"Experienced prosecutors from our office's Sex Crimes Division are carefully reviewing new leads and additional evidence that continue to come to our attention from the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department's investigation. New evidence has emerged within the last few weeks, adding to an already extensive case file presented to our office by the LASD. \"It is our office's responsibility to ensure that we have a complete picture of the admissible evidence available before making a filing decision. Senior staff members have met with victims, and our prosecutors continue to remain in contact with the victims and their representatives throughout this process. We are committed to making sure they are treated with dignity and respect. \"I have received requests from victims to meet personally to discuss the case, however, as the case is being investigated it would be inappropriate for me, as District Attorney, to meet with victims during this time. We anticipate making a filing decision soon and will provide an update when that time comes. At that time, I look forward to meeting with the victims to discuss how my office can continue to support them.\" Marilyn Manson has been facing a slew of lawsuits from Rachel Wood (and dealing one back), Esmé Bianco (which has been settled), Ashley Walters (which was going to trial back in November), Susan Fountain (the spitting incident), and Bianca Allaine Kyne (among others) due to allegations of various sexual abuses and misconducts over the past few years. Manson has denied all claims made against him. Amidst the legal issues, Manson has also announced his first record in four years One Assassination Under God – Chapter 1 due out November 22.
