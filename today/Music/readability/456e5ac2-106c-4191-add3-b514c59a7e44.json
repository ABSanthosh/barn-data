  "text": "In the early hours of May 22, tragedy struck in San Diego when a Cessna 550 crashed into a residential area, killing all aboard — including Daniel Williams, former drummer of The Devil Wears Prada, and Dave Shapiro, co-founder of Sound Talent Group. The accident left a path of destruction, igniting several homes and splashing jet fuel across neighborhood streets in Tierrasanta. Remarkably, no fatalities were reported among residents on the ground. The crash occurred around 3:47 a.m., with the aircraft reportedly hitting over a dozen vehicles and homes in a military housing development. The neighborhood was quickly evacuated as emergency services battled the fires. The jet was en route to Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, a short distance from the crash site. Williams, 39, documented his final moments with a characteristic sense of humor. He filmed himself boarding the aircraft at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and posted photos from the cockpit. In one image, he joked that he was the \"co-pilot now.\" The lighthearted post now reads like a poignant farewell. Following the news, The Devil Wears Prada posted a heartfelt tribute to Williams, who played with the band until 2016 before reportedly transitioning into a career as a software engineer. \"No words. We owe you everything. Love you forever,\" the band wrote, sharing a carousel of photos that captured his time with the group. Sound Talent Group, a major force in talent booking and management, released a somber statement to Billboard: \"We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues, and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today's tragedy. Thank you so much for respecting their privacy at this time.\" Williams had made San Diego his home after leaving the band, marking a quiet chapter in his life following a career that once placed him on international stages. News of the crash has sent shockwaves through the rock and metal communities, many of whom knew Shapiro and Williams personally. Tributes have quickly begun to surface online. Vinny Mauro, drummer for Motionless In White, posted: \"Hug your friends, cherish your time, and let them know you love them because you never know when the last chance will be. So cliche, but I’m sick to my stomach. I’ll see you again someday, my friend.\" Tyler Smith, vocalist for The Word Alive, echoed that pain: \"Losing not one but multiple longtime friends at once is fucking hell. This week is brutal. Sending all my love as news spreads, tell your friends you love them.\" I don't feel comfortable saying who some of the other ppl onboard are – as they are known and friends within the music community.
