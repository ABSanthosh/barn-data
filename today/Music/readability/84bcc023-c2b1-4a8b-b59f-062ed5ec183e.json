  "text": "If you’ve ever dreamed of owning a piece of the Fyre Festival brand, now is your chance — again. Owner and convicted fraudster Billy McFarland shared the news via Instagram on Monday, July 7th, after a planned sale of the brand fell through. “We had a seven-figure deal for the complete Fyre brand and IP package that fell through this morning,” McFarland explained in the post. “But now, the opportunity to own the Fyre brand is back on the table,” he added, explaining how to purchase or license the Fyre brand for your event or product. Watch the full clip below. Back in April of this year, documentarian Shawn Rech announced he had acquired some of the Fyre Fest brand’s IP and revealed plans to launch a new music-focused subscription video-on-demand platform. Apparently, this seems to be the deal that just fell through. And just last month, McFarland revealed that he was relaunching Fyre as a Caribbean island getaway in Honduras this September, promising “an experience built for adventurers, creators, and the curious.” Currently, this event appears to still be happening. The ongoing Fyre Fest drama continues after the initial 2017 event collapsed in catastrophic fashion, resulting in a pair of documentaries and McFarland being charged with multiple counts of fraud. Still, in 2023, he put tickets on sale for Fyre Festival 2, at the “First 100” tier price of $499, which promptly sold out despite a lack of location, dates or even a lineup. In 2024, McFarland revealed that the Fyre Fest 2 would happen in April 2025 at an unnamed private island off the coast of Mexico. Claiming at the time to be building out the location to accommodate 3,000 people for a three-day event, he touted that the fest would be more than just music, and include such activities as karate combat. Tickets were priced from $1,400 to an extravagant $1.1 million VIP package. No performers had yet to be booked. By February 2025, McFarland shared new dates for the Fyre Fest 2 (May 30th to June 2nd), and revealed a location: Isla Mujeres in Quintana Roo, Mexico. It wasn’t long before those plans were dashed, however, when the tourism directorate of Isla Mujeres explained having no knowledge of the event, and that it didn’t exist. That revelation didn’t deter former NFL star Antonio Brown from announcing himself as the first act booked for Fyre Fest 2 shortly thereafter. In April of this year, McFarland finally conceded that Fyre Fest 2 had been indefinitely postponed, promising new dates. That same month, Fyre Fest spokesperson Nick Lowe accused Mexican officials of “theft,” claiming they’d given money and been issued permits to proceed with the show. So for anyone who still longs to launch pretty much anything under the less-than-illustrious Fyre Festival brand (perhaps a DIY Ponzi scheme kit?), Billy McFarland is ready to listen.",
