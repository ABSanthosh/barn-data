  "text": "Sick Of It All vocalist Lou Koller was originally diagnosed with cancer in June 2024. After months of treatment for the condition and clearly some excellent doctors, Koller has announced he's officially cancer free! In a new post on his social media, Koller said he still needs to keep getting tested to make sure everything is cool, but he's been given the all-clear. Which is phenomenal news! \"Quick up date!! So happy to report I am cancer free!!! I still have to go for scans every six months for a couple years but right now I’m all good! Tim to continue the recovery and healing! Thank you all for your prayers and positive thoughts and well wishes + your support.\" In the video itself, Koller added: \"Hey everybody, what's up? I got some good news for everyone. I got my test results back — the scan results — I mean, and it turns out, it looks like there's nothing left, no more cancer. So I'm officially cancer-free right now. Thank God for that. And thank you all for your positive vibes, your prayers, all your well wishes. Thank you so much for all your support. And I'm really happy about this, now I can get on to trying to get myself back to normal, cause of this chicken neck and all this stuff. And thank you, that's all I can say. I'm really happy. \"I still have to go for a new scan every six months for the next couple years to make sure it's still out of me, but as of now I'm cancer free. Thank you everybody so much.\" Quick up date!! So happy to report I am cancer free!!! I still have to go for scans every six months for a couple years but right now I’m all good!
