What Is Paul McCartney’s 2025 Tour? Paul McCartney launched his “Got Back” tour in April 2022, which then served as his first series of live shows since 2019. The tour derives its name from The Beatles’ “Get Back,” itself the title of the group’s 2021 Disney+ documentary depicting the behind-the-scenes making of Let It Be.  McCartney completed a North American leg in 2022, brought the run to Australia, Mexico, and Brazil in 2023, and continued with more South American shows in 2024. Now, after McCartney’s thrilling trio of underplays at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City earlier this year (concluding with an appearance on SNL’s 50th Anniversary Special), McCartney will return this fall for another stretch of concerts in the US and Canada. The run begins in Palm Desert, California on September 29th, and continues with performances in arenas and stadiums in cities like Las Vegas, Denver, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Atlanta, Nashville, Columbus, Buffalo, and Montreal. He’ll wrap up the trek with two nights at Chicago’s United Center on November 24th and 25th. Meanwhile, McCartney will also play his first-ever concert in Albuquerque, New Mexico on October 7th. See the full list of tour dates below. What Is the Setlist for Paul McCartney’s 2025 Tour? McCartney is known for mixing in songs from his entire career — The Beatles, Wings, and his solo albums — and rarely plays less than two hours. While his exact setlist for the 2025 run is yet to be revealed, he did perform a handful of staples during his three-night run in New York this year. Beatles favorites like “Blackbird,” “Got to Get You Into My Life,” “Hey Jude,” “Let It Be,” “Get Back” and “I’ve Just Seen a Face” were all played, with Wings hits like “Jet,” “Let Me Roll It,” and “Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five” being performed each night as well. He also played “Now and Then,” which serves as The Beatles’ “final song” and garnered some major nominations and wins at the 2025 Grammys. McCartney typically ends his shows with The Beatles’ ending medley from Abby Road: “Golden Slumbers,” “Carry That Weight,” and “The End.” It’s unknown if McCartney will reprise the same collection of songs this go around, and The Beatle indeed loves a surprise or two.
