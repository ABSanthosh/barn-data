  "text": "Ryan Coogler’s critically acclaimed vampire flick Sinners has absolutely been killing it at the box office, especially for an original, R-rated movie. Thankfully for fans impatiently waiting to watch the film at home, it’s now officially available to pre-order on a variety of physical and digital formats. Though no release date has been revealed yet, Sinners is available for pre-order on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD. Additionally, there is a limited edition Steelbook version, which includes the 4K copy, up for pre-order. Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, and Jack O’Connell, among others, and follows two twin brothers in 1932 as they attempt to open up a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown. The only problem — beyond their gangster connections, Jim Crow, the KKK, etc. — is that a pack of vampires happens upon the place on opening night. “With Sinners, Coogler confirms that he has a real talent for exploring and reinventing genres, while still telling a story that feels wholly original,” Consequence Senior Entertainment Editor Liz Shannon Miller wrote in her review of the movie. For more on Sinners, check out our interview with Jerry Cantrell, who collaborated with composer Ludwig Göransson on the original song “In Moonlight.” Sinners is in theaters now.",
