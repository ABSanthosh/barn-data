  "text": "Lamb Of God vocalist Randy Blythe has announced his new memoir Just Beyond The Light: Making Peace With The Wars Inside Our Head for February 18, 2025. The memoir is a contrast to his bestselling debut memoir Dark Days, which was obviously much darker in tone and chronicles his time in a Czech Republic prison. In his own words, Just Beyond The Light is a \"tight, concise roadmap of how I have attempted to maintain what I believe to be a proper perspective in life, even during difficult times.\" \"For me, the single most gratifying aspect of being an artist is learning that your work has been useful to others in some way. I've been told by lots of readers that my last book, Dark Days, helped them – I hope Just Beyond the Light does the same,\" added Blythe. \"In chaotic times, Randy's outlook is a bulwark against despair. His perspective is hard-earned, and Just Beyond the Light reminds us that we can all work daily to achieve balance in our lives and strive to implement it in the world,\" says Ben Schafer, Executive Editor, Grand Central Publishing. While you're waiting, I strongly suggest checking out Dark Days. Blythe does a great job telling the story and certainly isn't afraid to get gruesome where it's warranted. The memoir follows Blythe's incarceration in the Pankrác Prison in Prague, a notorious 123-year-old institution where the Nazis' torture units had set up camp during the German occupation of then-Czechoslovakia. The jailing came after a 19-year-old fan died of injuries suffered at a Lamb Of God show in Prague, of which Blythe was ultimately found innocent. Want More Metal?
