  "text": "Jack Nicholson may still be a household name, but his public appearances are becoming more and more rare. Now less of an on-the-town movie star and more of a “I’d rather sit under a tree and read a book than act” retiree, it’s been two years since he has been photographed — a streak broken this week thanks to an Instagram post from his daughter. Sharing photos from this past holiday season, Lorraine Nicholson included a shot of her and her 87-year-old father, who appears a bit more clean-cut than he was when he was last seen in public at a Lakers game in 2023. In the background, you can see what is presumably a portion of the elder Nicholson’s library, with shelves of books, several black-and-white portraits, and, of course, a number of prestigious Hollywood awards on the top shelf. Check out the image below (it’s a carousel post — the pic of Jack is the ninth slide). Nicholson’s acting career began in 1958, and came to a close in 2010 after he appeared in the romantic comedy How Do You Know alongside Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, and Paul Rudd. Photos of him now are scarce, but there’s still plenty of vintage Jack Nicholson to go around. In fact, later this month you’ll be able to see him in Chinatown, which will be re-released in 4K Ultra HD on January 14th. Pre-orders are ongoing.",
