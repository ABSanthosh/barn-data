  "text": "Timothée Chalamet is coming off a critically acclaimed portrayal of Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown, but he once rapped as Timmy Tim during a high school talent show performance. Chalamet brought that same chaotic energy to a new Nardwuar interview, showing off his deep preparation for playing Dylan and expressing his appreciation for hip-hop. Filmed at Record Surplus in Santa Monica, California, the interview began with our Film Performer of the Year rolling on the floor to meet Nardwuar. He then read a Minnesota proclamation in its entirety while channeling the Micro Machines guy. With the tone set, Nardwuar gifted Chalamet with a record by the rapper and actor formerly known as Common Sense, whom he praised as an inspiration to idols like Kid Cudi and Lupe Fiasco. After a brief detour into an early role in Law \u0026 Order, Nardwuar skillfully connected Chalamet’s Times Square viewing of The Dark Knight with Heath Ledger’s own portrayal of Dylan in I’m Not There. Then, the Dylan nerd-off began, with Nardwuar setting the table for Chalamet to drop gems about the folk musician for the next 20 minutes or so. Elsewhere in the interview, Chalamet remembered being known as Soccer Timmy in his apartment building, thanked his drama teacher at LaGuardia High School for allowing his rap performances, and gushed over Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, and Lauryn Hill. He also described being knighted by rapper Lil B, whom he credited for having a successful acting career. “I met him at NYU. I had $50 from a commercial I did, I bribed a kid to give me his ticket,” Chalamet said. “I was in there alone, front row to the right. I raised my hand, I got called on by him, [and] I told him I was going to ask out a crush.” Chalamet continued, “He invited me on stage and he knighted me. And honestly, he said, ‘That boy’s hands been blessed,’ and from there, my acting career took off. I was struggling before that… and then I was nominated for an Oscar by the time I was 22.” Keep on rocking in the free world, and watch the full interview below. Earlier this month, Chalamet appeared on ESPN and impressed the College GameDay crew with his wealth of knowledge.
