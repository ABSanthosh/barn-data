  "text": "The Atlanta rapper sent out a disturbing message before deciding to delete his X \u0026 Instagram accounts. Offset at the GQ Bowl held at Hotel Peter and Paul on February 7, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Christopher Polk Offset doesn’t seem too happy about Cardi B and New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs going public over the weekend. The new couple went viral when videos of a yacht party surfaced just as the NFL’s organized team activities were starting up, and while the team activities weren’t mandatory, Diggs’ absence was frowned upon by his head coach Mike Vrabel because it’s his first season with the Pats. Offset also wasn’t the biggest fan of the videos, tweeting, “Good roll out n PR.” He has since deactivated his X account and his Instagram account after letting off a string of X posts earlier Tuesday that someone may get hurt seemingly over a picture floating around that suggests his and Cardi’s son Wave has the same hairstyle as Diggs. “Now when somebody die for playing with my son then call me the crash out,” he wrote in a since-deleted message. “Idc how I look trolling wit my kid ends bad.” Offset and Cardi B are currently in the midst of a messy divorce, in which the former Migos member asked for spousal support, prompting a vitriolic reaction from the Bronx rapper on X Spaces where she said she wanted him to “die slow.” Cardi also said Offset’s alleged cheating, lies and gaslighting affected her third pregnancy in negative ways. “It’s more than the cheating,” she claimed on X Spaces. “It’s the constant lies, the gaslighting — it was really messing up my with my head … I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. My baby came out five pounds. A healthy baby. My baby came out five pounds, because I couldn’t eat, I was so depressed.” The couple were married for six years and have three children together.
