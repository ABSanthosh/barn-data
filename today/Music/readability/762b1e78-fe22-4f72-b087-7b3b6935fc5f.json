  "text": "This week saw the release of \"transatlantic deathcore\" band Face Yourself's newest single, \"Predatory,\" alongside an accompanying music video. The deathcore six-piece are relatively new to the scene, with their first EP having been released in 2023. But, after their first EP dropped, the band continued to drop another two EPs in the same year. Face Yourself consists of French-native, dirty vocalist Yasmin Liverneaux, and American-natives Eric DiCarlo on drums, Thomas Cardone on guitar, Corey Doremus on guitars and backing vocals, Dave Ricco on lead guitar, and Kyle Muenzner on bass and backing vocals. Alongside the single and music video release, Face Yourself also announced their brand new EP, Martyr, out on April 18th via Sumerian Records. Their first release with Sumerian is bound to be a good one. You can pre-save the five-track EP here. Want More Metal?
