  "text": "Arcade Fire have announced their first album since frontman Win Butler was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women in 2022. Pink Elephant, out May 9 via Columbia, was produced by Butler and Régine Chassagne alongside Daniel Lanois; the lineup remains as it has been since Will Butler left the group in 2022. A new song, “Year of the Snake,” and its video are out today. Another song, “Cars \u0026 Telephones,” came out on the band’s Circle of Trust app last week but will not feature on the album.Arcade Fire’s last album, WE, came out in May 2022. Three months later, multiple women came forward in a report published by Pitchfork accusing Win Butler of sexual misconduct. After the initial report, an additional woman came forward with allegations of “manipulative, toxic” behavior against Butler. The musician, who is married to his bandmate Chassagne, acknowledged that he had extramarital relationships and maintained that the experiences were consensual.Following the report, Arcade Fire continued their tour in support of WE. They did, however, lose Feist as an opener in Europe. Arcade Fire have since played numerous festivals and concerts, including ones to mark the anniversary of Funeral. The band also appeared on SNL50: The Homecoming Concert, performing with David Byrne, St. Vincent, and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.",
