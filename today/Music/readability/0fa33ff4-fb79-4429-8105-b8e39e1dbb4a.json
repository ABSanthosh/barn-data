  "text": "Grave – currently featuring original frontman Ola Lindgren, drummer Jensa Paulsson who originally played for Grave between 1988 and 2002; bassist Jonas Torndal who originally played for Grave between 1989 and 1992; and guitarist and vocalist Jörgen Sandström, who originally played for Grave between 1988 and 1995 – has announced their first official reunion show of 2025! Grave will kick off their reunion shows with a set on April 5 at Kulturhuset in Stockholm, Sweden. Grave will also play Germany's Party.San Metal Open Air, Czech Republic's Brutal Assault, Switzerland's Metal Storm Over Luzern and The Netherlands' Graveland Festival throughout the year, with potentially more shows on the way! As it stands right now, all the reunion shows will feature Grave playing material from their first three albums – Into the Grave, You'll Never See…, and Soulless. So it should be one hell of a ripping good time. On the reunion, Lindgren commented back in August: \"Many thanks to all of you who commented on last weeks announcement and who are as excited about this as we are. Lets bring some clarity to what this 'reunion' is about. So early this year I was approached by the other 3 original members for a meeting. It resulted in the plan to do a couple of rehearsals for fun to see if we were first of all capable and also of course if we enjoyed jamming again. \"I would say that playing together after all these decades went far beyond anyone's expectations so we decided to try get some shows booked and here we are. This is initially a plan for festival shows during 2025. At the moment there are no plans to do any touring or recording new material with this lineup but who knows where this might lead us… \"The Grave that imploded last year is not dead and buried, it is simply put on ice.[longtime drummer Tomas Lagrén] is definitely not fired from the band and it will be his decision if he wants to be a part of any future Grave endevours when that time comes.\" Want More Metal?
