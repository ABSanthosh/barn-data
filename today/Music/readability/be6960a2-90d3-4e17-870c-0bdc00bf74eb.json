  "text": "Following the high praise of Oppenheimer, acclaimed director Christopher Nolan seems to be at the height of his powers. Luckily for fans excitedly waiting for his next project, Universal Pictures has officially announced that it will be an adaptation of Homer’s epic The Odyssey. Unfortunately for fans, it’s not set for release until 2026. “Christopher Nolan’s next film The Odyssey is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” the official Universal Pictures Twitter account posted. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.” The details follow reports from earlier this month that Nolan had pitched the likes of Tom Holland, Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Charlize Theron, and others to be a part of his next flick. As Holland stated on The Dish podcast, however, the filmmaker had shared very few details about what the project would entail. “To be perfectly honest, I don’t really know what it’s about,” the Spider-Man actor revealed. “I’m super excited, but it’s been pretty quiet about the project. I met with [Nolan] and it was awesome. He kind of loosely pitched what it is, and I’m sure when he’s ready he’ll announce what it’s about” As evidenced by the announcement, it seems that Nolan is ready. According to Deadline, The Odyssey is expected to start shooting in early 2025. It’ll serve as the director’s second film for Universal Pictures. Homer’s The Odyssey is an epic poem composed around 8th century BCE. Its importance to the field of literature and greater storytelling is immense, representing one of the most well-known pieces of the classical cannon. It has previously been adapted for the screen via projects like the 1954 Italian film Ulysses and the 1997 miniseries The Odyssey. The poem has also served as the basis for several other creative works, like the Coen Brothers’ 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou? Revisit our full review of Oppenheimer and see where it landed on our ranking of every Christopher Nolan movie. Additionally, Nolan’s 2014 movie Interstellar recently received a new collector’s box set edition to coincide with its 10th anniversary IMAX re-release; pick up a copy here.",
