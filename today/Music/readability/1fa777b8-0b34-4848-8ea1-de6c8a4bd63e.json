  "text": "Godsmack recently split with drummer Shannon Larkin and guitarist Tony Rombola, and recruited bassist Sam Bam Koltun and drummer Will Hunt for future live shows. Though it doesn't sound like there will be many more of those in the near future. According to frontman Sully Erna in an interview with Hammer World, Godsmack is likely going on a year-long hiatus now that their tour dates are all wrapped up. \"After this European tour, we're taking a full year off. I'll probably start something new during that time — I just don't know what yet. I usually work on Godsmack for a certain amount of time, and then when we take a break, I shift to solo stuff. I think I might do that again. \"This year is a bit of a mystery, but I've started getting some offers to focus on TV and film. I'm getting more and more involved in it, so I think I'm going to pursue that a little bit and see where it goes. I might end up writing music for movies or even acting again. I've done that before and I really enjoyed it, so I'd like to do more. I'm definitely exploring other things besides Godsmack to keep me occupied while we figure out what's next for the band. Right now, I honestly don't know.” Erna went on to add: \"What I do know is there's been a resurgence of Godsmack. When we come out now, we're playing to bigger and bigger audiences. We did Sofia, Bulgaria — sold out in two days, over 13,000 people. Romania was big and so was Poland. There's this new interest in the band again, and we're seeing a younger generation growing up listening to us. A lot of young kids are coming to our shows now, along with their parents. It's wild. \"We've survived so much over the years, gone through tough times, and we're still here. We're still relevant and writing good music. People keep coming to the shows, the band hasn't stopped growing, and I couldn't be happier. It's nice to just get back to playing again without any obligations. \"We're not promoting a new record or anything right now. We're just promoting the brand, the legacy. We're doing these greatest hits shows and playing music simply because we love it. We're back in control again — not the record labels, not the management company. Godsmack is back in control, and that, to me, is the greatest gift.\" Want More Metal?
