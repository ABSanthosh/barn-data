  "text": "Lead singer of Calva Louise, Jess Allanic, is the directorial vision within the band – she drafted many of the stories Calva Louise write about from a young age – and their newest single and its music video is no different. She conceptualized, directed, edited, designed, and colored their newest music video for \"Impeccable.\" \"Impeccable\" follows in the footsteps of five other adventurous and futuristic singles off the band's upcoming record, Edge Of The Abyss, out July 11th via Mascot Records. The 11-track record is meant to explore the use of fiction as an escape from reality, with Allanic's interest in science fiction and dystopias taking center-stage as she uses them to grapple with the world around her. Growing up in Venezuela's worst economic and financial crisis, Allanic fled to France at just 15 where she lived in a convent with nuns who would chastise her for playing System Of A Down on her guitar, crafting stories of her own. Now, living on The Edge of The Abyss, the three-piece have had their fair share of trials and tribulations and are getting ready to release their next record. \"Impeccable\" features textured synthesizers and an ode to Allanic's native tongue before a raunchy breakdown. Calva Louise explains in the video's caption, \"\"Impeccable\" tells the story of a young man called Jonnie, who after being deadly poisoned has no other choice but to act with impeccability in order to survive. For this, he will have to follow his double into another world, the Fractalworld, or death will strike him with certainty. Jonnie will have to quickly understand who his double is, as well as cross over the threshold to overcome his fate. Impeccable is the direct sequel of WTF, where the main character Louise has her first encounter with her double.\" You can watch the music video above, pre-order The Edge Of The Abyss here, and check out the tracklist below.
