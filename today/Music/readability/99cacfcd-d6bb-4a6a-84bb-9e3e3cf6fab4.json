  "text": "The provocative song is Peso's first solo release since dropping Éxodo earlier this summer. Peso Pluma isn’t wrapping up the year just yet. The Mexican music star unleashed the introspective yet provocative “Gervonta,” a corrido that finds Peso reflecting on his own journey to stardom. The nearly three-minute song kicks off with a slow and somber beat and then quickly transitions into a more uptempo, multi-instrumental sound that has characterized Peso’s corrido tumbado style. The title is a nod to American boxer Gervonta “Tank” Davis, a former three-division world champion who has held the World Boxing Association lightweight title since 2023. (Peso Pluma translates to lightweight in Spanish.) The professional athlete even reposted the new song’s cover art on his own Instagram Stories. In the flashy “Gervonta,” Peso sings about an extravagant lifestyle, one that thrives on wealth, travel and indulgence. It’s a theme Peso is familiar with, and one he’s explored in previous songs, including in his latest album Éxodo, which he released in June. The LP — featuring collabs with Cardi B, Ivan Cornejo and Quavo, to name a few — peaked at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart for 12 weeks. On the Billboard 200, the set earned a No. 5 spot. The album also landed in the top five of Spotify’s most-streamed Global Latin Albums, according to 2024 Spotify Wrapped, while Peso was the second most streamed Latin artist globally in 2024 after Bad Bunny. Trending on Billboard Peso Pluma’s Éxodo is up for best música mexicana album (including Tejano) at the Grammys, taking place Feb. 2. He’s up against Carín León (Boca Chueca, Vol. 1), Jessi Uribe (De Lejitos) and Chiquis (Diamantes). Below, stream Peso Pluma’s “Gervonta.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
