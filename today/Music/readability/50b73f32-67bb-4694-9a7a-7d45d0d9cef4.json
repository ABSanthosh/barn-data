  "text": "System Of A Down is teasing something on all their social media. After announcing six shows with Korn, Deftones, and Avenged Sevenfold last week, System Of A Down has now posted a brief teaser on all their social media featuring their 2001 track \"Chop Suey!\". The video only features an eye opening with the lyrics \"WAKE UP!\" flashing on the screen at the end. Clicking on the tease on the System Of A Down website only takes you to the band's mailing list \"to be the first to know about the latest news, tour updates, and exclusive merch from System Of A Down.\" Which doesn't really tell us much. My first thought was maybe this has something to do with a Toxicity anniversary considering the inclusion of \"Chop Suey!\", but that wouldn't really make sense – Toxicity turns 24 years old in 2025. Hardly an anniversary that warrants a tour. There's also a small part of me that hopes this has something to do with new music, but that always seems like a pipe dream. Plus y'know, it's got an old song in it. So stay tuned! System Of A Down is doing something and we don't know what it is. System Of A Down's 2025 shows are as follows (so far).
