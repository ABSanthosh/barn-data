  "text": "Sky Ferreira is back with her first new music since 2022. The new song, “Leash,” was written specifically for the upcoming A24 movie Babygirl, starring Nicole Kidman. Co-written by Ferreira and Jorge Elbrecht, “Leash” features lyrics about working through shame, feeling trapped, and fighting for yourself to persevere. Listen to “Leash (Babygirl Original Soundtrack)” below.In a new interview with Keaton Bell for Vogue, Ferreira discussed how her “fraught” relationship with Capitol Records, her former label, “kept me from putting out new music for 10 years,” her plans to self-release another new song in 2025, and why she recorded a track for Babygirl in the first place. “[Nicole Kidman’s] character is very self-destructive and destructive with other people’s lives, but she kinda has to go through this whole experience for the sake of growing as a person,” said Ferreira. “I think that’s why I connected to the material so much, even though my circumstances are so different from the world of the film.”Ferreira previously claimed that she has repeatedly “tried” to release her music over the years, a situation she describes as “beyond fucked up.” Last year, fans who run the social media campaign “Free Sky Ferreira” bought a digital billboard in Times Square to demand that Capitol Records stops holding her “hostage” and “blocking” the release of Masochism, her sophomore album that’s been teased since 2015. After that stint, Ferreira was removed from the Capitol Records artist roster on the label’s website.After releasing her 2013 debut album, Night Time, My Time, Ferreira put out “Downhill Lullaby,” in 2019, and “Don’t Forget,” in 2022. She made a surprise appearance during Kevin Abstract’s Coachella set earlier this year, too, where she covered “Need You Now” by Lady A.Revisit Pitchfork’s Cover Story “Sky Ferreira Returns.”",
