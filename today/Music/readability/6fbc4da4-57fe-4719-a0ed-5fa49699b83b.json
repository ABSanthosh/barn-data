  "text": "Casey Chaos, real name Karim George Chmielinski, has died at 54 years old. Chaos fronted Amen between 1994 and 2009, and then again between 2014 and present day. You might also know Chaos as one of the guest DJs on Queens Of The Stone Age's classic 2002 album Songs For The Deaf. News of Chaos' death comes from Cleopatra Records founder and CEO Brian Perera. We extend our condolences to Chaos' friends and family at this time. \"With heartfelt sadness, I extend my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Casey Chaos,\" wrote Perera via Blabbermouth. \"I had the privilege of working with Casey during his unforgettable live performance with Christian Death at the American Legion Hall back in 1993. Walking into the hall with my good friend Matt Green and my wife, Yvonne, was an experience I'll never forget — especially seeing Nicolas Cage sitting front-row center, completely captivated. \"Casey wasn't just an extraordinary musician—he truly lived and breathed the lifestyle. May he rest in peace alongside Rozz Williams and the many tortured souls we admire and respect.\" Chaos' death was further confirmed by Los Angeles musician and friend of Chaos, Skum Love: I am really thrown back right now. I don't know what to think. What to say. One of my good friends and in some ways someone who I look up to as a performer just passed away. Casey Chaos I'm gonna miss you. I love you. Thank you for always being a big support of what I did. You know I was your biggest fan and friend. RIP\".\" Want More Metal?
