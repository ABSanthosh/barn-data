  "text": "It appears Violet Grohl is set to release her debut album in the near future. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the eldest daughter of Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl has been “incredibly committed” to making full use of the studio space she received as a birthday gift from her father. Producer Justin Raisen (Kim Gordon, Charli XCX, Sky Ferreira) is among her collaborators. It’s believed the 18-year-old Grohl has enough material recorded for a full album, but details like a release date and record label are unclear at this time. Of course, her dad’s own Roswell imprint under RCA Records is a possibility. Since making her on-stage debut in 2018, Violet has toured with Foo Fighters as a backing vocalist, but has also proven capable of standing on her own in recent years. In 2022, Grohl paid tribute to Jeff Buckley and Amy Winehouse at the Taylor Hawkins tribute concert in London and covered “Hallelujah” at the Los Angeles show. More recently, she has frequented the intimate Sun Rose venue in Los Angeles. Just over a year ago, she joined David Bowie pianist Mike Garson at the West Hollywood venue to perform Bowie cover songs. During the concert, she also dueted with her father on “Show Me How” from Foo Fighters’ latest album, But Here We Are. Grohl reprised that set this past February, delivering a moody performance of “Heart-Shaped Box” by her father’s former band Nirvana. Watch fan-shot footage below.",
