  "text": "If you ever thought the seven-and-a-half-minute runtime for Oasis’ “Champagne Supernova” was simply not enough, Noel Gallagher has you covered with a six-hour version of the hit created for a London art gallery. Later this month, Gallagher’s reworked six-hour ambient track will be played alongside a portrait of the artist being displayed as part of photographer Zoe Law’s Legends exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Get Oasis Reunion Tickets Here Per The Independent, the exhibit features 100 black-and-white portraits taken by Law of people who have influenced her life and career. It will also include a never-before-seen portrait of actor Sienna Miller posing with the 1967 Epiphone guitar Gallagher used to write “Champagne Supernova.” Other subjects include World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton, actor Orlando Bloom, and Sex in the City star Kim Cattrall. Next year, Oasis will reunite for their first shows since 2009, playing the UK and Ireland, Australia, North America, and South America. Editor’s Note: Here are 10 deep cuts we’d love to see Oasis play on their reunion tour.",
