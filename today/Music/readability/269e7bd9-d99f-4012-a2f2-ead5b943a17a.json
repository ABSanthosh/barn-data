Scott Legato/Getty Images Former Eagles guitarist, Don Felder, is recovering after he was abruptly rushed offstage after a medical emergency during a Rock Legends Cruise performance. In a video shared by an attendee and posted by TMZ, the musician is seen introducing the Eagles classic, “Tequila Sunrise,” sharing the inspiration behind the song before he began strumming his guitar to perform it. He then appears to look to crew members on the side stage and lose balance, before a member of his team and his bandmates helped escort him offstage. The crowd cheered in support for the rocker before the video ends. Explore Explore the eagles See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Following the medical emergency, his team shared an update on his Instagram Stories. “We appreciate everyone’s concern regarding Don Felder’s abrupt stop to his show last night on the Rock Legends Cruise,” the statement reads. “After receiving medical attention he was deemed to be suffering from dehydration. He was given fluids, and is feeling much better.” Trending on Billboard The statement continued that the remainder of Felder’s cruise performances will be rescheduled to “ensure he has ample time to rehydrate and recover fully,” before concluding, “Thank you for your understanding and remember – drink your water!” See the post here. 77-year-old Felder performed with the Eagles from 1974 to 2001, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the band in 1998. After his departure from the group, he filed two lawsuits alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, though the case was settled in 2007. Felder published the book, Heaven and Hell: My Life in The Eagles, in November 2007. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
