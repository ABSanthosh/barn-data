  "text": "Coachella 2025 has come and gone, and now, all eyes are on Coachella 2026. The longtime Indio, California festival will be celebrating its 25th edition in 2026, with Weekend 1 going down from April 10th-12th and Weekend 2 going down from April 17th-19th. Find our guide to buying tickets to Coachella 2026, including on-sale times, pass types, changes between Weekend 1 and 2, and more. Get Coachella 2026 Tickets Here When Does Coachella 2026 Go On-Sale? Passes for Coachella 2026 will go on sale on Friday, May 2nd beginning at 11:00 a.m. PST via Coachella’s official website. The upcoming sale is just the advance sale; when the lineup arrives (usually in January, though for 2025 it came in late November), there will be another general sale. The advance sale is limited, so once tickets sell out, fans can get Coachella passes via StubHub, where orders are 110% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. StubHub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand. What Types of Passes Are Available at Coachella 2026, and How Much Do They Cost? Coachella 2026 will once again offer 3-Day passes only — meaning they will not be selling single day passes for individual days at the festival. Coachella offers a GA tier as well as a VIP tier. While VIP has been expanded in recent years, it doesn’t guarantee pit access to the Coachella’s various stages, unlike other festivals. VIP does, however, have a dedicated entry and exit lane, access to preferred parking, special food and drink options, a private entry lane for the Yuma tent, and enclosed areas by the Coachella Stage, Outdoor Stage, Sahara Tent, and Mojave Tent. For this year, passes for Weekend 1 are slightly more expensive than Weekend 2. Meanwhile, for those staying in hotels, Coachella also offers the option to bundle your festival pass with a shuttle pass. See below for each tier of passes for the upcoming advance sale: 3-Day GA (Weekend 1): $599 ($549 + $50 fees) 3-Day GA (Weekend 2): $549 ($499 + $50 fees) 3-Day GA + Shuttle Pass (Weekend 1): $729 ($679 + $50 fees) 3-Day GA + Shuttle Pass (Weekend 2): $679 ($629 + $50 fees) 3-Day VIP (Weekend 1): $1,299 ($1,169 + $130 fees) 3-Day VIP (Weekend 2): $1,199 ($1,069 + $130 fees) What Is the Difference Between Coachella Weekend 1 and Coachella Weekend 2? For the first time since the festival extended to two weekends in 2012, Coachella Weekend 1 is now more expensive than Coachella Weekend 2; it is unknown if Weekend 1 will revert back to the original price when the general sale occurs after the 2026 lineup drops. The price hike can be attributed to several factors. For one, the grass is literally greener during Weekend 1; the groundskeepers do an ample job of rehabilitating the Empire Polo Club’s fields between weekends, but it’s a challenge when thousands of people tread on fresh-cut grass during the first weekend. Meanwhile, Weekend 1 also has a higher percentage of livestream viewers, and to that end, a typically-larger percentage of special guests. The Quasar and DoLab stages rotate acts each weekend, and Coachella’s recent “surprise set time adds” — which were Weezer (Weekend 1) and Ed Sheeran (Weekend 2) this year — are typically split as well. Beyond that, though, both weekends feature roughly the same lineup, headliners and all.photo courtesy of Coachella Can I Buy Tickets for Coachella 2026 Using a Payment Plan? Yes — you won’t be alone, either, as a new study revealed that more than half of Coachella 2025 attendees financed their passes via a payment plan. Coachella offers a special payment plan for its upcoming May 2025 advance sale. For plans initiated from May 2nd to May 15th, 2025, attendees can pay $49 down at checkout, plus 8 equal payments of $55 with no added interest (starting May 16th) through December 15, 2025. For plans initiated from May 16th to May 31st, attendees can pay $49 down at checkout, plus 7 equal payments of $55 with no added interest (starting June 1st) through December 15, 2025. See Coachella’s website for more details about payment plans. Is There Camping at Coachella? Coachella offers several camping tiers, with each sold separately from passes to the festival itself. See below for the various camping tiers, their prices, and what they offer: Car Camping: $160 ($150 + $10 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — The O.G., standard car camping experience at Coachella. Group Car Camping: $160 ($150 + $10 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — The standard car camping experience with the option to arrive separate from your group and camp together on plot laid out specifically for your party. Preferred Car Camping: $420 ($400 + $20 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — Guarantees a camping spot close to the festival entrance. Preferred Front Row Car Camping: $520 ($500 + $20 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — Guarantees a camping spot in the front row of car camping, just steps away from the festival entrance. Powered Car Camping: $620 ($595 + $25 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — Car camping in a guaranteed spot with a power outlet and access to upgraded restroom and shower facilities. Ready-Set Tent Camping: $690 ($665 + $25 fees) + Transient Occupancy Tax — Camping in a pre-set limited-edition Coachella souvenir tent. La Campana Camping: $2,600 for 1 Queen or 2 Twins, $3,300 for 2 Queens or 4 Twins — A little bit of glamping, with real beds in private, temperature-controlled tents. Lake El Dorado Camping: $2,300 (2 Person)/$3,000 (4 Person) — Private, secluded, ready-to-go camping lodges. Safari Camping: $10,000 — The ultimate Coachella glamping experience with guest passes, golf carts, and much more. Camping in the Desert Sounds Hard. Can I Stay in a Hotel Instead? There are many different hotels to stay at near Coachella. The festival itself offers various Travel and Hotel Packages through Valley Music Travel; these packages come with shuttle passes as well (the exact shuttle schedule will be announced at a later date). Otherwise, there are lots of hotels within driving distance to the festival in Indio, Palm Desert, La Quinta, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Palm Springs, and more. If you’re planning a trip for Coachella 2026, you can save 15% off travel and accommodations through Booking.com. Who Is Playing Coachella 2026? The lineup for Coachella 2026 is unknown at this time. As stated, the Coachella lineup usually arrives in early January; maybe there was something in the water at Goldenvoice last fall, though, because the Coachella 2025 lineup arrived two months earlier than it usually does. Perhaps they were attempting to get the general sale going before and around the holidays, as opposed to shortly after the new year. Either way, when the lineup arrives, we’ll update this post with more info. Meanwhile, if you’re still feeling some Coachella FOMO and want to know what it’s like, check out our 2025 recap, where we break down everything you didn’t see on the livestream.",
