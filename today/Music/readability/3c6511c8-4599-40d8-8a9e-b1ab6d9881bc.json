  "text": "Posthumous adoration is already in full swing as Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath's streaming numbers across all platforms – but specifically Spotify – skyrocket, and see growth unlike any other. It's been long known that Black Sabbath is the core, and foundation of heavy metal music. Without them – our genre wouldn't be where it is today. They were the first to perform in the low tunings that they did, lending that creepy affect that Black Sabbath was labelled with during their origins in the late 60s and early 70s, paving a pathway for further exploration of low tuning and rather dark, eerie tones from the bands that followed after. The general public of metalheads are remembering, and some young ones are starting to learn, from the grandfathers of metal in ways they haven't before. According to The Hollywood Reporter, both Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath's catalogs are being consumed in ways they haven't been before. The numbers have grown since the publication of The Hollywood Reporter's article, and have been updated in this article for accuracy. Ozzy Osbourne has gained 7.7 million monthly listeners – he originally had 12.4 million, and now has 20.1 million monthly listeners. Black Sabbath has gained 6.1 million monthly listeners – they originally had 19.8 million, and now has 25.9 million monthly listeners at the time of writing. Osbourne and the band's most famous singles are seeing rapid increase in listens as Osbourne's top three singles increase by over 27 million streams: \"Crazy Train\" has increased by 10 million streams from Tuesday to over 811 million total streams on Spotify (it is Saturday at time of reporting). \"Mama, I'm Coming Home\" has increased by 8.2 million streams to over 246 million total streams on Spotify. \"No More Tears\" has increased by 9 million streams to over 268 million total streams on Spotify. And Black Sabbath's top three singles increase by over 24 million streams: \"Paranoid\" has increased by approximately 10.3 million streams to over 1.39 billion total streams on Spotify. \"War Pigs\" has increased by 6 million streams to over 386 million total streams on Spotify. \"Iron Man\" has increased by 8 million streams to over 589 million total streams on Spotify. With the news of Osbourne's passing, alongside the desire to reminisce, honor, and think of Ozzy, the numbers just show that he may be gone, but will soon not be forgotten. Want More Metal?
