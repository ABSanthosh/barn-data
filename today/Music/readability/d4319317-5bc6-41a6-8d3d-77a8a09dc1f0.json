Keep watching to see how many they know!  Tetris Kelly: We’re gonna play a quick game with Stray Kids, where I’m going to see if you can finish your own lyrics. Are you guys ready for this?  Stray Kids: No!  Tetris Kelly: Okay, here’s the pop quiz. We’re gonna start maybe a little easy here. “Now I’ll always be here. I won’t ever run”  Stray Kids: What on earth?! What? Tetris Kelly: These are your songs. No, this is English. “Now I’ll always be here. I won’t ever run.” Stray Kids: It is “Lose My Breath.” Okay, good job, good job. We got there. We got there. Now “we’re gonna go our own way to places still unknown.”   Stray Kids: I think this is “Stray Kids.  Tetris Kelly: He’s got “Stray Kids,” absolute bop. All right, here we go. Another one. “Show them what you’re made of, your endless nights deserve a loud ovation.” Stray Kids: “Blind Spot” Tetris Kelly: Yes, what comes after that, though? Stray Kids: Oh, wait, “loud ovation, shine bright and prove them wrong, because we feel perfect.” Tetris Kelly: Okay, last two. This one might stump you. Let’s see what we got here. We’re going to go a little deeper. “Locked in sight. We’re in trouble.” Stray Kids: We’re in trouble right now.  Tetris Kelly: You are in trouble. That’s because I went solo on you. Yes, Stray Kids I got this one it’s one “Disconnected.” Keep watching for more!",
