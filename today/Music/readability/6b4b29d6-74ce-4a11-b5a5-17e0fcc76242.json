Justin Bieber attends the Arsenal and Manchester United pre-season friendly soccer match at SoFi Stadium on July 27, 2024 in Inglewood, California. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Justin Bieber is mourning the passing of his maternal grandfather, Bruce Dale. On Saturday (April 26), the 31-year-old pop superstar shared a heartfelt tribute on social media honoring Dale, who died on April 24 at Rotary Hospice Stratford Perth, according to an obituary posted by W.G. Young Funeral Home in Stratford, Ontario. He was 80. “Papa , I always took all ur money lol,” Bieber wrote on Instagram alongside a throwback photo with his grandfather. “I remember u specifically telling me, gramma gave u an allowance of 20 dollars for the WEEK! I would always convince you to spend on snacks at the hockey game on Friday nights.” The “Sorry” singer also fondly recalled the moments they shared together. “Reluctantly you always gave it to me. Corn nuts, skittles, gum balls, chuck a puck, slush puppies … Shout out to the jr b referees Beatty, Fagon, Flanagan lmfao,” he wrote. Bieber went on to remember Dale’s spirited presence at hockey games, saying, “My grandpa wasn’t shy in letting them know that they were being pieces of sh-ts.” “I can’t wait to see u again soon in heaven,” he continued. “Until then I know ur watching down probly still heckling Beatty or Fagon for missing that cross check call in the corner there lmfao.” The “Baby” hitmaker concluded his emotional tribute, writing, “I will miss u. I will ache. And I’ll sit and let myself remember all of the wonderful times we’ve had.” Dale, father of Bieber’s mom, Pattie Mallette, was a longtime supporter of his grandson’s career. He appeared in Bieber’s 2011 documentary, Never Say Never, and shared memories during a 2018 interview at the Stratford Perth Museum, which featured an exhibit dedicated to the pop star. In addition to Justin, Dale’s obituary also mentioned the singer’s wife, Hailey, their son Jack Blues, Dale’s other children, and his wife, Diane. Bieber’s paternal grandfather, George Bieber, passed away in 2021, according to TMZ. See Bieber’s emotional tribute to his grandfather Bruce on Instagram here.
