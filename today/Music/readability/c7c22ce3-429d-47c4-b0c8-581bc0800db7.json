  "text": "METZ have announced they are taking an indefinite hiatus after their upcoming tour of the UK/Europe. “We’ve collectively decided to close this chapter of METZ,” the Canadian punk band’s statement reads in part. “The band will be on ‘indefinite hiatus’ while we take time to focus on other endeavors and enjoy more time at home with our families.” Get METZ Tickets Here The trio continued by referencing their over 15 years as a band and acknowledged their “privilege and pleasure of touring the globe and seeing the world,” which they described as “nothing short of life-affirming.” METZ added that the group has “brought an immeasurable amount of joy to our lives” before thanking their fans and label, Sub Pop. “A special thank you to Sub Pop Records for always believing in us and allowing us to chart our own unconventional path,” METZ wrote. “Sub Pop continues to be a glowing beacon of what is good in this deeply flawed industry, and we will always be grateful for their support and friendship. To work with people we consider family has been a true blessing.” To close out the statement, METZ said they considered themselves “more than a band” and “gave every ounce of ourselves” to the group. “It will be very hard to let it go,” they said. “The intangible feeling of connection, community, and inclusivity that music creates has always been at the heart of what we do and will inevitably be what we miss the most. We will miss singing, screaming, sweating, and dancing with all of you.” “We hope you join us for our final shows and help us celebrate something we will always hold dear,” they concluded. Read the full statement below. Guitarist/vocalist Alex Edkins and drummer Hayden Menzies formed METZ in Ottawa, Ontario, in 2007, and were soon joined by Chuck Saso on bass. When Edkins and Menzies moved to Toronto a year later, however, Saso stayed behind and they found a new bassist in Chris Slorach. Their lineup has remained the same since then. After releasing their 2012 self-titled debut, METZ quickly picked up buzz, playing at New York’s CMJ Music Marathon and earning a spot on the 2013 Polaris Music Prize shortlist. The late, great Steve Albini worked on their third album, 2017’s Strange Peace, which landed them a Juno Award nomination. Earlier this year, METZ released Up on Gravity Hill, their fifth and likely last studio album. The band’s final run begins on November 2nd in Rennes, France, and will include stops in Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and more. See the dates below, and get your tickets here.
