  "text": "Saturday Night Live will re-air its first-ever episode from October 11th, 1975, in celebration of the show’s 50th anniversary on Saturday, February 15th, at 11:00 p.m. ET/PT. The inaugural episode of SNL — then known simply as Saturday Night — was hosted by George Carlin and featured musical guests Billy Preston and Janis Ian. The episode also featured an appearance from comedian Andy Kaufman and a sketch from Muppets creator Jim Henson, as well as SNL cast members Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, and Gilda Radner. The lead-up to the episode was recently dramatized in Jason Reitman’s film, Saturday Night. The rebroadcast of SNL’s first episode is part of a huge celebratory weekend that also includes a Friday night concert from Radio City Music Hall, and a three-hour live primetime special taking place on Sunday, February 16th.",
