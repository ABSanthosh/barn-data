  "text": "Clairo performed at Coachella last night (Saturday, April 12) and her set featured a very special guest: Bernie Sanders. The U.S. Senator from Vermont took the stage to introduce the singer and her band, where he made an impassioned call for youth activism and political engagement. “I'm here to introduce Clairo not just because they are a great band,” Sanders said in his speech. “I'm here because Clairo has used her prominence to fight for women’s rights, to try to end the terrible, brutal war in Gaza, where thousands of women and children are being killed.” Scroll down for more footage of Sanders’ remarks, and rewind the livestream below to watch Clairo’s whole set.Prior to his Coachella appearance yesterday, Sanders hosted a rally in Los Angeles, which featured performances courtesy of Maggie Rogers, Indigo de Souza, Neil Young, and Joan Baez, among others. Last month, another stop on his “Fighting Oligarchy” had him joined by none other than hardcore band The Armed. Clairo released her last album, Charm, in 2024, and has since shared videos for the songs “Juna,” “Sexy to Someone,” and “Terrapin,” the latter of which starred ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic.Read about Charm on “The 50 Best Albums of 2024,” and follow along with all of Pitchfork’s coverage of Coachella 2025.",
