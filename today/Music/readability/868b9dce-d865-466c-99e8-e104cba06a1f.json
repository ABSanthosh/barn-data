  "text": "ZZ Top have been playing without longtime drummer Frank Beard for the past couple months after announcing he was sidelined with a health issue. Now, the band has revealed that Beard will be back for the band’s upcoming North American “Elevation Tour,” as well as the details surrounding his absence. As it turns out, Beard was dealing with foot and ankle issues that have since been remedied. He’ll be back with ZZ Top as they kick off the tour this Sunday (June 1st) in Victoria, British Columbia, and remain with the band throughout the entire run, which wraps up October 9th in Northfield, Ohio. Get ZZ Top Tickets Here ZZ Top singer-guitarist Billy Gibbons stated, “We’re happy that Frank is back with [bassist] Elwood [Francis] and yours truly, BFG. We missed him and are looking forward to turning it up and rocking out with him as has been the case for the last few hundred or so decades. His complete recovery is cause for celebration and that’s just what we intend to do on an open-ended basis. Welcome back, pardner!” Beard has been a member of ZZ Top since 1969, part of the classic trio of Gibbons and late bassist Dusty Hill. The 75-year-old drummer simply remarked, “It’s good to be back. See you out there.” See ZZ Top’s upcoming tour dates below, and pick up tickets here.
