The vinyl-only record features exclusive and unreleased covers by Segall, Shannon \u0026 the Clams, No Age, King Tuff, White Fence, Mikal Cronin, Meatbodies, Shannon Lay, and more. Pre-orders are currently available, and all proceeds go directly to One Voice LA - Fire Relief Fund and California Black Freedom Fund - Black LA Relief \u0026 Recovery Fund.“The idea of doing a comp turned into friends covering each other and we thought that would be a perfect thing to do for some L.A. fire relief charity fundraising,” Segall explained in a statement. “One thing was important—that everyone involved needed to have spent creative time living in L.A. It’s been very fun for everyone involved to cover each other’s music!”L.A. Recovers will be released by Classic Master Sound Recordings, a DIY label started by Ty and Denée Segall in 2021, and pressed to vinyl only once. In order to determine who each artist would cover from the list of compilation contributors, they took turns drawing names out of a hat—but the song choice was up to them.Ty Segall is releasing a new album, Possession, on May 30.
