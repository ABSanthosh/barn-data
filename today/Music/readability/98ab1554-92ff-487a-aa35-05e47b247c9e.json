Zhamira Zhambrano: My glam session has a pretty mixed soundtrack. Sometimes I listen to my own unreleased songs because it’s a moment where I’m alone and can concentrate on what I have to fix for certain songs. I listen to my husband’s music. I listen to Morat. I listen to songs in English. I think if you ask me right now, Karol G. I really like her style lately in her performances. Beyond her style, I really like her self-confidence that she shows in front of the cameras because that’s how you can get to know her and I think she’s a person who always looks beautiful, elegant and who’s super confident in herself. I have always said that if you feel beautiful inside, that is what you will radiate outwards. In my case, I try to work on that a lot with myself and involve it in the studio. When I am creating, I am always thinking about how the person or in this case, the woman who listens to this will feel, or even the man, too, because men can also feel beautiful and powerful. I think that as long as you carry a message of positivity, in my personal case, that’s what I try to radiate in the studio through the music with beautiful and motivational words, healthy and clean messages that reach the heart. You will feel good.",
