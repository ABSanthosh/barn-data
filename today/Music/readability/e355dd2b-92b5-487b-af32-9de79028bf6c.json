  "text": "If you watched Monday Night RAW on November 11, you might've noticed that Damian Priest's entrance song \"Rise Of The Night\" sounded a little heavier. It's because Kerry King made it that way. The original was written by WWE music production company def rebel, and it was still pretty damn heavy – but y'know, King has that touch. Check it out below alongside footage via Priest, who wrote: \"Shout out to the legend Kerry King for adding some of his genius to my theme. Love it!\" It also makes sense for King to contribute to Priest's entrance theme, as Priest is a pretty big metal fan. In a recent interview with Metal Hammer, Priest said he's been taking some recommendations from fellow WWE wrestler Rhea Ripley alongside jamming some of the stuff he's always loved. \"I try to mix it up. Rhea has got me more into Motionless In White and Ice Nine Kills, bands that I heard of but just didn't listen to, but now they're on every playlist I have, which is kinda cool. I like Soilwork's new stuff a lot – a lot, actually – it's on repeat at this point. I'm a big fan of Trivium. I've mentioned In Flames; they went through a phase where they were trying to find their new sound, and man do they got it now. That melodic death, but they figured out a way to do it. It's fire.\" Want More Metal? Subscribe To Our Daily Newsletter Enter your information below to get a daily update with all of our headlines and receive The Orchard Metal newsletter.",
