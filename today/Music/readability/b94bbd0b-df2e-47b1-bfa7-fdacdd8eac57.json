  "text": "Jonny Greenwood has poured cold water on the notion of a Radiohead reunion next year, saying the band has “no plans” for 2025. In a new interview with NME, Greenwood spoke about Radiohead reconvening for rehearsals over the summer, describing the sessions as “fun and natural.” When asked if he could “imagine” Radiohead releasing new music or playing live shows in 2025, Greenwood responded, “There are no plans — we’ve lots of individual projects going on at the moment.” Get Thom Yorke Tickets Here Indeed, Greenwood and Thom Yorke have been quite busy with The Smile, their Radiohead spinoff with drummer Tom Skinner. The trio has released two albums this year, Wall of Eyes and Cutouts. Speaking to NME, Greenwood said they were able to put out two projects in less than nine months because “small teams move more quickly.” He added, “We had a lot of pent-up energy when we started, so it’s felt very natural to just keep going.” Greenwood is currently recovering from a stay in intensive care that forced The Smile to cancel their tour. Earlier this year, his eight-hour organ composition “268 Years of Reverb” was performed at the Norfolk \u0026 Norwich Festival. In May, he confirmed that he would be scoring Paul Thomas Anderson’s next film. Meanwhile, his brother and Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood is set to release a new photography book called How to Disappear: A Photographic Portrait of Radiohead on October 15th. He’s also touring with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (get tickets here). Not to be left out, Yorke recently announced plans to adapt Radiohead’s Hail to the Thief for a new production of Hamlet and is set to head out on a solo tour of New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, and Japan. Tickets can be purchased here.",
