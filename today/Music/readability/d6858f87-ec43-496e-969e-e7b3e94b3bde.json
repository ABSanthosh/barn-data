  "text": "In response to her ex Elon Musk allegedly offering a Nazi salute onstage at a Donald Trump rally, Grimes has made a fresh effort to distance herself from the tech mogul. “It is unhealthy that people are this upset when I have not even been online yet today and am only just learning about this controversy now,” she said via Twitter in a reply to a fan who shared they were “hitting a breaking point.” “I know your concern comes from a good place,” the artist continued. “I respect you. I do not ask for sympathy. In a world overstimulated by scandal, I feel a moral imperative to only add to the mess when something positive can be done. Otherwise I’m just adding to the desensitization.” The “scandal” in question stems from an odd, one-armed gesture Musk executed after profusely thanking Trump onstage in Washington, DC. “My heart goes out to you,” the Tesla founder said. “It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured.” “I don’t know what happened and I will not make a rash statement — I am not a citizen of this country,” Grimes noted. “I will research the state of affairs tomorrow, but until I do, I’m not going to say something that will create an international scandal. It’s absurd that someone can be this cancelled for something their ex did before they even heard it happened. I am not him. I will not make a statement every time he does something. I can only send love back into a world that is hurting.” It’s not the first time Grimes has put distance between herself and her former partner, from whom she officially separated in 2022: In July of 2024, she publicly expressed support and solidarity with Musk’s daughter Vivian, who is transgender. However, just days ago, she also went out of her way to defend Musk’s gaming skills on Twitter as a point of “personal pride.” As for the salute, Musk seemed unbothered, replying, “Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” While I deeply respect your concern- it is unhealthy that people are this upset when I have not even been online yet today and am only just learning about this controversy now. I don't know what happened and I will not make a rash statement – I am not a citizen of this country.… — 𝖦𝗋𝗂𝗆𝖾𝗌 ⏳ (@Grimezsz) January 21, 2025",
