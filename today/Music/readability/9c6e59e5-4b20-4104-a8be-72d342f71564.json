The performances, which ran from June 5 through June 16, drew more than 275,000 fans and surpassed all previous artist records at the stadium, according to a press release from the stadium’s operator.The gross revenue figure marks the highest-earning concert series in the venue’s six-year history. The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with a seating capacity of 62,850, is the largest club ground in London.Following the London concert series, Beyoncé thanked Sir Paul McCartney in an Instagram post on Monday, referring to The Beatles’ Blackbird, which she covered on her Cowboy Carter album. In 2024, McCartney wrote: “I am so happy with @beyonce’s version of my song ‘Blackbird’. I think she does a magnificent version of it and it reinforces the civil rights message that inspired me to write the song in the first place.”The London run is part of Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour, which also celebrated multi-night runs in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Each performance runs nearly three hours and features songs from her Grammy-winning country-influenced Cowboy Carter album.The venue, which opened in 2019, has hosted a number of major touring acts. Beyoncé’s six-show run exceeded her own previous record of five sold-out nights during her Renaissance World Tour in 2023, also breaking the record for most ticket sales and the highest grossing concert for any artist at the venue.The Renaissance World Tour has spawn a documentary film called Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which topped the domestic box office, raking in $21 million in its opening weekend. The film generated $44 million in box office sales worldwide, including $34 million in the US alone.Promoted by Live Nation and produced by Parkwood Entertainment, Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter Tour has also attracted corporate sponsorships. Marriott International serves as the official hotel partner, while spirits brand SirDavis and Beyoncé’s haircare line Cécred have secured promotional partnerships.
