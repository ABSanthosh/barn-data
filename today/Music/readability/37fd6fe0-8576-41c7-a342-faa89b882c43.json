  "text": "Metz, the Toronto-based trio that blended noise-rock, post-punk, and hardcore, have announced they’re going on “indefinite hiatus” following a string of European tour dates. “For the last 15+ years, we’ve dedicated our lives to this band and have had the immense privilege and pleasure of touring the globe and seeing the world. It has been nothing short of life-affirming,” guitarist and vocalist Alex Edkins, drummer Hayden Menzies, and bassist Chris Slorach wrote in a statement. “METZ has brought an immeasurable amount of joy to our lives and it’s our sincere hope it’s brought you some joy too. We are so grateful to all of you who’ve joined us along the way and have made this life a reality for the three of us.”After forming in the late 2000s, Metz released their self-titled debut in 2012. The album was met with critical acclaim and made the shortlist for the 2013 Polaris Music Prize. The band went on to release four more studio albums, the most recent of which, Up on Gravity Hill, arrived in April.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
