  "text": "Yesterday we closed out our Wednesday with the insane story that Jillian Lauren-Shriner, the wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, was shot by Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers after she pointed a gun at them during an unrelated chase. Long story short, when police were looking for a suspect in the yard of whoever lives next door to Lauren and Shriner, Lauren came out of the house with a gun in her hand. The report notes that the cops told Lauren to drop the gun several times – which she didn't – and eventually pointed it at the officers. Lauren was shot in the shoulder by police and surrendered 30 minutes later. Now it's come to light that Shriner actually fired her gun at the cops, as told by Jennifer Forkish, LAPD Director of Communications, to NBC News: \"Our investigation revealed evidence such as a shell casing and video footage showing she repeatedly ignored police commands to disarm and that she fired her weapon at LAPD officers.\" Shriner was since been booked for attempted murder and was released on $1 million bail. Shriner is due in court on April 30. As for Weezer, apparently they're still playing Coachella. TMZ caught up with Shriner, who confirmed Lauren is doing alright before adding: \"I can't comment on [the situation] right now… I can't talk to you yet. See you at Coachella!\" @tmz #Weezer bassist #ScottShriner isn't offering much in the way of details about the incident involving his wife getting shot by the cops this week … other than to cheerfully say she's \"all right.\" Full story in bio! ♬ original sound – TMZ Want More Metal?
