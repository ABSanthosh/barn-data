  "text": "Earlier this month, Lucy Dacus shared an idea on social media: What if she married couples on stage at her shows? ‚ÄúJust thinking about how there may be many people looking to secure those rights asap for whatever reason (!) or maybe money or logistics are getting in the way,‚Äù the singer-songwriter wrote on X, adding that she ‚Äúwould do this for free.‚Äù Now, Dacus, who says she is ordained in the United States, is looking for fans to tie the knot during select shows on her Forever Is a Feeling Tour.‚ÄúDo you want to get married at one of my shows? üíç‚Äù Dacus wrote in a new statement that she posted on Instagram. ‚ÄúI asked last week if people would be interested if I figured out how to officiate weddings from the stage and many people said yes, so we made a google form to sign up- it‚Äôll be in my bio. I‚Äôm officiated in the U.S., only a few cities on this tour may not be possible, all the info is at the website, including how to get your marriage license by state. (Seems like it will be pretty easy, you‚Äôll just need to bring your marriage license to the box office and we‚Äôll return it by the end of the show.)‚ÄùThe Boygenius musician continued: ‚ÄúI can think of all sorts of reasons people may be interested in securing the rights granted through marriage (you know what I mean?), so if you‚Äôve had it in mind forever or are just recently making the decision, I will be honored to do the honors!‚ÄùDacus released Forever Is a Feeling in March. She resumes her tour in support of the album on Friday, July 25. See her tour schedule below. And, take note: If you want to get married at a Lucy Dacus show, there may be some local restrictions and extra steps at shows in Philadelphia; Milwaukee; Lewiston, New York; Montreal; Vancouver; Oklahoma City; and Richmond, Virginia.
