MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip, which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.The music industry’s rhythm of announcements is slowing to a lazy summer beat. But there was still enough big news this week to capture MBW’s attention.That was especially true in the world of music-making, and, particularly DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations).On Monday (June 23), Splice announced it had struck a new deal with Avid to bring its sample library to ProTools.Then, a few days later, AI music platform Suno – currently being sued by the major music companies – announced it had acquired WavTool, a DAW which boasts “professional-grade music production features”.Elsewhere this week, the results for music rightsholders from two key AI copyright cases involving Meta and Anthropic were mixed.And there was a big announcement from SESAC-owned Rumblefish and that small social media platform, TikTok.Here’s some of the biggest stories from the past few days…1) AI music platform SUNO acquires WavToolSuno, the AI music startup currently in a legal battle with major record labels alongside its rival Udio, is foraying into the digital audio workstation (DAW) market with its acquisition of WavTool.Suno announced the acquisition on Thursday (June 26), a day after its rival Udio released a visual editing workstation for AI-generated music.Suno’s acquisition of WavTool integrates the latter’s browser-based DAW technology into Suno’s existing AI music generation platform.Photo: A Jardiel2) Splice strikes partnership with Avid for ProTools libraryMusic creation platform Splice has integrated its sample library with Avid’s Pro Tools digital audio workstation, making millions of loops, sound effects and one-shots available to the artists and producers who use the popular music-making tool.The idea is to speed up the music-making process by eliminating the need to switch between apps when adding samples to a music project.The new Pro Tools 2025.6 will allow subscribers to access around 2,500 samples for free, with the rest available through a monthly subscription fee.Photo credit: Tinseltown/Shutterstock3) Court shoots down Sarah Silverman’s case against Meta AI – but declares using copyrighted works for training is not ‘fair use’For the second time this week, a US federal judge has issued an opinion on whether or not using copyrighted materials without permission to train AI amounts to “fair use” – and the most recent ruling contradicts the previous one.In an order on Monday (June 23), Judge William Alsup handed a partial victory to AI company Anthropic in its defense against a lawsuit by three authors, declaring that training AI on copyrighted materials does indeed count as fair use.Two days later, another judge in the same court – the US District Court for the Northern District of California – declared the exact opposite.4) RUMBLEFISH INKS BYTEDANCE DEAL TO PROVIDE MUSIC LICENSING TO TIKTOK, CAPCUTTikTok and CapCut have a new official partner providing music data, licensing, and royalty management services: Rumblefish.US-based Rumblefish is part of the Harry Fox Agency (HFA), which in turn is owned by SESAC Music Group’s Music Services division.According to Rumblefish, the new agreement will enable music publishers to directly license both ByteDance platforms.This arrangement, MBW has confirmed, will enable publishers to ink multi-territory licensing deals with ByteDance, dependent on the geographical scope of each pubco’s rights.Diego Thomazini/Shutterstock5) US senators call for FTC probe into Spotify’s bundling practicesTwo US senators have called on the US Federal Trade Commission to investigate Spotify over allegations that its streaming “bundling” practice harms consumers and could “damage” the marketplace and the music royalty system.In March 2024, Spotify reclassified its Premium subscription tiers as “bundles,” as they now include 15 hours of audiobook access each month.The move controversially resulted in Spotify paying a lower mechanical royalty rate to publishers and songwriters in the United States.MBW’s Weekly Round-Up is supported by Centtrip, which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Music Business Worldwide",
