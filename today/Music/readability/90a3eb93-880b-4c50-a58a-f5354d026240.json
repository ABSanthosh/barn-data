Now, Bleecker Street has unveiled the first trailer for the film, which reunites Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer with director Rob Reiner… and some very special guests. The teaser for Spinal Tap II: The End Continues features appearances from Paul McCartney, Elton John, Questlove, and others, while Reiner reprises his role as director Martin “Marty” Di Bergi, and Guest, McKean, and Shearer slip into aging versions of their original characters Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls, respectively. Watch the trailer below.Spinal Tap II: The End Continues hits theaters on Friday, September 12—only 41 years after the original film came out. The sequel follows Spinal Tap members—all of whom are white-haired and languishing in small-time bands—as they attempt to join forces for one more gig. Di Bergi captures the rockers as they seek out a 12th drummer (their 11th drummer sneezed himself to death), reckon with their past, and prepare for the ultimate farewell concert. What could go wrong?The new film was written by Reiner, McKean, Guest, and Shearer. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the first narrative feature film that Reiner has directed since 2017. Reiner produced the movie alongside Michele Reiner and Matthew George.Read more about This Is Spinal Tap in Pitchfork’s list of “The 50 Best Movie Soundtracks of All Time.”Madison Bloom is a Washington-born, New York–based writer who covers music and culture.
