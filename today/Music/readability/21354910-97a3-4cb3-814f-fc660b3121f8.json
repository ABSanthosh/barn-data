  "text": "Warner Chappell Music has extended its strategic joint venture partnership with Lilly Raye Music, the management company and publisher run by founder Edward Matthew and A\u0026R Manager Justin Martinez. The partnership, established in 2020 and expanded in 2023, is focused on “supporting collaborations between creatives” across Asia, Europe, and the US.According to WCM, the partnership is stepping up its activity in Germany and the Netherlands, with “a sharp focus” on the dance and electronic scenes, and building its “A\u0026R firepower” in the UK to support the careers of “top-tier talent” in that market.Elsewhere in the world, WCM said that the JV grew its presence in Asia “by 40%, as a direct result of strategic collaborations and a market-specific focus, including a Number One Billboard World Digital Song Sales single for LESSERAFIM’s Unforgiven, and a Number One Billboard Japan Hot 100 single with IVE’s Wave“.WCM has highlighted various other successes for the partnership, including Grammy recognition for its work on Summer Walker’s CLEAR 2: SOFT LIFE EP and Janelle Monáe’s The Age Of Pleasure, receiving a total of three nominations for Progressive R\u0026B Album, Best R\u0026B Album, and Album of the Year.The JV delivered 10 No.1 singles in the Swedish market over the last three years with the likes of Asme, Molly Sandén, and Saretti. Lilly Raye said it has also recently hired additional A\u0026R support “to keep evolving its Swedish roster”.Other successes include achieving “major global sync placements,” including a campaign featuring Jennie of BLACKPINK with Apple’s Beats by Dre, and a fashion campaign with ILLIT for Acne Studios.Elsewhere, WCM highlighted the JV’s artist collaborations, “supporting the likes of BANKS, Doechii, GloRilla, and FLO in creating bold, genre-pushing records”.The JV has also been focused on connecting creatives in Atlanta and Stockholm, with projects involving producer Mike WiLL Made-It, Dababy, and Swae Lee.WCM said that the JV has also secured recognition for its rising talent, with Emelie Walcott earning a nomination at the Denniz Pop Awards in Sweden for Rookie Songwriter of the Year, “while several other promising writers are coming through on the roster”.WCM added that the Lilly Raye management team also “continues to make waves behind the scenes”, contributing to “breakout success” for artists such as Ayra Starr, Cian Ducrot, RAYE and Renee Rapp.“Connecting creative talent across three continents is as exhilarating and inspirational as ever, and Warner Chappell’s combination of global firepower, local knowledge and cultural curiosity makes it an essential partner for us.”Edward Matthew and Justin Martinez Edward Matthew and Justin Martinez said: “We’re delighted to renew our deal with Warner Chappell, which has expanded so much in scope over the past few years.“Connecting creative talent across three continents is as exhilarating and inspirational as ever, and Warner Chappell’s combination of global firepower, local knowledge and cultural curiosity makes it an essential partner for us.”“I’m so pleased that we’re renewing our collaboration with Edward, Justin and the whole Lilly Raye crew.”Lars Karlsson, Warner Chappell Music NordicsLars Karlsson, Managing Director, Warner Chappell Music Nordics, added: “I’m so pleased that we’re renewing our collaboration with Edward, Justin and the whole Lilly Raye crew.“They bring a passion and an energy to their work that is unrivalled, and they have an uncanny ability to spot talent and partner compatible creatives together.”“We’ve built a really solid relationship with Edward and Justin over the past few years.
