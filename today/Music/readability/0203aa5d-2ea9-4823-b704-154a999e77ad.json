  "text": "Pavements, the experimental part biopic/part documentary film about the band Pavement, is set to hit theaters in 2025 after making the festival rounds this fall. During a recent episode of Vish Khanna’s podcast Kreative Kontrol, Pavements director Alex Perry Ross, producer Robert Greene, and the band’s co-founder Scott Kannberg (aka Spiral Stairs) shared that the film project would include a soundtrack featuring new music from the band. In no uncertain terms, Kannberg revealed, “There will be a new Pavement song on the soundtrack. I just heard a mix of it today, and it’s pretty good.” Although Pavement have certainly stayed busy playing live in recent years, the song would mark the band’s first new material since 1999, when they released their EP Major Leagues. In recent months, though, their song “Harness Your Hopes” received an unexpected second wind after going viral on TikTok, even achieving Gold-certified status, a first for the band. Listen to the full episode of the podcast here, and tune in to the new music announcement specifically below. Pavements screened at a number of festivals to generally favorable reviews, including the Venice and New York Film Festivals. It was recently acquired by Mubi for US distribution, but a specific wide release date yet to be announced.",
