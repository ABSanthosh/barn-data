  "text": "Danna talks about how she finds beauty and joy through her music, as well as her glam soundtrack backstage at Billboard Latin Music Week. Danna: A little bit of everything. It depends on the mood. Lately, we are listening to a striptease playlist because it’s like R\u0026B, then suddenly a little bolero, to slow reggaeton, a little bit of jazz, like a combination of all these sexy sounds to bring out that femininity. How does my music help me find beauty and joy? To put it simply, it’s in the act of it. I believe that, for me, creating music and dedicating myself to this industry is a very spiritual act. So within spirituality, there is a lot of beauty. It’s the creation of something together with someone. The beauty of friendship, of finding a very unique and magical moment when creating something, I think it’s very special. And I think the beauty and joy after finishing it and listening to it and you hear my fans singing my songs and that song that was made with so much love, gives me everything. What’s my favorite move on the dance floor these days?  Keep watching for more!",
