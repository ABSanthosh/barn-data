Jesy Nelson attends a music video screening at Everyman Screen on the Green on April 13, 2023 in London, England. Ricky Vigil M/Justin E Palmer/GC Images Jesy Nelson and Zion Foster’s babies have arrived. The new parents welcomed healthy, identical twin girls who were born early, at 31 weeks, on Thursday (May 15). Their premature birth occurred after Nelson faced complications with her pregnancy due to carrying monochorionic/diamniotic twins, babies who share a placenta while having separate amniotic sacs. “Our beautiful baby girls decided to come at 31weeks plus 5 days,” Nelson announced in an Instagram post on Sunday (May 18). “It all happened so quickly, but we are so blessed that they are here with us, healthy and fighting strong! We’ve never felt more in love.” “Everybody meet Ocean Jade Nelson-Foster and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster,” the singer wrote in her introduction to the newborn twins. She uploaded sweet snapshots of herself and her partner, Foster, lovingly holding their babies; the proud dad shared Nelson’s post in an Instagram Story and commented, “My princesses are here.” Trending on Billboard The former Little Mix member revealed she was pregnant in January in an Instagram post that indicated the couple was expecting twins. “She’s eating for 3 now,” she hinted at the time. In early March, she shared that they’d learned that Ocean and Story were monochorionic/diamniotic twins, which raised medical concerns.  “Normally, most twins will have two placentas that they feed off of, but when you have mono/di twins, that means your twins live off one placenta, which can lead to lots of complications,” Nelson explained in an emotional Instagram video posted in March. “One baby might take all the nutrients, the other might, which — really awful to say — could lead to both babies dying. At the moment, I am currently pre-stage TTTS, which is twin-to-twin transfusion. I’m being monitored very closely, I have to go be scanned twice a week.” (Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, or TTTS, is a rare pregnancy condition that affects identical twins or multiples when their shared network of blood vessels in the placenta is imbalanced, according to John Hopkins Medicine. One twin might give away more blood than it receives, risking malnourishment and organ failure, while the other twin might receive too much blood and become susceptible to the heart being overworked, or other cardiac complications.) Days later, Nelson shared an update that doctors determined she needed to undergo a medical procedure that would “give our babies the best chance of surviving.” Prior to giving birth on May 15, her last video update on Instagram came at the end of March, when she announced from the hospital that the operation had been successful, and the TTTS had “cleared up.” She said she was to stay in hospital, however, as doctors told her her cervix was very short and that her water could break at any time — “and I’m still very, very early.” She also shared images from a black-and-white maternity photo shoot in early May. Nelson and Foster were first linked together in January 2022. In August 2024, they released a song together titled “Mine.”  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
