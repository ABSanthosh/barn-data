  "text": "With the devastating Los Angeles wildfires still ongoing, the Weeknd has postponed the release of his forthcoming record, Hurry Up Tomorrow, and cancelled the album release concert that was to take place at the city’s Rose Bowl. “Out of respect and concern for the people of Los Angeles county,” Abel Tesfaye wrote on Instagram, “I have decided to push the release of my album to January 31st.” Read his full statement below.Hurry Up Tomorrow was originally set to come out next Friday, January 24. The project will feature the singles “Dancing in the Flames,” “Timeless (feat. Playboi Carti),” and “São Paulo (feat. Anitta).” Later this year, Tesfaye is set to release a movie, also called Hurry Up Tomorrow, in which he will star alongside Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan.Numerous musicians and their families have had fundraisers launched after being severely impacted by the LA wildfires, including Diiv’s Zachary Cole Smith, Ought and Cola’s Tim Darcy, Empress Of, and Fat Tony. Earlier today, producer Madlib shared that he lost his home, music archives, and all of his recording equipment in the fires. Thus far, the Recording Academy and MusiCares have pledged $1 million, and Beyoncé has pledged $2.5 million towards wildfire relief efforts; a benefit concert, FireAid, has also been announced, to take place at Inglewood’s Intuit Dome on Thursday, January 30.",
