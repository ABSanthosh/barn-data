  "text": "My Chemical Romance has made a statement regarding the death of Bob Bryar, who was the longest-tenured drummer of the legendary emo act. “It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Bob Bryar, our former bandmate and an important part of the history of My Chemical Romance,” the band wrote in a post on social media. “We send our deepest condolences to his friends and family at this time. May he rest in peace.” Bryar initially replaced drummer Matt Pelissier following My Chemical Romance’s 2004 release of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. He went on to tour extensively with the band and perform on the much-loved 2006 album The Black Parade. He also contributed to 2010’s Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys and the rarities compilation Conventional Weapons. He left the music industry in 2014, focusing on real estate and charity work in the years that followed. As reported by TMZ, Bryar was found dead at his home in Tennessee on Wednesday, November 27th. There has not yet been a cause of death reported, though a medical examiner is currently investigating. He was 44. See the band’s post below.",
