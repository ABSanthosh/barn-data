  "text": "SNL’s 50th anniversary concert became a dance party once again when Robyn took the stage with David Byrne to perform “Dancing On My Own.” The pair wore matching dark khaki suits (fitting slightly better than Byrne’s usual style) and danced exuberantly with the crowd bouncing along — the kind of performance that definitely required wireless mics. After “Dancing On My Own,” which Robyn first performed on Saturday Night Live on December 10th, 2011, the pair segued to The Talking Heads’ “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).” Byrne has made frequent appearances on SNL over the years: by himself, as a member of The Talking Heads, and as a special guest during John Mulaney’s “Airport Sushi” sketch. The SNL50 concert also featured performances from Nirvana with Post Malone, Jack White, Miley Cyrus, Eddie Vedder, Fugees, The B-52s and Devo,  plus Lady Gaga sang “Dick in the Box” Robyn Dancing On My Own at Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary #SNL50 pic.twitter.com/yo1p8JXxbi — Starpush2 (@Starpush2) February 15, 2025",
