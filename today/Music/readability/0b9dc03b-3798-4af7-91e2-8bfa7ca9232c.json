  "text": "With the 2025 Grammys swiftly approaching, it’s time for final predictions. It feels like a particularly high-profile Grammy season: Charli XCX, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Chappell Roan, Billie Eilish, and Sabrina Carpenter are all expected to be in attendance. In addition to Roan, Eilish, Carpenter, and Charli, who are all confirmed as performers, Raye, Doechii, Shakira, Benson Boone, and Teddy Swims are set to take the stage. As we close in on the 67th Grammy Awards, we’ve rallied three distinct perspectives for final predictions: R\u0026B artist and voting member of the Recording Academy Shae Universe, a professional betting expert (James Leyfield of Casinos.com), and me, your local Consequence writer. We’ve all shared our predictions for some of the biggest categories below. The 2025 Grammy Awards will broadcast on CBS and stream live on Paramount+ beginning at 8:00 p.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. PT. This year’s show will double as a fundraiser to support Los Angeles wildfire relief efforts. This weekend, stay close for our ongoing Grammys coverage here. Plus, spend some time with Shae Universe’s latest, the warm Love Letter (stream it here). Album of the Year James’ Prediction: Billie Eilish — HIT ME HARD AND SOFT This is likely to be between Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department, but Eilish will pip Swift to the prize. Taylor is aiming for consecutive Album of the Year victories, but an artist hasn’t won back-to-back in the category in more than 50 years. Beyoncé has never won Album of the Year — expect that to continue this year with Cowboy Carter missing out, too. Mary’s Prediction: Charli XCX — BRAT Maybe I’m too online or maybe I’m just still clinging to the final dregs of the 365 party girl moment, but it feels like Charli XCX could take the top prize this weekend for her culture-dominating BRAT. When nominations rolled out, the definitive album of the summer was once again the center of the conversation, proving that the pop artist’s staying power extended long beyond the change in the weather. Shae’s Prediction: Beyoncé — COWBOY CARTER I think COWBOY CARTER will win Album of the Year. Well…it’s Beyoncé!",
