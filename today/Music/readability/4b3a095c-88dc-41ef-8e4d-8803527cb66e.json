  "text": "Charli XCX pulled double-duty as host and musical guest on last night's episode of Saturday Night Live. This was Charli’s first time hosting and third performing, after appearances in 2014 and 2022. She sang the BRAT tracks “360” (introduced by Julia Fox) and “Sympathy is a Knife” (introduced by Bowen Yang), and starred in sketches as Victoria Beckham, a producer for a bro podcast, and a commercial acting teacher’s star student. Charli was also featured in a cut-for-time Please Don’t Destroy video, which is now on YouTube. Check out all of her sketches and performances below.SNL shared two promos in advance of Charli’s appearance. In one, she had a conversation with Chloe Fineman using only the word “Brat”; in the other, she revealed her “real name”—“Charleston 10-100-10”—alongside Marcello Hernandez. Watch both of those below, too. In October, Charli shared the remix album Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat. She was recently nominated for seven awards, including her first nominations as a solo artist, at the 2025 Grammys.SNL is in its currently in its 50th season. Recent musical guests have included Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, and Mk.gee. Roan performed “Pink Pony Club” and debuted a still-unreleased song called “The Giver,” while Mk.gee played his new single “Rockman” and the Two Star \u0026 the Dream Police track “Alesis.” Last month, Ariana Grande hosted an episode—alongside musical guest Stevie Nicks—where she appeared in sketches including the viral “Bridesmaid Speech.” Next week will feature Jean Smart and musical guest Jelly Roll, then, after a week off, SNL will return December 7 with Paul Mescal hosting and Shaboozey set to perform.PromosMonologue“For those of you who recognize me, you might know me from my album BRAT,” Charli kicked off her monologue, “but don’t worry if you don’t; there is nothing wrong with being straight.” She went on to share some biographical details—like getting driven to raves by her parents at the age of 15—describe herself as a triple threat (“which, in England, means I sing, I drink, and I smoke”), and give a shoutout to AutoTune. Finally, she tackled the question of “What is brat?” with a special appearance from recent SNL alum Kyle Mooney.BabymoonThis sequel to the viral Ariana Grande-starring “Bridesmaid Speech” continued the story of Kelsey (Chloe Fineman), her husband (Andrew Dismukes), and Domingo (Marcello Hernandez). Charli played Fineman’s cousin, leading Sarah Sherman, Heidi Gardner, and Ego Nwodim in a parody of “Hot to Go!” by Chappell Roan. It’s revealed Kelsey has still been texting D-O-M-I-N-G-O, and he may be the father of her child.Wicked AuditionsCharli XCX impersonated Adele and Troye Sivan, with Bowen Yang as Charli herself. Other impressions included a return of Yang’s Fran Leibowitz; Chloe Fineman as Jojo Siwa and Martha Stewart; Ego Nwodim as Janet Jackson; Sarah Sherman as Bernie Sanders; and Marcello Hernandez as Bad Bunny.Thanksgiving Baking Championship 2024In this baking competition parody—hosted by Andrew Dismukes with Ego Nwodim, Michael Longfellow, and Ashley Padilla as judges—Charli appeared alongside Leo (Marcello Hernandez), Sandi (Heidi Gardner), and Ralph (special guest Kyle Mooney). She played Giuliana, a British baker whose terrible turkey-shaped cake retched stuffing and may have been made of actual turkey.Here I Go (Digital Short)This pre-taped music video starred Andy Samberg as the ultimate NIMBY who’s been “itchin’ to do some snitchin’”, by calling the cops on anyone who so much as breathes on his well-manicured lawn. Charli had a guest verse as Samberg’s wife: “Piggy piggy / Babe in the city / When I smell bacon, always makes me feel giddy / I literally dare you to park within two centimeters of my driveway, bitch.”Banger BoyzIn a parody of the “bro podcasts” that Donald Trump appeared on as part of his presidential campaign, Mark (Andrew Dismukes), Dougan (Marcello Hernandez), and PJ (Emil Wakim), were joined by Charli as Kara, the producer of their show “Banger Boyz.” It was her job to read off the episode’s numerous sponsors: “Cargo Condoms,” “Zyn Junior,” “Topgolf” (“find out which one of your coworkers is an alcoholic”) “Male Chimp”—not to be confused with MailChimp—“Warm Plunges,” and “Pube Whacker.”Acting ClassMarcello Hernandez and Charli starred in this sketch as an acting teacher and his star student with a specialty in commercials. For the benefit of newbies Lacey (Chloe Fineman) and David (Andrew Dismukes), they performed line reads from auditions that Charli’s character Alyssa had almost booked, and improvised a commercial for paper towels on the spot.It Girl Thanksgiving SpecialCharli impersonated Victoria Beckham alongside other “it-girls past and present,” including Naomi Campbell (Ego Nwodim), Rachel Sennott (Sarah Sherman), and the Olsen twins (Jane Wickline and Ashley Padilla). Her contribution to the Thanksgiving table was “cream spinach,” although the cream in question was actually La Mer face cream. Heidi Gardner as recent Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame inductee Cher was on turkey duty, and the sketch culminated with a catwalk on the long dining table, seemingly inspired by Charli’s own “360” music video.Shrek: The MusicalThis sketch found Charli in hot water with her group of friends—played by Bowen Yang, Sarah Sherman, Ego Nwodim, and Emil Wakim—after they went to go see Shrek: The Musical. Her character, Leilani, emerged from the theater late with green face paint on her face and hands, despite insisting she hadn't made out with Shrek (Michael Longfellow). Charli wasn't alone, though; when Sherman went inside to complain to the director, she ended up hooking up with Shrek too, and it turned out Yang had gotten an “OTPBTWMB” (over-the-pants, below-the-waist motorboat) from the ogre “during and before the show.”PerformancesMean Cute",
