  "text": "\"I am deeply honored to join USC Marshall's commencement in celebrating the remarkable achievements of these graduates,\" he said in a statement. Snoop Dogg Ramona Rosales Snoop Dogg will deliver the 2025 commencement address at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business graduation ceremony, the university announced Tuesday (March 25). “I am deeply honored to join USC Marshall’s commencement in celebrating the remarkable achievements of these graduates,” the Long Beach rapper said in a statement posted to the school’s website. “Commencement is not just a milestone — it’s a launching point. It’s about stepping into your purpose, applying what you’ve learned, and making an impact that matters. I look forward to welcoming them into the next chapter of their journey as leaders, innovators, and changemakers.” Snoop’s been rooting for SC on the sidelines for decades, from frequently visiting USC football practice during coach Pete Carroll’s reign in the early 2000s to repping USC women’s basketball superstar guard Juju Watkins during their game against Notre Dame last fall. Trending on Billboard The iconic MC already spoke in front of hundreds of USC Marshall students just last December during The Entrepreneur as a Brand discussion with Albert Napoli, senior lecturer of clinical entrepreneurship, as part of Napoli’s BAEP 452: Feasibility Analysis class. “Snoop Dogg is the ‘Dogg-father of Cool,'” the professor said at the time. “He’s also a passionate and highly successful entrepreneur with a recognizable brand that speaks to a diverse range of demographics.” Snoop also won the 2024 Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies Entrepreneur of the Year award, the most prestigious honor bestowed by the Center and previously awarded to Apple’s late CEO/co-founder Steve Jobs, Starbucks’ former CEO/chairman Howard Schultz and Salesforce’s CEO/co-founder/chairman Marc Benioff.
