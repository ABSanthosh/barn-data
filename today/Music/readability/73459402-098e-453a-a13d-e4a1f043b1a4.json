It is the second time that the rapper behind the viral song “The Race” has been found guilty of murder.Tay-K was accused by Bexar County prosecutors of shooting and killing a 23-year-old photographer named Mark Anthony Saldivar. He is said to have murdered Saldivar, in April 2017, while on the run from authorities who sought him after he fled house arrest.Importantly, Tay-K was found guilty of murder and not capital murder, the latter of which carries a mandatory life sentence. He still faces between five and 99 years in prison.Tay-K is currently serving a 55-year prison sentence after being convicted, in the summer of 2019, of participating in a botched home invasion and robbery that left a 21-year-old man named Ethan Walker dead. The incident occurred in Tarrant County, Texas, in 2016.Tay-K gained notoriety, in June 2017, when the United States Marshals Service publicly sought the rapper’s arrest, labeling him a “violent fugitive.” Not long after the announcement, Tay-K released “The Race,” a song whose music video now has over 251 million views on YouTube.Tay-K, whose legal name is Taymor Travon McIntyre, was 16 years old at the time of the incident in Tarrant County, and he was 17 years old at the time of the incident in Bexar County.
