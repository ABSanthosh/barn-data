Fuerza Regida Courtesy of Street Mob Records It’s a historic week for Latin music on the all-genre Billboard 200 albums chart. For the first time in the chart’s 69-year history, Spanish-language albums are Nos. 1 and 2 at the same time. Bad Bunny’s Debí Tirar Más Fotos returns to the top, jumping 7-1 on the May 17-dated chart after its vinyl release, while Fuerza Regida achieves its highest-charting album ever, as the band’s new 111XPANTIA debuts at No. 2. Fuerza Regida also lays claim to the highest-charting Spanish-language album by a duo or group, or a regional Mexican music album, ever. Debí Tirar Más Fotos adds a fourth total week atop the list, as it previously spent three weeks at No. 1, consecutively, on the Jan. 25-Feb. 8-dated charts. The Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular weekly basis in March 1956. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new May 17, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on May 13. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In the tracking week ending May 8, Debí Tirar Más Fotos earned 84,500 equivalent album units in the United States — with album sales comprising 48,000 (essentially all vinyl purhases), according to Luminate. As for 111XPANTIA, it earned 76,000 units — and of that, 39,000 were album sales. Let’s take a look at some of the major milestones achieved this week by the teaming of Bad Bunny and Fuerza Regida in the top two slots of the Billboard 200. Biggest Sales Week for a Latin Music Album in Nearly Six Years: Debí Tirar Más Fotos sold 48,000 copies in the U.S. in the week ending May 8 — the largest sales week for a Latin music album in nearly six years. The last Latin album with the biggest sales week was the debut frame of Santana’s Africa Speaks, which sold 57,000 copies (on the June 22, 2019 chart), largely driven by sales generated from a concert ticket/album sale redemption offer for the act’s then-upcoming tour. Such offers are no longer chart-eligible. Largest Sales Week for a Latin Album on Vinyl in the Modern Era: Debí Tirar Más Fotos sold nearly 48,000 copies on vinyl in the week ending May 8 — the single largest sales week on vinyl for a Latin album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. It surpasses the previous record, held by the opening week of Kali Uchis’ Orquídeas (20,000 sold across seven variants; on the Jan. 27, 2024-dated chart). Debí Tirar Más Fotos was sold on one variant — a blue-colored double-vinyl, exclusively available via Bad Bunny’s official webstore. Highest-Charting Spanish-Language Album by a Duo or Group: Fuerza Regida’s 111XPANTIA debuts at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest-charting Spanish-language album ever by a duo or group. It surpasses the No. 4 debut and peak of Maná’s Amar Es Combatir in 2006. Highest-Charting Regional Mexican Album: 111XPANTIA’s arrival logs the highest-charting regional Mexican music album ever, surpassing the No. 3 debut and peak of Peso Pluma’s Génesis in 2023. Latin and regional Mexican albums are defined as those that are eligible for, or have charted on, Billboard’s Top Latin Albums and Top Regional Mexican Albums charts, respectively. Biggest Week by Units for Any Spanish-Language Album by a Duo or Group: Since the Billboard 200 began ranking the most popular albums of the week by equivalent album units in December 2014, 111XPANTIA nets the largest week, by units, for a Spanish-language album by a duo or group. The previous high, in that span of time, for a Spanish language album by a duo or group was Santana’s Africa Speaks with 57,000 in its opening week, in 2019. Biggest Week by Units for a Regional Mexican Album: Since the Billboard 200 began ranking the most popular albums of the week by equivalent album units in December 2014, 111XPANTIA nets the largest week, by units, for a regional Mexican album. The previous high, in that span of time, for a Spanish language album by a duo or group was the opening week of Génesis, with 73,000, in 2019. Largest Sales Week for a Regional Mexican Album in the Modern Era: With 39,000 copies sold in its first week, 111XPANTIA earns the largest sales week for a regional Mexican music album since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991. It surpasses the previous largest week for a regional Mexican title, when Selena’s Amor Prohibido sold 36,000 copies on the chart dated May 6, 1995, in the wake of her death in March of that year.
