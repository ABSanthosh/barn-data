  "text": "Bob Bryar, the longest-tenured drummer of My Chemical Romance, who played in the band between 2004 and 2010, has died at the age of 44. According to TMZ, Bryar was found dead at his home in Tennessee on November 27th. He had last been seen alive on November 4th, and his body was reportedly discovered by a member of Animal Control. TMZ reports that no foul play is suspected as all of Bryar’s weapons and music equipment were left in his home untouched, and a medical examiner is currently performing an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Bryar joined My Chemical Romance following the release of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004, replacing Matt Pelissier. He toured extensively with the band and contributed to their blockbuster 2006 album, The Black Parade. He was also featured on MCR’s fourth album, 2010’s Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, as well as their rarities compilation, Conventional Weapons. Bryar departed My Chemical Romance in 2010 and retired from the music industry entirely in 2014 to pursue a career in real estate. He also became actively involved in dog rescue charities and sanctuaries, notably auctioning off his My Chemical Romance memorabilia to support these efforts.",
