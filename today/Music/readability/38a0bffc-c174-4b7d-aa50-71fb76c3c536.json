The book features 313 color images—a combination of photographs by Santiago Felipe and imagery designed for the concerts by Tobias Gremmler, who also directed the music videos for “Losss” and “Tabula Rasa.” Preview the book, which is out on November 15, below.Björk’s Cornucopia concert series began in 2019 with a suite of performances in New York. After a break due to the pandemic, she returned to the project in 2022 and 2023, incorporating new material from her most recent album to date, Fossora. “Throughout this tale, there is a subplot woven in: a second story of an avatar—a modern marionette who alchemically mutates, from puppet to puppet, from the injury of a heart wound to a fully healed state,” Björk wrote in a press release. “I hope you enjoy it.”Read the 2022 Cover Story “Björk: Mother, Daughter, Force of Nature.”",
