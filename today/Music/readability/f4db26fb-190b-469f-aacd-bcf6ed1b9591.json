  "text": "The Summer Slaughter Tour was brought back in 2024 to mixed reviews. The tour was headlined by Veil Of Maya and Brand Of Sacrifice alongside openers like Left To Suffer, Gideon, Tallah, and more. Summer Slaughter 2024 came under pretty heavy fire by fans, who said the tour just wasn't that extreme to the point where the tour's tagline got changed from \"most extreme tour of the year\" to \"The All Day Rager Is Finally Back!\". Now in a shocking twist, Summer Slaughter has been transferred over to Hatebreed vocalist Jamey Jasta. Jasta revealed the news during an appearance on the Garza Podcast, saying: \"I'm going to be helping take over Summer Slaughter. I don't think I can talk about the lineup, but this is something that I really wanted to do. Especially after the reaction to last year's lineup… Ash is a Maverick and a visionary. And if you look at the early days of Summer Slaughter… There was shows where, like, Whitechapel opened, playing first, okay? \"And [Avildsen] would always offer us this tour, and we never did it, because we were always building in Europe. But now that we kind of made it where we need to be in Europe, where either we're headlining or we're second or third from the top — we focused on Europe for a long time — I said we want to bring back… We want Hatebreed to headline a summer tour. And so after the the reaction [to The Summer Slaughter Tour] from last year, I thought we could do this. \"We can bring it back, and we can diversify the lineup a little bit, with some hardcore and some metalcore, but still have the deathcore and the death metal and the crossover, or whatever you want to call it.\" Jasta also revealed that while he can't comment on the lineup just yet, he does want to take the tour outside the United States: \"So they created headliners out a lot of these bands, and Hatebreed hasn't done a summer tour in years in the US. But we're going to start small. It's going to be very short, like 14-15 shows and we're going to take small bands; we're going to take the future bands, for better or for worse. \"So we're not expecting it to be blowout bonkers, but we're just, we're also taking it global… Because, it's summer in other parts of the world, at different places, like Australia, like South America. \"And we [Hatebreed] also need to be… We're long overdue to start working Australia regularly. Again, we just did Knotfest and just crushed it, and in South America too. So yeah, so we got work to do, but it's good problems to have and it's good opportunities to have. \"And yeah, I really, I appreciate Ash giving Tim [Borror of Sound Talent Group] and myself the support of not only Milwaukee Metal Fest, but also the belief in us taking this over and trying to make something great again.\" Want More Metal?
