  "text": "The UK band Malevolence had to remove their most recent music video due to an issue with a UK nature and conservation charity due to the band's \"unauthorized\" use of some land for their newest music video. Nuclear Blast Records took down the Malevolence video for their song, \"Salt From The Wound,\" on Tuesday (10 June) after the charity threatened to pursue legal action and refused to compromise in any way, according to a statement from Malevolence, apparently due to the fact that the band didn't ask to use some of the areas showcased in their music video. In a statement posted to Facebook, Malevolence said: \"Sadly, our latest video for \"Salt The Wound\" has been forcibly removed from the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel due to threats of legal action made by @NationalTrust. Apparently pretending to play guitar for a couple of hours on a public path that thousands of tourists walk up every single day is a criminal offence worth pursuing. Attempts were made by our team to find a resolution for the situation, which have been entirely refused. The video is a celebration of where we come from and we're proud of what we've made. Fortunately… someone has anonymously uploaded a version back to YouTube. You can watch it now at the link in our bio. Thank you always for the support,Love Malev\" When Metal Hammer asked the National Trust for a response, a spokesperson said that the charity \"always [has] to balance the needs of people with the needs of nature and wildlife, and our costs as a charity,\" and that \"any filming for commercial activity needs permission and sometimes a fee, which will go toward the landscapes and nature.\" And, apparently due to the spokesperson, the video had been \"uploaded before an agreement could be reached.\" As of Sunday (15 June), the video is still not up on the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel, and the band's upcoming album, Where Only The Trust Is Spoken is out on Friday (20 June). You can pre-order the record here. Want More Metal?
