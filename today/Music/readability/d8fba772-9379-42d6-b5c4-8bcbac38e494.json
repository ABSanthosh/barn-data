  "text": "On Friday night, Miley Cyrus premiered the film component of her newly released visual album, Something Beautiful, at the Tribeca Film Festival. The event was promoted as a “one-of-a-kind pop opera featuring thirteen original new songs,” with an exclusive conversation with the singer to follow. However, some fans misread the message that it was a movie premiere and loudly heckled her while she was on stage. “We thought this was a concert! We paid $800!” one audience member can be heard saying in a video posted on social media. Despite the host reminding them that the event was part of a film festival, they persisted and asked, “Are you actually going to sing?”After more misinformed fans chimed in, Cyrus pacified them with an a cappella version of her 2009 song “The Climb.” A comment on Cyrus’ Instagram could provide insight into why some fans didn’t realize they were attending a movie premiere. “I bought my tickets [off StubHub] and it said MILEY CYRUS LIVE. It wasn’t clear that it wasn’t a concert so yea, for 1200 bucks for 2 crappy far away seats to see a movie and not hear any live music and not even knowing it until I saw chairs on the stage, yea I was livid and felt duped… I’ll admit maybe it was my mistake for not doing more research but I will say that afterward there were several other people outside saying the same thing.” Fans will be able to watch the Something Beautiful visual album in theaters for one night only on June 12th in the US and Canada, with international screenings following on June 27th.
