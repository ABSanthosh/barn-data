What’s your favorite album of all time? Let us know in the comments! Tetris Kelly: Billboard has ranked the Top 200 albums of the 21st century. And while the list is full of your faves that have been killing it since the year 2000, right now we’re giving you a taste of the top 5. At No. 5 is ‘Hamilton: An American Musical.’ The show soundtrack peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, after the show’s Disney+ premiere, becoming the highest-charting cast recording since 1969, when ‘Hair’ spent 13 weeks at No. 1. At No. 3 is Taylor Swift’s ‘Fearless.’ T-Swift’s first No. 1 on the Billboard 200, topped the chart upon its debut in 2008 and tallied 11 weeks in the spot and became the first of 14 No. 1 albums for the superstar – the most of any act in the 25-year span. And at No. 1 Morgan Wallen’s ‘Dangerous: The Double’ album. After debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in January 2021, it remained on top through March 27, becoming the first album to spend its first 10 weeks atop the list since Whitney Houston in 1987. Billboard’s Top Albums of the 21st century recaps reflect performance on weekly charts dated Jan.1, 2000, through Dec.28, 2024. Stay tuned for the top songs coming at you tomorrow on Billboard socials.",
