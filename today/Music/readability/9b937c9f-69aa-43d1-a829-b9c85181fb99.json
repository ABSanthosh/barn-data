  "text": "Mustafa has announced a 2025 tour in support of his debut album, Dunya. The musician will begin the tour in North America, in February, before heading to the United Kingdom and Europe for May concerts. He will close out the Lost in the Dunya Tour with stops in Ethiopia and Sudan. See Mustafa’s tour dates below; scroll down for a new live performance video from Mustafa and collaborators Daniel Caesar, Micah Preite, Kibrom Birhane, and Monica Martin.The upcoming tour is billed, in a press release, as Mustafa’s “debut world tour.” In a recent interview with Pitchfork, the musician discussed his reluctance to perform in front of an audience. “I mean, I did a few shows for the last record, but I didn’t go on a full tour,” he said. “I think bearing so much on a record and giving it to people, and then having to relive it and reimagine it on a stage is not a thing that excites me and the way that it excites some of my peers.”Read about Dunya’s “SNL” in “The 100 Best Songs of 2024.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
