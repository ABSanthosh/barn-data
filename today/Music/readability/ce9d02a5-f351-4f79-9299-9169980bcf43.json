  "text": "Beloved comedy songsmith “Weird Al” Yankovic kicked off his “The Bigger \u0026 Weirder 2025 Tour” in Las Vegas on Friday night with a stacked setlist of hits. Taking the stage at the Venetian Resort’s Venetian Theatre after an opening set by the singing clown Puddles Pity Party, Yankovic was backed by an eight-piece live band (including several of his original bandmates). The concert began with “Tacky,” his parody of Pharrell Williams’s “Happy,” followed by the live premiere of new songs “Mission Statement,” “Polkamania!” and “Everything You Know Is Wrong.” Get “Weird Al” Yankovic Tickets Here Yankovic then played “One More Minute,” “Smells Live Nirvana,” and “Dare to Be Stupid,” followed by a medley that mashed-up songs like “Party in the CIA,” “My Bologna,” “I Love Rocky Road,” “Eat It,” “Like a Surgeon,” and more. After that, he doubled-down on the hits with “Fat.” From there, the show continued with more parodies, drum solos, the first full live performance of “eBay” since 2003, and more, before he closed the main set with “White \u0026 Nerdy” and “Amish Paradise.” For the encore, Yankovic returned to the stage for “We All Have Cell Phones,” “The Saga Begins,” and “Yoda.” Watch fan-capture video of the performance below. Up next, Yankovic will perform five more nights in Las Vegas, followed by stops in Indianapolis, Toronto, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, and many more cities before wrapping on September 25th in Clearwater, Florida. All told, “Weird Al” will play more than 70 dates across the country, and fans can get tickets here. “Weird Al” Yankovic Setlist: Tacky Mission Statement Polkamania!
