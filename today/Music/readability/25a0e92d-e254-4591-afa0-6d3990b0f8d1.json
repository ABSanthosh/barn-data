  "text": "Kim Gordon has released a digital deluxe edition of The Collective, her second solo album that was released near the start of this year. The updated version of the LP includes two additional tracks: June’s “ECRP” and the brand new “Bangin’ on the Freeway.” Check out the music video for the latter, which was directed by Gordon’s daughter, Coco Gordon Moore, below.The deluxe edition of The Collective will also be available on vinyl, with physical copies dropping on December 13 via Matador. “Bangin’ on the Freeway” is the second single from it to get a visual directed by Coco Gordon Moore, following “ECRP.” Other videos were helmed by Clara Balzary (“Bye Bye”), Alex Ross Perry (“I’m a Man”), and Vice Cooler (“Psychedelic Orgasm”), the first two of which actually starred Coco Gordon Moore in front of the lens.Since touring in support of The Collective, which included a stop on Jimmy Kimmel Live!—marking Gordon’s solo live debut on late-night television—where she and her band played “Bye Bye,” Gordon has also found time to record with Model Home. The two teamed up on the track “Razzamatazz” along with Justin Raisen, who worked with Gordon on The Collective and 2021’s No Home Record.Read more about The Collective in “The Best Music of 2024 So Far.”",
