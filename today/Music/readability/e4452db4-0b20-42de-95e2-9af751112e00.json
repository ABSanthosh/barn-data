  "text": "Faces’ Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, and Kenney Jones have reportedly reunited to record 11 new songs, which may arrive as a new album in 2026. Word of the new music came in an interview with Jones by The Telegraph, in which the drummer confirmed that “about 11 tracks” have been recorded at RAK Studios in North London, including one featuring Jools Holland. “Not all of them are going to be right [for the album], but most of them are good,” Jones said. “I can’t see it coming out this year. But I can see it coming out next year. Everyone’s doing different things. We do little snippets [of recording] here and there. Then all of a sudden, The Stones are out [on tour] again, Rod’s out again.” Faces’ original run ran from 1969 to 1975, with various reunions occurring in the years since. In 2015, Stewart joined the group for their first performance together in 40 years, and more recently, murmurs of a formal reunion have grown louder. In 2020, the trio came together to perform their 1971 song “Stay with Me” at the BRIT Awards, and the next year, Wood revealed that they had gathered at his home in London to record “some new Faces music.” Now, it appears that the new project is closer to release than ever before, though further details are still unknown. Upon release, it would mark the first full-length effort from the band since 1973’s Ooh La La. Elsewhere in his new interview, Jones also reported that he recently met with “Rod and Ronnie” to discuss a new Faces documentary, which could feature footage that has “never been seen,” as well as “some rude bits.” Like the album, further information is “under wraps at the moment,” according to Jones’ collaborator Nigel Adams. Up next, Stewart will hit the road for a number of 2025 tour dates, including a Las Vegas residency, dates with Billy Joel, an appearance at Glastonbury 2025, and more (get tickets). In his interview, Jones said it “could be” possible that he and Wood would join Stewart for the Glastonbury set.",
