  "text": "Bonnaroo has canceled the remainder of its 2025 festival due to ongoing extreme weather. After delaying much of Friday’s festivities, organizers officially pulled the plug late Friday night, citing an updated forecast from the National Weather Service predicting “significant and steady precipitation that will produce deteriorating camping and egress conditions in the coming days.” As a result of the cancelation, all 1-day admission tickets and day parking passes for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday purchased via the festival’s primary ticket vendor, Front Gate Tickets, will be fully refunded. Additionally, four-day admission tickets and 4-day camping accommodations purchased will receive a 75% refund. All refunds will be issued to the original method of payment and may take up to 30 days to process. Bonnaroo was previously canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and again in 2021 due to the remnants of Hurricane Ida. pic.twitter.com/M7PxZsDrYW — Bonnaroo (@Bonnaroo) June 14, 2025",
