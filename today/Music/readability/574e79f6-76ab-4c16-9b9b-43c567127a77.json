PSYCHO-FRAME is now streaming the gutteral new single \"BLUEPRINTS FOR IDOL GENOCIDE\" above alongside a music video directed by Salem Vex. \"It's a song about bad actors in the community,\" said PSYCHO-FRAME vocalist Michael Sugars. \"I see people moving in weird ways. So, I'll keep my distance and let God sort 'em out while I do my thing.\" PSYCHO-FRAME guitarist and vocalist Hunter Young added: \"So many people are looking for someone to save them. No one is coming to save you at the end of the day though. That's where SALVATION LAUGHS IN THE FACE OF A GRIEVING MOTHER comes in. You're on your own.\" Pre-orders for SALVATION LAUGHS IN THE FACE OF A GRIEVING MOTHER are available here. Want More Metal?
