  "text": "Teddy Geiger and Yaeji have released a new Transa song, “Pink Ponies.” They made the track with Danny Parker, a songwriter who’s worked with Jessie Ware, Shawn Mendes, and many others. Listen to “Pink Ponies” below.In a press statement, Yaeji said: “When I heard the demo and lyrics Teddy sent for the first time, I was packing my bags to return to the U.S. from another brief stay with my family in Korea and it brought me to tears. It’s rare to be invited into a space where I can fully let my artistry and intentions sing in this way. What Teddy laid down was a beautiful invitation that allowed me to flow exactly the way my soul intended. The artist’s role is that of a truth teller, and this song and project is one example of the power of music and collective artistry.”Geiger explained a bit more about the track’s origins in a press statement of her own: “‘Pink Ponies’ grew out of a little harp improvisation and a melody/title from my friend Danny Parker. From there, a few words and phrases began to hang around—one about meaning something to a pearl at the bottom of the sea. At that time, I was spending a lot of time with a new friend whose name meant ‘pearl.’ Halfway through the process of working on the song, that friend passed away, and working through that grieving process, I completed the first two verses. Yaeji wrote the closing verses, the first time I heard her singing them I cried happy soft tears! I’m so happy we got to collaborate on something so meaningful together. It was an honor to be asked to contribute to the album and be a part of the story of Transa.”The Red Hot Organization’s Transa compilation is out November 22. It features contributions from Sade Adu, Lauren Auder, Beverly Glenn-Copeland, Julien Baker, and many others.",
