  "text": "The Weeknd's \"Blinding Lights\" and Drake's \"God's Plan\" also hold top positions. Apple Music has shared its 500 most-streamed songs of the decade, with Ed Sheeran leading the pack thanks to 12-week Billboard Hot 100-topper “Shape of You.” As announced Saturday (July 5), the British pop star’s 2017 smash has been listened to more than any other song on the platform in the past 10 years, beating out second- and third-place entries “Blinding Lights” by The Weeknd and “God’s Plan” by Drake. “Shape of You” also broke Apple’s record for most first-day streams when it was first released. The rest of the top 10 was fleshed out by Post Malone and Swae Lee’s “Sunflower,” Posty’s “Rockstar” featuring 21 Savage, Drizzy’s “One Dance” featuring Wizkid and Kyla, Travis Scott’s “Sicko Mode,” Sheeran’s “Perfect,” Chris Brown’s “No Guidance” and Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy,” in that order. Other tracks that ranked highly were The Chainsmokers and Halsey’s “Closer” at No. 11, Kendrick Lamar’s “Humble” at No. 15, Ariana Grande’s “7 rings” at No. 19 and BTS’ “Dynamite” at No. 34. Trending on Billboard With 27, Drake has more songs in the top 500 than any other artist, while Taylor Swift comes in second place with 14. Mariah Carey is the only artist to have a holiday song make it into the upper echelon, with “All I Want for Christmas Is You” coming in at No. 100. The remaining songs on the 500-count list can be found on a massive playlist unveiled by Apple on Saturday. It comes in celebration of the streamer’s 10-year anniversary. To keep the festivities going, Apple also shared an interview with Sheeran talking about the creation and impact of “Shape of You.” The track served as the lead single from the musician’s album Divide and won best pop solo performance at the 2018 Grammys. “No one can take away the song,” Sheeran reflected to Zane Lowe. “I’ll be able to play it forever … I’m just grateful that I have songs like that, that you could be anywhere in the world and someone gives you a guitar and you can make someone happy with it.” Watch the full interview above.
