  "text": "Good news! We're getting two brand new Panopticon records this year! Or at least one new one and one that you've definitely never heard before. Panopticon is set to release Laurentian Blue, which is an album purely of dark folk material that's meant to be a companion to …And Again Into the Light; and Songs Of Hiraeth, which is comprised of songs that were forgotten and lost in the shuffle during the On The Subject Of Mortality era. You can check out singles from both records below, of which I assure you are great. Though if anyone can point out a time where Austin Lunn has made anything less than phenomenal, I'm all ears – I've certainly never heard it. Pre-orders for both albums are available here in the United States and here in Europe. Want More Metal?
