  "text": "British Gambian rapper Pa Salieu has announced a new mixtape: the 11-song Afrikan Alien arrives next Friday, November 15. The project includes recent singles “Belly,” “Round \u0026 Round,” and “Allergy,” as well as tracks featuring contributions from Black Sherif, Byron Messia, and Odumodublvck. Afrikan Alien follows Salieu’s 2020 debut mixtape Send Them to Coventry. The mixtape also marks the artist’s first full-length record since he was released from prison earlier this year. Find the tracklist and cover artwork below.“Afrikan Alien is my story, my purpose. I started putting it together the moment I got out of prison, building it on real reflections and real experiences I processed while I was away,” Salieu said in a press release. “These bars were born in a cell and completed when I was released, with each collaboration—from Byron Messiah to Odumodublvck to Black Sherif—being organic and true, like home-cooked food from the motherland, filled with love and truth.”Salieu was released from prison in September. He was sentenced to 33 months of incarceration, in December 2022, after being convicted of violent disorder and possessing a bottle as an offensive weapon, stemming from a 2018 incident.",
