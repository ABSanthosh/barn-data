Morgan and Bootstrap Europe, bringing the total capital infusion to $85 million.According to a press release, the new funding will be used to scale Animaj’s “AI-powered flywheel model” – which it describes as a “digital-first, multi-platform ecosystem spanning YouTube, Roblox, TikTok, Spotify, and FAST channels.”The new capital will also “accelerate strategic IP acquisitions,” following Animaj’s purchase of the Pocoyo kids entertainment brand in 2023.“With proven monetization, an experienced team, and a strong pipeline of strategic IP opportunities, they are poised to become a category-defining leader.”Sherrese Clarke, HarbourView“Animaj is reimagining children’s entertainment for the digital age,” said Sherrese Clarke, Founder and CEO of HarbourView Equity Partners.“With proven monetization, an experienced team, and a strong pipeline of strategic IP opportunities, they are poised to become a category-defining leader.
