  "text": "Good news! Korn is working on the follow-up to their 2022 album Requiem. Kinda bad news! It's not coming any time soon, according to guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch in an interview with the Everblack podcast. Head notes the band is actively working on the new material, but there's no concrete timeframe for when it'll be finished and ready to go. \"Yeah, we got a lot of it [written]. We're still working,\" said Head. \"Dude, it's a trip 30 years later, man, to try to keep doing it. And we're very happy with what we got, but it's just gonna take a while. And I don't know how long — maybe next summer, maybe next year, the next winter, I don't know, but it's not gonna be soon.\" It's also not clear if Korn bassist Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu is going to participate in the new record. Fieldy has been filled in for by bassist Ra Díaz (BillyBio, ex-Suicidal Tendencies), who also rips big time. So we'll see what happens there. Korn is also set to rip through a handful of festival dates and a special New Jersey show with System Of A Down in 2025.
