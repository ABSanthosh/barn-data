  "text": "Timothée Chalamet himself showed up at a Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest in Washington Square Park in New York City on Sunday afternoon, posing for photos with shocked doppelgängers and fans who had gathered to watch the competition. The contest, which was promoted via street flyers and on the social media over the last few weeks, saw multiple Chalamet lookalikes compete for a grand prize of $50. The real-life Chalamet showed up about 30 minutes into the competition, initially sneaking through the crowd by concealing his face with a mask and baseball hat. The NYPD eventually broke up the fun, dispersing the crowd and issuing a $500 fine to the event’s organizers for failing to secure a permit for the event. One of the contestants was also detained by police for an undisclosed reason. Despite the disruption, a Staten Island college student named Miles Mitchell was crowned the winner. The real-life Chalamet can next be seen on-screen in the Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, which is set to open in theaters on December 25th, 2024.
