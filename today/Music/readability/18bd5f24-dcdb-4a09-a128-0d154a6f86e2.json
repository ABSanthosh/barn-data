  "text": "Following news that Sound Talent Group owner Dave Shapiro died in a plane crash in San Diego on Thursday morning (May 22nd), it has now been reported that one of the other victims was Daniel Williams, founding drummer of the metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada. On Thursday afternoon, the band posted photos of both Williams and Shapiro (who represented The Devil Wears Prada via Sound Talent Group), writing, “No words. We owe you everything. Love you forever.” Williams co-founded The Devil Wears Prada in 2005 and remained a member until 2016, when he parted ways with the band. His playing can be heard on their first five albums. According to his Instagram page, Williams was currently employed as a senior software architect at GoPro. Williams, Shapiro, and the other as-yet-unidentified victims were on board a 1985 Cessna Citation aircraft when it crashed at roughly 4 a.m. in the Tierrasanta neighborhood of San Diego. Our condolences go out to the families and friends of Daniel Williams, Dave Shapiro, and the other victims of the plane crash.",
