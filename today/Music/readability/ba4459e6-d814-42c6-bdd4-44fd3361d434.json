  "text": "Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has announced what he calls the “remaining steps in our plan to help future-proof the company”.This seemingly final stage in Warner’s recent restructuring under Kyncl is expected to further reduce the company’s annual costs by around USD $300 million on an annualized run-rate basis by the end of fiscal year 2027.Just over half of that annual $300 million cost-cutting target ($170 million) will be achieved via headcount reductions at WMG, said the company.A further $30 million of savings will be achieved by reducing costs (like admin and real estate expenses) directly related to the headcount reductions. The rest of the cost-cutting will target SG\u0026A expenses.In an SEC filing, Warner said it expects this plan to be “fully implemented by the end of calendar year 2026”.The news comes on the same day (July 1) that Warner announced another significant element in the evolution of its company, launching a $1.2 billion joint venture fund with Bain Capital to buy music copyrights.The first phase in Warner’s restructuring plan under Kyncl began last year, in a move “designed to free up more funds to invest in music”.In February 2024, WMG announced it would cut around 10% of its global workforce, with approximately 600 roles to be eliminated.Later in the year, it revised this plan, with 750 roles expected to go – the majority of which were based in Warner’s ‘Owned and Operated Media’ division.That 2024 ‘phase one’ restructuring was expected to result in approximately $260 million in annual pre-tax cost savings.The new “remaining steps” restructuring move, announced today, will supplement the plan announced by Kyncl last year.When combined, the two sets of restructuring should therefore result in comfortably more than half a billion dollars in annual cost savings at the company.In a note to staff sent today and obtained by MBW, Kyncl wrote: “Two years ago, we began to transform our company; not just to tinker around the edges of an old model, but to build a fast, innovative, and collaborative organization that reflects how music moves in the new world.“Today, our strategy is gaining momentum. Our artists have held half of the Top Ten on the Spotify Global chart for the past ten weeks and nailed the No. 1 spot for all but four weeks of 2025.“These aren’t just the biggest hits in the world today; they’re our evergreen catalog of the future. At the same time, we’re starting to see better progress in our global recorded music market share, while hitting new highs in music publishing. These wins are powered by our ability to become simultaneously more effective and more efficient… allowing us to invest in great talent, boost our star-making expertise, and deepen our world-building capabilities.”“Our artists have held half of the Top Ten on the Spotify Global chart for the past ten weeks and nailed the No. 1 spot for all but four weeks of 2025. These aren’t just the biggest hits in the world today; they’re our evergreen catalog of the future.”Robert KynclAdded Kyncl: “Building on this success requires us to keep evolving. Today we’re announcing the remaining steps in our plan to help future-proof the company and unlock the next era of growth. Specifically, we’ll be reducing our annual costs by ~$300 million as we reinvest in the business: ~$170 million through headcount rightsizing for agility and impact, and ~$130 million in administrative and real estate expenses. Many changes will be implemented in the next three months, with the remainder in fiscal 2026.”He continued: “I know that this news is tough and unsettling, and you will have many questions… These decisions are not being made lightly, it will be difficult to say goodbye to talented people, and we’re committed to acting with empathy and integrity.”Kyncl went on to discuss the “core drivers” of Warner’s growth plan in the year ahead.On A\u0026R, Kyncl wrote: “Working with the [Executive Leadership Team], we’ve sharpened our investment criteria… a more holistic and targeted approach to partnering with the world’s greatest musical talent, across (i) the most culturally potent and highest potential repertoire centers, (ii) globally managed off-roster catalog, and (iii) music publishing.”On M\u0026A, he added: “We have an ambitious M\u0026A pipeline, especially for timeless catalogs. Our acquisitions of Tempo and start-up RSDL are good signposts of how we intend on growing both our copyrights and our capabilities. And, as you’ve seen today, we’ve announced an exciting venture with Bain Capital that adds up to $1.2 billion to our catalog purchasing power across both recorded music and music publishing.”Kyncl suggested that a strengthened suite of services across Marketing, Distribution, Catalog, and Merchandising \u0026 Direct-to-Fan will back Warner’s “faster, more agile teams of local experts”.He also referenced the recent rollout of the WMG Pulse app, while promising to “land the benefits of our financial transformation initiative as well as a vastly improved supply chain and data infrastructure”.He concluded: “In an ever-changing industry, we must continue to supercharge our capabilities in long-term artist, songwriter, and catalog development. That’s why this company was created in the first place, it’s what we’ve always been best at, and it’s how we’ll differentiate ourselves in the future.“As we implement these changes, we promise to communicate with you regularly. Thank you for your patience and support for one another. We’ve got some remarkable music coming, and I know that whatever challenges we’re navigating, your commitment to our artists and songwriters is unwavering.”Music Business Worldwide",
