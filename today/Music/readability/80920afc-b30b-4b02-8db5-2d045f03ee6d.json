  "text": "Ty Dolla $ign celebrated his 43rd birthday with a Sahara Stage set at Coachella, but the thematic focus of his performance wasn’t on himself, it was on his incarcerated brother, Big TC. Midway through the set, Ty played a video featuring Big TC singing from prison, accompanied live by an onstage choir. On a stage decorated to resemble a prison yard — complete with chain link fences and barbed wire — the performers turned their back to the crowd and looked up towards the screen, which projected the video of Big TC. The video appeared to be on loop, and though not all the audible lyrics matched up with Big TC’s lips (making it a bit unclear as to where the actual audio came from), the impact was clear, demonstrating Ty’s love for his brother and illustrating the pain of incarceration. Watch the video of the moment below. Indeed, Ty has long paid homage to Big TC, who is currently serving a 67-year-to-life sentence in California’s Calipatria State Prison for murder. His 2015 debut album was even titled Free TC in honor of him. Elsewhere in Ty’s Coachella set, he brought out special guests Wiz Khalifa, YG, Tyga, Leon Thomas and more, performing songs from throughout his discography, including quite a few tracks from his Kanye collab VULTURES 1.
