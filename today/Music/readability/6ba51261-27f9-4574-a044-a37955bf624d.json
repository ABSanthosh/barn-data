  "text": "The Callous Daoboys have a highly anticipated album release ahead of them with their forthcoming record, I Don't Want To See You In Heaven, out on the 16th of May via MNRK Heavy. And they're making sure that anticipation won't fade with their most recent single, \"Distracted By The Mona Lisa.\" The track is a \"love letter to my own band,\" vocalist Carson Pace explains. \"There have been countless times in my life where I have felt married to my passion. It's been detrimental, painful, and has forced me to sacrifice a normal life. This song is me committing to being married to that passion, regardless of the consequences.\" The Callous Daoboys have already collected accolades for their work from The Guardian, Kerrang!, Knotfest, and more. You can see what everyone is raving about at one of their live shows as the band are currently on tour with Chiodos, Hawthorne Heights, and Emmure around North America. Check out tour dates below, and tickets here. You can also pre-order I Don't Want To See You In Heaven here.
