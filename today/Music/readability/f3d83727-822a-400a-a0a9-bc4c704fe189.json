  "text": "Smokey Robinson is now facing a criminal rape investigation after his former housekeepers filed a police report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, reports Billboard. The investigation follows a civil lawsuit filed by the same four housekeepers in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, May 6th. In that complaint, the Jane Does accused the 85-year-old singer of repeated sexual assault occurring between 2007 and 2024. Through his attorney, Robinson has denied the allegations, calling the claims “manufactured” and “unadulterated avarice.”",
