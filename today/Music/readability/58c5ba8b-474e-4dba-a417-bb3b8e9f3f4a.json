  "text": "Lorne Michaels just said on the record that no one has ever been banned from appearing on Saturday Night Live — and that apparently extends to the formerly incarcerated. On Monday evening, Martha Stewart revealed to Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon that she was asked to host the long-running sketch comedy show in 2005, right after her release from Alderson Federal Prison Camp. Unfortunately, her parole officer at the time wouldn’t allow it. It sounds like the issue was primarily a logistical one, because while on parole, Stewart said she was only allowed to be out of her house for eight hours a day, which would exceed the famously grueling nature of the SNL weekly production schedule. Thus, the “bastard” (Stewart’s words) “wouldn’t give me the time to do it.” “I’m so pissed,” Stewart added. “But maybe someday.” When Fallon said she’d be a great host, she agreed: “I would be amazing.” (Hopefully she’s aware that her crush Pete Davidson is no longer a cast member.) In the meantime, Stewart is now getting into the Peacock reality series The Traitors, after hearing that host Alan Cumming suggested her as a potential competitor for the next season. “I’m trying to do everything that’s fun,” the multi-hyphenate told Fallon (after asking him to form a Traitors alliance with her.) On the flip side of things, the interview began with Fallon noting how often Stewart has been impersonated on SNL. Stewart called out David Spade as her favorite of the nine featured performers who have donned her blond bob, noting that he wore “my real poncho.” But in general she loves these impersonations, as “imitation is the highest form of flattery.” Saturday Night Live continues to be in the conversation as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. Here are the biggest revelations from the Questlove-directed Ladies \u0026 Gentlemen… 50 Years of SNL Music, and Tom Morello’s story about how Rage Against the Machine was locked down by the Secret Service after their infamous 1996 performance. Watch Stewart’s appearance on The Tonight Show below.",
