  "text": "On Christmas Day, the much-hyped, Dylan-approved Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown is coming to cinemas. In the starring role, Timothée Chalamet himself sings a number of Dylan classics, and his renditions will be collected on A Complete Unknown (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), also out December 25. Listen to two tracks, “Girl From the North Country” and “Like a Rolling Stone,” below. Chalamet’s co-star Monica Barbaro joins him on the former song, in character as Joan Baez.Director James Mangold said in a press release, “To me, there was only one way to make this film—to cast actors that are profoundly talented, ambitious (and brave enough!) to inhabit the whole of the artists they would portray. And in order to inhabit that world those artists had to be able to sing the songs. We were never out to replace the power, beauty and majesty of what exists, but rather, to celebrate it.”A vinyl release of the soundtrack is due in January, the press release notes. The full tracklist has not yet been revealed.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
