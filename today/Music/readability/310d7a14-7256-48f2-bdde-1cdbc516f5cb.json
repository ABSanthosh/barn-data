Produced by a network of \"ghost artists\" operating under pseudonyms, the tracks are commissioned with the intent to reduce the company's royalty payouts to artists, per Pelly.Piloted in the 2010s, the PFC initiative has since infiltrated hundreds of Spotify playlists, according to Pelly's investigation. The deals are said to typically pay the program's artists modest upfront fees while Spotify and its partners retain all rights to the music, thereby recognizing substantially more profit by promoting the reach of ghost tracks on its platform.The program's effects extend beyond the individual musicians who relinquish ownership of their intellectual property. Once celebrated as avenues for artistic discovery, playlists have become tools for cost-cutting while musicians who are attempting to make a livable wage off their craft are pushed aside in favor of disposable, low-cost content.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesThe revelations about PFC echo similar controversies surrounding Spotify's \"Discovery Mode\" program, in which artists trade royalty cuts for a boost in algorithmic promotion.
