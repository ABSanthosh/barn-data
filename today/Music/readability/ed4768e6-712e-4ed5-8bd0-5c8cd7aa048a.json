  "text": "Finnish progressive post-metal band Besra is now streaming their new single \"Equilibrium\" from an EP of the same name, due out November 1. Equilibrium was mixed and mastered by Magnus Lindberg (Cult of Luna, Birds in Row, Russian Circles, Converge) and the music video is created by animation artist Laura Matikainen. \"'Equilibrium' originally came from a track left over from the previous album, but it underwent an almost complete transformation,\" said Besra drummer Ville Kaisla of the single. \"In fact, only a few chords from one riff remained in the end. In a way, this deconstruction is also reflected in the song itself, as it is much more straightforward and even hardcore punk minded compared to our previous album. It was also inspiring to work with Laura on a visually explosive video, which fits perfectly with the theme of this apocalyptic fear in the track. Create, destroy, and charge forward!\" Pre-orders for Equilibrium are available here. Want More Metal?
