  "text": "The Pains of Being Pure at Heart are compiling some of their lesser-known tracks on a new album. The B-Sides compilation Perfect Right Now: A Slumberland Collection 2008-2010 is out February 7. Take a look at the tracklist, and revisit the music video for 2010’s “Say No to Love,” below.“Many of these songs, like those that comprised our debut record, were written in that now—making up in wild pop fantasy what we couldn’t quite yet achieve through musical ability,” the Pains of Being Pure at Heart’s Kip Berman said in a statement. “But even if that now is now an irrevocable then, I still believe that there is nothing better than making music with your friends and dreaming, as our Myspace page once proclaimed, of ‘being the biggest band in the world—to about 18 people.’”The Pains of Being Pure at Heart announced their breakup in 2019, with Kip Berman going on to release music as the Natvral. Earlier this year, however, the band announced that it would reunite for a string of 2025 concerts.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
