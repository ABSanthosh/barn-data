  "text": "Belushi Speed Ball didn’t take kindly to Green Day’s recent “Demastered” 30th anniversary release of their multiplatinum album Dookie. So much so, that the crossover thrash band has released a “dookie” version of its single “This Is the Peak” on a piece of dog poop. Last month, Green Day announced that they would be releasing each of the 15 tracks on Dookie via unconventional and obsolete items like a Teddy Ruxpin, a Game Boy cartridge, a MiniDisc, HitClips, an 8-track, and a Big Mouth Billy Bass, among other formats. Belushi Speed Ball immediately accused Green Day of ripping them off, releasing the following statement to Consequence: “Here at Belushi Speed Ball Incorporated, we pride ourselves in the artisan crafting of our hand made merchandise items, which over the years we have provided the fans with albums on Super Nintendo, Gameboy Advanced, Nintendo 64, Sega Cd, VHS, Furby, Pizza, 8-track, and Teddy Ruxpin. Which we have busted our butts to get noticed by the masses. And in one single swoop, Green Day comes in and instantly is revered as innovative merch geniuses. Is this… is this how getting ripped off feels?!? Is this how Municipal Waste feels!?!” Now, Belushi Speed Ball have taken things one step further, unleashing the song “This Is the Peak” on a piece of Labrador poop, preserved in bowl of resin. The “one of one” release is available via eBay, where it has a top bid of $11.50 as of this posting. Belushi Speed Ball singer Vinny Castellano stated of the unique release (via Metal Injection), “After the shock of Green Day’s announcement set in. A fellow bestie, Scott McGovern, turned to me and said ‘Well at least they didn’t do Pizza!’ And I jokingly said, ‘We should release a song on Dookie.’ And then WE MADE IT HAPPEN!” He continued, “We are now offering the world the first ever, Dog Poop Single. You can listen to us gush about Fantano’s thighs through a heaping smoldering chunk of Labrador Feces. Which we have forever preserved in resin. This is a 1 of 1 item from us, which we will NEVER make again.” The song “This Is the Peak” appears on Belushi Speed Ball’s latest album, Stellkira, which was released in May of this year. If you so desire, you can see a close-up image of Belushi Speed Ball’s dog poop single below.",
