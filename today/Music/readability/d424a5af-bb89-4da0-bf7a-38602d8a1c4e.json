  "text": "After two hiatuses, Primer 55 have announced they are back again with Donny \"The DRP\" Polinske resuming his role as the vocalist, with Bobby Burns on guitar, Joshua Toomey on bass, and Preston Nash on drums. The line-up is vastly different than what it was ahead of their second hiatus – Bobby Burns still was on vocals, but Darren Walling was on bass, Heath Shaw was on drums, and Joey Busciglio on guitar. However, Primer 55's third reunion is filled with the band's alumni. Nash was in the band from 2001 to 2003, Toomey played bass in 2003 and then again in 2007 to 2010, and Donny \"The DRP\" Polinske fronted the band from 2008 to 2010. Burns has remained throughout. The first hiatus Primer 55 went on was reportedly due to issues with their record label as well as conflict between band members. It's widely documented that founding guitarist Jason \"J-Sin\" Luttrell struggled with addiction, and that contributed to the deterioration of the band. They tried again once more, however Luttrell's struggles persisted and the band decided to disband once more and scrap the record they had been working on. Sadly, Luttrell passed away in 2018. Bassist Joshua Toomey took to Facebook earlier this afternoon to post a photo of the new lineup with the caption, \"Well the cat is out of the bag. Nu Metal is back and so is Primer 55!!\" after the band updated their profile photo yesterday. You can check out what Toomey had to say below. Want More Metal?
