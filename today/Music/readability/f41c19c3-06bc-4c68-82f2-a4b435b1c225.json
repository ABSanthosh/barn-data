  "text": "Last year's results were sobering – and that was before wildfires in L.A. and hurricanes across the Southeast disrupted thousands of lives, including many who work in music. MusiCares Courtesy Photo MusiCares announced that it launched its 2025 Wellness in Music Survey on Monday (June 2). The study, which MusiCares first introduced in October 2020, includes questions on such sensitive topics as sexual harassment, sexual assault, suicide, mental health and substance use. The anonymous survey is limited to music professionals who are 18 and older. Responses are due by Friday (June 13) at 5 p.m. PT. MusiCares seeks to get participants to answer dozens of detailed questions about their health and well-being by saying, “The survey allows MusiCares to understand how music professionals are doing on a large scale, and to then tailor our services to the community’s most pressing needs. Your participation isn’t just valuable — it’s vital for making real, positive changes for everyone in the music community.” Key updates this year include additional questions around family/caregiving and the experiences of music professionals with disabilities. Trending on Billboard MusiCares reports that nearly 2,800 music professionals responded to last year’s survey. Based in part on their responses, MusiCares expanded telehealth support for addiction recovery, introduced financial coaching, covered childcare costs and increased access to preventive care services, including mammograms and cervical screenings. In its letter asking people to participate in the survey, MusiCares ticks off several ways in which music careers can be especially challenging in terms of health and well-being: “Unpredictable, gig-based income. High out-of-pocket healthcare costs. Long hours on the road, often in a new city each day. These challenges don’t just affect performers — they affect touring crews, engineers, stagehands, and every behind-the-scenes worker who keeps the music going. “The truth is: life in music isn’t just challenging — it’s often destabilizing in ways that most traditional workers never encounter. From a lack of benefits and paid leave to the mental toll of creative burnout, the risks are real — and they’re widespread. Go here to access the survey in English. Go here to access the survey in Spanish. Go here to access the social media toolkit in both English and Spanish. Last year’s survey results were sobering — and that was before wildfires in Los Angeles and hurricanes across the Southeast disrupted thousands of lives, including many who work in music. Here are some of the key findings from last year’s survey: 78% earned $100,000 or less — lower than national household averages.     69% couldn’t comfortably cover expenses through music work alone.     53% said their income hadn’t stabilized post-pandemic.     47% and 44% cited financial concerns as a direct cause of stress and anxiety, respectively.     65% were not confident about the trajectory of the music industry.     87% had health insurance, but only 54% had dental.     78% skipped hearing screenings, despite working in high-decibel environments.     70% of those 45+ missed colonoscopy screenings.     62% of women 24+ missed cervical cancer screenings.     60% of those under 45 skipped vision screenings.     8.3% had serious thoughts of suicide, compared to 5% nationally. Of those, 15.1% made a plan and 3.5% attempted — far above national rates.     36% reported using marijuana or marijuana-derived products in the past month. Among those users, 36% reported daily use. Offering preventive, emergency and recovery programs, MusiCares is a safety net supporting the health and welfare of the music community. Founded by the Recording Academy in 1989 as a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) charity, MusiCares safeguards the well-being of music workers through direct financial grant programs, networks of support resources and tailored crisis relief efforts.
