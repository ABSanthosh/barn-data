  "text": "Kadavar have released their third single, \"Regeneration,\" off their upcoming record, I Just Want To Be A Sound, out on May 16th via Clouds Hill. Celebrating \"change and new beginnings,\" guitarist Jascha Kreft explains, their upcoming record channels psych-rock with a modern twist. Chaotic, cathartic and melodic, Kadavar will be celebrating their release with three live shows from May 12th to May 15th. Having previously elaborated that the title track of the album is a \"relentless yearning for freedom and the unshakable urge to live through music,\" the upcoming release should follow in the same path.
