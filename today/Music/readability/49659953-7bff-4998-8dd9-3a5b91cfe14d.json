Just after singing “HOT TO GO!” Roan launched into her cover of the classic rock track. The Midwest Princess has covered “Barracuda” before, including at Austin City Limits 2024 during her last tour, describing it as one of her favorite songs. The rest of her set at Primavera Sound included performances of “Naked in Manhattan,” “After Midnight,” and “My Kink is Karma,” before she closed out with “Pink Pony Club.” Get Chappell Roan Tickets Here Chappell is back on tour this August, playing the festival circuit across Europe and the UK (get tickets here). As of now, her final show of the year is this November, headlining Corona Capital in Mexico City. Chappell Roan released her debut album The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess in 2023. Since then, she’s followed it up with the Grammy-nominated “Good Luck, Babe!” and the country influenced Song of the Week pick “The Giver.” Earlier this year, she won the Grammy for Best New Artist, and used her speech to make an impassioned plea for label heads to pay artists livable wages and provide access to healthcare. Meanwhile, Heart just kicked off their own tour across North America running through the end of summer. Get tickets here. And listen to Nancy Wilson break down the origins of “Barracuda” during a recent appearance on The Story Behind the Song.chappell roan performing a cover of ‘barracuda’ by heart at primavera sound barcelona pic.twitter.com/SX3RVmP9m5— best of chappell roan (@bestofchappell) June 7, 2025",
