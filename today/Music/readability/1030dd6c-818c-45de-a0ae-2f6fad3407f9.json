  "text": "Deathcore titan Signs Of The Swarm is now streaming their new single \"Clouded Retinas\" featuring Will Ramos of Lorna Shore. Not that I need to point out that this song is heavy as hell, but y'know – it's coming for you. As for the topic of the song, Signs Of The Swarm vocalist David Simonich lyrically explores his struggle with vision loss due to Stargardt disease. \"'Clouded Retinas' is about my struggle coming to terms with my vision loss and diagnosis of Stargardt disease,\" said Simonich. \"I asked my friend Will Ramos to hop on the song not just to make it sound sick but also to spread awareness of degenerative diseases and disability. With Will holding it down for today's deathcore, I tried to showcase my influences from Nate Johnson and Vincent Bennett because the song feels modern yet nostalgic at the same time.\" Signs Of The Swarm will release their new record To Rid Myself Of Truth on August 22.
