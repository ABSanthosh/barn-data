  "text": "In a recent sit-down with Lipps Service With Scott Lipps, Zakk Wylde shared insights into Black Label Society's upcoming twelfth studio album, which will follow their 2021 release, Doom Crew Inc., released under MNRK Heavy. While reflecting on their current songwriting and recording sessions, Zakk revealed: “We've been recording a batch of stuff while we're home. I mean, obviously it's gonna be a lot of — we're gonna be doing a Pantera celebration tour throughout 2025, and then there's going to be Zakk Sabbath shows peppered in there as well. So I'd imagine somewhere — I don't know — maybe late 2025, early '26, or whatever, putting out another Black Label album. Wylde expressed how the extended timeline allows for a more reflective creative process. \"All it does to me, it just gives you more time to just keep writing and listening to stuff and going back and going, 'No, you know what? Let me put more orange on that as opposed to red,' where you can actually sit back and look at it and everything like that. 'Cause usually, most of the time when I do the records, I'll go in, whether it was Stillborn, Suicide Messiah, anything like that, with nothing.\" For Wylde, recording sessions are fertile ground for inspiration. As he describes: “I think if you ask any musician, they'll tell you, when you're in a recording studio, it's just a breeding ground for inspiration. Because everything sounds good… Whether you're sitting with an acoustic guitar, or you're sitting behind a piano, or you got the big distorted guitars going, the drums sound like cannons. So, everything just sounds amazing. And it just is very inspiring.\" We got a taste of Black Label Society’s evolving sound with their recent single, “The Gallows,” which was released last September.
