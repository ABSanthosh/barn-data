Besides friends such as Haim, Laura Dern, Emma Stone and Shania Twain watching from the crowd and singing along to every word, Swift also surprised fans with onstage appearances. Despite telling Swifties during night one at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium that “we don’t have guests at this show,” the pop superstar invited Marcus Mumford, the Mumford \u0026 Sons frontman, for her debut live performance of “Cowboy Like Me,” from Swift’s chart-topping 2020 album, Evermore. Other music stars have also gotten an invite from Swift to perform alongside her on the tour, including opener Gracie Abrams, frequent collaborator Aaron Dessner, Taylor Lautner, Phoebe Bridgers, Ice Spice, Maren Morris and more. See below for all the celebrities who have made appearances at Swift’s The Eras tour stops, either in the audience or on stage, which we’ll be updating as the 14-time Grammy winner makes her way around the world. Haim Swift’s “No Body, No Crime” collaborators, “Bejeweled” music video co-stars and besties Haim were one of the first celebs spotted at The Eras tour, jamming along to the superstar’s many hits and dancing the night away on opening night.

The Beatles icon was also spotted trading friendship bracelets. Stevie Nicks Stevie Nicks, who penned a poem “for T — and me…” that appeared on the album art for physical copies of The Tortured Poets Department, was seen making her way through the crowd at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium on Sunday, June 30. Currently on her own solo tour, the legendary Fleetwood Mac singer-songwriter wore a mask to stay healthy for fans who are awaiting her show; she’s next scheduled to play on July 3, in Dublin. Swift names Nicks on the second verse of Tortured Poets track “Clara Bow,” singing: “You look like Stevie Nicks/ In ’75, the hair and lips/ Crowd goes wild at her fingertips/ Half moonshine, a full eclipse.” She debuted “Clara Bow” live at this show, with an introduction shouting out her “hero,” Nicks, of whom she said, “I could tell her any secret; she’d never tell anybody.” JWOWW \u0026 The Situation Jersey Shore stars Jenni “JWOWW” Farley and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino had an adorable family outing in Milan, Italy, over the weekend to catch Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour show. The Situation was joined by his wife, Lauren — and the reality TV star commemorated the sweet couple’s night out with a social media photo, in which the duo is seen smiling from their seats at San Siro Stadium. “The Situations are in the building #TaylorSwiftErasTourMilan,” he captioned the post. Farley, meanwhile, treated her 10-year-old daughter Meilani to the ultimate birthday gift at the show. “The swifties have arrived,” she captioned a group photo from dinner, in which her daughter is seen rocking a “22” music video inspired outfit. Channing Tatum \u0026 Zoë Kravitz A year after attending an Eras concert in Los Angeles, Channing Tatum caught one of Swift’s Wembley performances with fiancée Zoë Kravitz. “Date night with TSwift,” he tweeted afterward, sharing a video of him kissing the actress on the cheek during the show. “The love is real and @taylorswift13 is an absolute force!” Tom Brady The retired NFL star attended Swift’s Oct. 18 show in Miami and shared a heartwarming photo of himself and his two songs, Jack, 17, and Benjamin, 14. “Boys night at the Eras Tour,” the seven-time Super Bowl champ wrote on his Instagram Story, tagging Swift. Serena Williams The tennis legend and her husband, husband Alexis Ohanian, were spotted standing near the stage at Swift’s Miami concert on Oct. 18. Ohanian later shared that the couple took their 7-year-old daughter Olympia to the show. “I’m a Swiftie now. Amazing experience. Fantastic performance,” he wrote on Instagram alongside a photo. “Olympia’s first ever concert will be VERY hard to top. Thank you, @taylorswift.” https://www.instagram.com/p/DBSlhFFxD7t Hoda Kotb Today co-hosts Hoda Kotb, Jenna Bush Hager and Savannah Guthrie were seen in attendance at Swift’s Oct. 18 Eras Tour show in Miami. Kotb took to her Instagram to share some fun crowd shots of the Today hosts enjoying the show while surrounded by fans. “SWIFTIES,” she captioned one of the snaps. In a joint IG post shared by Kotb, Guthrie, and the Today show, the hosts are also seen with some of their children. “We knew all too well that Hoda, Savannah and Jenna would have a blast at the #ErasTour in Miami. @lindsaycz and Sibby were also there, too!” the caption reads. https://www.instagram.com/p/DBTgOpIMmeK Justin Trudeau Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau showed off his dance moves at the pop superstar’s fifth Eras Tour show in Toronto on Nov. 22. In a fan-captured video from the sold-out event at Rogers Centre, Trudeau is seen busting a move to “You Don’t Own Me” during the pre-show countdown, just before Swift took the stage. Another fan clip showed Trudeau exchanging friendship bracelets with Swifties ahead of the concert.",
