  "text": "Saving Grace will feature Plant's new band. Robert Plant \u0026 Band Tom Oldham Robert Plant will release a new album of song covers, Saving Grace, on Sept. 26. Being released via Nonesuch Records, the album is named after Plant’s new band, featuring vocalist Suzi Dian, drummer Oli Jefferson, guitarist Tony Kelsey, banjo and string player Matt Worley and cellist Barney Morse-Brown. In tandem with the announcement, Plant and Saving Grace have released the album’s lead single, “Everybody’s Song.” The single is the group’s take on the 2005 original by the Minnesota indie rock band Low. Plant, whose most recent collaborations have been with longtime creative partner Alison Krauss, with whom he went on tour last summer, connected with the players that would become Saving Grace while in lockdown in the English countryside. The album was recorded between April of 2019 and January of 2025 in the Cotswolds region of England and on the Welsh Borders. “We laugh a lot, really. I think that suits me. I like laughing,” Plant says of the band. “You know, I can’t find any reason to be too serious about anything. I’m not jaded. The sweetness of the whole thing …These are sweet people, and they are playing out all the stuff that they could never get out before. They have become unique stylists and together they seem to have landed in a most interesting place.” Trending on Billboard The album includes covers of music by Memphis Minnie, Bob Mosley of the band Moby Grape, Blind Willie Johnson, The Low Anthem, Martha Scanlan, Sarah Siskind and Low. Plant and Saving Grace will go on a 21-date tour behind the album in Europe and the U.S. this summer and fall. See the dates here. Over the decades, Plant has toured with other bands including the Sensational Shapeshifters and of course, Led Zeppelin. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
