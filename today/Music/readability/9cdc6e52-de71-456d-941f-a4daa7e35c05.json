  "text": "Do all roads lead to Las Vegas? On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie \u0026 Keith are talking about the pair of A-list guests who popped up with Beyoncé at two of her Paris concerts on the Cowboy Carter Tour — Miley Cyrus on Thursday night and Jay-Z (Bey’s husband and frequent collaborator) on Saturday — and why we’re hoping the cameos could lead to something very big. You see, next month, Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball tour kicks off at Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena, with three dates July 16-18, while Beyoncé wraps up her Cowboy Carter Tour at Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium, with two dates July 25-26. Is there a world where either Bey pops up for Gaga’s opening weekend or Gaga makes her way back from three Mayhem dates in San Francisco (July 22-26 — no concert on the 25th!) to share the stage with Bey? If the stars align, those lucky fans could potentially see the first-ever performance of the superstar duo’s 2010 top five Billboard Hot 100 hit “Telephone.” Listen to our full conversation about the possibility on the Pop Shop Podcast: Trending on Billboard Also on the show, we’ve got chart news on Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” returning to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and Morgan Wallen’s I’m the Problem continuing its run atop the Billboard 200 albums chart, while ATEEZ, Lil Tecca and Brandon Lake all debut in the top 10. Plus, we’re chatting about the just-announced Brandy and Monica co-headlining tour, kicking off in October, and Katie tells Keith all about her latest Vegas adventure, checking out night 1 of New Kids on the Block’s Park MGM residency and even chatting with the guys ahead of the show.
