  "text": "Bloc Party are reissuing their debut album Silent Alarm to celebrate the record’s 20th anniversary. The reissue’s release date is set for September 26th and it includes B-sides, rarities, previously unreleased demos, and the band’s 2004 Peel Session, alongside the original album’s 13 songs. Silent Alarm’s 20th anniversary box set spans four vinyl records; the first two being the album original sequencing from “Like Eating Glass” all the way to “Compliments.” Disc three contains 12 B-sides, and the final features Bloc Party’s BBC Radio 1 session with John Peel and additional demos. The band’s Peel Session was recorded following the radio presenter’s death in 2004, and this reissue marks the first time it (along with the aforementioned demos) will be released commercially. Record producer Paul Epworth wrote a foreword for the collection’s liner notes, which are contained in a 24-page booklet including exclusive photos. Get Bloc Party Tickets Here The reissue will also be available as an Amazon Music exclusive vinyl release, a standard two-vinyl set, and two-disc CD version. Pre-orders are ongoing. The celebration doesn’t stop there either — the band is heading out on a world tour performing Silent Alarm front to back this spring and summer (get tickets here). The first show is on May 8th in Mexico City, and they’ll play both headlining shows and festival slots, including at Just Like Heaven, Reading and Leeds, Down the Rabbit Hole, Summersonic, and more. Blonde Redhead recently replaced Metric as their support act. Bloc Party’s latest record was 2022’s Alpha Games, released via Infectious/DMG. Back in January, frontman Kele Okereke teased that the band’s next album is on the way, stating it plans to be a vulnerable affair. “It’s very personal and confessional, and I’ve never really done that as a songwriter. I’ve always preferred an element of distance. But in the past year I’ve been through quite an unbelievable time and had some very difficult relationships with people, and this is the only place to put all of that.” He continued: “It’s something I’ve never really done before. I’ve never really spoken directly, and this time I will.” Silent Alarm 20th Anniversary Box Set Reissue Tracklist: Silent Alarm: Side A 01. Like Eating Glass 02. Helicopter 03.
