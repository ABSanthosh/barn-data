  "text": "The Harlem rapper was confident in his catalogue. See what else had to say in his extensive and entertaining interview with 'The Breakfast Club.' 50 Cent performs onstage during Nicki Minaj Presents: Pink Friday 2 World Tour at Madison Square Garden on March 30, 2024 in New York City. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Live Nation 50 Cent fired back at Jim Jones claiming that he has better songs than most New York rappers. In a deleted post on Instagram, the Queens rapper and filmmaker called Jones “delusional” and brought up his infamous beef with rapper Tru Life. “Delusional,” wrote 50. “JoMo only got one song, Ballin written by Max B. Better shut up before I have Tru Life chasing you around the city again. F—king punk!” Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news During his conversation with The Breakfast Club as he was promoting his new album At the Church Steps, Dipset‘s notorious Verzuz loss to The LOX came up as the catalyst to Jones’ tension with fellow Dipset member Cam’ron. “Yeah, man, Verzuz was weak, man” Jim agreed. “He’s mad because we lost and he got boo’d, just tell the truth.” The Harlem rapper than asked which rapper wanted to do a Verzuz with him and stood by his catalogue. “I got more solo records than most of them that really hit — remember that” he said. “I got a lot of gold singles. I got some action with me. It’s gonna be hard for a lot of people from New York to win with Capo. In New York City, it’s going to be hard. I would say that for anybody.” Which then prompted DJ Envy to say that it sounded like he wanted to go up against the likes of 50 Cent.“ I don’t wanna do nothing with that sucka,” Jones responded. “Leave him out of the conversation.” Jones then revealed that he felt Swizz Beatz could’ve handled the business side of things in a better way. “Swizz, holla at me. You backdoored me, gave [Cam’ron] some business that you ain’t give all of us,” he said, implying that he and Juelz weren’t treated the same and said that he needed “triple what I had last time.” Earlier in the interview, Jones admitted that he didn’t regret promoting gang culture in his music, likening being in a gang to being in a fraternity. He also challenged Cam’ron to a $10 million dollar boxing match. Check out the full convo below. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
