Nicole Kidman and Ariana Grande attend the 36th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards at Palm Springs Convention Center on Jan. 3, 2025 in Palm Springs, California. Kevin Winter/Getty Images Ariana Grande and Nicole Kidman together on the red carpet had cameras flashing Friday night (Jan. 3) at the Palm Springs International Film Festival’s Film Awards Gala. “Oh my god,” Kidman cried out when seeing Grande headed her way at the fest. The two stars embraced, held hands and seemingly dished out compliments, though camera mics didn’t pick up their conversation, at least in video footage of the moment captured by The Associated Press or The Hollywood Reporter. Arms around each other, they posed for photographers, as seen in the clip from THR above. During their interaction Grande also gave the actress a small bow, which Kidman — who’s quite a bit taller than the pop star — leaned down to reciprocate. Trending on Billboard Though they haven’t worked together yet, Grande and Kidman were originally both cast in the 2020 Netflix musical The Prom. Grande had to drop out of filming due to tour scheduling conflicts, and Ariana DeBose filled the role. With Oscar nominations voting set to begin on Wednesday, many of Hollywood’s biggest names attended the Palm Springs fest to present or accept honors at the gala. (As THR points out, there’s often a number of Academy members in the crowd — and there’s still time to sway the race for the Academy Awards.) Grande was in Palm Springs to accept the Rising Star Award, presented by Jennifer Coolidge, for her work in the hit 2024 feature film adaptation of the musical Wicked, for which she’s predicted to be a frontrunner to receive a supporting actor nom at the Oscars. “I’ve been performing since I was a child, so I never thought at the age of 31 I would be hearing the words ‘Rising Star’ again. So I wanted to start by thanking my good friends Botox and Juvéderm. I thought I’d be hearing ‘Slightly Withering Star,’ or ‘Drooping Star’ by now, so thank you,” the charming Grande joked, breaking the ice during her Rising Star acceptance speech at the Palm Springs Film Fest, where she said, “Being able to play Glinda the Good” was “the honor of my life,” and that before music, her start as a performer was in stand-up — her grandparents’ living room being her first venue, and $5 her first paycheck. Grande employed humor and sincerity in her speech, while Kidman was overcome with emotion in hers. The Babygirl star was honored with the International Star Award, presented by Jamie Lee Curtis. Curtis held Kidman’s hand through a genuine speech in which the actress broke down in tears over the recent death of her mother. “My whole career has been for my mom and my dad, and they’re not here anymore,” Kidman said. “I want to keep working and giving to the world. I’m sorry I’m crying. I didn’t want to do that, but I feel my mama right now. This is for you, Mama.” See more pictures of Grande and Kidman’s sweet run-in on the Palm Springs Film Fest red carpet: Nicole Kidman and Ariana Grande attend the 36th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards at Palm Springs Convention Center on Jan. 3, 2025 in Palm Springs, California.
