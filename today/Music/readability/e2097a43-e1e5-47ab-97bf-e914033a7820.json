  "text": "In 2023, MF Doom’s widow, Jasmine Dumile Thompson, sued the rapper’s former A\u0026R Eothen “Egon” Alapatt for copyright infringement, fraud, intentional misrepresentation and unjust enrichment. The complaint stemmed from Alapatt obtaining many of Doom’s handwritten notebooks, and hanging onto them following the artist’s death in 2020. Now, the two parties have resolved the dispute amicably in a confidential settlement, and Alapatt has returned the notebooks to Thompson.“We are relieved to bring this chapter to a close,” Thompson said on behalf of her family. “Over the years, there have been many public narratives concerning this matter, some of which have been misrepresented or unfairly magnified. While differences did arise along the way, we acknowledge that Egon preserved Doom’s invaluable notebooks and are grateful to now have them returned as part of this resolution. As a family, our focus remains steadfast on celebrating Doom’s extraordinary legacy—his unparalleled artistry and his lasting impact on music and culture. We hope that this resolution serves as a step forward in continuing to honor his memory.”Alapatt added: “Doom was a dear friend to me and one of the most important artists I’ve ever known. I bought Doom’s notebooks and kept them safe for years to ensure his powerful musical legacy could be preserved. My only goal has always been to showcase Doom’s lasting musical genius, and the resolution Jasmine and I have reached regarding Doom’s notebooks represents a significant triumph in protecting the genesis of a once-in-a-lifetime talent. I am proud to have played a role in saving some precious markers of Doom’s life in music and trust Jasmine to determine the next steps for his notebooks.”",
