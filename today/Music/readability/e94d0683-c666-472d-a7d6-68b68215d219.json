  "text": "ZZ Top have got legs and they know how to use them. In fact, they have two North American legs of their ongoing “Elevation Tour” set for this summer after beefing up their itinerary with a number of newly announced gigs. Frontman Billy Gibbons and company will embark on the first leg on June 1st in Victoria, British Columbia, playing mostly Canadian and northern US cities through June 27th in Moncton, New Brunswick. The second leg will kick off August 1st at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, and wrap up in the band’s home state on September 3rd in Midland, Texas. Get ZZ Top Tickets Here A Live Nation pre-sale for select newly added shows (all within the second leg) begins Thursday (April 17th) at 10 a.m. local time using the code DANCE, while general tickets go on sale Friday at 10 a.m local time via Ticketmaster. Tickets to the previously announced concerts are already on sale at this location. ZZ Top just completed a spring US tour, although longtime drummer Frank Beard had to step away from the band for an undisclosed health issue. Drummer John Douglas filled in for Beard, and is expected to remain with ZZ Top for the upcoming dates. The summer shows will feature varying support from Night Ranger, Payton Smith, and Black Stone Cherry. Check your local venue to see who will be opening that particular concert. Prior to the June dates, ZZ Top will embark on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in late April and May. See their full itinerary below.
