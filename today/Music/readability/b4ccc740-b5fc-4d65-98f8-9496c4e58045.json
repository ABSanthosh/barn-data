  "text": "\"Y'all know I hate doing this,\" Timberlake said in a statement on Saturday (Nov. 30). Justin Timberlake performs onstage during Audacy's 11th Annual We Can Survive at the Prudential Center on Sept. 28, 2024 in Newark, New Jersey. Manny Carabel/Getty Images for Audacy Justin Timberlake has called off his next concert, which was scheduled for Dec. 2 at Oklahoma City’s Paycom Center, after suffering a back injury. It’s the eighth date to be postponed this fall on Timberlake’s The Forget Tomorrow World Tour, which launched in April. “I’m so sorry Oklahoma CIty… I have to cancel the show on 12/2. I hurt my back in NOLA and my doctors have instructed me to rest a little bit longer. Thank you for your support – y’all know I hate doing this,” he wrote in a statement shared via an Instagram Story on Saturday (Nov. 30). A rescheduled date has not yet been announced. In late October, Timberlake canceled six concerts (Columbus, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Grand Rapids) on The Forget Tomorrow World Tour, citing a bout of bronchitis and laryngitis, and rescheduled those performances for 2025. Trending on Billboard That illness came after canceling a Newark, New Jersey, show in early October due to an injury that he said prevented him from performing. Fortunately, he was able to reschedule and perform there just a week later. Currently, Timberlake is set to return to the stage for his concert on Dec. 4 in Houston, Texas. His tour runs through Dec. 20 before breaking for the holidays and picking up again on Jan. 13. The trek has Timberlake traveling around North America and bringing his live show to festivals in South America and Europe. A complete list of Timberlake’s tour dates can be found on his official website. The Forget Tomorrow World Tour supports his latest album, Everything I Thought It Was, which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 in March. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
