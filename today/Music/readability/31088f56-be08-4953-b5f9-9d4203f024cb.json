  "text": "Over the weekend, former Mushroomhead vocalist Jeffrey Nothing announced he'd be creating his own version of Mushroomhead sometime in 2025. Nothing has since retracted that statement and issued one that clarifies exactly what that means. Nothing notes that his new band is pushing a new sound, and will only be adjacent to old Mushroomhead in that he's fronting it. \"After seeing this hit the press yesterday, I feel I should clarify a few things that were mentioned, as well as questions that I saw in the comments. \"For starters, when I said that I'm doing my own version of Mushroomhead, I meant a new project based on the same creative ideals that the project I co-founded was based around. Mushroomhead was always supposed to be about pushing creativity and the abstract to its limits. The earlier music reflected that. That's what I'm bringing with the new project. It's not gonna be Mushroomhead 2.0. We're not gonna be rewriting 'Bwomp' and 'Sun Doesn't Rise' over and over. We're not going to try to capture that particular sound. It's going to be an evolution. The only real connection to MH will be my voice. \"If you're a Mushroomhead fan, there will be enough there to scratch that itch. If you never liked Mushroomhead, it'll be different enough that it may actually be something you can get into. We want this to have its own fingerprint. \"If you wanna revisit the Mushroomhead of yester-year, Waylon and Jmann will have you covered. (Highly recommend checking out A Killer's Confession.) If you want to see a band cling to a name so they can sell more masks every year, the current MH has you covered. This project is all about evolution and moving forward. \"There is a possibility of some MH alumni working on it or playing shows with us. Not because we're trying to recapture glory days or anything of that nature, but because some of them are dear friends. Simple as that. Every experience is that much better when it's shared with people you love. \"We are currently writing the material and will keep things radio silent until it's time to launch. Thank you for your continued support.\" Want More Metal?
