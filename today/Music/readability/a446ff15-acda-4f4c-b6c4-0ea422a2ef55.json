  "text": "A new American Eagle advertising campaign centered around actress Sydney Sweeney is credited with propelling the company’s stock by more than 15% this week. At the close of trading on July 22nd, American Eagle’s stock was priced at $10.20. The campaign with Sydney launched the following day. By Thursday morning, the stock peaked at $12.00 before closing the week at $11.76 — marking a 15.29% increase and an estimated $310 million boost to its market valuation, driven largely by the campaign’s viral success and a surge in online investor interest. The campaign, officially titled, “Sydney Sweeney Has Great (American Eagle) Jeans,” features a series of playful and provocative clips promoting the retailer’s denim collection. Several of the videos have since gone viral on social media, each amassing over 30 million views. This isn’t Sweeney’s first viral ad campaign of the year; she previously teamed up with natural soap brand Dr. Squatch to launch bars of soap infused with her actual bathwater.
