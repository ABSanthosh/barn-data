  "text": "Elton John and Brandi Carlile’s collaborative album, Who Believes in Angels?, has now arrived in full, and to celebrate the occasion, the duo appeared on Saturday Night Live for a rocking musical performance. Introduced by host Jack Black, John and Carlile’s portion of the evening saw the SNL stage decorated in the neon signs and bright colors of the Who Believes in Angels? album artwork. For their first song, the duo performed the album cut “Little Richard’s Bible,” leaning into the ‘50s-inspired rock sound. During the tune, John howled out the poetic tribute to his late friend and influence as his fingers kept down the rolicking piano line. At one point, he even let loose a solo, evoking his younger self and standing up out of excitement in a particularly up-beat moment. Carlile, playing guitar, looked on with a warm smile. For their second song, the duo played the title track to Who Believes in Angels?, with Carlile delivering a palpable sense of sincerity on the song’s “I’ve been there” refrain. Watch videos of both performances below. Who Believes in Angels? was first announced this past February, and was released on Friday, April 4th. It was preceded by two singles: the title track and March’s “Swing for the Fences.” Meanwhile, both John and Carlile have live dates coming up. John is set to perform in San Diego on May 9th for Curebound Concert For Cures (get tickets), and Carlile will play at her Mothership Weekend in Florida in May, followed by a number of European tour dates.",
