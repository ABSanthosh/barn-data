  "text": "King Diamond's November 20 show at the Edmonton Convention Center in Edmonton, AB and November 21 show at TCU Place in Saskatoon, SK have been cancelled. The news comes from TCU Place's social media, who issued the following statement: \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, the upcoming King Diamond shows in Saskatoon and Edmonton have been cancelled. Refunds are available at the point of purchase. For those interested in catching King Diamond, their show in Calgary at the Grey Eagle will still take place, and tickets are available at modo-live.com or ticketmaster.com.\" It's unclear what happened, but given the other Canadian show is still happening, it seems safe to rule out anything catastrophic. King Diamond is on the road across North America with newly-recruited backing vocalist and organist Myrkur, and openers Overkill and Night Demon. It's worth mentioning that King Diamond is also playing two new songs that we've never heard before, giving us all hope that The Institute is still happening.
