  "text": "The Puerto Rican artist will speak at 2024 Billboard Latin Music Week, returning Oct. 14-18 to Miami Beach. Yandel Ighor Cardozo In an industry constantly evolving with new musical trends, Yandel has opted to stay faithful to the genre that made him a household name, further proving on his new album why he remains one of the most elite artists in the game. Titled just that — ELYTE (replacing the I with the Y in honor of his artistic name) — the Puerto Rican artist presents his eighth solo studio album. The 19-track production is for the most part an entire album of reggaetón music, fusing the old-school sound with modern elements. Notably, the collaborators on the set include Tego Calderon, J Balvin, Feid, Myke Towers, Farruko and Blessd, to name a few.  “I feel deeply blessed and happy that my music has managed to transcend at different stages of my career,” the artist born Llandel Veguilla Malavé tells Billboard. “I always seek to evolve by staying true to my essence, without losing what defines me, but making sure that my music continues to connect with the public.”  ELYTE follows Yandel’s Resistencia (2023), Quien Contra Mi 2 (2020), The One (2019), #Update (2017), Dangerous (2015), De Líder a Leyenda (2013), and Quien Contra Mi (2003). Both his 2013 and 2015 albums hit No. 1 on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.  The album’s release also comes ahead of Yandel taking center stage at the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Week, returning to Miami Beach on Oct. 14-18, with other confirmed artists including Feid, Young Miko, Gloria Estefan, Alejandro Sanz, Maria Becerra and Peso Pluma, among many others.  Yandel — who’s also a finalist at the 2024 Billboard Latin Music Awards for Latin Rhythm Artist of the Year, Duo or Group with Wisin y Yandel — will be joined by Dei V and Roberto Andrade (managing director at Warner Music Latina) for a discussion on the beginning and future of the genre. For tickets and more details, visit BillboardLatinMusicWeek.com. Below, Yandel breaks down five essential tracks from ELYTE.  “Reggaetón Malandro” feat. Tego Calderón “This is a song by Nesty La Mente Maestra. From the moment I heard it, I immediately connected with it. “Reggaetón Malandro” is the pure essence of the golden age of reggaeton. Working on this song took me back to those moments when music felt raw, authentic, and full of energy. Also, teaming up with Tego Calderón on this song was something extraordinary for me. Tego is a great exponent of the beginning of this movement, and being able to collaborate with a legend who has left an indelible mark on reggaeton was an honor. Listening to it finished was like reliving that vibe, and it filled me with pride to know that we continue to contribute to such an important legacy for urban music.” “Old School” feat. Farruko “This song, as its name suggests, talks about how the genre grew while we were growing up in Puerto Rico, and that nostalgia is present in every verse. Creating it was a super cool process because we were able to connect with our roots and relive those moments that marked the beginning [of the movement]. With Farruko everything sounds good and he was the ideal person to share this song with. It turned out spectacular.” “Háblame Claro” feat. Feid  Image Credit: Oscar Mena “This is a song Tainy did with Los Icons. From the moment I heard it, I felt like it was a hit and that it was going to be a defining track on the album. We recorded it in Los Angeles, and what I remember most is the incredible energy that flowed in the studio that day. Everything felt natural, as if the ideas just aligned perfectly. Every time I listen to it, I am transported back to that moment and the vibe that led us to create something that, without a doubt, speaks to both the roots of reggaeton and its evolution.” “Puño de Tito” “This song is about me right now. It has a beat that captivates you and I decided to play it as the opening track of the album because it is the best introduction to ELYTE. I wanted you to feel that special something from the first moment and enjoy an album that has everything of me.” “Borracho y Loco” feat. Myke Towers Image Credit: Courtesy of Imagine It Media “This was the first single we released from the album and working with Myke is actually easy because he’s a great friend. We have a good sonic match and the collaboration came together quickly. It’s a happy and wild song like us. I’m very proud of this song.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
