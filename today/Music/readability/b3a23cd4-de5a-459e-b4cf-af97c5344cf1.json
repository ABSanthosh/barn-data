  "text": "In early January, Lucy Dacus put out a casting call for “hot mascs” to be featured in an upcoming music video. Now, the artist has shared the result of those efforts: a self-directed visual for her new song, “Best Guess,” the latest preview of her upcoming album, Forever Is a Feeling. Watch the clip below. Get Lucy Dacus Tickets Here A riff on ’90s Calvin Klein ads, the video co-stars Cara Delevigne, MUNA’s Naomi McPherson, Towa Bird, ER Fightmaster, and more as they bring “Best Guess” to life. Described in a press release as “an anthem of queer tenderness,” the song captures the feeling of taking a chance on a relationship with lyrics like: “If this doesn’t work out/ I would lose my mind/ And after a while/ I will be fine/ But I don’t wanna be fine/ I want you.” “Best Guess” is the third preview of Forever Is a Feeling after “Ankles” and “Limerence.” The album is out March 28th (pre-order here) and will be supported by a US tour with MUNA’s Katie Gavin and jasmine.4.t as openers. Tickets can be purchased here. Last month, Dacus pledged $10,000 to gender-affirming care in response to President Trump’s executive order targeting trans and non-binary individuals. More recently, she participated in an LA wildfire relief benefit concert alongside Hayley Williams, FINNEAS, St. Vincent, Jenny Lewis, and The Linda Lindas.",
