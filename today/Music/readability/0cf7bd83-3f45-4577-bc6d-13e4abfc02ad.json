JoJo Siwa attends the Disney+ \"High School Musical: The Musical: The Series\" season 3 premiere at Walt Disney Studios on July 27, 2022 in Burbank, California. VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images JoJo Siwa opened up about her sexuality and her reputation in a wide-ranging interview with Hailey Welch, a.k.a. the viral “Hawk Tuah” girl. In the latest episode of Welch’s Talk Tuah podcast, she brings up a recent photo shoot Siwa did with LadyGunn, in which the “Karma” singer is seen posing with a bedazzled gold chest plate and a matching G-string thong with a bulge peaking through. “The stone bulge is — we were just giving a little spice, a little gender-bend, a little you can be anything you want to be,” she said of the male genital addition to the outfit. “It just was spicing myself up a little. It’s like back in the day when Harry Styles wore a dress. Obviously, wearing a bulge is a little different than wearing a dress.” Siwa was referring to the December 2020 issue of Vogue, where Styles appears on the cover playing with genre-bending fashion by wearing a Gucci dress. Siwa added, “One thing about me is I like to be for the people who are different, for the people who don’t fit in and the people who are unafraid to take risks. Being that person, I have to go as far as I possibly can into the risk zone.” Explore Explore JoJo Siwa See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Elsewhere in the interview, Siwa discussed her dynamic with her new girlfriend, So You Think You Can Dance alum Dakayla Wilson. “I have big d— energy. It’s not a good thing, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just a thing. When it comes time to –just me at home, I have a switch. My d— gets soft,” she said. “My girlfriend’s always like, ‘I never thought that would happen. I thought you would just be, like, a hard-a– all the time.’ I’m definitely baby spoon vibe, but I will be big spoon. When we fall asleep, we fall asleep as a big spoon. But if we’re watching a movie, put your arm around me. I am nuzzling you.” Trending on Billboard She added of their intimate moments that she had been a “bottom” for most of her relationships, but that has changed with Wilson. “I have dabbled into top land. I prefer being bottom. […] I don’t like being a top, but I’m a really good top because I know what I like as a bottom.” Watch the full episode of Talk Tuah below.
