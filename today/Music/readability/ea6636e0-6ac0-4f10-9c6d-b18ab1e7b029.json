Sabrina Carpenter attends The BRIT Awards 2025 at the InterContinental London - The O2 on March 01, 2025 in London. Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images Español Sabrina Carpenter has taken the notion of “man’s best friend” quite literally in the weeks leading up to her seventh studio album, Man’s Best Friend. Set for release on Aug. 29 via Island Records, the LP’s rollout has been anything but ordinary: Carpenter enlisted a golden retriever puppy and a pair of lucky fans to unveil her tracklist, two songs at a time, in a series of Instagram and Twitter posts that combined star power with canine cuteness. About a month after announcing the album, Carpenter began the tracklist reveal on July 23 by introducing track 12, “Goodbye,” alongside a photo of fan Mariah cradling the puppy in her arms. In her caption she wrote, “track #12 is ‘Goodbye’ but mariah is helping us say hello to our tracklist reveal.” Trending on Billboard Two days later, Carpenter returned to the pup brigade to share track 11 — “House Tour” — featuring fan Neriah in a similar snapshot, captioned “neriah \u0026 a golden = home sweet home. track #11 is ‘House Tour.’” Both posts drew hundreds of thousands of likes, with fans applauding the innovative, heartwarming approach. Carpenter then took to X to amplify the moment, reposting excited reactions from @overdosedontun (“omggg sabrina asked me to reveal track 11 ‘House Tour’ from Man’s Best Friend !!!”) and urging fellow fans to rally: “Track 11 stans rise.” Beyond the puppy reveals, Carpenter has maintained momentum for Man’s Best Friend by leaning into playful fan interaction and capitalizing on her comedic timing — qualities that have earned her more than 5 million Instagram followers and built genuine community around her music. In the days that followed, titles “Don’t Worry I’ll Make You Happy” (track 10), “Go Go Juice” (track 9) and “When Did You Get Hot?” (track 8) were unveiled, with the countdown expected to continue. The forthcoming album follows 2024’s Short n’ Sweet and arrives amid Carpenter’s latest lead single, “Manchild,” released on June 5. Man’s Best Friend will drop almost exactly a year after Carpenter released breakthrough album Short n’ Sweet, which spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. So far, fans have gotten to hear only one song from the new record — “Manchild,” which dropped in June and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, marking Carpenter’s second-ever No. 1 song. In keeping with the album’s canine theme, Man’s Best Friend is available to preorder in multiple formats, including a Jacob Rochester–painted picture disc that depicts Carpenter in a surreal tableau beside a suited figure.
