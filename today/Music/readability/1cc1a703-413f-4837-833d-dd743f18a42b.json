MBW’s round-up is supported by Centtrip, which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximize their income and reduce their touring costs.Spotify revealed this week that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024 – a full $1 billion more than it paid out in 2023.Also this week, Spotify won a lawsuit brought by the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) last year over the streaming giant’s “bundling” of Premium subscriptions.Elsewhere this week, Influence Media Partners jumped into the asset-backed securitization (ABS) game with a $360 million debt financing round, backed by music royalties from its portfolio of music rights, and led by Goldman Sachs.Meanwhile, Concord acquired a portion of the song catalog of Johnny McDaid, a key collaborator of Ed Sheeran‘s, who has also written for the likes of P!nk, Lewis Capaldi, and BTS.Plus, Amazon Music raised the prices for its music streaming service in the US, the UK and Canada.Here’s what happened this week…gonzo/Shutterstock1) SPOTIFY PAID OUT $10 BILLION TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY IN 2024 – A FULL $1BN MORE THAN IN 2023Subscription music streaming changed the fortunes of the record industry over the past decade.That’s the message from David Kaefer, Spotify’s VP of Music Business, in a blog post published Tuesday (January 28).
