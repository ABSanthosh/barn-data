  "text": "Alright, this is pretty clever. Sleep Token just launched a mystery website called showmehowtodanceforever.com that seems to be hinting at a new record. Which makes sense given Download Festival boss Andy Copping saying in late 2024 that a new Sleep Token record should be out by the time the band headlines the festival: \"We're already on album number three and album number four should be out by the time Download comes around. It's going to be a meteoric rise for them across the globe, not just the UK. I think that they'll just do something super special there and smash it.\" Here's where things get really interesting. If you inspect the website's code and scroll all the way down, you'll find what appears to be an ASCII portal the with the coordinates \"52°48'05.0\"N 2°00'45.0\"W\" (as you'll see below in our screenshots). Those coordinates point to a location in Stafford, United Kingdom, which is… on a path of some sort? Maybe it has something to do with that building in the second screenshot below? Reddit seems to have figured out that the building in question is the Shepherd's Monument on the grounds of Shugborough Hall. The monument bears the inscription \"O U O S V A V V\" between the letters D M. The inscriptions are below a mirror image of Nicolas Poussin's painting the Shepherds of Arcadia, and has never been solved as to its meaning. Read all about that here because this one goes deep. The inscription So yeah, Sleep Token is up to some shit for sure. Want More Metal?
