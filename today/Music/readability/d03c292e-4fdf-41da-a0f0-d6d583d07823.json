  "text": "Sludge-metal veterans Down are recording their first new music in more than a decade. The long-running NOLA supergroup features singer Philip Anselmo (Pantera) alongside guitarists Pepper Keenan (Corrosion of Conformity) and Kirk Windstein (Crowbar), among others. Down — whose lineup is rounded out by drummer Jimmy Bower (Crowbar, Eyehategod, Superjoint Ritual) and bassist Pat Bruders (Crowbar, Goatwhore) — last released the EP Down IV – Part II in 2014. Get Danzig \u0026 Down Tickets Here On Friday (January 3rd), Bower posted a photo of Windstein and Keenan in the studio, writing, “Kirk and Pep laying down some magic today.” Back in November, Windstein told the podcast That Metal Interview (as transcribed by Blabbermouth), “I’ve been in Down world [for the last few months] kinda, writing with Down and finishing up the writing for the album that’s [gonna come] out [in 2025] at some point… We’ve got 10 new songs, man. It’s awesome.” Last month, it was announced that Down would support Danzig on a West Coast tour in March, with tickets available here. Anselmo has also been busy the past couple years touring with the revamped lineup of Pantera, who kick off a UK/European outing later this month. After that, Pantera will support Metallica at a number of North American stadium shows from April though June (pick up tickets here). See the studio update and the recent interview with Windstein below.",
