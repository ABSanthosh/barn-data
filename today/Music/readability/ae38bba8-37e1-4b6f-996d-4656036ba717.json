  "text": "No band ever seems to truly be over, and it seems that Van Halen might not be an exception. According to a report from De Telegraf, it seems Van Halen drummer Alex Van Halen is working with legendary session guitarist Steve Lukather on a new Van Halen record. De Telegraf seems to indicate that Van Halen and Lukather are working on finishing songs left behind by Eddie, though this is the translated version from Dutch word for word: \"After Eddie van Halen's death, there was already a lot of speculation about songs that were still on the shelf. It was common knowledge that the guitarist and his brother often worked for months in Eddie's 5150 studio in Hollywood to record songs. Alex van Halen indicates that he consciously chose Lukather. 'Ed and Steve Lukather were very good friends and they often worked together. There is no one who can do this process with me as well as he can.' \"Lukather was confronted with this news by the Telegraaf himself when he gave a concert with his band Toto in the Gelredome in Arnhem two weeks ago. 'Did Alex say that? Oh, in that case the news is true. Ed, Alex and I were very close for years. It is true that we worked on it together.'\" Of course there are loads of questions left unawared here, first and foremost \"is this actually happening?\" If so, how much of it will feature Eddie's playing or writing? And of course, who might it involve outside the aforementioned duo? I guess we'll see what happens. If this happens, it'll be the first new Van Halen material since A Different Kind of Truth in 2012.
