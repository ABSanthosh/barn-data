  "text": "Rolling Stone just published their The 100 Best Albums Of 2024 list and it's got one metal album on it. Rolling Stone overlooked some underground-ish killers like Blood Incantation's Absolute Elsewhere and Chat Pile's Cool World, skipped right over Judas Priest's Invincible Shield for a more mainstream pick, and went straight for Kerry King's debut solo album From Hell I Rise. Which certainly wasn't bad, but I mean… no other metal albums, huh? Also, I'm not sure I agree with Rolling Stone author K.G.'s assessment that King's album sounds \"at times, Slayer at their best.\" \"The first solo album from former Slayer guitarist Kerry King is basically the 'Still D.R.E.' of thrash metal,\" wrote K.G. \"But where Dr. Dre wanted to remind his fans that he was still puffin' his leafs, still fucking with beats, and still not lovin' police after close to a decade's absence, King wants his fans to understand that even though Slayer are essentially hell bound, he's still Satan's preeminent ambassador. On From Hell I Rise, King is still drinkin' his tequila, still fucking with riffs, and still not lovin' the priests. In other words, it sounds like Slayer — and at times, Slayer at their best.\" Anyway, check out the whole list here. Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter took the No. 1 spot. Want More Metal?
