La Joaqui: Hi everyone, I’m Joaqui and I’m here with Billboard for the ‘Behind the Photo.’ What a look that day, sometimes I treat myself badly. I love this photo because I’m sure you didn’t even know it, but this is when Kenia Os flew me to Los Angeles. I didn’t even know Los Angeles. And in fact I was Kenini, a fan, and I wrote to her because I was her fan. And I told her, “I’m your fan and I’m tired of acting like a normal person.” And she said, “I love what you do.” The next day, instantly, she sent me a ticket to Los Angeles. She took me to see Los Angeles, she took me to eat at a beautiful place. We did a song that became a hit, that opened the door for me to this precious kingdom that she shared with me. It is too early to get emotional. I love this photo, too. These are the polaroids that Cassu took because she has Polaroids and analog photos of me since 2014. She loves to take pictures, it’s a little secret she keeps to herself. And this is one of the collections she gave me, which is us being mothers with all our babies. Beautiful. What a nice picture. This is Shei SHei, one of my best friends. On her birthday, we made her a surprise cowboy snack because we were creating “TU PATRONA,” we had to be in the mood. Keep watching for more!",
