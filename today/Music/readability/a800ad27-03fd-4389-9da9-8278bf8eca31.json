MusiCares Courtesy Photo As the devastation from the wildfires in Los Angeles continues to unfold, the Recording Academy and MusiCares have launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort to support music professionals impacted by the crisis, making a combined pledge of $1 million to kick off the efforts. “The entire Grammy family is shocked and deeply saddened by the situation that is unfolding in Los Angeles,” Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy and MusiCares, said in a statement. “The music community is being so severely impacted but we will come together as an industry to support one another. Our organizations exist to serve music people … and we hope the broader industry will now rally to this cause.” “We expect the disaster relief efforts in Los Angeles to be extraordinary, if even just on the basis of how many music people have lost their homes in the last day,” added Laura Segura, executive director of MusiCares. “MusiCares is always committed to ensuring that music professionals are supported in times of crisis, and we ask for the larger community to donate for those in need at this dire time. MusiCares can help with short term emergent needs for those currently displaced, and then longer-term services as we get a handle on the full extent of how music people are impacted.” If you or someone you know in the music industry has been affected by the LA County fires, visit https://musicares.org/get-help to apply for relief. You can also send an email to musicaresrelief@musicares.org or call 1-800-687-4227. You can contribute to the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort to Support Music Professionals by donating at MusiCares.org/FireRelief. For more than three decades, MusiCares has provided relief to the music industry during times of need, including the Las Vegas Route 91 shooting, the COVID-19 pandemic, Superstorm Sandy, Hurricanes Katrina and Helene, and the California and Maui wildfires.
