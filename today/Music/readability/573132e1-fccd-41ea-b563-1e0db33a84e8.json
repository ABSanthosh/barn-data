  "text": "Mike Shinoda is aware of the comparisons that have come about since resurrecting Linkin Park without its lead vocalist, Chester Bennington, who tragically passed away nearly eight years ago, with new co-vocalist, Emily Armstrong. But, he's been quick to defend and protect the integrity of his newest bandmate's work. After extensive controversy regarding Emily Armstrong's connections with scientology, and possibly supporting convicted-rapist Danny Masterson, combined with a part of the fanbase just generally being upset that anyone was replacing Chester Bennington, Shinoda told KROQ radio last September: \"One difficult thing that people are experiencing is just that they've heard Linkin Park for so long with Chester's voice and the idea of somebody being in that role, it feels really different.\" But, Shinoda took upset fans' feelings regarding the new addition to the band with a pinch of salt, \"In the context of the new music, I know that I love it. I think her voice is incredible. And the best thing for people who have such a strong connection to Chester to know, just to know about me, is that Chester was a one-of-a-kind person and a one-of-a-kind voice, and Emily is also a one-of-a-kind person and a one-of-a-kind voice.\" Shinoda acknowledged that it feels \"like a new band,\" to Baltimore's 98 Rock radio station more recently (transcribed via Blabbermouth): \"So, it's almost like a new band, a new start, a first album. But luckily, we're also a new band that has 25 years of catalog people wanna see on stage and in concert.\" But, Shinoda thinks Armstrong fits in well, \"She's put in so much work. She's done such a great job,\" – and that's all that matters. Linkin Park are releasing a deluxe version of their newest record with Emily Armstrong on vocals, From Zero, on May 16th. The streaming version of the deluxe edition will include three new tracks, while From Zero (Deluxe Edition) will contain those three new tracks alongside five recordings of the band's most recent worldwide performances.
