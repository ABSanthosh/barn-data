  "text": "Norwegian black-meets-thrash metal band Sarke has sadly called it a day. Sarke existed between 2008 and 2025, and released eight albums – Endo Feight in 2024 being their final effort. Sarke's lineup over the years held quite a few legends outside founding bassist Sarke – this included Darkthrone's Nocturno Culto, Steinar Gundersen of Khold and Spiral Architect, former Enslaved drummer Cato Bekkevold, Spiral Architect drummer Asgeir Mickelson, Kråbøl drummer Terje Kråbøl and guitarist Stian Kråbøl, and many more. \"After eight albums and an incredible journey, Sarke has reached its end. It has been an honor to create music, perform live, and be part of something that has connected with so many of you. From the very beginning, what started as a solo project quickly evolved into a full band, allowing me to collaborate with musicians I deeply respect. \"We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been part of this journey: our dedicated fans, the media, our record labels, and our manager Håkon Grav of Photograve Management, our producer Lars Erik Westby from H-10 Productions, as well as every musician who has been a part of Sarke over the years. The lineup changes were never just changes—they were opportunities to work with artists I looked up to, and that has been an incredible experience. \"Our debut album Vorunah will always hold a special place in our hearts, as it was the beginning of something unique. At the same time, we are proud to have ended things on a high note with Endo Feight, an album that truly feels like a worthy conclusion to our story. And, of course, having the chance to travel and perform live for you has been an unforgettable privilege. \"Thank you for being part of this journey. Your support has meant everything. Sarke may be ending, but the music and memories live on. All the best, Sarke\" Want More Metal?
