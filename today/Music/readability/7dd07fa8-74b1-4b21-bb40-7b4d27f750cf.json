  "text": "Good news! Korn is working on the follow-up to their 2022 record Requiem. Though you're probably not going to hear it anytime soon. According to Korn guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch in an interview with BBC Radio 1's Rock Show With Daniel P Carter (as transcribed by The PRP), the band is \"taking their sweet ass time with it.\" Which isn't a bad thing – if more time means a better final product, then awesome. Korn guitarist Brian \"Head\" Welch later added: \"Yeah, we're doing it all on tape. Like, we're all in the room, sweating it out, [the] tape is rolling. The guy gives us the thumbs up in the window and we start playing and all of us are locked in. And if we don't get it right, we rewind the tape and we do it again. It takes more commitment. It's like this is how we used to make records. So there's an energy to it that we, I think, we like.\" Of course the real question is whether or not bassist Fieldy will be on the new record, but I guess we'll see what happens.
