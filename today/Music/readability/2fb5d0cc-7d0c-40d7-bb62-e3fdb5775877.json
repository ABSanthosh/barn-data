  "text": "Following a recent scandal alleging that the folk artist and activist Buffy Sainte-Marie had fabricated her Canadian Indigenous roots, the Polaris Music Prize and Juno Awards have revoked honors bestowed on the musician. The release of a 2023 documentary produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) called Sainte-Marie’s Indigenous identity into question. A fervent activist for Indigenous causes, as reflected in songs like “Now That the Buffalo’s Gone,” Sainte-Marie had long claimed that she was born and raised on a Cree reservation in Saskatchewan. However, the CBC program uncovered she was in fact born in Massachusetts. Earlier this year, Sainte-Marie, was stripped of her Order of Canada appointment. Now, the Polaris Music Prize and the Juno Awards have decided that her collected accolades from both institutions will be rescinded, due to her inability to provide tangible proof of her Canadian and/or Indigenous identity. The Polaris Prize was first awarded in 2006 and honors one full-length musical project created by a Canadian artist annually. Sainte-Marie had been awarded two Polaris Prizes; the first for her 2015 album Power in the Blood and later a Heritage Prize, which awards works that were released prior to the voting body’s first ceremony, for her 1964 record It’s My Way! “Our eligibility criteria requires all nominees to be Canadian citizens or permanent residents,” read a statement from the organization, “With proof of status provided through government-issued documentation, including passports, birth certificates, permanent resident cards, and/or secure certificates of Indian Status.” The Juno Awards has a longer history in Canada. The first JUNOS were called the Gold Leaf Awards and its inaugural ceremony was held in February 1970. Presented by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) the JUNOS honor new releases from Canadian artists that year, including Artist of the Year and Album of the Year. Sainte-Marie had received multiple Juno Awards, including the Humanitarian Award in 2017 and Indigenous Music Album of the Year in 2018. CARAS also founded the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1978, inducting Sainte-Marie in 1995, meaning she will no longer be part of the group of famed musicians, which includes Joni Mitchell, Alanis Morrisette, Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, and Leonard Cohen, among others. According to a CARAS press statement, the Academy acknowledges that “this decision is not a reflection of Ms. Sainte-Marie’s artistic contributions.” The statement continued: “Buffy Sainte-Marie has been a strong supporter and advocate for Canadian music, and we acknowledge the past contributions she has made to our organization. However, CARAS’ mandate is to educate, develop, celebrate, and honor Canadian artists. Maintaining the integrity of this process is essential to ensuring the organization continues to fulfill its purpose.” Following the release of CBC’s report, Sainte-Marie removed explicit claims of being Cree from her website, however, she maintained that she was Indigenous heritage in public statements. In a new statement responding to her being stripped of the Order of Canada and other accolades, Sainte-Marie said she “never treated my citizenship as a secret and most of my friends and relatives in Canada have known I’m American, and it’s never been an issue.” She added, “Although it’s true that I’ve never been certain of where I was born, and did investigate the possibility that I may have been born in Canada, I still don’t know.” As for her being stripped of her accolades, Sainte-Marie stated,  “It was very lovely to host the medals for awhile, but I return them with a good heart.” Sainte-Marie, 84, retired from live performances in 2023, citing physical injuries and health problems. Her last record was 2017’s Medicine Songs.",
