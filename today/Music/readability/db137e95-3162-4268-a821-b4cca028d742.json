  "text": "The Los Angeles record label Leaving has digitally released a new compilation to support artists who’ve been impacted by the California wildfires. The album, Staying, has contributions from Samantha Urbani, Eddie Chacon, Sam Wilkes, Laraaji, Reggie Watts, André 3000, Samiyam, Brijean, Julia Holter, Total Blue, and many others. The label’s founder, Matthewdavid, curated and compiled Staying, with help from Carlos Niño. Find the new compilation below. Vinyl and cassette editions of Staying: Leaving Records Aid to Artists Impacted by the Los Angeles Wildfires are forthcoming.Emmett Shoemaker, in a statement for Leaving Records, explained: “Seeking to supplement the numerous GoFundMes and the profound, often harrowing acts of mutual aid that are currently buoying recovery efforts, and in lieu of donating to a third party organization, all proceeds will be donated directly to impacted individuals. 50% will be meticulously, manually allocated to Los Angeles artists and music colleagues in need, as equitably as possible. We will be referencing existing music community aid spreadsheets / documents already circulating, alongside a succinct internal list of those affected in our immediate community. The other 50% of funds will be allocated to displaced Black families and community impacted by the fires, again, as equitably as possible (ie https://gofund.me/3f23de7d).”Since the wildfires broke out last week, there have been fundraisers to support Diiv’s Zachary Cole Smith, the rapper Fat Tony, Ought and Cola’s Tim Darcy, Madlib, and more. Organizations including BeyGood and MusiCares have also made donations to support wildfire relief efforts. There will also be a benefit concert, on January 30, featuring Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Joni Mitchell, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many others.Nicholas Pedroza, of Astro Nick and Bedridden, has also organized a benefit compilation to support the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank. The album, simply titled 2025 LA Fire Relief Comp, features They Are Gutting a Body of Water, Computerwife, Shower Curtain, Sleep Habits, and more. Find that new album below, too.",
