Jay David Saks listens during \"All Shook Up\" cast album recording at Right Track Recording Studio April 4, 2005 in New York City. Paul Hawthorne/Getty Images Record producer Jay David Saks, who died last month, left behind a rich and unique legacy, one that spanned the worlds of classical music and Broadway cast albums. But it all began a member of a “one-hit-wonder” group which had a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Saks died on Nov. 16 of Parkinsonism-related causes. He was 79. News of his death was confirmed by Peter Gelb of The Metropolitan Opera. Saks won 13 Grammys between 1983 and 2014, eight for classical music and five for his work on Broadway cast albums. He won best opera recording four times, all for work with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra/The Metropolitan Opera Chorus. He won for Verdi: La Traviata Opera Recording; Adams: Doctor Atomic; Wagner: Der Ring Des Nibelungen and Adès: The Tempest. Trending on Billboard He won best musical show album five times for cast albums from Into the Woods and Jerome Robbins’ Broadway and revivals of Guys and Dolls, Chicago and Gypsy. In addition, Saks won two Daytime Emmys, both for his work on Great Performances at the Met. He won outstanding individual achievement in any area of the performing arts – audio (1983) and outstanding individual achievement in the performing arts – audio (1984). Born in New York City, Saks grew up in The Bronx. His older sister was the cellist Toby Saks. During the 1960’s, Saks played bass guitar with The Balloon Farm, which had a top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1968 with the psychedelic pop/rock song “A Question of Temperature.” Saks wasn’t the only member of The Balloon Farm who went on to success in the industry. Fellow member Mike Appel managed Bruce Springsteen from 1972-75 and co-produced his first three albums. Their sole hit was produced by Peter Schekeryk, who went on to produce hits for his wife, Melanie, including the Hot 100-topping “Brand New Key.” Saks studied at the Juilliard School, and later continued his studies at the Mannes College of Music, from which he graduated in 1970. As an audio producer for CBS Masterworks, RCA Red Seal (RCA Records), Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), and Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Saks was responsible for engineering and master recording hundreds of titles. Beginning in 1980, Saks worked with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to record and produce more than 1,600 of its telecasts, radio broadcasts and live HD transmissions. Saks was nominated for 53 Grammys between 1977 and 2018. He received at least one Grammy nomination in 30 different years. He was nominated 10 times for classical producer of the year, but he never won in that category. Saks’ other cast show album nominations (in addition to his five wins) were for Starting Here, Starting Now, Anything Goes, Assassins, Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying!, Ragtime the Musical (for two different recordings), Cabaret, Fosse, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Man of La Mancha, Avenue Q—The Musical and The Color Purple. Saks was also nominated for best compilation soundtrack album for a motion picture, television or other visual media for Fantasia/2000. Saks was nominated for a Primetime Emmy in 2007 – outstanding sound mixing for a variety or music series or special – as audio producer for PBS’ The Magic Flute (Great Performances at the Met). An avid runner, Saks completed one of the earliest New York City marathons. Saks is survived by his wife, Linda Saks; their two sons, Jeremy Saks and Greg Saks; and three grandchildren, Bo Saks, May Li Saks, and Ben Saks. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
