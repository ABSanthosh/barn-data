FKA twigs performs during Vogue World: Paris at Place Vendome on June 23, 2024 in Paris, France. Marc Piasecki/Getty Images for Vogue FKA Twigs announced Friday night (April 4) that she has to cancel the remainder of her April tour dates in North America due to “ongoing visa issues.” The announcement affects her scheduled performances during weekends 1 and 2 at Coachella in Indio, California, later this month, as well as this weekend’s AXE Ceremonia in Mexico City. “im devastated to share the news that due to ongoing visa issues i am not able to see through any of my scheduled tour dates for the remainder of april across north america, including ceremonia and coachella,” Twigs announced via X (formerly Twitter). “it pains me to say this because i am so excited to bring you a creation that i have poured my soul into and i believe is amongst my strongest work and i know this news impacts so many of you that have already made plans and spent money in order to see these shows.” As for when Stateside fans can expect to see Twigs perform again, she promised she’s “working to reschedule the affected dates as quickly as possible.” Trending on Billboard “for headline shows, please refer to your point of purchase for details and refund information,” her statement continued. “back to you all with more updates as soon as i have them — in the meantime here are some of my favourite parts of the show that we worked so hard to create.” As part of her post, the performer shared four photos, in black-and-white and screaming red, from her tour dates across Europe so far, with the Eusexua Tour kicking off last month in Paris and continuing through dates in London, ending March 22. Brazilian pop star Anitta also dropped out of Coachella last month, “due to unexpected personal reasons.” Find FKA Twigs’ full post about the cancellation of her April dates below: im devastated to share the news that due to ongoing visa issues i am not able to see through any of my scheduled tour dates for the remainder of april across north america, including ceremonia and coachella. it pains me to say this because i am so excited to bring you a creation… pic.twitter.com/0VfhbC39Na— FKA twigs (@FKAtwigs) April 4, 2025 Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
