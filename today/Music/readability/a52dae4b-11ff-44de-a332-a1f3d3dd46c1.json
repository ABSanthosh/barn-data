  "text": "Spiritualized have added two U.S. dates to their tour celebrating the 30th anniversary of their second album, Pure Phase. They’ll play the album in full at Brooklyn’s Kings Theatre and downtown Los Angeles’ Orpheum Theatre on September 25 and 28, respectively.In a press release, J Spaceman said of Pure Phase, “I think it’s quite extraordinary and I’d probably say it’s my favourite of the records I’ve made. The construction of it satisfied something in me that likes breaking the rules, not in any kind of grandiose way but there’s something in the process of that which really satisfies me. Each side of the stereo contains a completely separate mix. I checked the masters back and it still sounds like this extraordinary thing. It exists in its own space; it doesn’t sound like anybody else.” The album, he added, was inspired by Michael Nyman, Steve Reich, John Adams, and rock’n’roll and gospel, creating music that “sounds like driving as fast as you can in torrential rain.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
