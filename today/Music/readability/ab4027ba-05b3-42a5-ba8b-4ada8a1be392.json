  "text": "Matt Cameron is leaving Pearl Jam, the drummer and his now-former bandmates announced today on social media. Cameron thanked frontman Eddie Vedder, guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, and bassist Jeff Ament for welcoming him into the group in 1998, but he did not disclose the reason for his departure. The remaining Pearl Jam members also did not say why Cameron is leaving. See their statements below.Pearl Jam cycled through drummers before finding a steady presence in Matt Cameron. The group’s first drummer, Dave Krusen, left in 1991, and was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who was in the band for a matter of weeks. Dave Abbruzzese took over in 1991, but he was replaced in 1994 by Jack Irons, the band’s last drummer before Cameron.By the time Cameron joined Pearl Jam, the group had already recorded five studio albums—1991’s Ten, 1993’s Vs., 1994, Vitalogy, 1996’s No Code, and 1998’s Yield. His first album with Pearl Jam, Binaural, came out in 2000, and he played on all of the band’s ensuing studio albums, the most recent of which, Dark Matter, came out in 2024.Prior to joining Pearl Jam, Matt Cameron spent over a decade with Soundgarden, playing on classics like Badmotorfinger and Superunknown. He also played with Chris Cornell and his eventual Pearl Jam bandmates in the supergroup Temple of the Dog.Outside of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, Cameron collaborated with Zach Hill and Janet Weiss on a 2013 album called Drumgasm. Later, in 2017, he released his first proper solo album, Cavedweller, through Pearl Jam’s Monkeywrench Records. And, more recently, he teamed up with Krist Novoselic, Kim Thayil, and others to release an album titled 3rd Secret.Cameron was inducted into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 as a member of Pearl Jam. He’ll be officially inducted as a member of Soundgarden later this year.Matt Cameron:After 27 fantastic years, I have taken my final steps down the drum riser for the mighty Pearl Jam. Much love and respect to Jeff, Ed, Mike and Stone for inviting me into the band in 1998 and for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime, filled with friendships, artistry, challenges and laughter. I am forever grateful to the crew, staff and fans the world over. It’s been an incredible journey. More to follow. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.Peace and Love,Matt CameronPearl Jam:From being one of our first musical heroes in the bands Skinyard and the mighty Soundgarden, to playing on our first demos in 1990, Matt Cameron has been a singular and true powerhouse of a musician and drummer.He has propelled the last 27 years of Pearl Jam live shows and studio recordings. It was a deeply important chapter for our group and we wish him well always. He will be deeply missed and is forever our friend in art and music.We love you Matt.",
