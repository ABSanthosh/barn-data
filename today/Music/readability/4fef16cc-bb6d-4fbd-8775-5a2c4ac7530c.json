Every month, Billboard Latin and Billboard Español editors spotlight a group of rising artists whose music we love. Think “diamantes en bruto,” or “diamonds in the rough.” These are newcomers who have yet to impact the mainstream — but whose music excites us, and who we believe our readers should make a point to discover. Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Our latest edition of On the Radar Latin includes a wave of emerging artists, who we discovered either by networking, or coming across their music at a showcase, or elsewhere. See our recommendations this month below: Artist: Baltazar Lora Trending on Billboard Country: Colombian American Why They Should Be on Your Radar: Baltazar Lora was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky to Colombian parents, which explains why his sound straddles two different worlds. There’s the Latin side that pulls at his heart strings and feeds on 70s classics from the Latin songbook. Check out his funky take on Danny Daniel’s “Por el amor de una mujer.” And then there’s what he grew up listening to –alt rock like The Strokes and Cage The Elephant—which inform his original material, melodic, catchy and with an indie vibe that doesn’t fall into the contrived territory of so many homegrown Latin acts.  Lora can sing equally well in both English and Spanish, and in fact, his beginnings with his own band, in high school and later at Yale University, were in English. He’s not only convincing in Spanish but also  fills a void there. His latest single, “Why Bye,” evokes the likes of Cage the Elephant but also Morat, and there’s clearly an appetite for this kind of artist and sound (and the cute hipster look doesn’t hurt either). Now working with veteran producer Kike Santander, Lora is testing different waters, and getting us to listen in the process. — LEILA COBO Song For Your Playlist: “Why Bye” Artist: Doctor Nativo Country: Guatemaya (as he calls it) Why The Should Be On Your Radar: Doctor Nativo has long been a voice for the voiceless, weaving poetry and activism into music that moves both the spirit and the soul. Formerly known as part of the pioneering Guatemalan hip-hop trio Balam Ajpu — who fused indigenous Mayan philosophy with modern rap — Nativo has continued to channel ancestral wisdom into songs that grapple with current injustices. His latest track, “Minorías,” featuring singer Adriana Primavera, is an emotional portrait of immigrant life. Set against nylon-string guitar melodies and haunting wind instruments, the single tells stories of struggle and survival, sung from the perspective of undocumented immigrants. Themes of familial heartbreak, displacement, and systemic oppression shape the lyrics, painting a devastating yet honest picture of life on the margins. The track, in a way, evokes Manu Chao’s “Clandestino,” striking a rare balance between beauty and heartbreak. The video, shot at the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Tijuana, underscores the song’s urgency, as immigration remains a polarizing topic worldwide.Nativo plays the role of an immigrant caught in the shadow of the American Dream, exposing the toll of chasing asylum and opportunity. — ISABELA RAYGOZA Song For Your Playlist: “Minorías” Artist: Vivillo Country: Spain Why They Should Be on Your Radar: Vivillo made his professional debut in 2004, when he entered the Benidorm Festival with the song “Soñé” under the stage name Viviarte. He was then 18 and had already been in music for over a decade, as he joined his church choir at the age of 6. Originally from La Línea de Concepción (Cádiz), Vivillo (real name: Rafael Fernández) has a Latin pop/urban sound with flamenco roots that can be heard on songs including “Solo Tú” and “Ella,” his latest singles. He has also collaborated with artists like Chabuco, who joined him on the song “Alma de Cristal” for his 2019 album Hay Quien Espera. – SIGAL RATNER-ARIAS Song for your playlist: “Ella” Name: Mattei Country: Puerto Rico Why They Should Be On Your Radar: In February, Mattei (real name: Sebastián Rodríguez Mattei) dropped his first-ever song called “Pa Las Girlas” (for the girls). It’s old-school beat à la reggaetón de marquesina instantly captivated the attention of artists such as Feid and Nicky Jam, who helped propel the tune to its viral success on social media. With his clean-cut yet bad-boy look and distinct voice, Mattei promises to become the next breakout star of Puerto Rico — so much so that genre icons Árcangel, De La Ghetto, and Jowell \u0026 Randy hopped on the “Pa Las Girlas (Remix)” earlier this month. — JESSICA ROIZ Song For Your Playlist: “Pa Las Girlas (Remix)” feat.
