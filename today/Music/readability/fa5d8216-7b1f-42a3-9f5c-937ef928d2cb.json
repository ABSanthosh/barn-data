  "text": "Metallica have paid tribute to Ozzy Osbourne following the legendary singer’s passing on Tuesday morning (July 22nd), calling him a “hero, icon, pioneer, inspiration, mentor, and, most of all, friend.” Ozzy famously took Metallica out on the road with him to support his “Ultimate Sin Tour” in 1986, helping bring their music to the masses. Just 17 days ago, Metallica played the “Back to the Beginning” concert featuring the final performances of Ozzy and Black Sabbath. In a statement on their official Instagram account, Metallica wrote the following: “It’s impossible to put into words what Ozzy Osbourne has meant to Metallica. Hero, icon, pioneer, inspiration, mentor, and, most of all, friend are a few that come to mind. Ozzy and Sharon believed in us and transformed our lives and careers. He taught us how to play in the big leagues while at the same time being warm, welcoming, engaging, and all around brilliant. We are heartbroken and devastated by this loss and send our love and condolences to Sharon and their family, bandmates, and his very large circle of friends. He left an incredible legacy and will be sorely missed.” Metallica are among the dozens of music acts and entertainers who have paid tribute to Ozzy upon the news of his passing, including the singer’s Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward. Along with their tribute, Metallica posted a couple of photos of themselves posing with Ozzy (see below).",
