  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Music | More Platforms Most fans might not consider Fall Out Boy particularly ska-ish, but there’s actually a strong connection between the band and the genre. This week on In Defense of Ska, the podcast welcomes back a fan-favorite guest, Fall Out Boy lead singer Patrick Stump, to chat more about his appreciation for ska, his favorite bands in the scene, and more. Listen above, or wherever you get your podcasts. Get Fall Out Boy Tickets Here Stump was previously on the podcast in 2021, where he shared a cover of Reel Big Fish’s “Sellout.” Now, the singer is back, and he has a whole lot more to say about his love of ska music. Stump talks about how his appreciation started when he was growing up in Chicago in the ’90s, sharing with the hosts some of his favorite bands from that time. He also celebrates Chuck Wren’s “Everything Off Beat” radio show, which helped further his knowledge and admiration for the genre. The FOB frontman also goes into detail about how different ska bands have inspired him and his work. He gushes over Fishbone, one of his favorite bands, and explains how he feels they are more complex than people realize. In addition, Stump discusses his love for Blue Meanies and how he was starstruck meeting their guitarist Sean Dolan. He even wore a Blue Meanies shirt during Fall Out Boy’s last tour. Elsewhere, he explains the rest of the band’s history with ska (such as originally being signed by a ska label) and goes into which Fall Out Boy songs he thinks are the most ska-leaning. So, listen Patrick Stump’s conversation about Fall Out Boy and ska above, and make sure to like, review, and follow the series wherever you get your podcast. Don’t forget to check out all the Consequence Podcast Network series here. Additionally, you can support the In Defense of Ska host Aaron Carnes by purchasing a copy of his book, In Defense of Ska. The 2nd, expanded edition will be released in October 2024. Co-host Adam Davis also has a band called Omnigone, whose latest record, Against the Rest, was released earlier this year.",
