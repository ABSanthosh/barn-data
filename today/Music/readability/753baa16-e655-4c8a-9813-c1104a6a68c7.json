  "text": "Disney+ has picked up a Holes TV show for pilot, as first reported by Variety. The potential series would be based on Louis Sachar’s 1998 book of the same name, which Disney previously adapted as a feature film in 2003. Alina Mankin will serve as writer, sharing executive producer duties with showrunner Liz Phang. One of the movie’s producers, Walden Media, is also producing the pilot after trying to get a series adaptation “off the ground for some time,” according to Variety. Here’s the logline: “In this reimagining of the beloved 1998 book from Louis Sachar, a teenage girl is sent to a detention camp where the ruthless Warden forces the campers to dig holes for a mysterious purpose.” The original Holes novel told the story of Stanley Yelnats, who was forced to dig holes at Camp Green Lake. A young Shia LaBeouf played Stanley in the movie, starring alongside Sigourney Weaver, Khleo Thomas, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Patricia Arquette, Dulé Hill, and Eartha Kitt.
