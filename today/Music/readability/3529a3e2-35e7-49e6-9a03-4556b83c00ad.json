  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Podcasts | More Platforms Auliʻi Cravalho (best known as the voice of Moana) returns to the mic in Lulu Is a Rhinoceros, a new Apple TV+ animated musical that asks, “What if identity was more than skin — or fur — deep?” Voicing a dog who sees a rhinoceros when they look in the mirror, Cravalho uses this children’s story to navigate themes of gender identity, kindness, and self-acceptance, and talks with Kyle Meredith all about it. Listen to the episode above or wherever you get your podcasts. Cravalho is also coming off a run in Cabaret starring alongside Adam Lambert, because apparently it’s not enough to voice a Disney icon — you’ve also got to tackle fascism eight shows a week. She talks about her love for roles that challenge her, her not-so-secret desire to play a villain, and how Lulu offers a chance to speak directly to the younger version of herself. Spoiler: she’s also plotting to take over behind the camera as a producer, director, and general artistic overlord. Listen to Auliʻi Cravalho talk about Lulu Is a Rhinoceros and more in the new episode above or by watching the video below. Keep up on all the latest episodes by following Kyle Meredith With… on your favorite podcast platform; plus, check out all the series on the Consequence Podcast Network.",
