  "text": "Neil Young intends to keep on rockin’ in the free world — Ukraine included. Via his website, the legendary rocker has announced plans to play free a free concert in the war-torn country in the near future. Specific details — including a date and location — are forthcoming. While the Trump administration has taken a harsher stance on Ukraine, falsely accusing the country of provoking Russia’s 2022 invasion, Young understands where the true blame lies. He previously described Russia’s invasion as “the crazy war of an old dying guy who wants to relive his life and make things better for himself because of mistakes he thinks were made 50 years ago . . . That’s a screwed-up mind. [Vladimir] Putin is receding into himself as he dies. He’s not leading. He’s only protecting Putin the Great.” As for Trump, in an a recent blog post titled “Leader of the Free World No More,” Young wrote that, “Under 47’s leadership, the US has lost its standing. Loyalists will never be stronger than Patriots, and Patriots are in the majority here in the USA. Our Patriots will take to the streets to peacefully demonstrate. There will be a moment of truth in our country and we will show the world who we really are. The USA will again be the leader of the Free World.” Presumably, Young and his new band, the chrome hearts, will visit Ukraine amidst the upcoming UK/European leg of their “love earth world tour,” which kicks off in June. They’ll then embark on a North American tour beginning in August. Tickets are available here.
