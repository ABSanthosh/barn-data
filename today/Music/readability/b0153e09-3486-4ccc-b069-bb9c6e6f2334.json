  "text": "Creed is set to embark on their second major reunion tour this summer, and guitarist Mark Tremonti isn't sure how many more the band can do before they've gotta start making more music. In an interview with Matt Pinfield, Tremonti said there's going to come a point that Creed will need some new music to start promoting. Tremonti also notes that Creed has begun talking about making new music, so y'know – maybe 2026? \"We're just finishing up this first tour,\" said Tremonti. \"Just us coming back together after so long was the big driver to get people to come to the shows. But as we keep doing it, we're going to need to introduce new music to keep, saying, 'Hey, we're touring this new EP or this new record.' So, we've all talked about it, and we just have to make the time and figure [it] out.\" \"We're all spinning plates right now. Scott's got his new record out. I've got my new record [The End Will Show Us How]. We got an Alter Bridge record we're going to record next year. And then, new Creed music — we'll try to start planting those seeds, and get those things going. Because it just can't all happen at one time. We've got to put everything in its place.\" This wouldn't be the first time that Creed put out some reunion material either. Upon reuniting in 2009, the band dropped their record Full Circle and stayed together until 2012. While you're waiting for the new material, Creed will hit the road for their 2025 Summer of '99 Tour featuring 3 Doors Down, Daughtry, Mammoth WVH, and Big Wreck. The tour begins on July 9 at Rupp Arena in Lexington, KY and wraps August 20 at the Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary, AB.
