  "text": "Vocalist Chris Lindblad of the now-defunct sludge band Admiral Angry has died. News of Lindblad's death comes from former Admiral Angry bassist Brandon Gillichbauer, who posted the following statement to his current band Black Sheep Wall's Facebook page alongside the launch of a benefit t-shirt (available here). \"It is with a heavy heart that I share, this past Wednesday, November 20th 2024 we learned of the passing of Christopher Patrick Lindblad, beloved son, brother, bandmate, and friend,\" wrote Gillichbauer. \"I've always been inspired by Chris; looked up to him, admired him. My first conversation with Chris was on the last day of a middle school trip to Washington. Standing in line for the Alpengeist at Busch Gardens, Chris gave me a compliment, it was the first time we ever spoke to each other. At that moment I remember thinking, 'Chris is really cool, why is he talking to me? I really wish he was my friend and that he thought I was cool.' 2 years later my wish came true. Chris was the first member of Admiral Angry that Daniel and I recruited and that gave me the opportunity to not only grow an incredible friendship with Chris, but to create art with him as well. I am forever grateful for that opportunity. \"This shirt release is done with the blessing of his family and the proceeds from the sales will be used for funeral costs and additional expenses. This will be a 3 week open preorder closing December 15th, and shipping in the new year. You can find our big cartel store. Link in comments. – thank you.\" Admiral Angry has been sadly defunct ever since the death of guitarist and main songwriter Daniel Krauss in February 2009. Want More Metal?
