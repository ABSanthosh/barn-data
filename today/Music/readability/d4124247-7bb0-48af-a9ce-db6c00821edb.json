  "text": "Lil Durk has pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges related to an alleged murder-for-hire plot, Rolling Stone reports. He is tentatively due to stand trial, in California, on Tuesday, January 7, 2025. Durk, who is in federal custody, in Los Angeles, has also delayed the release of his new album, Deep Thoughts, which had been due to arrive this autumn.Durk was arrested last month and charged with conspiracy to use interstate facilities to commit murder-for-hire resulting in death. He’s also facing two additional weapons-related charges.Prosecutors allege that Lil Durk and five other men allegedly associated with the rapper’s Only the Family (OTF) collective sought to kill the rapper Quando Rondo as revenge for the murder of King Von. Durk, according to the federal government’s indictment, was the mastermind of the murder-for-hire plot and made clear that he would pay a bounty to have Quando Rondo killed. An attempt to shoot Quando Rondo resulted in the death of the Georgia rapper’s cousin Saviay’a Tilal “Lul Pab” Robinson, prosecutors say.",
