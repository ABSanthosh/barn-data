  "text": "Just a few weeks after Hurricane Helene tore through Florida, Hurricane Milton has followed a similar path of destruction by taking out MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre, an outdoor concert venue in Tampa. Located at the Florida State Fairgrounds, MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre doesn’t have any upcoming concert dates until 2025, so there is plenty of time for the venue to recover. According to the official calendar, the next show on the books is A Perfect Circle, Primus, and Puscifer’s “Sessanta V2.0” tour date on May 8th. Before Hurricane Milton made landfall on Wednesday (October 9th), clean-up crews had been using MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre as a makeshift landfill to collect debris from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Besides the concert venue, Milton has devastated the Tampa Bay area’s sports stadiums, tearing the roof off of Tropicana Field (home to the Rays baseball team) and flooding parts of Raymond James Stadium (home to the Buccaneers football team).",
