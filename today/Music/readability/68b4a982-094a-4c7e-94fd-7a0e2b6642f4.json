  "text": "Look, murder is bad, but you can’t deny (defend, depose) that the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has revealed some real anger with the American health apparatus, although the jokes have been (forgive me) hit or miss. But few have taken the joke as far as Tim Dillon, who appeared on the Netflix special “Torching 2024: A Roast of the Year” as the ghost of the slain exec. Dillon dressed in ghostly chains that might look familiar from A Christmas Carol, berating the crowd as “socialists” and tossing them free medicine he claimed was laced with fentanyl. “I’m going to hell for this, you might as well laugh,” he said. “Get Tim Dillon Tickets Here” pubref=”tim-dillon*roast-unitedhealth” link=”https://www.stubhub.com/tim-dillon-tickets/performer/100270258″%5D His clothes lightly bloodstained, Dillon proceeded to berate everyone who acted happy at his demise. “Your reaction to my murder makes me sick,” he continued, “and not the type of sick I would immediately deny for not having the proper paperwork.” Referencing alleged killer Luigi Mangioni, he added, “Look at yourselves: Dancing in the streets because that guy Tortellini Mozzarella took me by surprise like an unexpected medical bill and shot me in the back,” Dillon cracked. “Apparently he had his own back problems. I’m sorry Luigi but nobody feels bad for a thin guy with back problems. Claim denied!” Dillon wrapped up his roast with a promise to, “Deny, defend, decompose!” a twist on the words deny, defend, and depose, which Mangione allegedly wrote on three bullet casings. Check out clips from the roast below via the New York Post.",
