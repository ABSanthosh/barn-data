  "text": "Haley Joel Osment has been ordered to complete a court-approved diversion program following an April arrest for alleged public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance at a California ski resort, People reports. Under the terms set by the judge, the actor must obey all laws, attend at least three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings per week for six months, and meet with a therapist twice a week. If Osment successfully complies with the conditions of the program, the charges against him will be dismissed. His next court date is scheduled for January 2026. The Sixth Sense star, who will next appear in an upcoming episode of Poker Face as well as the second season of Wednesday, lost his home in the Eaton fire earlier this year.",
