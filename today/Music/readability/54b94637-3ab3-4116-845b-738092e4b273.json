  "text": "The band, led by brothers Adolfo and Gustavo Ángel, thrilled fans Friday at the first of their last two shows at the GNP Seguros Stadium in Mexico City. Gustavo Angel performs during the Los Temerarios show at the Estadio GNP Seguros on Dec. 20, 2024 in Mexico City. OCESA/Lulú Urdapilleta Español The romantic songs of Los Temerarios, those that captivated four generations in Mexico and the United States, were sung along by thousands Friday night (Dec. 20) at the GNP Seguros Stadium in Mexico City — in the first of the last two concerts of the band’s farewell tour, Hasta Siempre, with which they’ll close a story of almost half a century. “We have reached the end, the end of these 47 years! We will always carry you in our hearts. Thank you for what you made us live during all this time. It has been wonderful!” said an emotional Gustavo Ángel to the 65,000 people who packed the venue, according to figures from promoter Ocesa. It was a nostalgic and very special night for the group, led by brothers Adolfo and Gustavo Ángel, and their loyal fans, many of whom have been followers of their music from the old days, when they attended their concerts in popular venues in municipalities on the outskirts of the Mexican capital. Many others maintained their taste for the group’s music after having migrated to the U.S., and made their songbook part of their connection to Mexico. Trending on Billboard “We are going to sing those songs with which you fell in love, got married, had children and grandchildren,” the vocalist and guitarist told the audience after performing “Tu Infame Engaño,” one of their classics from the ’80s. “Our beloved audience, 47 years of being here and you experiencing it with all your heart. There is nothing we can say to reciprocate your affection,” added keyboardist Adolfo Ángel, prompting a thunderous applause. The audience, mostly made up of women between 30 and 60 years old, sang along at the top of their lungs to songs like “Vivo Enamorado de Ti,” which opened the show, followed by the aforementioned “Tu Infame Engaño,” “Una Tarde Fue,” “Como Te Tecuerdo,” “Como Quisiera Volver,” and “Ya Me Voy Para Siempre.” The extensive repertoire also included songs like “Ven Porque Te Necesito,” “Acepta Mi Error,” “Porque Te Conocí,” “Una Lágrima No Basta,” “Eres Un Sueño,” “La Mujer Que Soñé,” “Me Partiste el Corazón” and “Te Quiero.” The show lasted about three hours, during which Los Temerarios performed more than 30 songs — those that catapulted them as one of the most beloved and successful Hispanic bands of the past four decades, and with which they achieved feats like 41 entries on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and 47 entries on Top Latin Albums. “The emotions are at their peak. If you see teary eyes around, it’s pure gratitude,” said Adolfo Ángel, who recalled that “Tu Última Canción” was inspired by an ex-girlfriend whose relationship ended in a phone call. The Hasta Siempre Tour of Los Temerarios began in February 2023, and this year accounted for more than 30 shows in cities in Mexico, the U.S., and Central America, including Mexico City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, Monterrey, San José, Houston and Atlanta, among others. In the Mexican capital, before their last performances at the GNP Seguros Stadium, the group packed eight nights at the Arena Ciudad de Mexico since last February, gathering about 160,000 people in total, according to promoter Zignia Live. On Saturday (Dec. 21), Los Temerarios will repeat the feat for the last time at the GNP Seguros Stadium, lowering the curtain after 47 years.
