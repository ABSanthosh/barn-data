  "text": "The singer made her debut at the country music festival on April 25. Lana Del Rey performs in concert during Primavera Sound Festival on May 31, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain. Xavi Torrent/Redferns Lana Del Rey is kissing and telling in her new song “57.5.” During her debut at the 2025 Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indio, Calif., on Friday (April 25), the 39-year-old singer revealed in the song’s lyrics that she once locked lips with a major country star. “I kissed Morgan Wallen/ I guess kissing me kind of went to his head,” Del Rey sang. “If you want my secret to success/ I suggest don’t go ATVing with him when you’re out west.” The eyebrow-raising premiere of “57.5” came during the alt-pop star’s set on the Palomino stage at Stagecoach. According to the lyrics, the title nods to the singer’s monthly Spotify listenership, measured in millions. Just before premiering the track, Del Rey told festival-goers that it would be “the last time I’m ever going to say this line.” It remains unclear whether Del Rey and Wallen ever shared a kiss, or when it supposedly occurred. Billboard has reached out to Wallen’s representatives for comment. Trending on Billboard Elsewhere in “57.5,” Del Rey crooned about having “a man” who “really loves me,” a sentiment seemingly referring to her husband, Jeremy Dufrene, whom she married in September 2024. Dressed in a white gown and performing in front of a set designed to resemble a picturesque rural home at dusk, Del Rey’s Stagecoach set featured a duet with George Birge on his current hit “Cowboy Songs,” a cover of Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man,” and a singalong to John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” In addition to debuting “57.5,” she also performed several new tracks from her forthcoming country-leaning studio album, which has yet to be titled or assigned a release date. The new songs included “Ride,” “Husband of Mine” and “Henry, Come On.” (Read Billboard‘s best moment from day one of Stagecoach 2025 here.) The singer’s upcoming album will follow Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, which peaked at No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200 in April 2023. To date, Del Rey has earned two top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: 2013’s “Summertime Sadness” and her 2022 feature on Taylor Swift’s “Snow on the Beach.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
