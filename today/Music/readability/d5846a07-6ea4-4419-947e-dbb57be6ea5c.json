  "text": "J. Cole just dropped “Port Antonio” where he addresses his role in the Drake and Kendrick beef. Keep watching to see the breakdown of the song. Tetris Kelly: J. Cole dropped a new song on his Instagram titled “Port Antonio,” where he addresses the battle that broke off between the big three. Produced by DZL, Omen and Cole, the beat flips the same sample used on Jay-Z’s “Dead Presidents,” Lonnie Liston Smith’s “Garden of Peace” and features a live performance of the British singer Cleo Sol singing “Know That You Are Loved.” The first verse details his rise from the streets of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to rap superstar, but it’s the second verse that has everybody talking. Cole addresses the media and explains why he backed out of the battle between him, Drake, and Kendrick. He then tries to explain why he laid his sword down after releasing Kendrick diss track, “7 Minute Drill.” Finally, he closes the song out by trying to give Drake some words of encouragement.",
