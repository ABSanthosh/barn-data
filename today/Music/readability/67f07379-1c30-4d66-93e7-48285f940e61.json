  "text": "Mikey Madison brought some surreal energy to Saturday Night Live’s 50th season, teaming up with Please Don’t Destroy a for a dramatic television adaptation of SpongeBob SquarePants. Complete with references to the animated series, uncanny makeup, and a particularly stirring rendition of “F.U.N.,” Madison’s realized project was similar to a previous skit featuring Bad Bunny as Shrek. In the sketch, Madison dreamt up a live-action TV adaptation of the Nickelodeon show, insisting it was really about “a friend group navigating life in their early 20s.” The Please Don’t Destroy trio wasn’t entirely convinced—“[It’s about] a funny sponge,” Martin Herlihy deadpanned, while John Higgins and Ben Marshall looked on, visibly confused. A quick cut to the future revealed that, despite their doubts, the group spent three years developing the project. The skit concluded with a trailer for the HBO-style adaptation, Treading Water, starring Madison (as Skidward) and the PDD trio as the residents of Bikini Bottom. In this version, SpongeBob and Squidward were romantically involved, Mr. Krabs discovered that his daughter Pearl was pregnant, and Patrick was dealing with mysterious health issues. Last night’s episode of SNL also featured country artist Morgan Wallen as the musical guest. During the final bow, Wallen walked off the Studio 8H stage without acknowledging any of the cast members.",
