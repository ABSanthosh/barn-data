  "text": "In September 2014, lead vocalist Mark Hunter announced that Chimaira were done. But, that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. Originally heartbreaking to some, the band seemingly had a good run. In 15 years, Chimaira put out seven LPs and two EPs. That's a lot of work – it seems fair that the band had decided to be done with it. Well, be done with it in the studio, at least. Chimaira haven't released a record since 2013, but have definitely taken part in their fair few reunion tours and shows. Their first? In 2017. Their second? Supposed to be 2020 – but, we all know what happened in 2020. Their second (technically, third)? In 2023 and 2024. And in 2024, Chimaira dusted off their festival shoes for the first time in over a decade at Inkcarceration Festival. This year, they're on the lineup for Aftershock, Louder Than Life, Welcome To Rockville, and most recently, Milwaukee Metalfest. And, at this glorious Milwaukee Metalfest this past Friday (16th May), Chimaira played two tracks that haven't been heard in decades – \"Lumps,\" from their debut LP, and \"Divination\" from their debut EP. 25 years since \"Divination\" had seen the light of day, and 20 years since \"Lumps\" did the same, the band have been revelling in their legacy throughout festival season. Chimaira also just started their own record label, White Cobra Records, and rereleased the 2005 self-titled record in which \"Lumps\" comes from. There is no new music as of yet, but guitarist Rob Arnold has gone on record stating that Chimaira had been working on new music and reunion shows leading up to the pandemic, but those plans were put on hold. Time will tell what they do with their new record label. Chimaira have three more live dates announced for this year – one tonight – and all three are sets at festivals. You can check that schedule below. May 18th – Daytona Beach, FL @ Welcome To RockvilleSeptember 20th – Louisville, KY @ Louder Than Life FestivalOctober 5th – Sacramento, CA @ Aftershock Festival Want More Metal?
