  "text": "Billy McFarland has revealed new details about Fyre Fest 2, including a new date and location. Originally announced as taking place April 25th through 28th, Fyre Festival 2 is now going down from May 30th to June 2nd. In a new interview with TODAY, the convicted fraudster explained, “We just needed the extra month to give our partners time to get everything ready.” The festival will take place on Isla Mujeres in Quintana Roo, Mexico. MacFarland isn’t ready to reveal any of the acts he’s supposedly booked to play. However, “We’re going to have artists across electronic, hip hop, pop, and rock,” he told TODAY. “It’s not just music,” he added. “We might have a professional skateboarder do a demonstration. We might have an MMA champion teach you techniques in the morning.” Tickets are now on sale through the festival’s website, with options ranging from $1,400 for the “Ignite” general access pass to $25,000 for the “Phoenix” artist access tier. For those looking to truly set their money on fire, there’s a $1.1 million “Prometheus” package for eight people. “You will be on a boat, have the luxury yachts that we partner with who will be docked and parked outside the island,” McFarland said about the latter package. “But once again, Fyre is not just about this, like, luxury experience. It’s about the adventure. So you’ll be scuba diving with me.” In 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of wire fraud in connection to the original Fyre Fest. After serving four years of the sentence, he was released early in May 2022. This time around, McFarland has apparently removed himself from the logistical process, having teamed up with Mexican concert production company LostNights. He’s also partnered with secondary ticket reseller soldout.com, which promises a 100% refund on tickets if Fyre Fest 2 is canceled.",
