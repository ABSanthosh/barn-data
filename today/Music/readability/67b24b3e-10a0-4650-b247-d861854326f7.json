  "text": "Grammy-nominated metal titans Lamb of God has just surprise-released the official studio version of their cover of Black Sabbath’s classic \"Children of the Grave\". The track is now available on all major digital streaming platforms here alongside footage of the band performing the same song live below. The Richmond, Virginia-based heavyweights debuted the song live for the first time on Saturday, July 5, during their set at \"Back To The Beginning\" – the epic, all-star farewell concert for Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath held at Villa Park in Birmingham, UK. The monumental event featured performances by Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Tool, Mastodon, and more, culminating in a final bow from Ozzy and the original Black Sabbath lineup. \"Lamb of God being invited to perform with Black Sabbath at their final show is one of the greatest honors of our career,\" said guitarist Mark Morton. \"As an offering to the celebration, we’ve recorded our take on their classic ‘Children of the Grave’, a protest song with lyrics that are as relevant today as they were in 1971 when the original was released.\" Morton continued: \"Black Sabbath invented heavy metal and in doing so, they changed the world. This genre that they created brings immeasurable joy to fans all over the world. We are so grateful to have the heavy metal community to call our home, and so grateful to Black Sabbath for the gift of their music that they’ve given to all of us.\" The release of \"Children of the Grave\" arrives as Lamb of God finalizes work on their upcoming tenth studio album, the follow-up to 2022’s critically acclaimed Omens.
