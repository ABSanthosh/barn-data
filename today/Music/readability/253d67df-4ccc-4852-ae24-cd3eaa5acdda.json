Let us know in the comments! Tetris Kelly: I mean, hanging out with Stacey, you’re a legend. You’ve been with this thing since the beginning. So how is it to like come here, have these amazing artists join you and support you? Stacy Vee: I mean, it’s pretty amazing to see this collection of personalities, talent partners, bookers, we all come together with a common goal of pushing the genre forward and having a bunch of fun in the process.  Tetris Kelly: I mean, and Guy, how has it been to work with Stacey over all these years?  Guy Fieri: Well, she is the queen, the godmother, she’s the one that curates this. I know everybody loves to come to Stagecoach, but all of our careers have been impacted by her vision and awareness of what’s going on in the world, in the world of music, the world of food, the world of, you know, a party and Stagecoach is Stagecoach because of Stacy Vee.  Tetris Kelly: I mean, you’re rolling up to Stagecoach, man, this is three weekends for you. I’ve been laughing about you and T-Pain. Coachella, Coachella, Stagecoach. How’s it to be here tonight? Shaboozey: It’s amazing, man, to be over here with my brother. Man, we just put out a song and and, you know, I’m just really humbled and grateful to be here.  Keep watching for more!",
