  "text": "Youth Lagoon’s Trevor Powers has shared a new song. “My Beautiful Girl,” co-produced with Rodaidh McDonald, arrives with a video directed by Regrets Only that focuses on a woman sitting in front of a birthday cake. Check it out below.Speaking about the new song’s origins, Powers explained, “There’s a near-ghost town in western Idaho called Idaho City—about 30 minutes from home. I go there often to swim in the river, pray, and be alone in the country. Last time I went, I hiked through the cemetery (known as ‘Boothill’ cuz of all the miners that died with their boots on) and saw a gravestone in darkness and dry weeds that said only, ‘My Beautiful Girl.’ No name. No dates. Just love. Who was this beautiful girl? The portal opened, and I wrote down the message.”“My Beautiful Girl” is the third Youth Lagoon single this year. It follows “Football” and “Lucy Takes a Picture,” both of which were also co-produced by McDonald. The latest Youth Lagoon album, Heaven Is a Junkyard, arrived in 2023 after an eight-year hiatus.",
