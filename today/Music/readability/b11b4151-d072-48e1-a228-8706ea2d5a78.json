  "text": "Last week, it was announced that Kehlani’s invitation to perform at Slope Day—Cornell University’s annual spring concert to celebrate the final days of undergraduate classes—had been rescinded due to her opposition of Israel’s war in Gaza. Now, the singer has responded. “I am not antisemitic, nor anti-Jew. I am anti-genocide,” Kehlani said in an Instagram video posted Saturday, April 26. She continues:I am anti the actions of the Israeli government, I am anti an extermination of an entire people, I am anti the bombing of innocent children, men, women—that’s what I’m anti.In fact, the very first [Instagram] Live that I did in the beginning of this genocide was with a really beautiful Jewish organization called Jewish Voices for Peace, and I still continue to learn from and work alongside really impactful Jewish organizers against this genocide.I want to be very clear in stating that I do believe God has plans for me and that’s not gonna stop nothing that I have going on, but I’m asked to clarify because this keeps coming up as a means to silence me, as a means to stop things that happen in my career, as a means to change the course of my life, and I just don’t believe that.In his original email to students announcing Kehlani’s removal from the lineup, university president Michael I. Kotlikoff wrote “Slope Day is a cherished tradition at Cornell—a time for our community to come together to celebrate the end of classes. For decades, student leaders have taken the helm in organizing this event, hiring performers they hope will appeal to the student body.”“Unfortunately, although it was not the intention, the selection of Kehlani as this year’s headliner has injected division and discord into Slope Day,” he continued. “For that reason, I am rescinding Kehlani’s invitation and expect a new lineup for a great 2025 Slope Day to be announced shortly.”Explaining his decision to remove Kehlani from Slope Day, Kotlikoff said: “In the days since Kehlani was announced, I have heard grave concerns from our community that many are angry, hurt, and confused that Slope Day would feature a performer who has espoused antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media. While any artist has the right in our country to express hateful views, Slope Day is about uniting our community, not dividing it.”Kehlani has long opposed Israel’s war in Gaza and shown support for Palestinians. Israel’s war in the territory escalated after the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 Israelis. A ceasefire took hold in January 2025, but ended in March, as Israel accused Hamas of violating terms of the agreement. According to recent numbers from Gaza’s Health Ministry, Israel’s offensive has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians.According to The Cornell Sun, students from Cornellians for Israel launched a petition against the selection of Kehlani not long after she was announced for Slope Day. The group took issue with some of her social media posts and cited the singer’s “Next 2 U” music video, which opened with the message “Long Live the Intifada.” The term “intifada,” an Arabic word for a rebellion or uprising, is used by pro-Palestinian demonstrators to signal support for the region’s liberation from oppression. It has also been used to describe periods of violent protests by Palestinians against Israelis.Cornell’s decision to remove Kehlani from its spring concert arrives as President Donald J. Trump and his administration crack down against free speech on college campuses. The administration has particularly targeted schools that have dealt with student protests against Israel and the war in Gaza. Cornell, for example, recently, had more than $1 billion frozen by the Trump administration as the government investigates allegations of antisemitism on campus.",
