  "text": "Julian McMahon, the actor best known for his leading roles on Nip/Tuck and Charmed, has died at the age of 56 following a battle with cancer. The Australian native also played Dr. Doom in 2005’s Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. “With an open heart, I wish to share with the world that my beloved husband, Julian McMahon, died peacefully this week after a valiant effort to overcome cancer,” McMahon’s wife, Kelly McMahon, said in a statement on Friday. “Julian loved life. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his work, and he loved his fans. His deepest wish was to bring joy into as many lives as possible. We ask for support during this time to allow our family to grieve in privacy. And we wish for all of those to whom Julian brought joy, to continue to find joy in life. We are grateful for the memories.”",
