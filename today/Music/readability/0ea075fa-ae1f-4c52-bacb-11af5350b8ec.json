  "text": "Sacred Bones Records has announced a new collection of music by the late cult artist Q Lazzarus. Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus (Music From the Motion Picture) is a 21-song compilation featuring a trove of unreleased tracks, all recorded between 1985 and 1995. The songs were retrieved from Q Lazzarus’ archive of digital tapes and cassettes, and will now be released as a 10-track vinyl album, with additional cuts on the digital and CD editions. Check out the tracklist below, along with a new-wave version of Q Lazzarus’ biggest hit, “Goodbye Horses.”Q Lazzarus died, in 2022, following a short illness; she was 61. The singer had been working with filmmaker and friend Aridjis Fuentes on a documentary, also titled Goodbye Horses: The Many Lives of Q Lazzarus, and the new collection of music is being released in conjunction with that project.“Goodbye Horses” appeared in two Jonathan Demme films: 1988’s Married to the Mob, and, more famously, 1991’s The Silence of the Lamb’s, where it scored a memorable scene featuring the film’s principal villain, Buffalo Bill. Q Lazzarus met Demme by chance when she was driving a cab in the 1980s. She met Aridjis in a similar fashion, when she was serving as her New York driver in 2019.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
