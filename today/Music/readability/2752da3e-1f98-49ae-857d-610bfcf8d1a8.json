Get Coldplay Tickets Here Get your seat here, and read on for more info — including how to get ensure accesses to what is already one of the biggest tours in music history. What Is Coldplay’s 2025 North American Tour? Coldplay’s “Music of the Spheres World Tour” has been running since the release of their 2021 album, Music of the Spheres. They’ve continuously extended the tour with multiple legs over the last few years, making the 2025 run their fourth stint in the US since 2021. As such, the band are hitting several cities that they’ve missed in previous North American runs, like Toronto, Denver, Las Vegas, and more. The North American tour begins with a show at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California on May 31st, 2025. The run continues with shows in Las Vegas, Denver, El Paso, Toronto (marking some of the first-ever concerts at the brand new Rogers Stadium), Foxborough, Madison, and Nashville, concluding with a July 26th show in Miami. Coldplay aren’t just touring this continent next year — they have a slew of international tour dates planned for 2025, including shows in United Arab Emirates, India, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Coldplay will also play 10 shows at London’s Wembley Stadium throughout August and September. Meanwhile, the band is closing out their 2024 run with a handful of shows in Australia and New Zealand. See below for the full list of Coldplay’s 2024-2025 tour dates. “Music of the Spheres World Tour” recently became the first rock tour — and second tour ever (behind Taylor Swift’s “The Eras Tour”) — to gross over $1 billion dollars.
