Jimin and Jung Kook of BTS appear in Yeoncheon, South Korea, after being discharged from mandatory military service on June 11, 2025. Billboard Korea YEONCHEON, South Korea — Jimin and Jung Kook of BTS were officially discharged from South Korea’s mandatory military service on Wednesday (June 11), marking a major step forward in the group’s long-awaited reunion. With their discharge, six of the seven BTS members have now completed their service obligations, with only SUGA currently fulfilling his alternative service as a social worker. His discharge is expected later this month. On Tuesday morning, fans and media began gathering near Yeoncheon Public Stadium in Gyeonggi Province to welcome the two stars. Jimin and Jung Kook appeared with bright smiles, offering brief greetings and expressing their sincere gratitude to supporters who had waited for their return. Trending on Billboard “Thank you to the fans and reporters who came to see us,” Jimin said. “It’s been a long time, from the pandemic to military service. Now that we’re back, we’ll work hard to show you what we’ve prepared.” “There were a lot of unforgettable moments,” Jung Kook added. “Thanks to everyone who served with us and supported us along the way.” Jimin also hinted at what’s to come: “Now that I’m discharged, I think it’s time we continue drawing the picture we had in mind. We’ll prepare well and share it with you soon.” He concluded: “Military life wasn’t easy, but I’m grateful for the memories. If you see a soldier on the street, a warm gesture can mean a lot.” Jimin and Jung Kook of BTS appear in Yeoncheon, South Korea, after being discharged from mandatory military service on June 11, 2025.
