Justin Bieber attends the Arsenal and Manchester United pre-season friendly soccer match at SoFi Stadium on July 27, 2024 in Inglewood, California. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Justin Bieber is giving fans a behind-the-scenes look at the making of his upcoming album. On Saturday (March 22), the 31-year-old pop star shared a video on Instagram of himself jamming with fellow musicians in a spacious room filled with music equipment and a pool table, all while overlooking stunning outdoor views. “I think I hate myself sometimes when I feel myself start to become inauthentic,” Bieber captioned the nearly three-minute clip. “Then I remember we’re all being made to think we’re not enough but I still hate when I change myself to please people.” In the video, Bieber sports a yellow beanie while immersing himself in a trippy, experimental jam session with an eclectic mix of mind-bending electronic sounds. The “Sorry” singer tagged several other musicians and friends in his Instagram Stories, including singer-songwriter Jensen McRae, pastor Judah Smith, Josh Mehl, DJ Taylor James, producer Camper, and others. Bieber’s post also drew a supportive comment from frequent Prince collaborator Sheila E. “DONT EVER SAY U HATE URSELF!!!!!!!!!!! call auntie Sheila. Let’s talk,” the Grammy-winning drummer wrote. Trending on Billboard Earlier that day, the “Peaches” hitmaker shared another reflective post on Instagram, writing, “I got anger issues too, but I wanna grow and not react so much smh.” The message included three photos: a close-up selfie of him in a hoodie, an image from his childhood, and a photo of what appears to be his baby son, Jack Blues, lying on a blanket in front of a large screen. On March 16, the singer opened up on Instagram Stories about his journey toward letting go of hate. In an all-caps message, he wrote, “I WAS ALWAYS TOLD WHEN I WAS A KID NOT TO HATE … BUT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WASNT ALLOWED TO HAVE IT AND SO I DIDN’T TELL ANYONE IVE HAD IT.” The Grammy winner’s recent social media posts followed another vulnerable message on March 13, where he admitted to feeling “unequipped and unqualified most days.” In recent weeks, Bieber has been candid with fans about the need to “grow up,” revealing in February that he was working on “letting go and remembering the weight isnt on me to change.” Bieber hasn’t released an album since 2021’s Justice, which spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. This year, the star has teased new music, sharing occasional studio photos on Instagram. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
