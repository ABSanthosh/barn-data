  "text": "The reunited Snot – currently guitarists Mikey Doling and Sonny Mayo, bassist John \"Tumor\" Fahnestock, drummer Jamie Miller, and a mystery vocalist – is set to take the stage for the first time on January 17 at the House Of Blues Anaheim in Anaheim, CA. While Snot is purposefully keeping the identity of their new vocalist a secret until then, you can hear the mystery man in action below. Whoever they are is sounds pretty damn good (for at least those few seconds), so this is certainly exciting!
