Camila Cabello attends the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, Calif. Amy Sussman/Getty Images Camila Cabello is loving the new Wicked movie. On Saturday (Nov. 30), the 27-year-old pop star took to social media to share her excitement about the live-action adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical, starring Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda. “You were brilliant,” Cabello captioned a black-and-white video of herself on her Instagram Story, tagging Erivo and Grande. “Can’t stop listening and singing.” The post also featured a pink and green heart emoji, symbolizing Grande’s fairytale-like pink dress and Erivo’s iconic green-skinned character. Along with her congratulations, Cabello included a short clip of herself belting out the musical’s iconic hit “Defying Gravity,” which appears on the film’s soundtrack that debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Trending on Billboard Cabello is no stranger to musical movies. In 2021, the “Havana” hitmaker starred as Cinderella in Amazon’s modern musical adaptation of the classic fairytale, offering a fresh twist on the story that Disney turned into a beloved animated film in 1950. Meanwhile, Wicked dominated the pre-Thanksgiving weekend box office, debuting at No. 1 with a global total of $164.2 million. Since its release on Nov. 22, the Jon M. Chu-directed film has earned widespread praise, especially for the performances of its lead actresses in these iconic roles. The second part of the Wicked adaptation is set to hit theaters in November 2025. For fans eager to sing along like Cabello, a special sing-along version of Wicked will be hitting theaters on Christmas Day. The screenings are expected to play at approximately 1,000 theaters across North America, according to Variety. Exact locations and showtimes are still to be confirmed.
