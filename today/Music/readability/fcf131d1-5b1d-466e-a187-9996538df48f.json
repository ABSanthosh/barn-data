  "text": "\"It really changed my perspective on so many things that I want to carry into my own career,\" he said of Swift's Eras Tour. Benson Boone at Clive Davis’ and the Recording Academy’s Pre-Grammy Gala at The Beverly Hilton on Feb. 1, 2025, in Los Angeles. Gilbert Flores It’s been almost a year since Benson Boone opened for Taylor Swift at London’s Wembley Stadium during her record-breaking Eras Tour, and while he’s a big fan now, that wasn’t always the case. Explore See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news The 22-year-old singer sat down with Rolling Stone for a new interview published this week, in which he recalls the moment he was told about opening for Swift. “I didn’t even know much about her,” Boone told the publication. “Her team reached out, and I literally, like, s— my pants. I could not believe it. It was insane, so I started listening to more of her music. I didn’t want to go to that show and not know anything.” He’s since grown into a fan. “She is an unbelievable performer and has an unbe­lievable world built around her that is unmatched,” he explained. “It is incredible to see how vastly gigantic her show is, just countless moving parts behind the scenes that nobody knows about. She is one of a kind. Such a genuine person. I got the privilege to talk to her, for a while, and she’s so kind.” Trending on Billboard Boone continued, “And she shouted me out onstage, which you do not need to do. It really changed my perspective on so many things that I want to carry into my own career. Just the way I treat people and my crew, watching the way that she treats people. There’s a lot of people who don’t like Taylor Swift. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but if you have something against her and you don’t know her, I don’t think that is fair.”  2024 was a breakthrough year for Boone beyond his gig at the Eras Tour, thanks to the release of his Billboard Hot 100 No. 2 hit, “Beautiful Things.” He performed the track at the 2025 Grammy Awards, where he was nominated for best new artist.
