However, the experience can have the opposite effect for the DJs who bring us together.As a psychologist who coaches DJs, I've seen how isolation impacts artists beyond what fans see. They constantly juggle creative demands, business pressures and expectations without the support system many professionals take for granted.Before working closely with DJs, I didn't fully grasp their lifestyle's physical and emotional intensity. But I now see how deep the struggles run, from the small stage to the main stage. DJs need support, clarity and guidance to navigate the highs and lows while building a sustainable and fulfilling career.Fans experience the art—the energy of the DJ's performance and the music they produce—but they don't see the hidden side: the loneliness, the stress and the intense pressure DJs experience behind the scenes. The very stages that unite us can isolate them and amplify loneliness, which causes an increased risk of anxiety, depression and physical health issues if not addressed.Constant screen time and political divides contribute to a growing sense of isolation for both fans and artists. EDM events provide fans with community, but touring DJs often experience grueling travel, separation from loved ones and the pressure to consistently perform. The festival experience allows fans to recharge. However, many artists leave feeling drained and isolated as they rush to their next show.Touring schedules can be brutal. Some DJs play around 300 shows each year, often with limited support and schedules that don't include much time for wellness.

The recent release of the intimate Netflix documentary I'm Tim, which chronicles Avicii's life and career, has reignited the mental health conversation, but more needs to be done. If we want our favorite artists to thrive, we need to rethink how the EDM industry supports its talent.Some artists, labels, fans and festival organizers are beginning to recognize and address the challenges of artist loneliness, but we need more widespread action.
