  "text": "On April 2, NAQT VANE released their new concept EP, NV. This is NAQT VANE’s first concept EP with its new lineup after welcoming Yunoa. The EP has a total of seven songs, including solo songs “C” and “O” by Yunoa and Harukaze and an “NV Series” of reinterpreted NAQT VANE songs. What kind of spirit and message have they poured into the “NV” concept EP? Billboard Japan talked at length with the two, hot off their nationwide tour, about this and about their thoughts on the tour. Explore Explore Billboard See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news You just finished your first nationwide tour as a team of two vocalists, performing eight shows in four cities. What did you think of it? Harukaze: At first, I thought that it would feel like long, but once we actually started performing, it was over in the blink of an eye. We had a blast performing, and I still feel a little wistful that we’ve already finished all eight shows. Trending on Billboard Yunoa: It went by so fast. It was my first time performing in a solo show from the very start, and my first time touring. So I was really nervous going in, but once we started, I had so much fun. I still can’t believe it’s over, and I’m looking forward to going out on tour again. On the tour, you represented yourselves as the “sun and moon,” and you had different set lists for your daytime and nighttime shows. How do you feel about that contrast of your individual characters as sun and moon? Harukaze: During this one meeting we had about the tour, the conversation turned to how to showcase the “pair” aspect of NAQT VANE, now that we have twin vocalists. We wrote down keywords that represented our own individuality and unique characters. One of the things that came up was this concept of “sun and moon,” and we thought that conveyed the concept the clearest. They stand in contrast with each other, but both are essential, and when you have the two of them together, something magical happens. They’re like us in all kinds of ways. It’s been 10 months since you formed this new lineup, which features your contrasting characters, and now you’ve finished a tour. Have there been any changes during this time? Harukaze: When we changed to a twin vocal lineup, I knew from the start that it would open up a new path before us. Now, after finishing the tour, we’ve become absolutely essential to each other. We each produced our sun and moon shows, and in both shows, there were parts where we were able to shine because of each other’s presence. Yunoa: For me, the tour impressed on me again just how fun it is to sing with Harukaze. Also, I didn’t know that I could spend so much time with someone else while always being comfortable staying true to myself. It was such a fun experience. I discovered something new about myself, that I didn’t have any problem being with others. Now I want to always stay close to these people I love so much. Now you’ve released the “NV” concept EP, which includes “C” and “O,” solo songs that Hiroyuki wrote for the tour. I’d like to start out by asking about these solo songs. Yunoa, how did you feel when you first heard the music Hiroyuki wrote for “C?” Yunoa: Usually, when I’m working solo as Yunoa, I write my own lyrics, but with “C,” I thought about my own traits and features, wrote them down, and had the lyrics written based on them. There were several parts where the lyrics I received perfectly conveyed what I was thinking. I didn’t feel over-pressured by “C.” What did you think of the title? Yunoa: It’s the shape of a crescent moon. I really liked the simplicity of that. Right. So the same is true for “O?” Harukaze: It’s the shape of the sun. It forms a set with “C.” When I got the lyrics, I also felt like it had really captured the message that I was trying to convey. My life motto is “I want people to smile,” and that was reflected in the line “Give me a smile.” I didn’t get any instructions to sing in a certain key or in a certain way, but the song has a lot of technical parts which Hiroyuki has complimented me on in past recordings. There are two NAQT VANE anthems, “Beautiful Mess” and “VANE,” and it’s really easy to picture singing them along with audiences. You use a lot of different vocal tones in your singing, don’t you? Harukaze: I’d talked to Hiroyuki in the past about how whenever I go in to record vocals, I want to take on new challenges. On NAQT songs, I added twists at the end, or I envisioned different peoples’ vocal tones when I recorded the chorus. I’d think about trying to be a specific type of singer, or I’d try singing in a super low, older man’s voice. I tried out all kinds of different voices, like 15 different people. They’re all in there, and that whole process of including those playful elements in the recording process was a new challenge for me. You also recorded newly reimagined NV versions of songs from your first album, this time with twin vocals. What song made a particular impact on you? Yunoa: “Ditty – NV.” There’s a rap part in it that just slaps. It just busts out right from the start. It’s so fast, I can’t even mentally keep up with what I’m saying. You’ve got to hear it. Harukaze: But you sound like you’re having so much fun in that part. You’re really vibing!  It comes across so clearly. Part of it might be because the song itself is so fun. Yunoa: It’s probably the most danceable song. Harukaze: And it has a sense of playfulness. It’s so fast, and your rap part gets me fired up, too. I was surprised to see how much a song could change. The original was already playful, but having two people sing it instead of one makes it so much more exciting. How did you feel after getting all seven songs ready for the release? Yunoa: Really happy. I’ve been a member of NAQT VANE for less than a year, so it’s tremendously exciting to see my own name on a CD for the first time. Our new twin vocal lineup is used to its fullest, and we each have our own solo songs, so the EP highlights the qualities of both approaches. When I saw the samples of the finished EP, I was really impressed. The jackets are all unique variants, each with its own pattern, and each comes with a puzzle piece. The contents of the EP are so cute. There are so many special things about the CD, and more than anything I feel happy and a bit awed that so much is being done on my first ever CD. Harukaze: I think the new EP packs in the true essence of NAQT VANE. This may be how some people discover us. We want to show our new lineup, and I hope that the EP is a breath of fresh air for everyone preparing for a new beginning [this spring]. The “NV” means both “NAQT VANE” and “New Version,” but it has another meaning, too: “Newborn Vibes.” Vibes are a really important part of the project, so we want to share these new vibes with all our VANEs. What kind of “New Versions” do you see for the future? Yunoa: We want to get bigger and bigger. We want more people to discover NAQT VANE. Everyone says we’re at our best in our live shows, so I want everyone to come see us perform live. We want to play in even bigger venues, filling domes. Harukaze: We want to play at huge venues, and we also want to perform around the world. Our overseas fans send us messages asking when we’ll perform in their countries, so I hope we can really extend our overseas reach and perform in different countries, bringing out each of our own best qualities. Do you have any closing message for your overseas listeners? Yunoa: I think there are a lot of people in countries like the U.S. who share the same vibes as us. I’m sure they’d love us if they heard us, so please give us a listen. Then come to our show and go crazy on the dance floor. Harukaze: When I was in high school, I spent three and a half years living in Vancouver, Canada, and then I went to university for four years in L.A. My dream is to return to Canada and America to put on shows. When I go back, I want to give back to all my old friends and all the people who’ve supported me. We’re going to be communicating more with our overseas listeners, so I hope everyone checks out what we have to say! —This interview by Atsuo Nagahori first appeared on Billboard Japan",
