  "text": "Dan Aykroyd was one of the SNL legends conspicuously absent from the show’s 50th anniversary celebration earlier this year. In a new interview with Entertainment Weekly, the OG cast member offered a refreshingly practical reason for his absence: he just wanted to watch the show at home on TV. “I wanted to be at home and I wanted to watch the show [from] beginning to end,” Aykroyd explained. “I knew if I was there, I’d be in a dressing room, I’d be working.” “I wanted to see it live,” he added. “I’m a fan of the show today, and I watch it all the time. I love these new players; I think they’re just great. I just wanted to see and live nostalgically with my family in my own home, eating my own popcorn.”",
