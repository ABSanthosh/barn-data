  "text": "HBO is gearing up to release a new documentary as part of its Music Box film series. The cheekily titled Yacht Rock: A Dockumentary is out November 29. It chronicles the rise of soft-rock in the 1970s and its unlikely reevaluation over the past decade, with additional profiles of key artists from the genre, such as Michael McDonald, Steely Dan, Kenny Loggins, Toto, and Christopher Cross. Watch the trailer for it below.Yacht Rock: A Dockumentary was directed by Garret Price, who also helmed Woodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage, Daisy Jones \u0026 the Six, and Love, Antosha. It’s produced by Garret, Adam Gibbs, and Madison Cross, and executive-produced by Jody Gerson, Marc Cimino, and Bill Simmons. Also co-executive-producing are Geoff Chow and Sean Fennessey.In addition to the aforementioned bands and musicians starring in the documentary, it also features interviews with De La Soul’s Prince Paul, Paramore and Vampire Weekend touring guitarist Brian Robert Jones, Thundercat, Questlove, Mac DeMarco, and Fred Armisen, among other music producers, journalists, and critics.See where the yacht-rock classics land on Pitchfork’s list “The 200 Best Songs of the 1970s.”",
