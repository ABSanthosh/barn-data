  "text": "Pamela Anderson says that she was once assaulted on a plane after being mistakenly confused for a member of The Chicks. The Golden Globe-nominated actress and star of The Last Showgirl recalled the incident during an appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast on Monday. “This one time, I was on a flight and this guy came up to me and said, ‘Do you know what this country’s done for you?’” Anderson recounted. “And I was like, ‘Oh, my God. What have I done?’” Anderson said that the man continued to snarl and stare at her throughout the flight. He eventually attempted to physically attack her and had to be restrained by a flight attendant. He “thought I was a Dixie Chick,” Anderson continued. “Remember that whole Dixie Chick thing? I almost got killed on a plane.” The Chicks, formerly known as the Dixie Chicks, famously faced intense criticism from conservatives in 2003 after lead singer Natalie Maines publicly condemned President George W. Bush for the United States’ invasion of Iraq. Anderson, who did not specify when the incident occurred, admitted that she “was scared to fly after that, a little bit.”",
