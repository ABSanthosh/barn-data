  "text": "Consequence’s Songs of the Week is a weekly column that looks at quality new tunes from the last week and analyzes notable releases. Find our new favorites and more on our Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, check out our New Sounds playlist. This week, Jack White rocks out with an electric new track. Earlier this year, Jack White surprised-released No Name, a record our own Wren Graves called the artist’s “most enjoyable solo album since Blunderbuss.” Now, just a few months later and with a couple of club shows underneath his belt, White is back with a riff-heavy B-side, “You Got Me Searching.” Get Jack White Tickets Here Like the most bangin’ tunes from No Name, “You Got Me Searching” wastes no time launching into its blues-rock party, kicking off with a very White-ian riff before transitioning into lurching guitar chugs and wonderfully simple, propulsive drums (I feel like we’ve heard that dynamic before, but megbe I’m wrong…). The pendulum between these two modes swings back and forth while White details his search for… something. Perhaps it’s because the wound is still fresh, or maybe it’s because the songwriter has publicly trashed America’s newest President-Elect, but it’s hard not to read into the potential political themes hiding between the lines. With references to going high when others go low, needing to help yourself, and even a verse that seemingly tackles populism, there’s certainly enough to chew on whether White intended that to be the case or not. Either way, the tune is vague enough to remain a banger uninhibited by potentially polarizing messaging. Crank that shit and start searching, we promise it’ll be a good time. — Jonah Krueger Editorial Coordinator Staff Picks: Best Songs of the Week November 9th – November 15th Clipping. — “Keep Pushing” For as industrial and noisy as Clipping. is known to be, their newest track “Keep Pushing” is remarkably accessible. Compared to past cuts, which might have built its respective beat off of a screeching alarm clock or walls of harsh noise, “Keep Pushing” is downright club-ready with its bouncy synth line and sung hook. The trio never fails to surprise. — J. Krueger FKA twigs — “Drums of Death” “Drums of Death” offers a literal interpretation of its title as the pervasive, unsettling drums lure you into a suspenseful build-up that brims with futuristic digital manipulations. twigs’ hauntingly ethereal vocals pair seamlessly with the darkly sensual backdrop that precedes her. Am I entering a ritual in the depths of digital hell? If twigs is leading, I’ll follow. — Nicolle Periola Flo — “Soft” British R\u0026B-pop queens FLO have touched down with a new full-length album, Access All Areas, that shows off the impeccable harmonies and addictive rhythms the trio has to offer. Each song flows so smoothly into the next that it’s immensely difficult to identify a standout, but “Soft,” the romantic, sensual offering towards the first third of the LP, has to at least be in the conversation. These girls have the it factor, and this album is a playground for them to prove it over and over again. — M. Siroky Hope Tala — “Survival” Wrapped in Hope Tala’s smooth voice and effortlessly catchy melodies, contemplation and introspection have never felt quite so engaging. “What do I know of survival?” she asks, thinking about the generations that preceded her and the difficulties her ancestors faced. “I wanted to say something definitive about resilience,” the singer-songwriter revealed in a statement. “But while sitting with myself and the concept, I found that I couldn’t do that with any real authority. I kept thinking about my own privilege and about how much worse my circumstances could be. I realized eventually that the song couldn’t be linear.” — M. Siroky Huxlii — “so this is it” The new single from Huxlii’s upcoming EP Odd and Ends, But Mostly Ends, the artists’ first EP with Majesticsilk Records and her first using a full-blown recording studio, recontextualizes Huxlii with newfound polish. While “so this is it” is certainly more manicured, the song still has the bold authenticity that makes Huxlii’s work special. — Rachel Rosenfield Kathryn Mohr — “Driven” Slowcore experimentalist Kathryn Mohr has announced her new album — Waiting Room, out January 24th via The Flenser — and shared its lead single “Driven,” a fittingly melancholic, spacey preview. Overtop the reverbed, reversed soundscape, Mohr delicately sings, with her voice delaying back and forth until it ultimately gets swallowed into the abyss. Listening to it, you feel as if you might fall into the abyss yourself. — J. Krueger Matt Champion feat. Deb Never — “Ash” It sounds like it’s gonna be a cold, lonely winter for Matt Champion and Deb Never as they explore the emotional highs and lows of a fading relationship. The lush, tender vocal delivery of the duet flows harmoniously with the production’s melancholic textures. “Ash” offers a somber conclusion to Champion’s 4-track Slint’s Favorite EP. — N. Periola Nao — “Elevate” Nao finds otherworldly transcendence as she reflects on the all-consuming feelings of falling in love. The second track in her untitled album rollout evokes the spirit of Saturn (2016) but feels more polished and refined — a reflection of her deeper understanding of herself, her emotions, and the world she inhabits. — N. Periola Sasami — “Just Be Friends” Between “Honeycrash” and “Slugger,” Sasami has already built  excitement for her upcoming album Blood on the Silver Screen. Now, she has a new single out that demonstrates what the album may be capable of. “Just Be Friends” boasts passionate lyrics that capture the intensity of romance and a poppy melody that is both soft and catchy. There is some innocence to the sound of this song, but the overall product shows Sasami’s maturity as an artist. — R. Rosenfield Yola — “Symphony” Powerhouse vocalist Yola knows that she deserves the best, and that energy is contagious on her new single, “Symphony.” There’s an anthemic, encouraging quality to the song, particularly on the growling, free-wheeling bridge. “After experiencing dating app nightmares in these streets, there is a sense of surprise and profound shock when you meet someone that is a functioning human being,” she explained in a statement. She’s honestly so real for that. — M. Siroky Listen to these songs and past selections on Amazon Music.
