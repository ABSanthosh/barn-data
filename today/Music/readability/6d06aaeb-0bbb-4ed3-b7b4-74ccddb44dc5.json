  "text": "This isn't the first time the former Fox News host has taken issue with J.Lo. Host Megyn Kelly at SiriusXM Studios on May 1, 2025 in New York City. Gary Gershoff/Getty Images Apparently Megyn Kelly isn’t planning to go to a Jennifer Lopez concert anytime soon. On Monday (July 21), the SiriusXM host shared a clip from a recent J.Lo concert — as the pop star makes her way across Europe for the Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour — that shows Lopez dancing suggestively with three male backup dancers to her 2011 Lil Wayne-assisted hit “I’m Into You.” “So she’s a soft porn star now,” Kelly wrote on X alongside the video, whose original poster had captioned it “55 year old Jennifer Lopez ‘performing.'” Kelly added: “Great choices!” Anyone who’s seen Lopez perform recently — like when she returned to host the American Music Awards in May and kicked off the show with a choreography-heavy opening number soundtracked by the biggest hits of 2024-25 — knows this performance is nothing new for the singer/actress, long known for her dancing chops and her uninhibited onstage persona. (This is the woman behind the 2014 Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit “Booty,” after all.) But it doesn’t seem like Kelly has ever counted herself among Lopez’s J.Lovers fan base. As recently as last year, Lopez caught a stray when the former Fox News host took issue with a different musician, Usher, and his 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. Trending on Billboard “Not into Usher or this halftime show,” Kelly wrote on X in February 2024, following the R\u0026B superstar’s headlining stint at Las Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium. “However I do appreciate that my kids haven’t had anyone’s vag exposed to them on screen as they innocently wait for the football to start. (Hi J-Lo, Shakira.)” (While there was no nudity during Lopez’s co-headlining halftime show with Shakira at the 2020 Super Bowl, Kelly seems to remember a much more explicit production.) Once Lopez wraps her string of European dates next month, she’ll return to Las Vegas for a new residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace starting Dec. 30, with dates through March 2026. Her Up All Night Live in Las Vegas residency follows her Jennifer Lopez: All I Have stint from 2016 to 2018 at Zappos Theater in Planet Hollywood.
