Are you ready for a new Drake album? Let us know in the comments! Tetris Kelly: Drake’s recent return with PARTYNEXTDOOR wasn’t enough, as he hints at new music with Adin Ross. After Yeat and Travis Scott showed him all the love at Coachella, we’re breaking it down. “Nokia” just reached a new peak on the Billboard Hot 100, and Drake told Adin Ross on a livestream he appreciates the success, but is ready for a new album. We hope it slaps—the OVO crooner dropped his last solo LP back in 2023. The streets must miss him, because Yeat performed a cover of Drake’s song “Feel No Ways” at Coachella, and Travis Scott performed “Modern Jam” over Drake’s “Nokia” instrumental. Drake himself also mentioned the Wireless Festival, which he’s headlining in London this July.",
