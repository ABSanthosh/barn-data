  "text": "John Mayer and Hollywood director McG have swooped in to purchase the lot that currently houses Jim Henson Studios for $60 million, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. According to a spokesperson for Mayer, the singer and filmmaker are “under contract to buy Henson Studios” after the Church of Scientology had been rumored to be circling the property. Though that report was never confirmed, THR has learned that a father-son duo with strong ties to Scientology had a hold on the land before Mayer. Run by Steve and Shaun Fabos, Fab Factory Studios had plans to lock in a deal. Steve Fabos is reportedly a major Scientology donor, while Shuan notably testified during Danny Masterson’s rape trial and was deemed a hostile witness after changing his testimony to support the disgraced actor. The Jim Henson Studios lot has been around since the beginnings of Hollywood, housing Charlie Chaplin’s studio from 1917 until he sold it in 1953. From there, it was used for various TV productions and was the headquarters for A\u0026M Records until Henson bought it in 1999 for a reported $12.5 million. Earlier this year, Henson’s legacy was explored in the Ron Howard documentary Idea Man, now streaming on Disney+.",
