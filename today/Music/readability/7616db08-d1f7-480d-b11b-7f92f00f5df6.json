Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, Mickey Hart and Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. Chris Walter/WireImage The lineup for the 2025 MusiCares Person of the Year benefit gala held in tribute to the Grateful Dead in Los Angeles has been revealed. On Monday (Jan. 20), The Hollywood Reporter announced the artists attached to the Grammy Week event scheduled for Jan. 31 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. Dead \u0026 Company (which includes Grateful Dead co-founders Bob Weir and Mickey Hart), John Mayer, Mick Fleetwood with Stewart Copeland, Norah Jones, Maren Morris, Noah Kahan, Vampire Weekend, Sierra Farrell and Lukas Nelson, Dwight Yoakam, Billy Strings, My Morning Jacket, Sammy Hagar, the War and Treaty and the War on Drugs are set for the event, as well as previous Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. Andy Cohen will be the MC. Original Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and Bob Weir will be recognized for their contributions to music, their philanthropic efforts and the group’s pioneering role in fostering communities through their concerts and activism. Two of the band’s founding members, the late Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh, who passed away in October, will be honored posthumously. Trending on Billboard The Grateful Dead is the third band to receive the honor, following Fleetwood Mac (2018) and Aerosmith (2020). The esteemed list of MusiCares Person of the Year honorees also includes Jon Bon Jovi, Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, Joni Mitchell, Dolly Parton, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Barbra Streisand, Neil Young, Neil Diamond, Aretha Franklin, Don Henley, James Taylor, Brian Wilson, Sting, Bono, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Luciano Pavarotti, Phil Collins, Quincy Jones, Tony Bennett, Gloria Estefan, Natalie Cole, Bonnie Raitt and David Crosby. It was confirmed that the 2025 MusiCares Persons of the Year event will go on as planned last week, amid the wildfires that have devastated the Los Angeles area. The announcement came a day after the Recording Academy said the Grammys are still on for Feb. 2. “Your attendance at Persons of the Year and your ongoing generosity will support these continued vital efforts, helping those in urgent need and signaling to the world that this vibrant city is on its feet,” MusiCares said in a statement. “At our upcoming Persons of the Year, we will make a special appeal for donations to support our wildfire relief efforts. We invite you to join us in spreading the word to your friends and family by sharing this link: www.musicares.org/FireRelief.” Since 1991, the MusiCares Person of the Year gala has raised funds to support MusiCares’ health and human services programs, which offer physical and mental health care, addiction recovery, preventive clinics, unforeseen personal emergencies and disaster relief to music professionals.
