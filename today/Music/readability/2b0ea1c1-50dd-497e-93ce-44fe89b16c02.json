  "text": "2025 has already proven to be an insane year for releases – and it's looking like we can add another to the list of forthcoming records. Fit For A King took to social media earlier this week to, rather clearly, confirm their next release: \"UPDATE: album will be 12 songs with a 40min run time. No interludes or any of that. 3 guest vocals (Landon Tewers on Technium included) That's all you get for now. New song coming sooner than you think.\" Fit For A King's last album was in 2022, and started releasing singles off the upcoming record in January with the track \"Keeping Secrets.\" They followed up with the aforementioned track, \"Technium\" featuring Landon Tewers in July, but not much has occurred since then. Hats off to Fit For A King for being so transparent about their next record, though – most bands just like to watch you squirm for details. Here's to hoping we get the new track by sometime in May. Fit For A King will be on the road in the US for a few days this summer with Killswitch Engage. In the meantime, you can check out the select dates below. May 8th – Columbus, Ohio @ Sonic Temple Art \u0026 Music Festival 2025May 10th – Indianapolis, Indiana @ Egyptian Room at Old National CentreMay 11th – Memphis, Tennessee @ Minglewood HallMay 13th – New Orleans, Louisiana @ Fillmore New OrleansMay 14th – Birmingham, Alabama @ Avondale Brewing CompanyMay 17th – North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina @ House of Blues Myrtle BeachMay 18th – Daytona Beach, Florida @ Welcome to Rockville 2025May 18th – Virginia Beach, Virginia @ The Dome Want More Metal?
