  "text": "Every week, Consequence’s Songs of the Week column looks at great new tunes from the last seven days and analyzes notable releases. Find our new favorites and more on our Spotify Top Songs playlist, and for other great songs from emerging artists, check out our Spotify New Sounds playlist. This week, FKA twigs and Tyler, the Creator offer windows into their intriguing new eras. Tyler’s Dust-Tinted Tease Tyler, the Creator is back with a new era and a new record, CHROMAKOPIA. The follow-up to 2021’s great CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST is just around the corner, arriving October 28th, and as a preview, the enigmatic artist has shared a brand new track — or did he? Honestly, we’re not sure. Tyler certainly released something, an 84-second video titled “ST. CHROMA,” but as of now, it’s unclear if it’s a full track, an album intro, or merely a teaser for what’s to come. Regardless of what it ultimately turns out to be, it’s quite a compelling taste from the ever-evolving rapper. Get Camp Flog Gnaw Tickets Here Tyler, the Creator is no stranger to high-concept music. Be it his early days of controversy, the wide appeal of Flower Boy, or the lovesick narrative of IGOR, each of his projects have their own respective visual and sonic vibes. Even CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, which was relatively more straightforward than the projects that preceded it, had ongoing DJ Drama narration scattered throughout the tracklist. For the upcoming CHROMAKOPIA, “ST. CHROMA” seems to hint at yet another new world. Featuring whispered verses over grainy, monochromatic footage of Tyler (?) in a mask, “ST. CHROMA,” like any good teaser, comes with more questions than answers. Though delivered like he’s pissed off in a library, Tyler’s bars are confident, pointed, and come across like the ambitious beginnings of a protagonist who’s about to go through quite the rise and fall. Then, Daniel Caesar comes in to wrap things up before it all suddenly comes to a close. What’s it all mean? Some dedicated fans have theories, but it’s anybody’s guess until the 28th. Till then, we’re on the edge of our seats. Jonah Kreuger Editorial Coordinator",
