Digging through a friend’s record collection can be an interesting way to get to know their tastes and personality. Looking through an artist genius’ vinyl stacks, however, can be downright enlightening. As Open Culture uncovered, David Bowie rummaged through his impressive collection of 2,500 LPs back in 2003 to pick out 25 records he said “could change your reputation.” The list of favorites ranges from spoken word (The Last Poets’ 1970 self-titled album) to classical (Gundula Janowitz’s performance of Strauss’ Four Last Songs) to good ol’ underground rock (The Velvet Underground’s The Velvet Underground \u0026 Nico). There’s everything from lesser-known psychedelic folk (The Incredible String Band’s The 5000 Spirits of the Layers of the Onion) to theatrical cast recordings (Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris), each given with Bowie’s explanation of his attraction to the album and how he came to possess it. Though many of the records are hard to track down even on CD — let alone vinyl — Open Culture went ahead and put together a Spotify playlist featuring as many of them as possible. You can listen to that below, followed by Find the complete list of Bowie’s favorite vinyl LPs. To read Bowie’s descriptions of the albums, head to Vinyl of the Day. You might also want to revisit a list of the late musician’s favorite books. David Bowie’s 25 Favorite Vinyl Records: The Last Poets — The Last Poets Shipbuilding — Robert Wyatt The Fabulous Little Richard — Little Richard Music for 18 Musicians — Steve Reich The Velvet Underground \u0026 Nico — The Velvet Underground Tupelo Blues — John Lee Hooker Blues, Rags and Hollers — Koerner, Ray and Glover The Apollo Theatre Presents: In Person! The James Brown Show — James Brown Forces of Victory — Linton Kwesi Johnson The Red Flower of Tachai Blossoms Everywhere: Music Played on National Instruments — Various Artists Banana Moon — Daevid Allen Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris — Cast Album The Electrosoniks: Electronic Music — Tom Dissevelt The 5000 Spirits of the Layers of the Onion — The Incredible String Band Ten Songs by Tucker Zimmerman — Tucker Zimmerman Four Last Songs (Strauss) — Gundula Janowitz The Ascension — Glenn Branca The Madcap Laughs — Syd Barrett Black Angels — George Crumb Funky Kingston — Toots \u0026 The Maytals Delusion of the Fury — Harry Partch Oh Yeah — Charles Mingus Le Sacre du Printemps — Igor Stravinsky The Fugs — The Fugs The Glory (????) of the Human Voice — Florence Foster Jenkins Read Bowie’s complete intro the list below. “There is really no way to do a list of my favorite albums with any rationality. I do only have about 2,500 vinyls. There is a possibility there. I’ll look through the albums and pull together a list of those I have re-bought or am in the process of re-buying on CD. I have little time, and there are just too many to sort through. So, I’ll keep pulling stuff out blindly, and if it’s too obvious (Sgt. Pepper, Nirvana) I’ll put it back again till I find something more interesting. A lot of the rock stuff I have is the same as everyone else’s, and I have so many blues and R\u0026B albums that it would topple over into trainspotter world if I went that route. O.K., no rules then. I’ll just make ’em up as I go along. I’d say half of this list below is now on my CD racks, but many are finding impossible to trace. The John Lee Hooker album, for instance, or The Red Flower of Tachai Blossoms Everywhere. I have done the only thing possible and burned them to CD myself, reduced the cover art down to size, and made reasonable simulacrums of the originals. If you can possibly get your hands on any of these, I guarantee you evenings of listening pleasure, and you will encourage a new high-minded circle of friends, although one or two choices will lead some of your old pals to think you completely barmy. So, without chronology, genre, or reason, herewith, in no particular order, 25 albums that could change your reputation.”",
