  "text": "Creed and Sevendust will close out 2024 with three shows leading up to, and including New Year's Eve. The shows start on December 28 at the Choctaw Casino \u0026 Resorts in Durant, OK and then move into a double header at the Colosseum Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, NV on December 30 and 31. Tickets are available here. 12/28 Durant, OK Choctaw Casino \u0026 Resorts12/30 Las Vegas, NV The Colosseum Caesars Palace12/31 Las Vegas, NV The Colosseum Caesars Palace As for potential new Creed, guitarist Mark Tremonti revealed in an interview with Ethan Dometrius that there was new material in the works around 2012, but he feels the band could do a little better than what they have. \"We were trying to get this back together about three years ago, right before COVID hit, so it kind of took things till now. But it's always something in the back of our minds. Every time we get going and we're doing promotions for new projects, everybody always asks us about new Creed music, new Creed tours. And it would be a shame not to get out there and continue to do it. I think just enough time has passed where people are dying to see Creed again, and we're very excited about it.\" Tremonti added: \"The last time we got together [more than a decade ago], we put together almost an entire another record, but it's just kind of sitting there on my laptop waiting to be dug back into. But I thought, honestly, if we wrote some new music, we could do better than that. And we'll kind of see what happens.\" Want More Metal?
