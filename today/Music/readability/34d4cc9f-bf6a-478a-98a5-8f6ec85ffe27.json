TikTok cited concerns about copyright issues, while Merlin stated this was an attempt by the Bytedance company to “fragment the Merlin membership”.Merlin says its membership – across 70+ countries – represents 15% of the global recorded music market.“Leading Merlin and empowering independence has been the privilege of a lifetime,” said Sirota. “Every day I get to wake up and create meaningful impact for our members, help them navigate through disruption, and ensure they have agency in a time of extraordinary change.“I leave with incredible pride knowing that Merlin has a bright future.”Jeremy Sirota“I leave with incredible pride knowing that Merlin has a bright future.

I’m also immensely grateful for the support of Darius Van Arman, Dave Hansen, the co-founders — Martin Mills, Michel Lambot, and the late Horst Weidenmüller — as well as the entire Merlin Board.”According to the announcement, Sirota will continue in his role through the end of the year. The executive team that will remain includes Charlie Lexton (COO), Jim Mahoney (SVP, Member \u0026 Partner Success), Adam Wright (CFO), and Neil Miller (General Counsel).The Merlin Board has formed a recruiting subcommittee to search for Sirota’s replacement.During Sirota’s time as CEO, Merlin has added new members including Artist Partner Group, Avex, Global Sound, and Nettwerk.The organization recently launched the Weidenmüller Sustainability Fund in partnership with IMPALA.Music Business Worldwide",
