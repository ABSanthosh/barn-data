  "text": "Described as a metallic hardcore band, THE BARBARIANS OF CALIFORNIA embrace California's hardcore punk scene and its scrappy melodies and ethos of defiance on \"Mr. Microphone.\" Despite both ERIC STENMAN (TINFED) and AARON BRUNO's (INSURGENCE, AWOLNATION) expansive experience in other genres, THE BARBARIANS OF CALIFORNIA is both STENMAN and BRUNO's homecoming to the punk scene in which they originally started. Their music careers were bloomed from the same scene as Dance Gavin Dance and Deftones, so their debut record felt quite full circle. THE BARBARIANS OF CALIFORNIA's first album, And Now I'm Just Gnashing My Teeth, dropped October 4th of last year, but the band aren't quite finished fleshing out the vision of this record. This past Friday, the band debuted a brand new music video for their single, \"Mr. Microphone.\" Punchy and thrashy with some distorted guitars, the track manages carves out a distinctive sound for the new band.
