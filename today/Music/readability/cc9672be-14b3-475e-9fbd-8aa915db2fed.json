  "text": "If you’re a fan of movies and television, you’ve probably heard the names Colin Farrell and Luca Guadagnino a whole bunch in recent years. Now, the two seem like they’re bound to collaborate on a new Sgt. Rock movie for DC Studios, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The news follows reports from late last year that Daniel Craig was circling the role, though DC Studios heads James Gunn and Peter Safran confirmed last month that no official offer was ever extended to the former James Bond actor. Should a deal finalize between Farrell and the studio, the film is expected to shoot this summer in England. Farrell is no stranger to DC properties, as he portrayed The Penguin in both Matt Reeves’ The Batman and in the eponymous HBO series The Penguin. For Guadagnino, however, the flick will mark his first foray into comic book movies. The director is also currently slated to helm the upcoming American Psycho remake. The character of Sgt. Franklin John Rock was created by Robert Kanigher and Joe Kubert and first appeared in the 1959 DC issue Our Army at War. Rock is an infantry soldier in World War II and boasts superpowers like shooting and throwing grenades with uncanny accuracy, close combat skills, superhuman endurance and strength, and a sixth sense “combat antenna.” Revisit our reviews of Luca Guadagnino’s two great films from last year, Challengers and Queer, and see where they placed on our list of the Best Films of 2024.",
