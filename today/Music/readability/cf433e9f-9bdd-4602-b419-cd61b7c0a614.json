Fans created 370 million posts and sent 4.88 million digital Fan Letters.Weverse Live, the platform’s real-time video feature, streamed 5,787 broadcasts totaling 4,779 hours of content with 11.25 million viewers and 426 million total views.The platform has attracted high-profile international artists in recent months, including Ariana Grande, Dua Lipa, Megan Thee Stallion, and Conan Gray.Joon Choi recently participated in SXSW Session, entitled  The Future of Music: Building a Superfan-Centric Business to discuss superfans in the music business. “Once fandoms grow beyond a certain level, their needs expand beyond general social media, and dedicated platforms like Weverse are necessary to retain the fans,” said Choi.  “Weverse is a tailor-made platform for superfans, integrating e-commerce, streaming and community features that are necessary to meet the growing needs of superfans.” He added: “Artists and fans know that Weverse is where the most loyal, core fans are. Because of this, it creates a unique environment where they can interact in a more meaningful way.”Music Business Worldwide",
