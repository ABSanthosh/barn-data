  "text": "Just hours after Dave Navarro, Stephen Perkins, and Eric Avery sued singer Perry Farrell over an infamous onstage altercation and its ramifications on the band, the frontman has sued his ex-Jane’s Addiction bandmates, citing assault and battery, bullying and harassment, and breach of contract, among other allegations. As Variety reports, Farrell’s legal action is not a countersuit, but rather a separate lawsuit filed by Farrell, his wife Etty Lau Farrell, and his touring company against Navarro, Perkins, and Avery. A summary statement from Farrell’s lawyer, as emailed to Consequence from his publicist, reads as follows: “As a founding member and creative force behind Jane’s Addiction, Perry Farrell has always prioritized the band’s legacy and its supporters, which is why the events of September 13th, 2024 in Boston and the resulting fallout was so devastating. Without warning or consultation and using Perry as a scapegoat, Dave Navarro and the other band members took it upon themselves to abruptly cancel the remaining tour dates—violating contracts and disregarding all professional obligations. Perry was blindsided by not being allowed to vote and be heard, leaving him unable to plead his case to continue the tour for their fans. If that was not harmful enough, Dave Navarro then intentionally and publicly blamed Perry for the canceled tour dates effectively destroying Perry’s reputation and causing him irreparable harm. Despite this continued bullying perpetuated by Navarro, Perry’s dedication to Jane’s Addiction and the preservation of its positive impact on the music industry remains unshaken. He is actively exploring ways to address the situation and ensure accountability.” Both lawsuits stem from Jane’s Addiction’s show in Boston on September 13th, 2024, which now stands as the band’s final concert. During the gig, Farrell shoved and punched Navarro onstage, as captured on fan-filmed video. Further reports suggested that Avery then punched Farrell while restraining him, and that Farrell and Navarro got into another physical altercation backstage. The band subsequently canceled the remainder of the tour and broke up. Farrell’s legal complaint contends that Navarro “charged and assaulted” Perry and Etty Lau backstage, while the ex-bandmates’ suit alleges that Farrell punched Navarro in the face backstage. The singer’s legal action also states that his bandmates refused to lower the volume of their playing after multiple requests by Farrell, causing the frontman emotional distress. Furthermore, Farrell’s suit argues that the singer did not want to cancel the tour and was forced to do so by his bandmates. Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed by Navarro, Avery, and Perkins against Farrell seeks $10 million in damages, with Navarro citing assault and battery, and all three alleging emotional distress, negligence, and breach of contract.",
