  "text": "Saxon has sadly cancelled their upcoming 2025 summer shows as singer Biff Byford undergoes an emergency procedure. It's worth noting that Saxon's Rockharz Festival in Ballenstedt in Germany on July 2 performance is still on, but other than that – cancelled. No additional information is currently available, though we wish Byford all the best with his health. \"Saxon were so looking forward to performing at all the below summer festivals and events, but the health and well-being of the band obviously has to come first,\" wrote a spokesperson for Saxon's management company. \"It goes without saying that all in Saxon are gutted that they will be unable to perform but look forward to hopefully being back on stage in time to play both Trutnoff Open Air Festival in Czech Republic on August 23 and Neuborn Open Air on August 29. The band are also very much looking forward to their upcoming tours of both Spain, France and the U.K. later this year too.
