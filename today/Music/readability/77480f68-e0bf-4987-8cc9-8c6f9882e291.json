  "text": "It all started when As I Lay Dying bassist Ryan Neff left the band a few days ago with barely any statement. Then rumors started swirling that As I Lay Dying's European tour had been cancelled, all amidst their tour manager quitting. Guitarist then Ken Susi quit the band followed immediately by drummer Nick Pierce. While As I Lay Dying still hasn't issued a statement on why everyone's quitting, fellow European tourmates Decapitated and Ov Sulfur have made it clear that the tour is indeed cancelled. Decapitated wrote: \"Dear Fans, we regret to inform you that, due to circumstances beyond our control, the upcoming tour has been cancelled. We are very sorry for all our fans who were planning to come to these shows and already bought tickets. Get ready for an amazing new tour that’s on the way—we can’t wait to make it up to you! Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for support! Tickets can be refunded at your point of purchase. Ov Sulfur added in their own post: \"Unfortunately our European tour with As I Lay Dying, Decapitated and Caliban has been canceled. We are disappointed to not play for our fans overseas for what would have been our first time, but this was out of our control. We look forward to making it to your side of the world as soon as we can. \"Sadly some costs incurred are not recoupable, so if you have the means it would mean the world if you check out any of our merch stores or stream our music. Thank you and see you soon.\" As I Lay Dying guitarist Phil Sgrosso (who I'm assuming is still in the band since he hasn't said otherwise yet) has only partially addressed the situation, saying he's preparing a statement and is trying to navigate the business side of everything. \"I will be making a personal statement shortly on where I stand in the AILD situation,\" wrote Sgrosso.\"There is a lot more of the bureaucracy/business that I am navigating at the moment but I will share more with you once a clear path of moving forward presents itself.\" Want More Metal?
