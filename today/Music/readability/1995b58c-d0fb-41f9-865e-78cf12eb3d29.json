  "text": "Bruce Springsteen is bigger than ever. Despite Donald Trump labeling the legendary classic rocker as “highly overrated” earlier this year, Springsteen has wrapped up the most successful tour of his career, pulling in a whopping $729.7 million and selling 4.9 million tickets along the way. According to Billboard, his 2023-25 tour grossed more than double his previous biggest run of shows, the “Wrecking Ball World Tour,” which generated $347 million in 2012-13. Other Springsteen tours that made more than $200 million include “The Rising Tour” of 2002-03, “The Magic Tour” of 2007-08, and “The River Tour,” which happened in 2016-17. While some of the increased revenue of The Boss’ 2023-35 tour can be attributed to the industry-wide surge in ticket prices, Springsteen also sold more tickets than previous jaunts. The 4.9 million tickets moved during his 2023-25 tour far outpaced the 3.6 million sold during “The Wrecking Ball Tour” by 37%. It was also his longest jaunt ever, with 129 shows. That inches out the 125 shows of “The Wrecking Ball Tour.”",
