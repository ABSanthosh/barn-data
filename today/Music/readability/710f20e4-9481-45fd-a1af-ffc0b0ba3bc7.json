  "text": "Noah Weiland, son of late Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland, has unveiled a cover and music video of the STP classic “Sex Type Thing” in honor of his late father. “Filmed this about a dream I had long ago about seeing my father again. It’s hard for me to stay in the moment sometimes, but I try,” wrote Noah on Instagram. The cover is a stripped-down version of the song, which served as STP’s first-ever single off their debut album, Core. It features Noah’s vocals over an acoustic guitar, played by Spencer Carr Reed. The music video depicts Noah out and about with a Chucky doll, which is representative of Scott in Noah’s aforementioned dream. Along with the visuals of Noah and the doll, there are captions that explain the dream and how it relates to Scott: “There was so much I wanted to tell him, like how much has changed on Earth without him.” The video concludes, “I wish I could dream about you forever. But it’s OK … because for now I will carry on your legacy.” Noah has been pursuing music for a number of years. We first reported on him back in 2020 when he emerged in the band Suspect208, also featuring the sons of Guns N’ Roses’ Slash and Metallica’s Robert Trujillo. He’s released a number of solo songs since then, including one titled “Time Will Tell” featuring previously unreleased Scott Weiland vocals. A year ago, he told Rolling Stone that people misconceived him as a privileged child of a late rock star. “I’m not a trust fund baby or anything like that,” said Noah. “I always get annoyed when people say that type of stuff. My dad was millions in debt when he died. My mom has always worked a normal job.” Watch Noah Weiland’s video for his cover of Stone Temple Pilots’ “Sex Type Thing” below.",
