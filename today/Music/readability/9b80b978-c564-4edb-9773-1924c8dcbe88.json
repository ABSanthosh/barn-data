  "text": "A seemingly innocuous Disney-themed dance party has gone viral after one of the DJs performed in front of photographs of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City last week. ‚ÄúBop to the Top‚Äù is billed as DJ led dance night featuring Disney Channel music. On Friday night, the group staged in an event at Big Night Live in Boston. At one point, as Hannah Montana‚Äôs ‚ÄúHe Could Be the One‚Äù played, images of Mangione flashed on the screen, drawing noticeable cheers from the crowd. ‚ÄúYou gotta give the people what they want,‚Äù the DJ exclaimed. ‚ÄúBop to the Top‚Äù has since uploaded the footage to social media to promote its upcoming tour dates. ‚ÄúDisney Channel Night x Luigi coming to your city this holiday season!‚Äù the caption reads. To be clear, the event has no affiliation with Disney, but conservatives have already seized on the footage, using it to attack the company and liberals on social media. üö®#WATCH: As crowds of concert attendees cheer when the Bop to the Top tour puts photos of Luigi, who tragically m*rdered the healthcare CEO‚Å∞üìå#Boston | #Massachusetts‚Å∞Watch shocking footage of concert attendees erupting in cheers and celebration during the Bop to the Top‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/TmxtvDl7oa ‚Äî R A W S A L E R T S (@rawsalerts) December 14, 2024",
