  "text": "The Bravo star impressed the judges all along before getting her leash yanked on Wednesday night's episode. Yorkie on 'THE MASKED SINGER.' Michael Becker/©2025 FOX Media LLC. So far this season on The Masked Singer, viewers have seen the fuzzy heads come off of Honey Pot (Cedric the Entertainer), Fuzzy Peas (Oscar De La Hoya), Ant (Aubrey O’Day), Bat (Scheana Shay), Space Ranger (Flavor Flav), Griffin (James Van Der Beek), Cherry Blossom (Candace Cameron Bure) and Stud Muffin (Method Man). Through it all, the show’s judges have consistently given one contestant major props: Yorkie. She first came out, tail swinging, on her spirited cover of Chappell Roan’s “Hot to Go!” during week 7, getting the audience in on the shout-along chorus and then having all the right moves on a cover of New Kids on the Block’s “Step By Step” on Boy Band Night. Yorkie proved it again on Wednesday night’s (April 9) group C finals Decades Night, when she joined Nessie and Mad Scientist Monster to bop through iconic tunes from the 1950s, ’60s, ’70s and ’80s. She jammed out in the episode’s kick-off bop through The Knack’s iconic “My Sharona” as the night’s stars tried to secure the last two spots in the Lucky Six lineup.  Trending on Billboard The sparkly pink pup was up first, noting that she chose the ‘60s because the decade reminded her of her “ultimate protector”: her mom. She sounded confident on The Supremes’ “Stop! In the Name of Love,” nailing the song with her alluringly husky voice while adding just the right amount of tail-wagging sass. In a Battle Royale showdown for the last spot in the Lucky Six, Yorkie took on Mad Scientist Monster during a run through Otis Redding’s “Hard to Handle,” with the towering Nessy knocking it out of the park to secure the elusive final spot. Ken Jeong had high praise for the dogged performer, saying she proved herself to be the “funniest, most charismatic” contestant so far this season, just before she was sent to the doghouse. After a clue noted that she’s on a huge TV show and has had some legal problems, Robin Thicke guessed Full House star and college admission scandal conspirator Lori Laughlin. After guessing Real Housewives of New Jersey star Theresa Giudice last week, always-wrong Ken Jeong pivoted to another Real Housewives star, Beverly Hills’ Kyle Richards. He was, as usual, wrong, while self-appointed Bravo superfan Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg knew she had it in the bag, doubling down on her previous guess of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne. The reality icon who has landed nine No. 1 songs on Billboard‘s Dance Club Songs chart spoke to Billboard before her elimination about why Yorkie was the perfect choice for her, how much less stressful the show was than Housewives and why, like Roan, she’s definitely hot to go. The pink sparkly Yorkie costume seemed like a slam dunk for you. Were there even any other options? You touched on it immediately. I saw the sketch for Yorkie and I was just, “That’s it! I know this character, it’s perfect for me. I’m in love with this little character.” And that’s why every time I performed, I lived her personality to the fullest. Listen: If you can’t have fun in a pink miniskirt and crop top with sunglasses and pink-tipped ears and pink Ugg boots, there’s something wrong with you. This was just made to have a good time. You said you chose the Supremes song tonight because it reminded you of your mom. Was that an emotional song for you to sing? Any time you bring something up about family or you dedicate something, your emotions are in it and yes, of course. I talk about protecting my heart. We’re all emotional beings and, listen, the Yorkie is too! Little Yorkie has feelings too. You also  seemed to really get into you Chappell Roan cover. What appealed to you about that song?  It’s a great little fun song to perform. It has tons of personality. It fit just beautifully and you can get out there and really have a good time. And I’m hot to go, so there you go! Were you psyched when Jenny channeled Donny Wahlberg to praise your “Step by Step” cover? That’s the ultimate thumbs-up! I love that compliment. I never get to sing a boy band song, so this was a really nice step out of the norm and I really had a good time with it. You’ve had nine No. 1s on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, with songs like “Roller Coaster,” “Stars,” “Give You Everything” and, of course, “How Many F—s,” so why not pick a more upbeat dance song to perform? The themes are set so it would be Boy Band night or Classics night, so I really had to work in the theme of the night, so I picked the material I thought I could do the best with. Given you chart success, were you bummed that you didn’t make it longer on the show? No, those things are beyond my control. I just went out there every night and performed to the best of my ability and had a great time doing the show. So much of Real Housewives each season is about where your relationships stand with the other women, but on The Masked Singer, you’re completely isolated from the rest of the cast. Were there any similarities between this reality competition and your typical experience on reality TV? No. [Laughs] Let me say this in the best way possible: Housewives can be very uncomfortable at times. Masked Singer was a dream. Few things are more stressful than Real Housewives. Your son Tommy is a cop. Did he use his detective skills to suss out what you were up to? My son is a sergeant with the LAPD. And no, absolutely not. Did any of your Real Housewives castmates directly ask if it was you or recognize your voice? My voice is quite recognizable, so my DMs are flooded with “I know that’s you, I know that’s you!” You’ve had so much chart success, but was Masked Singer a way to continue that but with less pressure since nobody knew it was you? Absolutely. 100%. The Masked Singer was a wonderful way to hide behind a mask and just get out there and perform and really inhabit the character and entertain and I enjoyed every moment of it. You’re in your 10th year on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Is there any world where you thought you’d be on the show for a decade when you signed on? And what do you see for your future on the show, given the rumors that you might not be coming back? Another decade? Is that what you said? Oh my God, certainly not a decade. I’ve had the great pleasure of being on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills for almost a decade. I don’t know what’s happening the next year or beyond… certainly not another decade. Tell me about how you’re prepping for your upcoming performance at Mighty Hoopla in the U.K. on June 1. I’m super excited about the Mighty Hoopla and then Koko [in London] on June 3. I’m super excited to take the show over. I haven’t been to the U.K. in a very long time. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
