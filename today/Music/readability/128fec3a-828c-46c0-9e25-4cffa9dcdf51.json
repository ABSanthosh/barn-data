  "text": "KISS – like every other band that has ever played their final tour – isn't quite done yet. KISS has just sent an email out to the mailing list of the KISSOnline.com website, informing everyone of an unmasked KISS show as part of the three-day KISS Army Storms Vegas event. \"In celebration of the KISS Army's 50th Anniversary and the 30th anniversary of the first KISS fan convention, KISS Army Storms Vegas will take place at Virgin Hotels Las Vegas from November 14-16, 2025!\" reads a portion of the email. \"This exclusive, 'everything KISS' paradise marks the first time KISS has performed together since retiring from touring in December 2023.\" The email also notes a \"special live performance from former KISS member Bruce Kulick,\" though it's not clear if Kulick will be performing with KISS or as a solo act. Kulick played with KISS between 1984 and 1996. And yeah, again – is anyone surprised by this? I'm not. KISS is gonna be printing money until the sun eventually consumes the Earth, and even then they'll find a way to turn that into merchandise. Want More Metal?
