  "text": "Emperor released their last record in 2001, yet questions still remain as to whether or not we'll ever receive more Emperor material, and frontman Ihsahn [Vegard Sverre Tveitan] has no problem fielding the questions despite his own solo work. The curiosity makes sense – Emperor embarked on a tour for the first time in 15 years two years ago, and as Ihsahn pointed out that he said, \"There would never be anymore Emperor live shows.\" Ihsahn elaborates on why he believed Emperor was able to tour again when chatting to Jorge Botas at Metal Global in Portugal, saying that people enjoy the music because \"they know it's for real. It's not made for some kind of commercial aspect or some kind of entrepreneurial idea. It's just music for the sake of music. Of course there are lots of financial motivations to do such a thing, but then again, I don't think any of us would want that to be a motivation for us doing what we do\" (transcribed via Blabbermouth). So, at least if Emperor decides to make new music, it'll be because they want to, \"If stars align, and we have been going with the live stuff for a long, long time, but if we were to make something, I think that the reason behind it would have to be right.\" You can check out everything Ihsahn had to say about his solo work and Emperor in the interview below.
