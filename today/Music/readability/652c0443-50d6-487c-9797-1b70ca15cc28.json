  "text": "Sun Don't Shine – the band featuring Type O Negative guitarist Kenny Hickey and drummer Johnny Kelly alongside current Crowbar frontman Kirk Windstein and ex-Crowbar bassist Todd Strange that used to be called Eye Am – is now streaming their latest single \"Coming Down\". The single is a part of Sun Don't Shine's upcoming four-song EP of the same name, which is out in July and is available for pre-order right here. On the band itself and their overall approach to songwriting, Hickey offered: \"We don't want it to be one-dimensional. We want the music to be both light and dark—dynamic and unpredictable.\" Sun Don't Shine originally debuted as Eye Am in 2023 with their first single, \"Dreams Always Die With The Sun.\" The band chose to relaunch as Sun Don't Shine in January 2025, better reflecting their darker, more layered musical direction.
