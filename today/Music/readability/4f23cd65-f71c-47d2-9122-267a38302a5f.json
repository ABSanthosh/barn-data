  "text": "A civil lawsuit accusing JAY-Z of assaulting a 13-year-old girl was voluntarily dismissed on Friday (February 14th). “Today is a victory. The frivolous, fictitious and appalling allegations have been dismissed,” JAY-Z wrote in statement responding to the lawsuit’s dismal. “This civil suit was without merit and never going anywhere. The fictional tale they created was laughable, if not for the seriousness of the claims. I would not wish this experience on anyone. The trauma that my wife, my children, my loved ones and I have endured can never be dismissed.” The lawsuit, originally filed by Jane Doe against Sean “Diddy” Combs in October 2024 and later amended in December to include JAY-Z, accused the two musicians of raping the then-13-year-old victim at an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty in 2000. The alleged victim later admitted to inconsistencies in her story. In his statement on Friday, JAY-Z also blasted the alleged victim’s attorney, Jay Buzbee, writing, “This 1-800 lawyer gets to file a suit hiding behind Jane Doe, and when they quickly realize that the money grab is going to fail, they get to walk away with no repercussions. The system has failed.” JAY-Z continued, “The court must protect victims, OF COURSE, while with the same ethical responsibility, the courts must protect the innocent from being accused without a shred of evidence. May the truth prevail for all victims and those falsely accused equally.” Buzbee declined to comment on the dismissal.",
