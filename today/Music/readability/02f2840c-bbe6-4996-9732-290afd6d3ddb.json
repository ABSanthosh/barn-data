  "text": "Brandy and Monica are teaming up for their first-ever co-headlining tour in Fall 2025. Kelly Rowland, Muni Long, and 2025 American Idol winner Jamal Roberts will join them as special guests. Aptly titled “The Boy Is Mine Tour,” the 24-city arena run kicks off on October 16th in Cincinnati, with subsequent stops including Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, DC. See the full schedule below. Get Brandy and Monica Tickets Here Tickets for Brandy and Monica’s 2025 tour are now on sale via Ticketmaster. Fans can also look for deals or get tickets to sold-out shows via StubHub, where orders are 110% guaranteed through StubHub’s FanProtect program. Of course, the co-headlining tour is named after Brandy and Monica’s classic 1998 duet “The Boy Is Mine,” which spent a record-breaking 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and won them a Grammy for Best R\u0026B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The artists previously reunited on “It All Belongs to Me” in 2012. “This really is a full-circle moment. Monica and I coming together again isn’t just about the music — it’s about honoring where we came from and how far we’ve both come,” Brandy said in a statement. “‘The Boy Is Mine’ was a defining chapter in R\u0026B, and to share the stage all these years later is bigger than a reunion — it’s a celebration of growth, sisterhood, and the love our fans have given us from day one.” Monica added, “The love that ‘The Boy Is Mine’ continues to receive means everything to me. This tour is a celebration of our history, our impact, and the fans who have grown with us. Brandy and I have been on our own unique journeys, and coming back together in this way is a reminder of the power of respect, strength, and real music. We’re giving the people what they’ve been asking for, and doing it with grace, love, and purpose. God’s timing perfectly aligned us.” Last year, the duo gained a whole new generation of fans after making a surprise cameo in Ariana Grande’s music video for “the boy is mine.” Brandy and Monica contributed to the subsequent “the boy is mine” remix, which earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.
