  "text": "Acid Bath frontman Dax Riggs is gonna have one hell of a 2025. Acid Bath has reunited for some reunion shows, and Riggs himself is releasing his first new album in 15 years named 7 Songs For Spiders, due out January 24. Riggs is now streaming the single \"Even The Stars Fall\", about which he said: \"A meditation on human collapse and how failure creates the only heaven we'll ever know. GET UNDEAD! BE ALIVE NOW! Cause even the stars fall.\" 7 Songs For Spiders was written at Riggs' home in Acadiana, a region settled by descendants of French exiles from Canada. \"I've always felt a connection with the spirit of this place,\" said Riggs of the location. \"There's a vacuum for rock music here in 'Cajun hell,' so it's the perfect place to go inside yourself–where I've always gone.\" 7 Songs For Spiders features guitarist and synth player Lucas Broussard, bassist Kane Cormier, and percussionist Scott Domingue. Pre-orders for 7 Songs For Spiders are available here. Want More Metal?
