  "text": "AC/DC hit the road across Europe earlier this year, and it looks like they'll be doing the same in 2025 across North America. An advertisement for an AC/DC show on April 11, 2025 at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, MN showed up earlier today before being removed. A ticket sale date for November 15 is also being reported, so we'll see what happens later this week. If it's true, this will be AC/DC's first proper tour of North American since 2015 and 2016 (and first with vocalist Brian Johnson across all its dates). AC/DC is currently Johnson, guitarists Angus and Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug in place of Phil Rudd, and bassist Chris Chaney (Jane's Addiction, Alanis Morissette) in place of Cliff Williams. We'll update this story if and when the rumored tour gets announced. Want More Metal?
