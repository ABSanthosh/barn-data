  "text": "Green Day were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame today, May 1st. As promised, Matt Pinfield made his first public appearance since suffering a massive stroke in January to serve as emcee. “What an honor it is to be here today with these three guys that I love. Love their music and love them as people,” said the legendary former MTV host while opening the ceremony. “[Dookie] made so many young people pick up guitars, bass, and drums, and want to sing and write songs.” Get Green Day Tickets Here He continued, “That is what punk rock, rock and roll music is all about. That beauty, that love, a passing on of that gift. And that’s the thing that’s so special about Green Day and why it’s such an honor to be here today.” Outside of leaning on a cane to walk up to the podium, Pinfield showed few signs of being two months removed from a coma. Seemingly energized by the moment, he was effusive in his praise for Green Day, whom he called “one of the greatest live bands” today. Frequent Green Day collaborator Rob Cavallo then took the mic, recalling making Dookie with the band when grunge was the dominant sound in the music industry. Ryan Reynolds was up next, opening his speech with a joke about Green Day “being the only child of Doris Day.” Getting serious, he spoke about being inspired to use the band’s hit “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)” for the closing credits of Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine after seeing its emotional impact on people hearing it in a cafe. Watch the full ceremony below. Green Day’s most recent album, Saviors, is set to receive an expanded deluxe edition arriving May 23rd via Reprise Records. Pre-orders are ongoing. Starting later this month, they will head back on the road for a string of festival dates across Europe, North America, and Brazil. Get tickets here.",
