  "text": "Wilson proposed during the \"Back to the Beginning\" send-off on Saturday (July 5). Sid Wilson and Kelly Osbourne attend Matt Mathews' Celebration of Boujee on a Budget Tour with Live Nation at The Peppermint Club on Nov. 20, 2024 in Los Angeles, Calif. Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Live Nation Kelly Osbourne and Slipknot‘s Sid Wilson are engaged, the couple shared on Sunday (July 6). Wilson proposed during Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath‘s farewell concert on Saturday in Birmingham, England, in front of Kelly’s family, whose reactions were caught on camera. “Kelly, you know I love you more than anything in the world–” Wilson began, only to be momentarily interrupted by a quip from Ozzy that brought on a room full of laughs: “F— off, you’re not marrying my daughter.” Trending on Billboard In a video of the proposal posted on Instagram by Kelly, her soon-to-be fiancé is seen picking up where he left off: “Nothing would make me happier than spending the rest of my life with you. So, in front of your family and all of our friends, Kelly, will you marry me?” He got down on one knee, and Kelly accepted. She let him put a ring on her finger, to unanimous cheers. Kelly and Sid have one child together, 2-year-old Sidney, who was born in 2022. Mom Sharon Osbourne excitedly announced his birth and his name on The Talk in January 2023, though Kelly commented after the show that she was “not ready to share him with the world.” The couple first met in 1999, when Slipknot was touring with Ozzfest. In January 2022, Kelly shared that they were together. “After 23 years of friendship I can’t believe where we have ended up!” she said of her relationship with Wilson, writing on Instagram that she was “deeply in love.” She called Wilson her “best friend” and “soulmate.” Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath’s “Back to the Beginning” concert, featuring the band’s original lineup (Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward), had 45,000 fans descending on Villa Park for an all-star stadium show on Saturday. Alongside the main event — the final setlist included five songs from Ozzy’s solo career and four Black Sabbath songs — the day saw performances from Metallica, Slayer, Guns N’ Roses, Tool, Pantera, Anthrax and more.  Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
