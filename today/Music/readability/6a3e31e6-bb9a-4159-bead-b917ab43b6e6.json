With Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” reigning at No. 1 on the Hot 100, do Kendrick Lamar \u0026 SZA’s “Luther,” Drake’s “Nokia” or Morgan Wallen stand a chance? What do you think the Song of the Summer will be? Let us know in the comments! Guest 1: I feel like, because there’s so much going on in the world, we need to get lit. We want to be outside. Tetris Kelly: Like Drake said, where the f— the function? The sun’s out, skin showing, fire up the grill, it’s summertime. And with summer 2025 in full effect, that means artists like Morgan Wallen, Chappell Roan, Doechii, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, Kendrick Lamar and more are all vying for the Song of the Summer. The competition is tough, but Alex Warren has come out swinging with his hit “Ordinary.” The track has been holding it down at the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. But the summer is just starting, so it’s anyone’s game. We headed over to Santa Monica Pier to find out what song people are feeling.  Guest 2: So they asked what the Song of the Summer is. I think I already know. “Nokia,” that’s a bop right there. I love that song.  Guest 3: “Anxiety” by Doechii. She’s popping off right now, and she deserves it, and “Anxiety” is fire as h*ll. Guest 4: I don’t know. It’s definitely a season for the pop girls still. BRAT season is not yet over. “What Was That?” by Lorde is, like, the best song ever. Guest 1: Definitely “Mutt” By Leon Thomas, yeah, that’s the song I play every single day, maybe five times a day. Keep watching for more!",
