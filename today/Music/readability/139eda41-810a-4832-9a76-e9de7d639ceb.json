  "text": "Here's an absolutely insane story to close out your Wednesday. Jillian Lauren, the wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, was shot by police officers during a chase in Los Angeles and has since been book for attempted murder. According to a report from TMZ, it all started when California Highway Patrol and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers were looking for someone involved with a hit-and-run on April 8. Three suspects involved with the crime fled the scene, with one fleeing on foot into a residential street. This where Lauren enters. When police were looking for the suspect in the yard of whoever lives next door to Lauren and Shriner, Lauren came out of the house with a gun in her hand. The report notes that the cops told Lauren to drop the gun several times – which she didn't – and eventually pointed it at the officers. Lauren was shot in the shoulder by police and surrendered 30 minutes later. Lauren has since been treated for a non-life threatening injury and has been booked for attempted murder. The one person that fled the scene of the original crime was caught, while the other two remain at large. Want More Metal?
