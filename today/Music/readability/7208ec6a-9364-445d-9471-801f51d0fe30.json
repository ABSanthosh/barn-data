  "text": "The suspension is for six months \u0026 includes several conditions. Los Alegres del Barranco Courtesy of Los Alegres del Barranco Español On Monday (June 30), a judge halted criminal proceedings for six months against Los Alegres del Barranco, a Mexican group facing accusations of glorifying organized crime during a Jalisco concert where they performed a narcocorrido and displayed imagery of a notorious cartel leader. The suspension comes as part of an agreement requiring the band members to take specific steps to repair the damage caused. The Council of the Judiciary of the State of Jalisco confirmed to Billboard Español that a judge approved the measures agreed upon between the prosecution and the legal defense of the band, formally and temporarily suspending the criminal proceedings faced by the artists, their representative, and the promoter of their concerts starting Monday. Trending on Billboard However, state authorities clarified that this suspension does not extend to the investigation into their possible involvement in the crime of operations with resources of illicit origin, which remains ongoing. Luis Alvarado, spokesperson for Los Alegres del Barranco, also confirmed to Billboard Español the agreement between the Jalisco Prosecutor’s Office and the musical group, without providing details. A request for information sent to the Jalisco Prosecutor’s Office about this agreement has not yet been answered. According to the Council of the Judiciary of the State of Jalisco, the agreement requires the group to maintain their residence in Guadalajara, report periodically to state authorities, and hold two conferences with incarcerated individuals in the municipalities of Guadalajara and Ciudad Guzmán to promote positive messages and encourage them to distance themselves from organized crime. Additionally, the band has reportedly committed to making a financial donation, the amount and destination of which will be determined by the Prosecutor’s Office. The agreement reached with the Prosecutor’s Office to suspend the criminal proceedings for alleged glorification of crime came after the Sinaloa-based quartet released an anti-narcocorrido, recorded at the request of Jalisco state governor Pablo Lemus. The song, titled “El Consejo” and released on YouTube on June 15, serves as a call to discourage young people from joining the ranks of organized crime and warns them about the potential consequences of getting involved in criminal activities. The case stems from a presentation in an auditorium at the University of Guadalajara on March 29, where the band performed a narcocorrido, accompanied by images alluding to the leader of the Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho.” This even prompted the U.S. to revoke the work and tourist visas of its members. Ten of Mexico’s 32 states have implemented various bans against narcocorridos or any expression that advocates crime, without it being a federal law.
