Drew Afualo: Team, we have the iconic, the legendary, the one and only GloRilla. Welcome backstage, how do you feel being here at the Billboard Women in Music Awards?  GloRilla: I feel honored.  That’s amazing. You look fab.  Thank you. You look fab.  Thank you so much. Thank you. Did you guys get that on camera? I also hear you’re on tour, and you made time to come here. I love that.  Yes, I did.  How’s tour going?  It’s going great. Sold-out shows every night. You know?  Look at you, yeah, just slight work, you know, you know, a little bit.  Well, really a lot of work, but we gonna call it slight work, you know, make it look easy. You make it look easy, tea, love that for you. OK, so I do want to ask you some fun questions, but first I’m gonna give you some flowers. Oh, look at that. That’s for you! Oh, thank you so much. Oh my gosh, you’re so welcome. Flowers, literally and metaphorically. But I want to ask you: Who do you give your flowers to for getting you where you are now? My fans.  Love.  Yeah, most definitely my fans and my team. That’s amazing. And who do you give flowers to for inspiring your music?  Oh, my cousin. My cousin. I ramp up. Keep watching for more!",
