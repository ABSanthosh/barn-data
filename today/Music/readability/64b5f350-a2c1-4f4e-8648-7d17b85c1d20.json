  "text": "It seems that Oceano is gonna be mired down in drama right to the end. Oceano recently unveiled their farewell tour for this May and June after announcing they'd sadly be coming to an end this year in the wake of some drama regarding their plans to tour with Attila and Dealer. Now Oceano is being accused by artist Chris Gallien of stealing their final show tour poster from concepts presented by Gallien to the band. In a statement, Gallien accused Oceano of straight up plagiarizing his art after the band allegedly told him they weren't interested in what he presented. Oceano has not yet addressed the claims. \"Ya I'm not keeping my mouth shut,\" wrote Gallien. \"Don't meet your heroes, they'll take advantage of you. That Oceano tour flier that dropped yesterday was my work and I got zero credit for it. Straight up 'hey, you can copy my homework, just change it up a little.'\" \"I was told my flier didn't make the cut, and then see that my work was completely ripped off and plagiarized. With that being said, I'm not working with Adam or Oceano on anything moving forward. That's the last time I do anything without upfront deposits and contracts. Even the big boys will play you.\" Oceano will hit the road this May with I Declare War, See You Next Tuesday, Filth, BackBiter for their very last trek kicking off on May 13 at the Black Circle in Indianapolis, IN.
