  "text": "It's no secret Birmingham went all out for the Back To The Beginning show – painting a massive mural of the four original members – Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward – alongside putting up a photo gallery in the city's centre, as well as offering an exhibit on Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne's lives and careers. Even retail stores had decorated in celebration of the band's final show. There are even landmarks within Birmingham for diehard Black Sabbath fans permanently – there even was a bench with the four original members statutes was originally designed and implemented in 2019. It was originally conceptualized in 2017 by a superfan named Mohammed Osama and built by brothers Ben and Phil Lungley, and the plaques of each member's likeness were done by a Birmingham jeweller, Adam. After the bench was unveiled by Toni Iommi and Geezer Butler in June of 2019 on a bridge across the Birmingham Canal, the bridge was shortly renamed Black Sabbath Bridge. Now, that bench – and bridge – have been turned into a memorial for Ozzy Osbourne as fans lay dozens of bouquets of flowers, different pieces of artwork, Black Sabbath memorabilia, letters of gratitude and more in honor of Osbourne's passing four days ago on July 22nd. He had just performed his last show with Black Sabbath on July 5th. You can see the bridge, and bench, for yourself through a livestream camera from the Black Sabbath Bench website. It's quite a bittersweet feeling to look at the bench – you can check out the livestream here. All you need is a working email address. Nearly everyone walking by stops, at least just for a moment. Others linger. Ultimately, Birmingham, and the entire metal community, is in mourning. Want More Metal?
