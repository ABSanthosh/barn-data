  "text": "Dropkick Murphys frontman, Ken Casey, has doubled-down on his criticisms of Donald Trump and Elon Musk, saying America is amidst “a class war.” Casey made the comments during an interview with Boston’s WBUR, following several viral moments highlighting the Celtic punk band’s disdain for the politics of Trump’s administration — including a recent incident in which Casey exposed that a front-row fan’s MAGA shirt wasn’t made in America, but Nicaragua. Get Dropkick Murphys Tickets Here When asked what “message” he’s trying to send, Casey replied, “my point is that this is a class war, not a political war. We are being tricked to fight amongst each other so that the ultra wealthy can milk us of everything we have.” The pro-union vocalist also clarified that he’s not necessarily trying to have these political moments. “I never plan to say anything,” he explained. “Some nights I’m worried about just trying to remember the lyrics — I gotta do my job first.” Nevertheless, he feels a duty to be vocal against injustice. “ I want to be remembered as the band that spoke out, whether it benefits or hurts us,” he said. “And now, as we put ourselves more in the crosshairs speaking out, I feel like more people on the left are like, ‘We gotta support this band,’ which is nice, but I don’t really care. It’s who we are and what we do.” Dropkick Murphys also have a long history of being pro-immigrant, which Casey reaffirmed. “The way I was taught is, if your family were immigrants to this country and came for a better life, the price you pay for that is you can never say that ‘no one else is welcome,’” he said. “That is what America was built on.” As for the Trump-loyalists and naysayers, Casey said, “Someone who is a Trump fan will say I’m dividing people. I say, ‘My words are dividing people? No. I’m not the one that’s doing all these horrible policies. I’m just speaking up.’” Concluding, Casey admitted that he is “terrified” about the future of the country. “I’ll be alright, but I worry about my kids,” he said. “I think a lot of people just assume, if you look back through history in America, good always comes out on top. But you can’t just assume that we’ll suffer through these four years and he’ll be gone. There might not be another election. That’s the way I look at it.” Meanwhile, the band just wrapped their four-show residency in Boston for St. Patrick’s Day. Up next, they’ll hit the road again in the summer for a number of co-headlining tour dates with Bad Religion. Get tickets here.
