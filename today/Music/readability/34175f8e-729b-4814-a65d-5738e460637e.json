As for why they chose to reunite, Duet revealed to the Tales From The Riff Podcast that it had a lot to do with the death of live keyboardist Tomas Viator in 2024. \"What happened was 'Sick New World' contacted, my… well, Goatwhore booking agent, Dan Rozenblum, and was like, 'So what would it take to make this happen?' And we had recently had a passing of a very good friend of ours that was playing keyboards for us on the Pagan Terrorism Tactics tour. \"His name was Tommy Viator — better known as Tomas. And I think that had a big role to play in the situation, to where, you know, a lot of us aren't going to be around forever, right? \"So… I had spoken to Dax about this, when we were talking about getting it back together, and I was like, you know, we need to do this before… I didn't put it that way, but I just kind of hinted. And he was like, 'maybe it's time.' And that's how this whole thing kind of came into play.\" Want More Metal?
