  "text": "Lucy Dacus has confirmed rumors of a romantic relationship with her boygenius bandmate Julien Baker. In a recent New Yorker profile about Dacus’ upcoming album, Forever Is a Feeling, journalist Amanda Petrusich plainly states the musicians are in a “committed relationship.” Get Lucy Dacus Tickets Here Dacus said that while fans have mostly respected their wishes to keep the relationship private, “it only takes a handful to make your life feel like a really easily threatened thing.” She added, “I’ve been practicing not reinforcing that narrative to myself.” However, Dacus’ love life is still a focus of her forthcoming project. “It’s been interesting, because I want to protect what is precious in my life, but also to be honest, and make art that’s true,” she said. “I think maybe a part of it is just trusting that it’s not at risk.” She continued, “Maybe a healthier way to think about it is that it’s not actually fragile. These songs are about different people. But, you know, ‘Most Wanted Man in West Tennessee’ — what are you gonna do?” A clear reference to Baker’s upbringing in the Memphis area, “Most Wanted Man” features lyrics about their new love: “Now I feel your hand under the table, at the fancy restaurant/ Gripping on my inner thigh, like if you don’t I’m gonna run/ But I’m not going anywhere, least not anywhere you’re not.” Forever Is a Feeling is out on March 28th (pre-order here), while Baker has a collaborative album with TORRES titled Send a Prayer My Way (pre-order here) coming on April 18th. The couple will be apart while touring behind their respective releases. Baker kicks off her US tour (get tickets here) in late March, while Dacus’ trek (get tickets here) begins on April 16th.",
