  "text": "Midnight is back with a new record Steel, Rust And Disgust due out May 23, and a new single \"Cleveland Metal\" streaming right now. The song comes alongside a music video by My Good Eye Visuals, which finds Midnight bringing a scythe into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall Of Fame. It's pretty metal… Cleveland metal. Pre-orders are available here. The full album is mostly covers and consists of the following tracks: Cleveland Metal Iron Beast (Kratos cover) I'm Insane (Synastryche cover) Final Solution (Rocket From The Tombs cover) Frenzy (Screamin' Jay Hawkins cover) Child Eaters (Rubber City Rebels cover) 3rd Generation Nation (Dead Boys cover) Rock N' Roll Fever (David Allan Coe cover) Carrions Keep (False Hope cover) Black Leather Rock (Electric Eels cover) Steel, Rust And Disgust Agitated (Electric Eels cover) \"The idea to record an album of all cover jams with a certain theme is nothing quite new,\" said Midnight's Athenar. \"The original title for this album was gonna be Throw Ups as an homage to the David Bowie's Pin Ups album, also of covers. Although Throw Ups is only two syllables, and I need six. I guess I could've called it Throw Downs Throw Outs Throw Ups, but that would just be fucking stupid. \"I just wanted to record some songs by bands who shared the same sights, sounds, and sewage of my region of birth. Some of these tunes you may have heard, some you may have not. So please, do yourself a favor and check out the original versions… if you want to transform into a total fucking slimebag that is!\" Want More Metal?
