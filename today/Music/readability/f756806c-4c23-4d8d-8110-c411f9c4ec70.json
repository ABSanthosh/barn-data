  "text": "Weezer didn’t let a recent headline-making incident stop them from delivering a stellar performance at the Coachella festival on Saturday (April 12th). The Los Angeles band, who were a last-minute addition to the fest, played a 12-song set of fan favorites and a cover of a Metallica classic. It was only a few days ago when bassist Scott Shriner’s wife, Jillian Lauren, was shot by police and subsequently arrested for attempted murder in a bizarre case that involved a manhunt for three individuals involved in a high speed chase that ended up with one of the suspects on the couple’s property. Get Weezer Tickets Here Despite the high-profile incident, Shriner and Weezer forged ahead with their Coachella appearance on the Mojave stage, and fans were treated to a set that spotlighted the band’s multiplatinum self-titled debut, also known as “The Blue Album.” In fact, Weezer played five songs from the 1994 LP, including the set-opener “My Name Is Jonas,” along with “Undone – The Sweater Song,” “Surf Wax America,” “Say It Ain’t So,” and the set-closer, “Buddy Holly.” The band had a little fun during the dialogue intro of “Undone – The Sweater Song,” with guitarist Brian Bell making it all about Coachella, including mention of an after-party in Green Day’s dressing room. They also switched up the lyrics to “Beverly Hills,” shouting, “Living in Coachella, California.” It’s no secret that frontman Rivers Cuomo was a metalhead growing up, and he showed his love for Metallica when Weezer covered “Enter Sandman” 10 songs into the set, eliciting a massive sing-along from the crowd. Cuomo played a blistering solo during the Metallica cover, even working in a little taste of “Buddy Holly.” Weezer will play a handful of US festivals in May, followed by a few more in the fall (with tickets available here). They’ll also hit the UK and Europe for a number of festivals and headlining shows beginning in June.
