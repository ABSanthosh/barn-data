  "text": "Omnium Gatherum is rejoined by former guitarist Joonas Koto on stage, as their usual live guitarist Nick Cordle has stepped down to focus on other projects. Koto originally played with Omnium Gatherum live between 2010 and 2011, and then joined the band full time between 2011 and 2019. \"Hello Omnium Gatherum alleycats!\" wrote Omnium Gatherum in a post. \"We're excited about starting the European tour today in London, and everyone's ready for tonight's show @ Heaven with Insomnium! \"As you might have noticed in our previous updates, Joonas 'Jope' Koto will be joining us on this tour and it's great to have the old gang back on the road again. At the same time it means Nick Cordle won't be on stage with us, meaning not now nor in the future, as he will focus on his new own musical adventures from this on.\" \"We want to thank Nick for these years in Omnium Gatherum and wish him all the best luck in the future. We will surely meet at some festival backstage sooner than we can think and will raise a glass. See you all on the road, come and say hi and let's celebrate Beyond album around Europe! Cordle added: \"Happy new year! I wish for everyone's 2025 to be full of new adventures and especially new music (as mine will be!), and I wish Jope and the gang all the best times on their tour.\" Omnium Gatherum and Insomnium are currently on tour throughout Europe with Hinayana.
