  "text": "Danish rockers Volbeat paid powerful tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne on Tuesday night, July 22 by opening their set with a searing cover of Black Sabbath's classic \"Children Of The Grave.\" The performance took place at the Cascades Amphitheater in Ridgefield, WA — just hours after news broke of Osbourne's death at the age of 76. The emotionally charged rendition served as an immediate nod to the monumental impact Ozzy had on the world of heavy music. With Black Sabbath widely credited as the godfathers of heavy metal, and Ozzy as its most iconic voice, the loss was deeply felt across the rock community — and Volbeat wasted no time in paying their respects onstage. Footage of the tribute has since surfaced online, capturing the moment Volbeat lit up the Ridgefield stage with Sabbath's thunderous, groove-driven anthem. It's a performance that both celebrated Ozzy's enduring legacy and channeled the energy and darkness he helped define for generations. And frankly, it's pretty damn impressive they pulled it off on such short notice. Want More Metal?
