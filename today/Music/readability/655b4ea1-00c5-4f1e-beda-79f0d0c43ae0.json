  "text": "For Airbnb’s latest edition of their new “Icons” line of movie-themed vacation homes, you can now make like Beetlejuice and haunt the eerie home of Delia Deetz from the eponymous film. Located in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, the listing (which was posted by the fictional Deetz) showcases a series of rooms that painstakingly recreate various scenes from Tim Burton’s 1988 classic. Patrons will gaze upon Deetz’s art, take a trip to the afterlife, and meet characters from the film. There are also interactive activities, including “the first-ever art class from beyond the grave” and a feast of “avant-garde bites.” Check out the full details of the listing here. Despite all of the enticingly spooky attractions, fans are unfortunately not able to spend the night at the exhibit. Instead, guests will stay at a nearby location. Those looking to attend can request a booking via the Airbnb app. Requests are free and will stay open until November 5th. The Beetlejuice edition of “Icons” is just the latest pop-culture project from Airbnb. Previously, they recreated the floating house from Up, the “X Mansion” from the Marvel Animation series X-Men ’97, and Prince’s home from Purple Rain. Additionally, precursor iterations of the series featured Shrek’s Swamp, the mansion from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, the pub from Ted Lasso, and even the world’s last Blockbuster video store. Notably, third-party celebrity-focused listings have popped up on the service as well, including the American Football house, an early Beatles venue, and Jeff Buckley’s Memphis home. Revisit our review of Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, which Senior Entertainment Editor Liz Shannon Miller called “a less scary, more silly sequel.” Also, in case you can’t get enough of the spooky spirit, check out our recent list of 20 Best Family-Friendly Halloween Movies.",
