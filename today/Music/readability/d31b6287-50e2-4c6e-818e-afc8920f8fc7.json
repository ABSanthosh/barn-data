  "text": "If anyone's metal band needs a bassist, maybe you ought to call Taylor Swift's master of the low end Amos Heller. In a new video from bass company Dingwall, Heller shows off his stellar bass chops by ripping through Dream Theater's classic Awake track \"Caught In A Web\". Which I guess isn't too surprising, considering he's a professional bassist operating in arguably one of the biggest touring acts in the entire world. It's just cool to see the guy is also a metal fan. Speaking of Heller and his mastery of bass, you really should check out his bass-centric cover of Metallica's \"Blackened\" below as well. It's an absolute fucking ripper that would put a smile on Lars Ulrich's face… if he didn't turn the volume on this, too. Want More Metal?
