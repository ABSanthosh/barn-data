  "text": "Evanescence has teamed up with Netflix's Devil May Cry series for their brand new single \"Afterlife\". The single is out on March 28 on all streaming services, and is somehow tied into the Devil May Cry show… which I guess isn't surprising given its nü-metal leanings by including Limp Bizkit's \"Rollin'\" as the theme song and Papa Roach's \"Last Resort\" in a recent trailer. Devil May Cry is based on the video game series of the same name developed by Capcom and created by Hideki Kamiya, while the show itself was created by Adi Shankar and produced by Studio Mir. Devil May Cry is set to begin streaming on April 3 on Netflix. As far as a show description, Nexflix has described it as such: \"Sinister forces are at play at the portal between the human and demon realms. In the middle of it all is Dante, an orphaned demon hunter for hire, unaware that the fate of both worlds hangs around his neck.\" Want More Metal?
