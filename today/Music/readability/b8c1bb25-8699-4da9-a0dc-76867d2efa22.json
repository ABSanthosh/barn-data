  "text": "One of the most delightfully strange movies from the 2024 Sundance Film Festival is about to make its theatrical debut this January. And the first trailer for Love Me, a millennia-spanning romance starring Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun, captures a portion of that delightful strangeness. Love Me begins well after the extinction of humanity, when a technologically advanced buoy (played by Stewart) makes virtual contact with a satellite orbiting the planet that contains all of humanity’s knowledge (Yeun). Eventually, the buoy and satellite learn to connect more intimately, as we learn that while humanity might be gone, its legacy still lives on. Our full review of Love Me can be read here. Also, check out the capsule reviews of every movie we watched from last year’s Sundance Film Festival. Stewart’s next announced project is the trippy-sounding vampire drama Flesh of the Gods, alongside Oscar Isaac. Yeun, meanwhile, will also appear in Bong Joon-ho’s highly-anticipated Mickey 17, starring Robert Pattinson. Check out the full trailer for Love Me, directed by Sam Zuchero and Andy Zuchero, below. The movie arrives in theaters on January 31st, 2025.",
