  "text": "Amongst the thousands of people who have lost their homes during the devastating Los Angeles wildfires this January, there are many familiar faces. This includes Carel Struycken, whose iconic presence has featured in numerous films and TV shows over the past several decades, including Barry Sonnenfeld’s Addams Family films and Twin Peaks, in which he played first The Giant, and then (in The Return) The Fireman. Struycken may also be familiar from key roles in Men in Black, Gerald’s Game, Doctor Sleep, The Witches of Eastwick, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. The 76-year-old actor and his wife, who resided in Altadena, lost everything after the Eaton Fire burned through their neighborhood. Their son-in-law, Michael Anspach, has launched a GoFundMe to help support the family. “We’re so very thankful they were able to safely escape the oncoming blaze, but like so many others, they lost everything to the Eaton Fire. Please keep Carel, Tracey, and all those affected by the fires in your thoughts and prayers,” Anspach writes. While the full impact of this disaster is as yet unclear, organizations and individuals across the country have mobilized to help those who have been affected. Just a few of those efforts: Metallica’s All Within My Hands Foundation is donating $500,000 to relief efforts, while Guitar Center has created a special grant program that will allow musicians to replace instruments that were destroyed. Consequence has launched a special “All for LA” edition of our Protect Live Music t-shirts. 100% of proceeds will go to MusiCares’ Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort. You can find additional ways to support and donate here.",
