  "text": "Editor's Note: EDM.com proudly publishes four installments of annual year-end coverage: Industry Leaders, Performances \u0026 DJ Sets, Music Producers and Songs.More often than not, year-end coverage published by the music industry's vast pool of media outlets is limited to its artists and performers.To honor the extraordinary work of the industry's unsung people and brands, EDM.com annually recognizes a group of leaders whose contributions redefined dancefloors and helped shape the future of electronic dance music.Record Label: Experts OnlyForged in the crucible of a late-2023 rebrand, John Summit's Experts Only imprint emerged with a clarity of vision that few could match this year.From releases like Max Styler's \"Lights Out\" and Chris Avantgarde and Kevin de Vries' \"Killa,\" the label was a primary driver of the conversation about the ever-evolving boundaries of tech house music. Summit's own debut album, Comfort In Chaos, arrived mid-year as a tour de force of emotion and experimentation, bolstered by standout remixes like Cassian's stunning take on \"Shiver\" and YDG's transformative remix of \"Go Back.\"The label's ambitions also extended far beyond its music, with the Experts Only Ski Weekender in Vail curating a groundbreaking fusion of slope-side adventures and dancefloors. Inspired by Summit's own passion for skiing, the event brought the label’s ethos to life: bold, unflinching and deeply connected to its audience.In one short year, Experts Only emerged as a creative force that respects the roots of house music while fearlessly carving out its own future, setting a high bar for what it means to lead with vision and purpose.Words by Cameron Sunkel.Honorable Mentions: Memory Palace | HypnoVizion | Defected RecordsExperts OnlyClub: Club SpaceA cornerstone of global club culture, Miami's Club Space isn't an ordinary venue—it's a rite of passage.In 2024, the venue's ethos of \"the party never ends\" was tested and proven when it closed for three months of structural renovations. Even in its absence, the Space legacy loomed large as Factory Town held down the scene while fans restlessly waited. When the fall finally arrived, Space's reopening party, headlined by Peggy Gou, reminded us why this 2,000-capacity spot holds an outsized influence in the dance music community.From a marathon 36-hour Miami Music Week closing party featuring Carlita, Marco Carola and more to a 24-hour Art Basel closing party with 23 DJs from 13 countries, Space was a seedbed of club culture. The venue isn't just about major festival weekends—it snaps into action for cultural events like Formula One Race Week, when Black Coffee and MEDUZA dazzled behind the decks. Now, Tiësto is primed for a rare \"Sunrise\" set in January 2025.Club Space's significance transcends its size, earning its place as a destination where DJs from around the globe gather to create something extraordinary. And in 2024, its organizers continued to live up to their prevailing tenet: whether it's 3am, sunrise or mid-morning, they've got your back.Words by Cameron Sunkel.Honorable Mentions: Cloud 9 Fiji | Ushuaïa Ibiza | DrumshedsMusic Company: Vita MotusFor the idealistic minds behind the producers of music festivals, one question often gnaws like a spider in the brain: can a stage be more than just a platform? For Vita Motus, the design studio behind Coachella's groundbreaking Quasar stage, it's a resounding \"yes.\"Led by its ambitious founder and CEO, Heather Shaw, Vita Motus has executed phantasmagoric stages for EDC, Electric Forest and Lightning in a Bottle, among other major festivals. But she found herself in a three-month pressure cooker ahead of Coachella, where the studio was tasked with building a universe unto itself.The stage's monolithic LED walls, Shaw told EDM.com back in April, were designed \"to push the boundaries of what's possible at music festivals.\" Her team ultimately delivered, establishing a bastion of iconoclastic festival design within Coachella's hallowed desert metropolis.The stage became the epicenter of EDM at the nation's most iconic music festival, which in 2024 teemed with unforgettable rave moments. Fans willingly plunged into the rabbit holes of innovative three-hour DJ sets by RÜFÜS DU SOL and a cancer-free Michael Bibi, among other influential electronic acts. Eric Prydz and Anyma, two of the industry's most subversive creators of visual displays, also performed together for the first time as the sun set.To that end, Quasar dissolved the boundaries between electronic music and performative spectacle, reimagining the inert concert stage as a living, breathing organism.Words by Jason Heffler.Honorable Mentions: End Overdose | Playtime Engineering | WavMakerThe Quasar stage at the 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Julian BajselMusic Executive: Cindy CharlesCindy Charles didn’t just change how we hear electronic dance music this year. She changed how we feel it—both together and apart.Charles tragically died in October following a traffic accident during the Amsterdam Dance Event, the world's leading electronic music summit. But before we lost Twitch's trailblazing Head of Music, she led the development of the platform's pioneering DJ category, a breakthrough that established it as the first to provide a long-term home for DJs to legally livestream.Charles, a visionary agent of change in the intersection of music and technology, redefined how artists and creators engage with audiences online. She remains revered for leading Twitch's label relations and music licensing operations, fostering an ecosystem that enables DJs to build fanbases and achieve financial freedom on the platform.In addition to fiercely championing rave culture, Charles was also an unshakeable advocate for women in the music industry. She co-founded the San Francisco chapter of She Is The Music as well as Women In Digital, a community of over 1,500 members with a mission \"to help women define a limitless future for all by shining a light on careers in digital and technology.\"Words by Jason Heffler.Honorable Mentions: Christine Thomas (Dolby) | Adam Russakoff (Ultra Worldwide) | Jeff Abel (Excision Presents)Cindy Charles.TwitchEvent Organizer: Breakaway Music FestivalBreakaway didn't just host music festivals in 2024—it created destinations at scale.Breakaway lived up to its name in 2024, leaving competitors in its dust as it became the nation's preeminent traveling EDM festival. The event's organizers are now poised to expand to a bevy of new markets in 2025, swelling to a staggering 12 cities.That kind of growth was a white whale for independent festivals in 2024, a time when inflationary pressures hiked operating costs to prohibitive levels. Nevertheless, Breakaway managed to become the fastest-growing music festival brand in the country, due in part to their knack for blending high-profile headliners with undiscovered talent in lineups that felt both elite and accessible, a rare feat in a crowded market.Breakaway's influence, however, is greater than the sum of its dozen parts. The brand supercharged its sustainability efforts by partnering with Zero Waste Event Productions, a leading provider of recycling, composting and waste management services, to divert from landfills over 25,000 pounds of recyclable materials, including harmful plastics.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesBreakaway's proprietors also recently announced that all of their 2025 festivals will accept cryptocurrency as payment, mirroring its ethos of progress and inclusivity to foster a new kind of freedom on and off the dancefloor. \"As the music industry continues to evolve, we’re committed to adapting to the needs of our fans and staying ahead of the curve,\" said co-founder and CEO Adam Lynn.Words by Jason Heffler.Honorable Mentions: DEF | House Calls | FIVE MusicBreakaway Music Festival.KURSZAVisual Artist: Tobias GremmlerTobias Gremmler's larger-than-life artistry was impossible to ignore in 2024, imbued with an almost intangible quality that connected deeply with Afterlife's broadening global audience.His work with Anyma on the superstar DJ's tour and sophomore album, Genesys II, transformed towering LED screens into portals, immersing fans in haunting spaces where the boundaries between performer and participant disintegrated. Blending Afterlife’s iconic dual themes of robotics and nature, Gremmler's awe-inspiring visual concepts captivated audiences in high-profile venues from Los Angeles to Miami to Amsterdam, threading an ineffable emotional connection amidst the grandeur of stadium-scale productions.Anticipation is now building for Anyma's historic Las Vegas Sphere New Year's Eve show and residency, \"The End of Genesys,\" which will see Gremmler's transhumanist visual designs envelop the record-breaking venue for its first-ever electronic music shows. His creative direction is ambitious by all accounts, and it's reshaping how we experience and engage with EDM's most transcendent performances.Words by Cameron Sunkel.Honorable Mentions: DR01D VISUALS | Wesley So | NeuriteYouTube Channel: Book Club RadioWhat do butterfly houses, Y2K vampires, frat parties, robot uprisings, Florida men, murder mysteries and 2010s EDM all have in common? They’re all themes for Book Club Radio’s epic parties—err, \"meetings\"—in 2024.Each theme is truly immersive: the DJs curate mixes to fit each, the crowds dress up for the part and the backdrops are filled with madcap props often hand-built by the Book Club Radio crew. The feverish fandom around their YouTube channel is a testament to the fresh perspective that the Brooklyn-based collective, founded by the inimitable Jojo Lorenzo, is bringing to dancefloors.Words by Saad Masood.Honorable Mentions: Flavour Trip | Tracklib | putyouon. by Steve CardiganAudio Engineer: A. G. CookWhen Charli xcx recorded her global hit \"360\" and said, \"You gon' jump if A. G. made it,\" she was sending a message.One of hyperpop's most influential producers, A. G. Cook has made a name for himself crafting music for international superstars like Beyoncé, Hikaru Utada and Caroline Polachek. While that pedigree is impressive in its own right, his brilliant work on Charli's viral sensation, Brat, may go down as his finest.Serving as an executive producer of Brat and vocal engineer of most of its tracks, Cook propelled his longtime collaborator's latest album not only to the top of the charts, but also to the lime green-colored pinnacle of pop culture. There would be no \"brat summer\" without him.Cook's work on Brat led the album to a staggering seven Grammy nominations, including Album Of The Year, Best Dance/Electronic Album, Record Of The Year (\"360\") and Best Pop Solo Performance (\"Apple\"). Words by Nick Yopko.Honorable Mentions: Cassian Stewart-Kasimba | Emily Lazar | Sonny MooreA. G. Cook.c/o PressArtist Management: MetatoneIn an impressive seven-year period, Metatone founders Holt Harmon and Parker Cohen have built an independent management powerhouse. And in 2024, the firm set new standards for driving success in the house music world.Their secret? A results-driven, holistic approach and wealth of resources that help DJs reach new audiences. Since bringing John Summit aboard during the company's formative years, Metatone has cultivated a formidable roster of producers that includes Max Styler, Ranger Trucco, Deeper Purpose and Layton Giordani.Its commitment to fostering both the wellness and creative freedom of its roster remains at the heart of its philosophy. Through the expansion of Metatone Media, the company provided its artists with tailored support in branding, touring logistics and content creation, empowering them to focus on crafting groundbreaking house music.And that they did. From Summit's stratospheric debut album Comfort in Chaos to Giordani's rare official remix of deadmau5's \"Strobe\" to Max Styler's prolific run of tech house hits, Metatone broke out this year. Its proprietors also worked diligently to position their artists at the cutting-edge, like when Summit sold out Madison Square Garden.Words by Mikala Lugen and Rachel Freeman.Honorable Mentions: 2+2 Management | Club Class | Kompass Music GroupJohn Summit, who is represented by Metatone, performing at Madison Square Garden.Alive CoverageMusic PR: Falcon PublicityIn just five years, Falcon Publicity has managed to become one of the leading forces in media relations within the mercurial world of electronic dance music. It's the brainchild of PR vet Alexandra Greenberg, whose decades of expertise have led her to acquire a remarkable roster of artists, brands and events in that short time.Influential electronic artists like deadmau5, Kraftwerk, Jean-Michel Jarre and Subtronics all call Falcon home. The firm had its talons on the pulse of dance music in 2024, executing a slew of innovative, high-profile campaigns that propelled it to the industry's corps d'elite.One was HAYLA, whose stentorian vocals dominated playlists and music festivals all year. After collaborating with John Summit, Kx5, Kygo and MEDUZA, the surging singer-songwriter broke out as a solo artist with the help of Greenberg, who ran press for her scintillating debut album, DUSK.And then there's techno superstar Anyma, who in 2024 announced he'd be the first electronic music artist to perform inside the record-breaking Las Vegas Sphere. What started out as a single New Year's Eve performance quickly snowballed into a historic DJ residency with enough audiovisual specs to change the fabric of Sin City raving—and Falcon is shaping the narrative.Words by Ulises Vargas.Honorable Mentions: Bampire | MP3 PR | JSloane CreativeFalcon Publicity founder and CEO Alex Greenberg.Lindsey Byrnes",
