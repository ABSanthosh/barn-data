  "text": "To paraphrase one of our most eloquent political commentators on behalf of one of our other most eloquent political commentators: Jon Smash! In the latest episode of The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart found himself so enraged by the news he was reporting that he smashed a mug that had been on the desk, cutting his hand to the point of bleeding. If you just want to watch Stewart destroy the mug, skip to the 17:00 minute mark below to see the carnage — followed by Stewart, ever the professional, slipping his right hand below the desk as soon as he realizes it’s bleeding, only acknowledging the injury with a quiet “I’ll be going to the hospital soon.” If you do skip forward, though, you’ll miss the reason why Stewart was so angry: In the segment, the host attempts to find areas of the United States budget where cuts might be possible, which brings him to a rant about the kinds of subsidies drug companies receive thanks to the past administration. You’ll also miss the reason why there was a mug on the desk: Before being smashed, it read “World’s Most Dad,” because Stewart was indulging in a little bit of Elon Musk cosplay. The “Most” refers to number of children Musk has, to be clear, not the degree to which he actively parents any of his children. Stewart will be continuing his part-time hosting role on The Daily Show for the rest of 2025. Given the way the year’s going, probably best to keep any other breakable objects off the desk for a while. Check out the clip from Monday’s show below.",
