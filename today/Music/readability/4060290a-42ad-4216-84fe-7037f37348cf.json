Explore See latest videos, charts and news Hot off the group’s Billboard 200 debut with their first full-length [Drip] splashed onto the charts in November, the stars tease a “vibrant setlist” featuring never-before-performed tracks from the LP alongside individual solo stages by members RUKA, PHARITA, ASA, AHYEON, RAMI, RORA, and CHIQUITA. Accompanied by a live band, the \u003cHELLO MONSTERS\u003e tour will rock major arenas like Los Angeles’ Kia Forum and the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ, to help cement their reputation as rising live-performance powerhouses. So far, BABYMONSTER has already wowed live audiences with standout appearances at K-pop award shows (a highlight of the year for RORA) and as special guests during dates of 2NE1‘s highly anticipated reunion tour across Asia (which “felt like a dream,” according to youngest member CHIQUITA). Billboard caught up with the monster rookies to learn about the creative process behind their tour, the group’s favorite moments and tracks from last year, and New Year’s greetings and messages for their loyal fans — adorably known as MONSTIEZ. Congratulations on announcing your first-ever world tour! What does it mean to you as a group that your first U.S. shows will be at iconic arenas like the Kia Forum and Prudential Center?  RUKA: We are honored and thrilled to be able to hold our first U.S. shows at such iconic arenas. We promise to deliver amazing, unforgettable performances that you’ll cherish for a lifetime, so please look forward to them!  The name is really fun, how did you decide on the name for your world tour? Is there a message you wanted to convey? RAMI: \u003cHELLO MONSTERS\u003e was chosen with the idea of our first meeting with our fans in mind and the very first greeting we will share when we meet in person. We would like to extend a heartfelt first greeting through our music and performances. First meetings are always so exciting, which is why we are especially looking forward to the upcoming shows! This tour will be a chance for us to share our story with all of you and create special, unforgettable moments that will be cherished for years to come. CHIQUITA: For the first time ever, we’re unveiling performances from our first full-length album, [DRIP], including solo stages and a vibrant setlist. We can’t wait to showcase not only the unique charms of our seven members but also the incredible synergy we share together.   The tour begins in Seoul in late January. What songs are you looking forward to performing for the most? And what should U.S. fans expect from your shows? PHARITA: I’m so excited to perform songs we’ve never shared with our fans before! However, the song I always enjoy performing the most on stage is “BATTER UP (Remix)!” ASA: Our U.S. fans will get to experience our vibrant performances and high-energy stages. We hope to create special moments with music and performances that showcase our unique style. Additionally, we look forward to connecting more closely with MONSTIEZ and sharing unforgettable moments together! BABYMONSTER gained a lot of attention for the live “band” performances of your songs like “SHEESH” and “FOREVER.” I hope that means you’ll be touring with a live band in the U.S.?  AHYEON: We believe that a live band is the best way to capture the energy and atmosphere of the moment, so we’ve decided to perform every song with one! The rearrangements in each track will bring a fresh, new vibe while adding elements we hope you’ll find exciting and enjoyable. Beyond the concerts, what are you looking forward to doing or experiencing in the LA or NY areas?  RAMI: I want to stroll, shop, and enjoy delicious food at my leisure while soaking up the sun on the streets of LA. In NY, I definitely want to visit Times Square! Taking a step back, 2024 has been a monumental year for the group; what stands out as most memorable? RORA: It’s definitely hard to choose just one, as there have been so many memorable moments! However, the most unforgettable moment for me was performing at the year-end annual music festival. It is both the most recent and the most memorable. It was my first time performing on such a big stage, and everything — from the newly arranged songs and choreography, to the stage and outfits — was perfect, making it such a fun performance.  One of my personal highlights was seeing BABYMONSTER perform as guests on 2NE1’s comeback concerts. What was your experience alongside such icons?  CHIQUITA: It was such an honor and felt like a dream to perform on stage at the 2NE1 concerts — seniors I’ve admired since I was young! Watching their amazing performances inspired me to improve and strive to do even better on our own stages in the future.  BABYMONSTER won several new-artist awards this year and was named K-Pop Rookie of the Month at Billboard. What do these titles mean to you and what more would you like to show moving forward?  RUKA: As we’ve been given the “Monster Rookie” title, we’ll continue to work hard, strive to show our growth, and always present new and different sides of ourselves.  The start of the year is often a time for goal setting. What dreams do you have for 2025, whether as a group or as individuals? PHARITA: 2024 was filled with amazing opportunities and achievements. I’m so proud of all our members and I hope we continue to grow and stay healthy throughout our 2025 tour.  ASA: As a group, we hope to connect with more fans and share our music and performances with a wider audience on stages around the world. We also aim to continue challenging ourselves with new music styles and to showcase our growth. In 2025, we’ll work even harder to ensure we can share amazing moments together. Billboard always shares its staff picks for the best songs of the year. What were each of your favorite songs from 2024? RUKA: “Die With a Smile” by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars  PHARITA: “Good Graces” by Sabrina Carpenter  ASA: “POWER” by G-DRAGON  AHYEON: “Soft Spot” by keshi  RAMI: It would have to be “toxic till the end” by ROSÉ! It’s one of the songs I listen to every single day because I love the melody and style so much!  RORA: “BIRDS OF A FEATHER” by Billie Eilish  CHIQUITA: “BILLIONAIRE” by BABYMONSTER  Any other messages you’d like to share with international fans and Billboard readers? AHYEON: I hope everyone stays healthy and happy in the new year. We’ll work hard to make sure 2025 is a year where we can take another step forward and show even better versions of ourselves. Thank you, and wishing you all a happy new year. RORA: First of all, kudos to everyone for all the hard work and dedication you’ve shown throughout 2024 — you’ve all been amazing! 2024 has been especially meaningful for BABYMONSTER, as it marked the beginning of our journey. We’ve worked incredibly hard, given it our all, and gained so many valuable experiences. I’m truly grateful to everyone who has supported us, and as the years go by, we promise to become stronger and even more incredible artists. Last but not least, we’d like to express our deepest gratitude to all the Billboard readers who love and support BABYMONSTER. Thank you so much! Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
