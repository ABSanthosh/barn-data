  "text": "Cannibal Corpse guitarist Erik Rutan left the band's European tour a few weeks ago to get home and address the damages done to his Florida home by Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Rutan has now issued a very somber update, revealing that roughly 90% of everything he and his wife own has been destroyed. I'd say we wish Rutan and his family all the best at this time, but that feels like such a gross understatement. What Rutan and the rest of everyone down south is going through right now is nothing short of terribly tragic. \"We are so grateful for all the love and support that has come our way,\" wrote Rutan. \"The positive words, messages, texts and phone calls have meant so much to us. We feel so blessed to know that so many people care. Hurricane Helene and Milton decimated so many homes and lives and ours was one of them. \"90% of everything we own including personal and family belongings, photos, things that can never be replaced as well as musical and studio gear was either severely damaged or completely destroyed. This experience has been difficult beyond words. Almost 3 weeks ago I left the Cannibal Corpse tour to fly home to be with my Wife, only to see our home and all our belongings in ruin. \"This has been one of the most difficult times of our lives. Right now, we, as well as many are suffering beyond measure. We worked so hard our entire lives to achieve what we have only to see it all taken away in a fleeting moment. I have no idea how we will overcome all of this, but anyone that knows us knows that we will fight our way back through sheer will and determination to hopefully one day reclaim some kind of normalcy. \"As we try to pick up the pieces of our lives, please send all the positive strength and energy you can. I will give further updates when time allows. Eternal Gratitude. RUTAN\" Want More Metal?
