  "text": "Loss Becomes is now streaming their new single \"Broken Mirrors\" featuring the powerful vocals of Killswitch Engage frontman Jesse Leach. The single features a music video by Sean Ageman and riffs that'll tear your damn head off. \"This song is pretty much summed up as a conversation about OCD, something I've dealt with as far back as I can remember,\" said Loss Becomes vocalist Anthony Copozzi. \"So, the idea of 'bad luck' has always been a funny thing that I've both been afraid of and laughed at continuously.\" Copozzi continued: \"He's someone I've looked up to for many years and now I'm able to call him my friend. It's an honor and a privilege to work with someone that can challenge you and step up your game, while also helping craft your art into something bigger and better. What a dream come true.\" All we know outside the above is that \"Broken Mirrors\" will be included in Loss Becomes currently-unannounced new album. Want More Metal?
