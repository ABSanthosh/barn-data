  "text": "Goya – Phoenix purveyor of all things riff-based – has signed to Blues Funeral Recordings for the release of their fourth studio album In the Dawn of November this June 13. The album was recorded with legendary producer Jack Endino (High On Fire, Year of the Cobra, Soundgarden) at Soundhouse Studios in Seattle, WA, and you can get destroyed by the title track right now. \"The eight years since the last Goya record have brought me face to face with some hard truths about life,\" said Goya frontman Jeffrey Owens. \"I'm getting older, and mortality has struck me in new ways, so this album is largely a meditation on death. In the Dawn of November is the natural evolution of the band, and the culmination of everything that came before it, simultaneously signifying a new era for Goya.\" On the signing, Blues Funeral Recordings founder Jadd Shickler added: \"We are proud to welcome these Arizona desert doom stalwarts to the label with a new LP of crushing cosmic sludge! Goya has historically done almost everything themselves, and we're grateful for the trust they've shown by allowing us into their fortress to do what we do and help spread their monolithic riff-heaviness farther than ever before.\" Pre-order In the Dawn of November on Bandcamp, Bluesfuneral.com and SPKR shop.
