  "text": "PETA plans to protest an upcoming screening of Robert Eggers’ Nosferatu over the use of live rats in the film’s production and the suggestion that the rodents caused the bubonic plague. “A human is no more likely to be harmed or killed by a rat in real life than by a vampire, and false portrayals of these animals as harbingers of death deny viewers the chance to see them as the intelligent, social, and affectionate individuals they are,” PETA said in a statement. “The only ‘pests’ moviegoers need to be concerned with are directors who subject animals to the chaos and confusion of a film set, and PETA encourages everyone to see through these shameful stereotypes and give rats the respect they deserve.” In its statement, PETA further stressed that “rats form close bonds with their families and friends, enjoy playing and wrestling, and even giggle when tickled—and are less likely than dogs or cats to catch and transmit parasites and viruses.” PETA’s protest at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverley Hills will include a “giant rat” carrying a sign that reads, “Rats Have Rights! We Didn’t Cause the Plague!” Robert Eggers, who directed Nosferatu, previously revealed that 5,000 live rats were used in the production of the film. However, in an interview with Variety, production designer Craig Lathrop said that none of the rats were lost, explaining that, “We built these plexiglass barriers so that the live rats would be in a controlled area.” Nosferatu is a reimagining of the 1922 silent German horror classic, which itself is based on Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Starring Bill Skarsgård, Nicholas Hoult, Lily-Rose Depp, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Ralph Ineson, Simon McBurney, and Willem Dafoe, the film is set to open wide on December 25th, 2024.
