  "text": "Lamb of God's guitarist Mark Morton took a sharp left-turn from Lamb of God's signature metal sound and went for a blues and country solo record. Released this Friday, April 11th, Morton's solo record, Without The Pain, featured several guests, but only two were from the metal scene. The first guest appeared on the previously released cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"The Needle And The Spoon,\" where Clutch vocalist Neil Fallon featured on the song. The second metal guest to appear on the record was bassist and vocalist of Mastodon, Troy Sanders, on the song, \"Nocturnal Sun.\" You can check out the track below. Certainly rockier and moodier than the other tracks on the record, it's nice to see Mark Morton maintain some of his roots in Lamb of God within his solo work. Want More Metal?
