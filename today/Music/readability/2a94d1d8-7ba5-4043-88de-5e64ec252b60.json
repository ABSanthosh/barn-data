  "text": "Wednesday and MJ Lenderman have announced the reissue of a 2021 collaborative EP. The six-track, jointly-billed Guttering will be available on vinyl for the first time via Julia’s War Recordings, the same label that originally put it out on cassette as their first-ever release. It features the songs “Big Money” and “Phish Pepsi,” as well as a cover of Greg Sage’s “Sacrifice (For Love)” that later appeared on Karly Hartzman \u0026 co.’s 2022 covers record Mowing the Leaves Instead of Piling ’Em Up.“Sometimes, I’ll look back at a chance encounter or passing interaction years later and realize, ‘Wow, that event was the catalyst for all this change,’” Julia’s War label head Douglas Dulagrian said in a press statement. “I’m proud that this record was the first Julia’s War release four or five years ago. Crazy to think about that. And these days, all these years later, records like Guttering and many more have allowed the thing to grow into what it is today: a label of all my favorite bands, and it’s still just all my f*cking friends. Each release is this little chapter in the book of it all. And that little guy on the cover is the first page.”Guttering’s reissue is set to hit record store shelves on June 20. MJ Lenderman recently shared that he will no longer tour with Wednesday. He also put out a cover of “Dancing in the Club,” by This Is Lorelei, which will appear on a deluxe version of Nate Amos’ 2024 album Box for Buddy, Box for Star, and contributed a new song, “Bury the Dog,” to a benefit compilation for Asheville-based artists in the who were affected by Hurricane Helene. Wednesday’s last album, Rat Saw God, came out in 2023.Check out our Best New Track review of “Dancing in the Club (MJ Lenderman Version),” and read about Rat Saw God at No. 32 on “The 100 Best Albums of the 2020s So Far.”",
