  "text": "For decades, audio engineers have lived by Hofmann's Iron Law, the fun-killing principle that essentially says you can have deep bass or portability, but never both. It's like being told you can have either cheese or chocolate, when any reasonable person demands both.Enter Brane Audio's mind-boggling Brane X, which solves that problem with a technological apparatus that essentially gaslights the laws of physics. Founded in 2015 in Austin, Texas—because of course a company breaking audio rules would set up shop in the live music capital—the organization has been quietly plotting this sonic coup since the pandemic while its competitors were busy adding another 15 minutes of battery life or an even more confusing voice assistant. EDM.com visited Brane Audio's storefront in Austin to demo the Brane X, which the company claims is the \"first portable speaker with a true subwoofer built in.\" CEO Joe Pinkerton played music through speakers from a number of high-profile competitors, and it took no less than three seconds to hear the difference not only in bass, but in overall fidelity. It's one of those things you experience and instantaneously think, \"I need this now.\"Their subwoofer breakthrough represents one of the most significant commercial advancements in speaker technology in some time—no small claim in an industry that thrives on hyperbole. In fact, Pinkerton tells us, the Brane X delivers 10 times the bass of competing speakers that dwarf its size.The Brane X speaker from Brane Audio.Brane AudioIn this eternally crowded landscape of portable speakers, where incremental improvements masquerade as innovation, the sleek and unassuming Brane X is a genuine paradigm shift. The secret lies in what Brane calls its Repel-Attract Driver (RAD), which elegantly circumvents Hofmann's Iron Law, the long-standing acoustic principle that has forced speaker designers to choose between size, efficiency and bass response.Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesBy deploying a proprietary configuration of permanent magnets to neutralize internal air pressure forces, the Brane X can produce notes as low as 27Hz, territory previously accessible only to speakers approximately 35 times its size. For context, that's like having a concert subwoofer that fits in your tote bag—a solid value proposition at a $499 price point.What's perhaps most impressive about the Brane X is how it achieves this sonic sorcery without demanding the typical sacrifices. Battery life isn't compromised. Size remains manageable. It's waterproof. And your grandmother could figure out is connectivity right out of the box, not to mention Alexa is built in.Brane AudioDeveloped by a phalanx of renowned physicists and engineers, it's very much the real deal. Pinkerton studied applied physics at Columbia University before leaving to pursue entrepreneurship. In the early 1990s, he founded a tech company in Austin that developed a battery-free, energy-efficient backup power system, which he took public in 2000. After leading the firm for six years, he briefly retired before launching Clean Energy Labs, which went on to incubate Brane Audio.The company has now been issued seven patents, according to Pinkerton, who says the best is still yet to come. Brane is now developing a \"substantially more powerful\" speaker that delivers the same experience, but outside.\"This [Brane X] sounds great in a room, but we're working on something that—when you take it outside—sounds just like what you heard, but in the middle of a field. This thing scales to concert level speakers with the same advantages. Right now we've got about a tenfold advantage over everyone else, but our next product will be between 30 and 40x... And we've got a pretty good line to get to 100x.\"In an era where genuine innovation often feels like a marketing mirage, the Brane X reminds us that sometimes, the most impressive technology isn't another screen to stare at or app to download, but one that fundamentally transforms how we experience the things we love—or at least how we irritate our neighbors from much greater distances than previously possible.You can find out more about the Brane X here.",
