  "text": "Danzig is currently playing a handful of West Coast shows and for whatever reason, his merch line is kinda racist. Numerous Danzig fans have pointed out Danzig's use of the Sonnenrad – or Sunwheel, or Black Sun – on t-shirts and posters available at his shows. To quote the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) about the symbol, it's \"one of a number of ancient European symbols appropriated by the Nazis in their attempt to invent an idealized 'Aryan/Norse' heritage.\" And yeah I know, the Sunwheel pre-dates the Nazis and was appropriated for a shitty use. But it's the same thing as wearing a swastika and trying to say it's actually an ancient religious symbol – we all know what you're trying to do here. Danzig hasn't commented on the issue yet, and maybe he didn't know? Who knows who approved this, but still – it's not exactly a good look, and apparently the extreme right wing racists are already welcoming him as one of their own. So if Danzig truly didn't mean this, he might wanna get on commenting about the situation like… now. And if he truly did mean it, then that's a whole separate article with some very stronly worded language. The following photos are courtesy of Reddit. Want More Metal?
