  "text": "The upcoming Showtime prequel series Dexter: Original Sin, if nothing else, promises a return to Miami and murder, while never passing up an opportunity to remind viewers of the original show’s glory days. In this new trailer, we get a solid tease of Patrick Gibson taking on the younger version of serial-killer-for-good Dexter Morgan, along with Christian Slater explaining the purpose of the “code” that defines Dexter’s actions as a vigilante: “The code is to make sure that you are different from the people you kill.” Dexter: Original Sin is the second spin-off series launched to build off the popularity of Dexter, which was a ratings hit for Showtime during its original 2006-2013 run, and also received 24 Emmy nominations, including four nominations for Outstanding Drama Series. The show’s eighth season ended with a series finale that was considered underwhelming, leading to the eventual greenlight for Dexter: New Blood, a revival series that brought back Michael C. Hall as Dexter for what was meant to be one last hurrah… Until the Summer 2024 announcement that Hall would be returning for another series, Dexter: Resurrection. The trailer for Original Sin emphasizes that New Blood doesn’t just focus on a young Dexter, but also features younger versions of characters from the flagship series, including Slater as Dexter’s adoptive father Harry, Molly Brown as Dexter’s sister Debra, Christina Milian as Maria LaGuerta, James Martinez as Angel Batista, and Alex Shimizu as Vince Masuka. Also featured is Sarah Michelle Gellar as Tanya Martin, a forensics expert who becomes young Dexter’s boss. And like other prequel series like Young Sheldon and NCIS: Origins, Michael C. Hall doesn’t just narrate the trailer, but will provide voice-over for the series. Dexter: Original Sin first premieres December 13th, 2024 on Paramount+ with Showtime, before premiering on the Showtime cable channel on December 15th. Check out the trailer below.",
