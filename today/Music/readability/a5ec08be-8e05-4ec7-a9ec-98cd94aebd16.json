  "text": "The rapper 6ix9ine is back in federal custody. A court document shows that the musician was arrested for allegedly violating conditions of his supervised release. The violation was not specified in the document, but, at a hearing today (October 29), in New York, prosecutors explained that he was arrested after traveling to Las Vegas without permission, failing to go to a mandatory drug test, and testing positive for methamphetamine, according to ABC 7.The rapper reportedly explained that he went to Las Vegas to perform at a Grupo Firme concert, and that he thought he had told authorities about his travel plans. He also said that he tested positive for methamphetamine because he takes Adderall. His next hearing is scheduled for November 12.The musician 6ix9ine, who’s also known as Tekashi69 and whose legal name is Daniel Hernandez, was arrested, in November 2018, with other alleged Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods members on firearms and racketeering conspiracy charges. He initially pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, but famously reversed course by accepting a cooperation deal, pleading guilty, and testifying against his co-defendants. He was sentenced to two years in prison with five years of supervised release, but he was released from federal custody earlier than expected, near the start of the pandemic, due to health concerns.The rapper released an album, Dummy Boy, immediately following his arrest, in 2018, and he resumed his music career, upon his release from custody, with the single “Gooba.” His subsequent single, the Nicki Minaj collaboration “Trollz,” topped the charts. More tracks and projects have followed, but 6ix9ine has struggled to replicate his commercial success in recent years.Earlier this year, 6ix9ine was arrested in the Dominican Republic for domestic violence.",
