  "text": "After years of silence, Snot have officially entered the studio to record their first new material in over 25 years. The band is working with acclaimed producer Chris Collier (Korn, Prong), who's overseeing the sessions. These new tracks will mark the recorded debut of Andy Knapp, who joined the band as lead vocalist in 2024. Since then, Snot have been back on the road, tearing up stages and reclaiming their place in the heavy music world. In an update posted to their Instagram on July 13, the band shared: \"Snot has just entered the studio with producer, engineer, mixer Chris Collier @cmc21productions at the helm laying down tracks for two brand new songs which are set to be released late 2025 or early 2026.\" Snot originally exploded onto the scene in the late '90s with their unpredictable and high-energy sound. Their 1997 debut Get Some became a cult classic, showcasing the magnetic charisma of late frontman Lynn Strait. Tragically, Strait died in a car accident in December 1998 at just 30 years old – just as the band was preparing to record their second album. What followed was both heartbreaking and beautiful: in 2000, Snot released Strait Up, a tribute album featuring some of the biggest names in heavy music. Fred Durst, Jonathan Davis, Corey Taylor, Max Cavalera, and many more contributed vocals in honor of Strait's legacy. It remains one of the most emotionally charged and unique records to come out of the nü-metal movement. In the years since, Snot activity has been sporadic – brief reunions, one-off shows, and lineup shifts – but a full-scale comeback never fully materialized. That changed in 2025. With Andy Knapp on the mic, Snot officially returned, bringing their raw, chaotic energy back to the stage. Knapp may be a newcomer, but he's been killing it live, winning over longtime fans with ease. Now, with new music finally on the horizon, the comeback feels real. Founding bassist John \"Tumor\" Fahnestock recently teased a short snippet of what's to come on social media – and while it's just a taste, it sounds really promising. Crushing riffs, tight grooves, and that signature Snot bite. For fans who've waited decades, this is the moment. The band is aiming to release the new material in late 2025 or early 2026.
