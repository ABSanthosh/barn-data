  "text": "According to a report from TMZ, online personality and music journalist Matt Pinfield suffered a \"massive stroke\" earlier this month. The report notes that Pinfield's daughter Jessica has filed for a temporary conservatorship over Matt as she sorts out his finances and makes decisions on his health. No statement from anyone in the Pinfield family or their associate camps have issued a statement on Matt's health as of yet. Pinfield's presence in the rock and metal world has been extensive and well-documented over the past few decades. Pinfield hosted MTV's 120 Minutes alongside a slew of other specials on the channel in the '90s, and in 2001 becae the Vice President of A \u0026 R and Artist Development for Columbia Records. Pinfield later hosted VH1's VSpot Top 20 Countdown, has DJ'ed on SiriusXM Radio, and countless others. We wish Pinfield all the best at this time and hope the reports of his health are at the very least, exaggerated. Losing Matt Pinfield would be a major blow to the community. Want More Metal?
