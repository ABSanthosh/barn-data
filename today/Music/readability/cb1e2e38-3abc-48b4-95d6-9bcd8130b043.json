  "text": "HBO has apparently found its Dumbledore: John Lithgow is the choice to play the Hogwarts’ headmaster in the upcoming Harry Potter television series, according to Deadline. Professor Albus Dumbledore was portrayed by Richard Harris in the first two Harry Potter films. After Harris’ passing in 2002, Michael Gambon took over the role for the remaining six movies. Jude Law later played a younger version of the character in the Fantastic Beasts film series. Lithgow is the second known actor attached to the TV series; Paapa Essiedu is reportedly in talks to star as Professor Severus Snape. The Harry Potter TV series is described as a faithful adaptation of the book franchise featuring an entirely new cast. Each season will be tied to a specific book in the series, meaning the series will run seven seasons. Succession alum Francesca Gardiner has been tapped as showrunner, while Mark Mylod is attached to direct multiple episodes. The series is currently in pre-production. Meanwhile, despite publicly feuding with cast members of the film franchise over her anti-trans views, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling is “very involved” in the development of the television series.",
