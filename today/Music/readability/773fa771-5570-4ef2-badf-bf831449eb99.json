  "text": "Glastonbury Festival has announced its 2025 lineup. The 1975, Neil Young and the Chrome Hearts, and Olivia Rodrigo will headline this year’s event in Somerset, marking Young’s first time claiming the top spot since 2009 and both the 1975 and Rodrigo’s headliner debut on the main stage. Rod Stewart claims the Sunday afternoon “legends” slot, with Charli XCX, the Prodigy, and Loyle Carner headlining the Other Stage. Elsewhere on the bill are Alanis Morissette, Doechii, Noah Kahan, Raye, Biffy Clyro, and Nile Rodgers \u0026 Chic. The soldout festival takes place from June 25 to 29. Check out the poster below.Others on the British lineup include Deftones, Busta Rhymes, Wet Leg, Four Tet, John Fogerty, Amyl and the Sniffers, TV on the Radio, Gracie Abrams, Anohni and the Johnsons, Maribou State, Wolf Alice, Fatboy Slim, Turnstile, Beth Gibbons, Ezra Collective, Father John Misty, Japanese Breakfast, Amaarae, Faye Webster, Beabadoobee, Caribou, Scissor Sisters, Weezer, Floating Points, Osees, St. Vincent, Jorja Smith, Overmono, the Libertines, Future Islands, Celeste, Girl in Red, Kae Tempest, and many more. Last year’s headliners were SZA, Coldplay, and Dua Lipa.At the start of the year, Young almost pulled out of Glastonbury, claiming that the BBC—the government-owned broadcasting company that airs some of the festival—was exerting “corporate control” over the sponsorship-free, nonprofit festival. Less than 24 hours later, he backtracked his statement, blaming “an error in the information received,” and confirmed he and his band would be performing after all.",
