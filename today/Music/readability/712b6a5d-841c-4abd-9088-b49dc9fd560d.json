  "text": "It’s been seven years since A Perfect Circle last released an album, 2018’s Eat the Elephant, but guitarist Billy Howerdel and singer Maynard James Keenan say that a new album could be on the way. In a new retrospective interview with Revolver looking back at 25 years of A Perfect Circle, both Howerdel and Keenan addressed the potential for a new album. Get A Perfect Circle Tickets Here Howerdel, who composes most of the band’s music, disclosed that he’s been working on new songs that could end up on the next APC album. “As I’m writing, sometimes I find myself [thinking], ‘Wow, I really like this, but man, this is fucking sinister,’” said the guitarist. “I’m in a not-sleeping-much and self-discovery mode. When I’m writing music, I’ve been full night-terror, waking up — like, can’t-let-your-mind-rest thing.” Keenan added that he’s constantly writing music for all three of his bands, including APC, Tool and Puscifer, noting, “I’m always writing. I’m writing with everyone,” while specifically referring to Tool when he remarked, “And if I can get the other guys to dig in, there’s always that.” The singer continued, “I’m sure that Billy’s got a folder of fun stuff for me to dig through. It’s all about timing.” Elsewhere in the interview, Howerdel looked back at A Perfect Circle’s evolving lineup over the years, including the departure of original bassist Paz Lenchantin. “It was such a high, and then it just sort of fell apart,” the guitarist recalled of her exit from the band. “She kind of musically broke up with me that day. I think she wanted to contribute more in the writing, which maybe I was holding close to my chest still.” A Perfect Circle are in the midst of the “Sessanta V2.0 Tour” with Puscifer and Primus. The outing runs through a June 7th gig in Auburn, Washington, with tickets to the remaining shows available here. Last year, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer, and Primus each released a new song on the Sessanta E.P.P.P., with APC’s contribution being the track “Kindred.”",
