  "text": "Exodus recently split with longtime vocalist Steve \"Zetro\" Souza and announced their reunion with frontman Rob Dukes. At the time, Exodus issued a statement saying they had simply parted ways with Souza and that they wished him all the best. \"Announcement! Exodus have parted ways with Steve 'Zetro' Souza,\" wrote Exodus on their Instagram at the time. \"We thank Steve for his years fronting the band and all the killer music we made during that time. We wish him only the best in the future and much success with anything he does. \"And please help us welcome Rob Dukes back to Exodus! We are beyond stoked to have Rob back ripping up the stage with us and he's looking forward to crushing everything like only he can. Next chapter begins, new record rolls along as planned and the beatings will continue.\" While Souza hasn't issued any lengthy statement on the split, he did respond to a few comments on Instagram saying he was fired. When asked why he never issued a statement by one fan, Souza responded (via Blabbermouth): \"Really no statement, I was let go, if you read the [band's official] statement it says Exodus has parted ways, not Zetro has parted ways!\" Souza responded to another fan asking a similar question, saying: \"I did not leave, I was let go!! Exodus parted ways with Zetro.\" Souza had a few stints with Exodus over the years between 1986 and 1993, from 2002 to 2004, and then again from 2014 to present day. Dukes fronted Exodus in Souza's absence between 2005 and 2014, and sang on Exodus' albums from Shovel Headed Kill Machine in 2005 to Exhibit B: The Human Condition in 2010. Exodus is set to celebrate 40 years of their debut album Bonded By Blood this April with two Bay Area shows; The shows feature Death Angel and Nukem as the openers for both nights, with Blind Illusion as a guest on the first night and Hirax on the second night. Those two dates are: 4/25 Berkeley, CA UC Theatre4/26 Anaheim, CA House of Blues Want More Metal?
