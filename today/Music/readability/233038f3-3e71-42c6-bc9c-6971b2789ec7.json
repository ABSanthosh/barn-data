The performance video shows the two musicians harmonizing on the chorus of “The A Team.” “Been a fan of Olivia’s since Drivers License blew my mind back at the start of 2021,” he wrote. “Both albums are no skips for me, I’m a proper fan. We first met at the rock and roll hall of fame back in 2022, sat next to each other with her mum and my dad and went on to hang and keep in touch from there.” Trending on Billboard Of his Friday night plans, Sheeran said, “Was gonna go watch the show anyway but she hit me and asked to sing The A Team with her, which was such a buzz. That song turns 15 this year, and I remember playing it to rooms with no one in it in 2010, so to still be playing it to new fans with one of the brightest stars of the next generation is an honour and a privilege. Rock Glasto headline Sunday @oliviarodrigo , UK loves you x.” “you are the best ever ed!!! appreciate you so much. last night was a blast,” Rodrigo commented on the post Saturday morning. Also spotted at Rodrigo’s Friday gig was a smiling Sabrina Carpenter who enjoyed the show from the balcony, as seen in photos published by the Daily Mail. “The A Team,” first released in 2011, was Sheeran’s first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 16 in 2012. Following Rodrigo’s concert, on Saturday Sheeran posted another treat for fans on TikTok: a short mashup of his “Perfect” with Rodrigo’s “Happier,” sung together. Sheeran previously praised Rodrigo’s 2021 breakthrough hit, “Drivers License,” as a flawless debut single, and noted both her debut and sophomore full-length albums, Sour and Guts, are “unskippable… it’s just, as a record, just a great record.” Watch the Rodrigo-Sheeran performance clips courtesy of Ed’s social media pages below.
