  "text": "Black Sabbath fans were quick to rejoice at the news of a reunion – now, not so much. Ozzy Osbourne recently confirmed on Ozzy Speaks, his SiriusXM talkshow, that he wasn't \"planning on doing a set with Black Sabbath.\" Granted, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2020, so he isn't exactly physically able to perform to his fullest extent. It was, however – in some fans' eyes – marketed as a Black Sabbath show. Not just \"bits and pieces.\" So, not only was the ticket buying process a free for all – with BBC reporting that some consumers got stuck behind over 60,000 people in a virtual queue and others paid over £1,000 ($1,259.50) for only two tickets – but now, those who bought tickets under the guise of the show being a full Black Sabbath reunion are out at least £200 ($251.90). Which, by the way, was the cheapest option available. Before fees. Yes, Ozzy Osbourne does have a disorder that affects his nervous system, and he's 76, so it only makes sense that he is \"doing what [he] can, where [he] feels comfortable.\" However – the show was seemingly promoted as a Black Sabbath show. Besides, it's not just Black Sabbath that will be performing at Ozzy Osbourne's Back To The Beginning show. Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God and more will also be in attendance, so even if there is only a \"little bit\" of Black Sabbath, there are plenty of other artists to enjoy. The show is for a good cause as well – Aston Villa's Acorn Children's Hospital, Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Cure Parkinson's will receive donations from the proceeds. Want More Metal?
