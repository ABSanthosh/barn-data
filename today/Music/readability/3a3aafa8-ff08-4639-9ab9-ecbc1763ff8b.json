  "text": "Morgan Wallen walked off the ‘SNL’ set early, which stirred memes and debates online as to why he left and around his cryptic post of “Get me to God’s Country.” ‘SNL’ cast members Kenan Thompson responded to his walk-off. Keep watching for all the updates on Morgan Wallen’s abrupt departure. What do you think of Morgan Wallen walking off? Let us know in the comments. Tetris Kelly: Morgan Wallen walked off the SNL set early and then posted “Get me to God’s Country,” which started a flurry of online debate and memes. Some SNL cast members have spoken out, with Morgan finally chiming in. We have the story. Saturday Night Live’s host or musical guest usually stays on stage during the credits, but the country star abruptly left, noticeably causing some confusion. Then, after that, posting “Get me to God’s Country” had the internet and NYC in a tizzy. One user stated: “Sorry, but there’s nothing funnier than saying ‘Get me to God’s Country’ on a photo of your private jet.” While another user zinged: “Morgan Wallen had to run off the stage at SNL to get back to ‘God’s Country,’ where you can apparently say the N-word and throw chairs off of tall buildings with absolutely no meaningful consequences,” referencing some of his past controversies. Meanwhile, some just showed their version of God’s Country, including the Empire State Building. SNL cast member Kenan Thompson has spoken up, saying: “We’re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody’s saying, ‘Good job, good job, good job.’ So when there’s a departure from that, it’s like, hmm, I wonder what that’s about? Seems like a complicated individual, I guess. The ‘God’s Country’ of it all is strange because it’s like, what are you trying to say? You trying to say that we are not in God’s Country? We’re not all under God’s umbrella? That’s not necessarily my favorite.” Keep watching for more.",
