  "text": "Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe has blasted Elon Musk in a new social media post, calling the tech billionaire President Trump’s “ketamine-fueled pet rocket monkey.” The metal singer spoke out after seeing Musk give what appeared to be a Nazi salute (twice!) at Trump’s post-inauguration celebration at the Capitol One Arena in Washington, D.C. on Monday. Get Randy Blythe Tickets Here Blythe blasted Musk as a “complete asshole,” writing the following on his Instagram Stories: “It’s taken me a couple of days to wrap my head around this one. I’ve tried to consider every angle. Maybe he’s a Nazi? Maybe he’s just trolling? Maybe he’s just so socially awkward he can’t control himself? WHO KNOWS? The motherf**ker is weird. But one thing is blatantly obvious — he’s a FUCKING ASSHOLE. Does Elon Musk have Asperger’s? Oh, I definitely believe so. That doesn’t mean he’s not a COMPLETE ASSHOLE- the two are not mutually exclusive, by the way. For fuck’s sake, he named his son ‘X Æ A-Xii’- who would do that to a child other than a pure and unadulterated thoroughbred PRICK? I know a few people with autism- not a single one of them has ever REMOTELY reminded me of Hitler. Even if it WAS an autism-induced mistake, he refuses to cop to it, and that tells us everything we need to know. Because, you see, that’s what people with correctly calibrated moral compasses do — they admit their mistakes. Supposedly Musk may become an actual government employee at some point- that means we the people will be paying his salary (not that he needs it.) So as a tax paying citizen of the United States, I have a request for the 47th-President Trump, please put your KETAMINE-FUELED PET ROCKET MONKEY back in his cage so he can do things he’s suited for- obviously appearing in public is not one of them. Oh, and of course: FUCK ALL NAZIS.” Blythe’s takedown of Elon Musk comes a month ahead of his book tour in support of his new memoir, Just Beyond the Light: Making Peace with the Wars Inside Our Head, arriving February 18th (pre-order here). The tour kicks off February 19th in Philadelphia and runs through March 14th in San Diego, with tickets available here. Earlier this month, Blythe warned parents not to bring their kids to his book tour, as it will deal with “HEAVY alcohol and drug usage, as well as the batshit insane situations that occurred as a result of said substance intake.” See a screen capture of Randy Blythe’s IG stories post about Elon Musk below (via ThePRP).",
