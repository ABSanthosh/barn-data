  "text": "Earlier today, it was reported that Jonathan Joss, the voice actor known for his role in King of the Hill, was tragically shot and killed on Sunday following a dispute with his neighbor. Now, Joss’ husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has issued a statement revealing that the incident was, in fact, a hate crime: My husband Jonathan Joss and I were involved in a shooting while checking the mail at the site of our former home. That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done. Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic. When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw. While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired. Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life. Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future. He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other. The alleged suspect, identified as Sigfredo Alvarez-Cega, was arrested and charged with murder shortly after the shooting. Joss voiced Redcorn on King of the Hill from seasons 2 to 13, and had recorded lines for the series’ upcoming revival set to air on Hulu this summer. He also notably played Chief Ken Hotate on the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation.",
