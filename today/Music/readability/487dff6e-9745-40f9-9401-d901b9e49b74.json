  "text": "Sly Stone, the leader of Sly and the Family Stone, and one of the most influential musicians of all time, passed away at the age of 82 on June 9th, 2025. He left behind a musical legacy that is only rivaled by very few artists. With Sly and the Family Stone, he helped bring psychedelic soul and funk to the mainstream, releasing some of the most iconic songs ever, including such classics as “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” and “Family Affair.” A testament to the Sly and the Family Stone’s lasting legacy is the countless times the group’s songs have been covered and sampled, with a prime example being Arrested Development’s “People Everyday,” which put a new spin on “Everyday People.” And while Sly’s name was front and center, the rest of the band is legendary, as well, including his brother Freddie and sister Rose, as well as dynamic singer-trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, the innovative Larry Graham (one of the 100 Greatest Bassists of All Time), drummer Gregg Errico, and saxophonist Jerry Martini, among others. Questlove, who recently directed the documentary Sly Lives! (aka the Burden of Black Genius), wrote on the day of Stone’s passing that “Sly was a giant — not just for his groundbreaking work with the Family Stone, but for the radical inclusivity and deep human truths he poured into every note. His songs weren’t just about fighting injustice; they were about transforming the self to transform the world.” The ten songs below reflect that legacy — for no matter the story being told, Stone’s message remained consistent: Take care of each other, because we’re all we’ve got. In tribute to the great Sly Stone, we present Consequence’s picks for Sly and the Family Stone’s 10 Best Songs. — Spencer Kaufman",
