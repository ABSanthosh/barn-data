  "text": "The Offspring stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Wednesday night to perform “Make It All Right,” a recent single from their upcoming album SUPERCHARGED. Performing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!’s outdoor stage in Los Angeles instead of the studio, the California natives bring plenty of energy and a healthy amount of “ba-ba-ba”s to their rendition of “Make It All Right.” The band reprised their punchy live sound, made all more electric from 29-year-old drummer Brandon Pertzborn, who smacked the drums like he’ll never get the chance to play again. Watch The Offspring play “Make It All Right” below. Get The Offspring Tickets Here The Offspring are about to release SUPERCHARGED, their 11th studio album, on Friday, October 11th. The band shared “Make It All Right” when announcing the album in June, and followed it up with singles “Light It Up” and “Come to Brazil.” They’ve had a particularly busy 2024 so far, recently wrapping up appearances at Riot Fest, Oceans Calling, and Louder Than Life, and playing dozens of shows around the world. They have one more US date left on their 2024 tour — San Diego’s Punk in the Park festival — before heading back out for a run of international dates. Get tickets to see The Offspring here. Meanwhile, The Offspring’s Dexter Holland and Noodles recently sat with Kyle Meredith to discuss SUPERCHARGED, feeling creatively energized, and celebrating both 30 years of their album Smash as well as 40 years as a band.",
