  "text": "The Dylan biopic, starring Chalamet, is set to open in theaters on Christmas Day. Timothée Chalamet attends the premiere of Searchlight Pictures \"A Complete Unknown\" at SVA Theater on December 13, 2024 in New York City. Dominik Bindl/WireImage Timothée Chalamet channeled Bob Dylan‘s blonde-haired look at the New York premiere of his upcoming biopic. During the premiere of A Complete Unknown at New York’s SVA Theater on Friday (Dec. 13), the 28-year-old actor paid tribute to the folk icon by recreating Dylan’s style from a 2003 Sundance Film Festival event. Dressed in a light blue beanie, black leather coat, gray patterned scarf, red flannel shirt and sporting dyed blonde bangs, Chalamet’s ensemble closely mirrored a look Dylan wore to the Masked and Anonymous movie screening more than two decades ago. A Complete Unknown, which hits theaters on Christmas Day (Dec. 25), stars Chalamet as a younger version of Dylan. The film also features Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro and Edward Norton. Earlier this month, Dylan himself took to X (formerly Twitter) to give the film his stamp of approval. “There’s a movie about me opening soon called A Complete Unknown (what a title!). Timothee Chalamet is starring in the lead role,” the legendary musician wrote. “Timmy’s a brilliant actor so I’m sure he’s going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me. The film’s taken from Elijah Wald’s Dylan Goes Electric — a book that came out in 2015. It’s a fantastic retelling of events from the early ’60s that led up to the fiasco at Newport. After you’ve seen the movie read the book.” “Floored,” Chalamet tweeted in response. “I am so grateful. Thank you, Bob.” Also starring Boyd Holbrook, Dan Fogler, Norbert Leo Butz and Scoot McNairy, the biographical drama is inspired by Wald’s 2015 book Dylan Goes Electric. Director James Mangold revealed that Dylan personally provided feedback on the script. Fans first spotted Chalamet filming in New York earlier this year. The Wonka actor has said he’s been honing his portrayal of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer for years, working with a movement coach, taking a “spirit-gathering” road trip to Dylan’s early stomping grounds, and training with a harmonica coach for five years to master the singer-songwriter’s signature style.
