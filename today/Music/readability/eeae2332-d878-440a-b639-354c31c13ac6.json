  "text": "Aerosmith members Steven Tyler and Joe Perry played live together for the first time in two years at a private benefit for Tyler’s charitable organization Janie’s Fund in San Francisco on Wednesday night (April 30th). The “Toxic Twins,” as the singer and guitarist are affectionately known, hadn’t performed on the same stage since Tyler suffered a vocal injury just three shows into Aerosmith’s farewell tour in September 2023. The following year, the legendary rock band announced they were retiring from touring due to Tyler’s condition, and canceled a rescheduled tour that was set to begin in September 2024. While Tyler returned to the stage in early February of this year at a Grammy party benefitting Janie’s Fund, Perry was unable to join him that night, although Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton did share the stage with the singer for that performance. On Wednesday night, Tyler and Perry closed out a show that was preceded by performances from Cheap Trick’s Robin Zander and The Black Crowes’ Chris Robinson. The founding Aerosmith bandmates, along with Extreme’s Nuno Bettencourt and former Guns N’ Roses drummer Matt Sorum, played five of the band’s classic songs together, including “Toys in the Attic,” “Same Old Song and Dance,” “Sweet Emotion,” “Dream On,” and “Walk This Way.” They were then joined by Zander and Robinson for an encore of two more classics, “Train Kept a Rollin'” and their cover of The Beatles’ “Come Together.” Tyler has slowly been returning to the stage since the vocal injury had presumably ended his singing career. In addition to the two charity gigs, the Aerosmith frontman was also just added to the star-studded final Black Sabbath concert taking place July 5th in Birmingham, England. On Instagram, Tyler shared a photo of himself backstage with Perry, writing, “DAMN @joeperryofficial . . . WE LOOK GOOD! #toxictwins. That post can be seen below, along with a couple of video clips from the performance.",
