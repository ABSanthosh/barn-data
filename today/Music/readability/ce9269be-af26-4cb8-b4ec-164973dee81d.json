  "text": "Megadeth has left Universal Records, their old label home where they released three albums – Super Collider in 2013, Dystopia in 2016, and The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead! in 2022. Megadeth has now signed with Frontiers Label Group imprint label BLKIIBLK for their upcoming record. Megadeth joins Biohazard and Sick N' Beautiful on the label. \"When I first met Tom Lipsky [North American head of A\u0026R at Frontiers Label Group] and Bob Chiappardi back in the day, I had no idea we would be working together again so many years in the future,\" said Megadeth mastermind Dave Mustaine. \"I look forward to working with Serafino [Perugino, President/CEO of Frontiers Label Group] and the team in Italy and I can't wait for the fans to hear the songs from our new record.\" Megadeth has been in the studio with engineer Chris Rakestraw working on the follow-up to the band's 2022 record The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead! for the past few months. The new record will be Megadeth's first since Endgame in 2009 to feature bassist James LoMenzo, and the first-ever Megadeth album to feature new guitarist Teemu Mäntysaari. Want More Metal?
