  "text": "Listen via: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Podcasts | More Platforms Justin Vernon joins Kyle Meredith With… to dive into SABLE, fABLE, Bon Iver’s latest and most rootsy record in years. But don’t call it a pivot — Vernon says it’s more about clarity than change. “Less mystery, more humanity,” he explains, crediting the song “Everything Is Peaceful Love” as the emotional and sonic compass for an album that tracks a “Man in black in a cabin, making the choice to change his life.” Listen above or wherever you get your podcasts. Vernon discusses the cinematic quality and “visual story” of the songs, the subconscious as his favorite collaborator, and how the album helped stitch him back together after a tough chapter. We also hear about the influence of Rickie Lee Jones (“The Horses” is his second favorite song of all time), why the band hasn’t played “Exile” without Taylor Swift (“It’s her song”), and what it was like getting snowed in with Danielle Haim (“She’s one of my favorite people ever”) during recording. We also dig back into Bon Iver lore to reflect on that cover of The Outfield’s “Your Love.” Vernon still considers it some of Bon Iver’s best cover work: “It was a big moment for us,” he says. Listen to Justin Vernon discuss Bon Iver’s SABLE, fABLE and more above, or watch the interview below.
