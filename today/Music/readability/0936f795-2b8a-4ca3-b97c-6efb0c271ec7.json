  "text": "Electric Wizard is returning to the world with a brand new, two-LP live record called Black Magic Rituals And Perversions Vol. 1, due out December 13. The record was recorded onto a 16-track tape machine during the lockdown months of 2020 when Electric Wizard wasn't sure they'd ever play live again. \"It's raw as fuck,\" said Electric Wizard singer and guitarist Jus Oborn. \"It's like a lost '70s black metal demo rehearsal session or something. It's raw, nasty, screaming in your face. I always promised Electric Wizard was like rats in your face. This is verging on it.\" He continued: \"We'd been gigging for two years at that point, around America three times, going to Japan and Australia, and we were sounding pretty good by the end of it. When the pandemic happened we thought, 'Fuck it, maybe we'll never play again.' So we went into the jam room and played the songs to get them on tape to capture how we were playing at the time.\" Pre-orders for Black Magic Rituals And Perversions Vol. 1 are available here. The album runs as follows: \"Dopethrone\" \"Incense For The Damned\" \"Black Mass\" \"Witchcult Today\" \"Satanic Rites of Drugula\" \"Scorpio Curse\" \"The Chosen Few\" \"Funeralopolis\" Here's hoping this also means we'll get the first new Electric Wizard record since 2017 next year.
