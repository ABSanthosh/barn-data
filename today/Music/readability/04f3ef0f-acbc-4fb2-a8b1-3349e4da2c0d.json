  "text": "Listen – these headlines write themselves sometimes… Everyone's favorite band Disturbed, on the record, has stated they would like to collaborate with Kendrick Lamar. During a radio interview with Brian Haddad of Chicago's Q101 station, frontman David Draiman was prompted with a question of whether or not a collaboration with Kendrick Lamar would be possible, to which Draiman replied – in all seriousness – that it was something Disturbed had been \"thinking about pretty seriously.\" And if there were any rappers to collaborate with, \"Kendrick is way at the top of the list.\" If it were quite literally any other heavy metal band, a collaboration with arguably the greatest rapper alive would sound quite interesting, maybe even enjoyable. However, it's Disturbed, and based on the general reception of Disturbed, no one really wants to hear that. The band's 25th anniversary for The Sickness begins this week, yet they've been teasing the idea that they've been in the studio working on brand new material with cryptic messages popping up on newly launched email signup lists. Disturbed will be on tour with Daughtry, Nothing More, Three Days Grace, and Sevendust opening.
