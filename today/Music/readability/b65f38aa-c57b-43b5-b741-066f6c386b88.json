  "text": "When Abbott Elementary and It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, two beloved Philly-based sitcoms, announced that a crossover episode was in the works, fans expressed excitement and confusion. Would we see the teachers of Abbott Elementary stoop down to the vulgarity of the world of Sunny or would the latter’s gang be on their best G-rated behavior? Well, we’re one step close to finding out, as ABC has announced that the special will air on Wednesday, January 8th. The network also released the first trailer for the special episode. Watch it below. The teaser previews a few brief interactions between the two shows’ respective casts intercut with silly reaction shot after silly reaction shot. Set to Rob Base and DJ EZ Rcok’s “It Takes Two,” the whole thing boasts a generally fun-loving, slapstick vibe. To answer our own question, it seems like the Sunny crew has cleaned up their act enough for at least one episode of family-friendly television. Abbott Elementary star Quinta Brunson first hinted at the crossover during this year’s Comic Con. Rob McElhenney of Sunny then confirmed the project by posting a picture of him and his co-stars onset with the actors of Abbott. Season 4 of Abbott Elementary kicked off in October, and Season 3 of the series recently made our list of the 25 Best TV Shows of 2024. For its part, Always Sunny aired its 16th season in 2023. Read our review of that batch of episodes here.",
