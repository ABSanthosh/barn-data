  "text": "The Live Nation-produced tour launches Feb. 9 in Melbourne. Drake performs onstage during \"Lil Baby \u0026 Friends Birthday Celebration Concert\" at State Farm Arena on Dec. 9, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia. Prince Williams/Wireimage Drake is heading back to Australia and New Zealand in early 2025. On Thursday (Nov. 28), the Canadian superstar revealed the dates for his upcoming The Anita Max Win Tour, which marks first visit to the region since 2017. The Live Nation-produced tour launches with two nights at Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena on Feb. 9-10 and wraps with back-to-back shows at Auckland’s Spark Arena on Feb. 28 and March 1. The seven-date tour will also make stops in Sydney and Brisbane. See the full tour itinerary below. Explore Explore Drake See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Tickets will be available for purchase through various presales beginning Tuesday (Dec. 3). The general onsale begins Dec. 6 at 12 p.m. local time. The Anita Max Win Tour is named after a viral moment from Drake’s December 2023 livestream on Kick, where he introduced a new “alter ego” named Anita Max Win. The name is a playful pun on the gambling phrase “I need a max win,” referring to hitting the maximum payout on a slot machine. Trending on Billboard Drizzy first hinted at the tour on Nov. 24 during a livestream with gaming streamer xQc, saying, “February 9th for anybody that’s watching from Australia, I’m coming back to Australia for the first time in eight years. Coming back to Australia on tour. Melbourne, Sydney, Gold Coast… February 9 ’til like… March something.” This marks a major return for Drake’s Australian and New Zealand fans, who last saw him live during the Boy Meets World Tour in 2017. “Funny enough, it’s actually called the Anita Max Wynn Tour,” the Toronto MC said during the xQc livestream. In August, Drake also announced his forthcoming collaborative album with PARTYNEXTDOOR. PND recently went live on Instagram, sharing exciting news about the joint project. “Guys, I have one more show left on this tour,” PARTYNEXTDOOR told his followers. “Then the album is getting finished. That’s all I gotta say.” Drake’s tour announcement is especially noteworthy as it coincides with Kendrick Lamar’s highly anticipated Super Bowl Halftime Show performance on Feb. 9 — the same date as the start of Drake’s tour. The two rappers have been at the center of a well-publicized rivalry in 2024, trading shots through diss tracks like Lamar’s “Not Like Us” and Drake’s “Push Ups.” Lamar also recently dropped his surprise album GNX, adding more fuel to the fire.
