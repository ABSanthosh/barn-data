  "text": "Rick Buckler, drummer for legendary UK rock band The Jam, has died at the age of 69. A statement from his family states that Buckler “passed away peacefully on Monday evening in Woking after a short illness with family by his side.” The Jam’s Paul Weller and Bruce Foxton both paid tribute to their late bandmate, with Weller stating, “I’m shocked and saddened by Rick’s passing. I’m thinking back to us all rehearsing in my bedroom in Stanley Road, Woking. To all the pubs and clubs we played at as kids, to eventually making a record. What a journey! We went far beyond our dreams and what we made stands the test of time. My deepest sympathy to all family and friends.” Foxton added, “I was shocked and devastated to hear the very sad news today. Rick was a good guy and a great drummer whose innovative drum patterns helped shape our songs. I’m glad we had the chance to work together as much as we did. My thoughts are with Leslie and his family at this very difficult time.” The Jam formed in 1972 and lasted until their breakup in 1982. They released their first album, In the City, in 1977, followed by This Is the Modern World (1977), All Mod Cons (1978), Setting Sons (1979), Sound Affects (1980), and The Gift (1982). Known for their Mod look and punk-infused melodic pop sound, The Jam released such classic singles as “In the City,” “Going Undergound,” and “Town Called Malice,” among others. Their music influenced countless bands, including The Smiths, Oasis, and more. After The Jam’s breakup, Buckler formed the bands Time UK and Sharp in the ’80s. He then left the music industry in the ’90s, and took up a career as a carpenter. In 2005, the drummer resurfaced in music with the band The Gift, which at one point welcomed his former Jam bandmate Bruce Foxton as its bassist. And in recent years, he worked in artist management. Buckler detailed his life in the 2015 autobiography That’s Entertainment: My Life in the Jam. Our condolences go out to Rick Buckler’s family, friends, and bandmates during this difficult time.",
