  "text": "On the heels of their Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame induction this past Saturday (October 19th), Foreigner have announced that they are extending their farewell tour. Moreover, the band plans to feature classic members at select shows, including original lead singer Lou Gramm. The dates start with a previously announced Las Vegas residency that kicks off this Friday (October 25th) at The Venetian. Classic members Rick Wills and Al Greenwood will sit in with the band during the entire residency. Get Foreigner Tickets Here After that, Foreigner have dates scheduled throughout 2025, beginning March 13th in Hollywood, Florida, and wrapping up with a two-night stand October 10th and 11th in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with tickets available here. A press release hints that the tour will likely be extended into 2026 to celebrate the band’s 50th anniversary. Gramm, Wills, and Greenwood were all on-hand in Cleveland to accept Foreigner’s induction into the Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame this past weekend. They all performed with the current members of the band, who were also joined by Demi Lovato, Sammy Hagar, and Kelly Clarkson during the Rock Hall set. Gramm duetted with Clarkson on “I Want to Know What Love Is.” While there’s no specific plans in place for Gramm to join the band as of yet, the press release states, “Discussions are in hand to include Lou Gramm as Foreigner moves toward its 50th anniversary in 2026.” Gramm, who has toured with his solo band in recent years, had previously stated he was retiring from touring at the end of this year. Gramm exited Foreigner in 2003, but joined them for select shows in 2017 and 2018. Kelly Hansen has been the band’s frontman since 2005, with no classic members in the current touring lineup. Founding guitarist Mick Jones is still an official member of Foreigner but no longer tours with the band due to his ongoing battle with Parkinson’s disease. Foreigner also performed at halftime of the Cleveland Browns-Cincinnati Bengals game on Sunday (October 21st). “Performing the incredible catalogue of music created by Mick Jones and the rest of the first incarnation of Foreigner is a dream come true for all of us,” stated Hansen. “After twenty years of proudly flying the Foreigner flag, we are thrilled to be periodically sharing the stage with the guys who started it all as we celebrate their Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame recognition.” See Foreigner’s updated list of farewell tour dates below, and watch the full Rock \u0026 Roll Hall of Fame ceremony on Disney+ or Hulu.
