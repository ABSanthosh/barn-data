  "text": "Every week, Consequence’s Songs of the Week column spotlights the best new tracks from the last seven days. Find our new favorites on our Top Songs playlist, and for more great songs from emerging artists, listen to our New Sounds playlist. This week, we’re loving some great new collaborative tracks, including 2-Chainz and Ne-Yo, JPEGMAFIA and Joey Valence and Brae, and Kevin Abstract and Dominic Fike. 2 Chainz and Ne-Yo — “NOT THE SAME” Atlanta rap mainstay 2 Chainz has always had a good ear for samples (see: the Hall \u0026 Oates flip “Can’t Go for That” released in 2020). On the lush Ne-Yo collaboration “NOT THE SAME,” 2 Chainz continues to revel in the classics, this time over a healthy sampling of R\u0026B group Enchantment’s 1977 record “Silly Love Song.” Featured on the soundtrack of 2 Chainz’s upcoming short film Red Clay, “NOT THE SAME” checks every box for anyone who likes their hip-hop infused with warmth, soul, and authentic messaging. —Kiana Fitzgerald Aunt Katrina — “Ran Out of Time” Aunt Katrina have gathered more momentum from just one EP than the majority of their peers on the come-up. After a year and a half of stirring up excitement since the EP’s release, the DMV outfit is finally set to unveil their debut studio record next month. As the July 11th release of This Heat Is Slowly Killing Me inches closer, they have now shared the album’s emotive second single. Starting out in a delicate and fragile state, “Ran Out of Time” ultimately explodes with a gentle and muffled restraint. A charming display of moderation and development, this one alone makes a strong case for the upcoming project. — Karan Singh Cardinals – “Big Empty Heart” On their latest cut, Irish indie rock up-and-comers Cardinals bear their “Big Empty Heart.” Overtop a swaying instrumental of distorted guitars, crashing drums, and accordion, frontman Euan Manning comes through with one of his most emotionally distraught performances yet, with the slight tremor in his voice almost bringing to mind Robert Smith. All the while, the band waltzes their way through the tune’s Pixies-esque dynamics. It’s enough to fill one’s heart. — Jonah Krueger",
