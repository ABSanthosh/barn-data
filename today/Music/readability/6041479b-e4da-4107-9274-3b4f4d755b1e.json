I am exceptionally proud of what we have built as a team.”SMP adds that the expansion is part of its ongoing efforts to extend support for the company’s songwriters worldwide and points to other recent developments and enhancements across multiple territories, including the UK, Germany, The Netherlands, Canada, Nashville, Spain, Colombia, Sweden, South Africa, India, and more.See a collection of photos from the new creative hub below: Music Business Worldwide",
