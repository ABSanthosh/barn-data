  "text": "The Mexican music superstar was accompanied by Fidel of Marca Registrada, Jasiel Núñez \u0026 Tito Double P during the Nuevo Mexicano panel. Peso Pluma at Billboard's Latin Power Players at Casadonna on Oct. 14, 2024 in Miami Beach, Florida. Christopher Polk Peso Pluma sat down Tuesday (Oct. 15) on a panel at Billboard Latin Music Week 2024 and for the first time spoke live about his musical origins, his creative process and the importance of having close friends in his life. In the panel “Nuevo Mexicano: Peso Pluma y Amigos,” the superstar invited some of the most exciting artists in the new Mexican music movement, including Fidel of Marca Registrada, Jasiel Nunez and Tito Double P. The talk took place at the Fillmore Miami Beach, moderated by Billboard Latin/Español’s chief content officer Leila Cobo. Here are 10 of the best quotes during the Nuevo Mexicano panel: Trending on Billboard Peso Pluma I am an artist that has helped Mexican music grow by representing the corridos that we are passionate about. Throughout this year, I have not only grown as an artist but also as a businessman, which is the big difference from a year ago to today. I am impulsive when it comes to songwriting; it’s the best way to write is through my impulsiveness. I have never taken formal lessons, not in singing, and I never will. My voice has been like this since I was born, you hear it and know it’s Hassan. (Why did he want to do corridos?) Because I am Mexican. I was heavily influenced by other genres and I listen to everything. I have always listened to corridos, Chalino Sánchez, and El Halcón de la Sierra. I felt it in my blood. I wanted to make a change within regional Mexican music, and to have Mexican music recognized as it deserves. My friends Natanael Cano and Junior H paved the way and Mexican music deserved this moment. My friends are my pillars in life. When things get ugly, you realize who your real friends are. As far as friendships go, I try to be the same, to respect those who respect me. Helping my friends fills my heart. Fidel, a great man, I have a lot of respect for him both as a person and as an artist. Since I was a kid, I listened to his music [with Marca Registrada]. The first tattoo I got was a corrido written by him. Fidel: We must always be original with what we do and not be afraid of different genres. I started with traditional e-mails. I have also done electrocorridos, I have done reggaeton, I have been encouraged to do everything. A little while ago I recorded a song called corridos felices [“Bling Bling” with Octavio Cuadras, a new genre]. And I said: “Happy corridos? What is that? It reached Maluma’s ears, he liked it, got on board and recorded it. Tito Double P: Once things got solid with the Peso Pluma project, I always had a thorn in my side about wanting to release a song. Finally, last year, just a month before releasing my first song, a dembow I did was leaked on TikTok and suddenly it was everywhere, with 100,000 views in a week. Everyone was asking, “Who is that voice?”. It was Tito. It was something very strange, but it seemed like he already had to sing, like it wasn’t something we planned, a song leaks and Tito Double P is born. Jasiel Núñez: We met, we really hit it off, we taught each other our songs. I always liked the way he (Peso) composed a lot. It was very different, and I think that brought us together. We were always very criticized, but at the same time our close people were very supportive.
