  "text": "Over the weekend, a man attended the Punk Rock Bowling \u0026 Music Festival in Las Vegas while brazenly wearing a t-shirt displaying the SS logo adopted by Nazi Germany in the 1930s. As captured in a video circulating on social media, other festival attendees responded by punching and shoving the man as security escorted him off the premises. “No fucking Nazis,” one person can be heard shouting. Another added, “Get out of our scene.” Apparently, this man ignored the message of Dead Kennedys’ 1981 song “Nazi Punks Fuck Off.”",
