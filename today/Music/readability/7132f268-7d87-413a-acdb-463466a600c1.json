  "text": "\"Feid's talent is undeniable and our chemistry ... has always been amazing,\" Balvin says as the song climbs 6-1 for its first week atop the radio ranking. J Balvin Diego Bedezu J Balvin and Feid’s “Doblexxo” snags the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s Latin Airplay chart as the song climbs 6-1 for its first week atop the March 15-dated list. The song lands at the summit in its 13th week. “I feel super excited to know that our fans have embraced this song in such a way,” Balvin tells Billboard. “Feid’s talent is undeniable and our chemistry when it comes to making music has always been amazing. I can’t wait to sing ‘Doblexxo’ live during my upcoming Rayo tour.” Trending on Billboard In the tracking week ending March 6, “Doblexxo” pulled 8.4 million audience impressions earned in the U.S., according to Luminate; that’s a 32% gain from the week prior when the song generated 6.1 million. With “Doblexxo,” Balvin achieves his record-extending 37th No. 1s since the Latin Airplay chart began in 1994, opening a wider gap from his next competitor (Ozuna, 34 champs). Feid bags his ninth ruler. The latter last reached the top with “Si Sabe Ferxxo,” with Blessd, which spent a week at No. 1 in June 2024. Except for 2024, Balvin has placed at least one champ every year during his decadelong No. 1 chart career, dating back to “6AM,” featuring Farruko (May 2014). He completed his most lucrative period in 2022, placing nine No. 1 hits between February and October then. The year before, Balvin reached his second-best run, with six No. 1s in 2019. Good reception across Latin rhythmic stations also spurs its coronation on the Latin Rhythm Airplay chart, where “Doblexxo” jumps 3-1. There, Balvin also stands firmly ahead of the rest, with 37 No. 1s. (Daddy Yankee follows with 35.) The song’s 13-week climb to No. 1 marks a longer stride to the top than Balvin and Feid’s past pair-up, “Porfa” — where Maluma, Nicky Jam, Sech and Justin Quiles are also part of the billing — as it ruled after eight weeks in August 2020. “Doblexxo” is the fourth radio promoted single from Balvin’s sixth studio album Rayo, which debuted and peaked at No. 5 on Latin Rhythm Albums last August. All charts (dated March 15, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, March 11.
