  "text": "Oklou has released a new remix EP to accompany her February album Choke Enough. Nick León, Malibu, Aaron Hibell, and Jamesjamesjames each contribute a remix. Hear them all below.Hibell, who remixes “Take Me by the Hand” on the EP, said in a press release, “I’ve been a fan of Oklou for a while now, and when I heard her latest album, especially ‘Take Me by the Hand,’ I was immediately drawn to the ’90s and early 2000s trance influences woven through it. I wanted to really flip it into my own style, pushing further into that old school trance aesthetic but still feeling fresh and anthemic, that’s been such a big part of my sound.”Nick León, who is releasing his own album A Tropical Entropy this Friday, was an additional producer on Choke Enough track “Harvest Sky.” He takes on “Blade Bird.” Malibu and Jamesjamesjames both rework the album’s title track.Oklou will soon head out on a North American and European tour, including a date at Pitchfork Music Festival London.",
