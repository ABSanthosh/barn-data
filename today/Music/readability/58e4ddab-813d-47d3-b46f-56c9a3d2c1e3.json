  "text": "We've rounded up a combined top 10 ranking of both Black Sabbath \u0026 Osbourne's biggest albums on the all-genre chart. Black Sabbath Ross Halfin Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne (long the band’s famed frontman) have a heavy (metal) legacy of hit albums on the Billboard 200 chart, dating to when the group notched its first chart entry with its self-titled debut in 1970. Through the years, the band, and Osbourne with solo projects, has rocked the chart with a series of high-charting albums. The band logged a series of top 40-charting efforts over the decades, first reaching the top 10 in 1971 with Master of Reality, which climbed to No. 8. The group last hit the chart with the reunion project 13, released in 2013, which marked the group’s second top 10, and first No. 1. Osbourne himself as a soloist has claimed nine top 10-charting sets on the Billboard 200, including at least one in every decade from the 1980s through the 2020s. He most recently hit the top 10 with the No. 3-peaking Patient Number 9 in 2022. Along the way, Osbourne also claimed a pair of top 10 charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100, with his Lita Ford duet “Close My Eyes Forever” (No. 8 in 1989) and his featured turn, alongside Travis Scott, on Post Malone’s “Take What You Want” (No. 8 in 2019). Below is a combined top 10 ranking of both Black Sabbath and Osbourne’s biggest albums on the Billboard 200 chart. The ranking is based on actual performance on the weekly Billboard 200 through the July 5, 2025, chart. Titles are ranked on an inverse point system, with weeks at No. 1 earning the greatest value and weeks at No. 200 earning the least. Due to changes in chart methodology over the years, eras are weighted to account for different chart turnover rates over various periods. Black Rain, Ozzy Osbourne Peak Position: No. 3Peak Date: June 9, 2007 The set spent 20 weeks on the Billboard 200 and housed the single “I Don’t Wanna Stop,” which spent five weeks atop the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. Blizzard of Ozz, Ozzy Osbourne Peak Position: No. 21Peak Date: Aug. 8, 1981 While Blizzard of Ozz may have peaked outside the top 20 on the weekly Billboard 200, Osbourne’s debut solo effort spent a mighty 107 weeks on the chart in total — the most of any Osbourne or Black Sabbath album. The set launched one of Osbourne’s most famous hits, “Crazy Train,” which reached No. 9 on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart in 1981. Vol. 4, Black Sabbath Peak Position: No. 13Peak Date: Dec. 23, 1972 The band’s appropriately titled fourth studio album, Vol. 4, spent 31 weeks on the chart and marked the fourth top 40-charting effort for the group in less than two years, dating to the group’s self-titled debut in 1970. Tribute, Ozzy Osbourne/Randy Rhoads Peak Position: No. 6Peak Date: June 13, 1987 The live album from Osbourne includes performances with guitarist Randy Rhoads, who played with Osbourne’s band in the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, and died in 1982. The set spun off a single in a live rendition of “Crazy Train,” which also garnered its first official music video. Diary of a Madman, Ozzy Osbourne Peak Position: No. 16Peak Date: Dec. 19, 1981 Osbourne’s second solo studio album was his first to reach the top 20 on the weekly Billboard 200, peaking at No. 16, and spending 75 total weeks on the chart. The set includes the radio single “Flying High Again,” which peaked at No. 2 on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart. 13, Black Sabbath Peak Position: No. 1 (one week)Peak Date: June 29, 2013 Forty-three years after Black Sabbath made its debut on the Billboard 200, the band scored its first No. 1 with the chart-topping debut of the reunion project 13. It was the first studio album with Osbourne since 1978’s Never Say Die! Paranoid, Black Sabbath Peak Position: No. 12Peak Date: March 20, 1971 The band’s second studio album reached No. 12 and launched the group’s only two charted hits on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart: the title track (peaking No. 61 in December 1970) and “Iron Man” (No. 52 in March 1972). Master of Reality, Black Sabbath Peak Position: No. 8Peak Date: Sept. 25, 1971 When the album, the group’s third studio set, reached No. 8 on Sept. 25, 1971 (sandwiched between albums by Carpenters and the Partridge Family), it marked the first top 10 for the band — and the only top 10 it would claim until the chart-topping reunion set 13 in 2013. No More Tears, Ozzy Osbourne Peak Position: No. 7Peak Date: Oct. 5, 1991 No More Tears launched a pair of Hot 100-charting singles in the title track (No. 71) and “Mama, I’m Coming Home” (No. 28). The latter remains Osbourne’s only top 40 hit on the all-genre Hot 100 unaccompanied by any other act. On the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart, the set generated five top 40-charting titles: “No More Tears” (No. 10), “Mama” (No. 2), “Road to Nowhere” (No. 3), “Mr. Tinkertrain” (No. 34) and “Time After Time” (No. 6). The album No More Tears would remain on the Billboard 200 for 86 weeks — the second-longest run of any Osbourne solo album, after Blizzard of Ozz‘s 107 weeks. The Ultimate Sin, Ozzy Osbourne Peak Position: No. 6Peak Date: April 5, 1986 The Ultimate Sin reigns as the No. 1 album on this combined ranking of the top 10 albums by Osbourne and Black Sabbath. The set reached No. 6 in April of 1986 and spent 13 weeks inside the weekly top 20 — the most of any album by Osbourne or Sabbath. The album generated a hit single in “Shot In the Dark,” which became Osbourne’s first solo Hot 100 entry, peaking No. 68 in April 1986. It would also hit No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart.

The set reached No. 6 in April of 1986 and spent 13 weeks inside the weekly top 20 — the most of any album by Osbourne or Sabbath. The album generated a hit single in “Shot In the Dark,” which became Osbourne’s first solo Hot 100 entry, peaking No. 68 in April 1986. It would also hit No. 10 on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.billboard.com/\" title=\"Billboard\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" style=\"height:100%;width:100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 455.133 94.711\"\u003e\u003cpath d=\"M70.107 28.859h21.318V93.69H70.107zM95.834 3.51h21.312v90.18H95.834zm25.723 0h21.312v90.18h-21.312zm250.711 32.035v-6.686h-21.315V93.69h21.315V62.792c0-7.949 4.154-12.237 11.728-12.237h2.522V28.229c-6.432.253-11.1 2.271-14.25 7.316M80.764 0c-6.822 0-12.359 5.535-12.359 12.361s5.537 12.363 12.359 12.363c6.828 0 12.361-5.537 12.361-12.363S87.592 0 80.764 0m244.457 33.795c-2.996-3.268-9.967-5.965-15.26-5.965-16.098 0-27.646 10.613-30.473 26.389-3.082-15.135-16.273-26.78-32.359-26.78-16.24 0-29.537 11.781-32.444 27.2-2.822-16.026-15.428-26.648-31.061-26.648-5.801 0-10.596 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521h-21.312V93.7h20.938v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.467 6.812 17.154 6.812 14.398 0 26.52-11.271 29.113-26.807 3.055 15.203 16.169 26.76 32.373 26.76 16.065 0 28.949-11.312 32.228-26.125 2.711 16.18 15.531 26.301 30.854 26.301 5.293 0 11.099-1.771 15.009-4.668V93.7h21.312V65.327q.002-1.745-.031-3.406.033-1.66.031-3.405V28.969h-21.312zM181.355 73.948c-6.826 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.533-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.824 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358.001 6.828-5.534 12.363-12.359 12.363m65.774-.99c-6.822 0-12.361-5.539-12.361-12.363s5.539-12.358 12.361-12.358c6.824 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.823-5.532 12.363-12.359 12.363m64.047.392c-6.826 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.363s5.527-12.358 12.354-12.358c6.832 0 12.359 5.535 12.359 12.358.001 6.824-5.527 12.363-12.359 12.363M433.815 3.5v28.631c-4.156-2.9-8.949-4.16-14.757-4.16-17.782 0-31.654 13.746-31.654 33.55 0 18.664 13.368 33.043 29.642 33.043 6.68 0 12.103-2.146 17.152-6.811v5.928h20.938V3.5zm-12.553 70.288c-6.817 0-12.354-5.539-12.354-12.358 0-6.828 5.535-12.365 12.354-12.365 6.828 0 12.363 5.537 12.363 12.365 0 6.819-5.535 12.358-12.363 12.358M36.072 27.99c-5.803 0-10.594 1.262-14.76 4.16V3.521H0V93.7h20.936v-5.93c5.045 4.668 10.469 6.812 17.156 6.812 16.268 0 29.637-14.383 29.637-33.047 0-19.797-13.874-33.545-31.657-33.545m-2.269 45.958c-6.824 0-12.359-5.535-12.359-12.363 0-6.824 5.535-12.358 12.359-12.358 6.826 0 12.359 5.534 12.359 12.358 0 6.828-5.533 12.363-12.359 12.363\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cp\u003eGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.email.billboard.com/signup/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003e\n\tSign Up\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
