  "text": "8-year-old Luna and 6-year-old Miles test their dad in a fun family game. John Legend thought his daughter Luna’s favorite singer was Sabrina Carpenter. He was wrong. The Short n’ Sweet pop star actually ranks at No. 2 for the 8-year-old, Legend learned in a round of “Our Favorite Things” with Luna and her 6-year-old brother, Miles. The very first episode of the Billboard Family game, featuring Legend quizzed by his two eldest children, is premiering now but was filmed in late 2024 — when Luna also led a one-on-one interview with her dad about his children’s album, My Favorite Dream. “Favorite singers?” Luna asks her father during the game, in the video that’s seen above. “Right now your favorite is Sabrina Carpenter,” Legend says, only for Luna to refute his response.“How is that incorrect? Because I am in the car when you’re picking songs,” he says to his daughter. He’s wrong because her favorite singer is Dad, of course. (Cue the heart-eyes and smiling-with-tears-in-your-eyes emojis as you watch her quietly point at him.) “Awww. OK. You just melted my heart,” the “L.O.V.E.” singer says in the clip of the family game. Legend then correctly identifies some of Miles’ favorite music artists: Zedd, Marshmello and The Chainsmokers. “He’s very into DJs,” Legend says, joking, “I think he wants to do a Vegas residency at some point.” The sweet game also has Legend answering questions about Luna and Miles’ favorite hobbies, things to do together with Dad, TV shows, books and meals. Stick around until the end of the video to see what scores they give their superstar parent. Plus, Legend — who has two more kids, 2-year-old Esti and 1-year-old Wren, with wife Chrissy Teigen — is tested on his children’s favorite songs from his own album My Favorite Dream, which is nominated for best children’s album in the 2025 Grammy Awards, among good company: Lucky Diaz and The Family Jam Band’s Brillo, Brillo!, Lucy Kalantari \u0026 The Jazz Cats’ Creciendo, Rock for Children’s Solid Rock Revival and Divinity Roxx and Divi Roxx Kids’ World Wide Playdate are also up for the award. The Grammys will proceed as planned on Feb. 2 at the Crypto.com Arena, and will be telecast on CBS. Many Los Angeles music events were canceled or postponed due to the wildfires that have devastated communities in the greater L.A. area, but the show “will carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours,” Recording Academy and MusiCares CEO Harvey Mason Jr. and Tammy Hurt, the chair of the academy’s board of trustees, said in a joint statement last week. Legend and his family were safely able to go back to their L.A. house after evacuating, Teigen shared in an update on Jan. 13, nothing that they were “feeling grateful to be back home.” In addition to sharing resources for fire victims on social media, her brand Cravings made a total of $100,000 in donations to organizations including World Central Kitchen, the YMCA, LA Regional Food Bank and the Red Cross “to support in fulfilling much needed supplies and most importantly – food, to help people begin to recover and rebuild.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
