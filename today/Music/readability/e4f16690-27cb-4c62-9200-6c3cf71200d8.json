James Austin Johnson and Sarah Sherman portray Oasis' Noel and Liam Gallagher, respectively, during \"Saturday Night Live\" on Oct. 12, 2024. Courtesy Photo Liam Gallagher isn’t amused by Saturday Night Live‘s take on his tumultuous relationship with brother Noel. The long-feuding Oasis siblings were portrayed by SNL cast members James Austin Johnson (Noel) and Sarah Sherman (Liam) during the “Weekend Update” segment of the long-running NBC sketch comedy show’s episode on Oct. 12. In the sketch, “Weekend Update” host Colin Jost interviews the brothers about the North American leg of their 2025 Oasis reunion tour and whether they’ll break up before the launch. “I’m cool if he’s cool,” Johnson’s Noel responds. “I’m cool, I’m cool, I’m cooler than you are,” Sherman’s Liam hits back. Unconvinced, Jost says, “Great. So, that’s a no.” Trending on Billboard The skit continues with Noel and Liam mostly bickering and answering questions with the lyrics of “Wonderwall,” while only agreeing on topics like cartoon characters, their favorite Sex in the City boyfriend, and the best Will Smith film. Sherman’s Liam also claims their feud began at London’s Wembley Stadium in 1993 when Noel told the Spice Girls that his brother had a “crooked knob — you said me knob bended like Beckham!” As expected, the real Liam Gallagher didn’t take too kindly to SNL‘s interpretation of his relationship with Noel. “Are they meant to be comedians,” he commented on X (formerly Twitter) early Sunday under a post linked to the skit. Oasis announced their long-awaited reunion tour in late August. The global trek is scheduled to launch in September 2025 with multiple dates in the United Kingdom, followed by performances in North America, Europe, and Australia. Oasis split in 2009 after years of massive chart success and tabloid headlines in the U.K. tied to the Gallagher siblings’ fierce rivalry, with main songwriter older brother Noel quitting the band after a backstage fight with Liam at a show near Paris that year. The brothers haven’t performed live since then, though they often play Oasis songs during their solo gigs and with their side bands and, until the reunion announcement, continued to snipe at each other online and in the press.
