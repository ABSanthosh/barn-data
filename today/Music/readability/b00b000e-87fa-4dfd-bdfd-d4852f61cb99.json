  "text": "After previously offering his support for Republican nominee and convicted felon Donald Trump, Reggaeton artist Nicky Jam has withdrawn his endorsement. In a video shared to his 44 million Instagram followers, the artist spoke in Spanish about his concerns, specifically citing the comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe onstage at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally this past weekend. Watch the full video below. “The reason I supported Donald Trump was because I thought he was the best for the economy in the United States where a lot of Latinos live; a lot of immigrants are suffering because of the economy,” he said. “Never in my life did I think that one month later there would be a comedian who would criticize and speak poorly of my Puerto Rico, and for that I withdraw my support of Donald Trump and stepping away from political conversation. Puerto Rico deserves respect.” During the event, Hinchliffe described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage,” which has prompted other prominent Puerto Rican figures — and voters — like Bad Bunny to officially endorse Kamala Harris. Nicky Jam’s statement follows an awkward appearance at a rally where Trump appeared to not be familiar with the musician’s gender and attempted to welcome him by that, “She’s hot.”",
