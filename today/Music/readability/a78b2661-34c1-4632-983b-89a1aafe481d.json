  "text": "Last year, American Football celebrated the 25th anniversary of their landmark debut album with a series of live performances. Now, that tour will be immortalized in the form of a concert film. American Football (Live in Los Angeles) was recorded across two nights at Los Angeles’ El Rey Theatre. Directed by Steph Rinzler and featuring interviews with Ethel Cain, Yvette Young, and M.A.G.S., the film is set to premiere tonight (July 2) at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the band’s YouTube channel.American Football (Live in Los Angeles) is accompanied by the official release of American Football’s first live album. The record, which includes renditions of all the songs on the emo lodestars’ debut, was originally made available on Bandcamp earlier this year, with proceeds going to benefit victims of the California wildfires. Vinyl pressings will come with an eight-page booklet of photographs from the El Rey Theatre shows taken by Atiba Jefferson. Listen to the album below.Alongside remastering and reissuing their debut LP in 2024, American Football shared a full-album covers compilation with contributions from Iron \u0026 Wine, Manchester Orchestra, and Blondshell, among others.
