Tetris Kelly: Donald J. Trump has been re-elected as America’s 47th president, and the hip-hop community is reacting. Cardi B posted on her IG story, “I hate y’all bad.” 50 Cent posted on his page, “I don’t care how the fight goes, I’m leaving with the winner sh*t. I still don’t know what’s going on. Congratulations!” Joe Budden took it to Twitter saying, “If Trump wins, I’m egging Cyber Trucks.” And over at ‘The Breakfast Club,’ Charlamagne Tha God had this to say. Charlamagne tha God: Donald Trump is now all of our president again. I don’t want to fight anyone. I don’t want to argue with anyone, because at the end of the day we are all Americans.  Tetris Kelly: In the upcoming days, there will be more reactions flooding in, but no matter where you lean politically, make sure to take some time to check in on friends, loved ones and, most importantly, yourself.",
