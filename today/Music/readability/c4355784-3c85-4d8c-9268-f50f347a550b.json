  "text": "The Vans Warped Tour is returning. In celebration of its 30th anniversary, the legacy emo, rock, and pop-punk festival will be stopping in three cities in 2025: Washington, D.C. (June 14 and 15), Long Beach, California (July 26 and 27), and Orlando, Florida (November 15 and 16). Each two-day stop will feature 70 to 100 bands, with full lineups still to be announced.The Warped Tour last took place in 2019, as it celebrated its 25th anniversary with shows in Cleveland, Atlantic City, and Mountain View, California. In a statement about the festival’s return, founder Kevin Lyman said, “People are craving connection, live music, and the raw, unfiltered experience that Warped has always offered. We’ve seen how music continues to unite and inspire, and this return isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about giving a new generation the chance to feel that same sense of belonging and freedom that Warped has always championed.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
