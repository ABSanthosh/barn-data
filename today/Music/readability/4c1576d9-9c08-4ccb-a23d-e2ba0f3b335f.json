  "text": "Beyoncé's 13-year-old handled the minor Cowboy Carter show mishap like a pro. Jay-Z, Beyonce and Blue Ivy Carter at The 67th Annual Grammy Awards, airing live from Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Francis Specker/CBS via Getty Images The show must go on, even when your earring accidentally gets completely tangled in Beyoncé‘s hair. The superstar’s 13-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, found herself in this exact situation on the Cowboy Carter Tour stage earlier this week. Blue and little sister Rumi, 7, have been joining Bey on stage in concert, during the singer’s performance of “Protector.” While Rumi sits with Mom, Blue is seated behind the two for the sweet number, taking part in the choreography alongside Beyoncé’s dancers. At the Cowboy Carter concert at Chicago’s Soldier Field on Thursday (May 15), the serene moment was interrupted — at least for Blue, who realized the earring in her right ear was caught in Beyoncé’s hair. Trending on Billboard In a video filmed by a fan in the audience, Blue’s eyes can be seen widening ever so slightly upon realizing what’s happened. But the issue was remarkably short-lived, thanks to a swift recovery on the young teen’s part. In fact, she thought to remove the earring from her ear so quickly (rather than work on untangling it) that her mother didn’t even seem to notice anything unusual was going on. See fan-captured footage of the moment on X. The Cowboy Carter Tour — Beyoncé’s 32-date stadium run that kicked off on April 28 with a five-show stint at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, that grossed $55.7 million — continues through July 26. Eldest child Blue Ivy memorably takes the stage for “Déjà Vu,” for which the young talent leads an impressive dance routine. Beyoncé returns to Soldier Field tonight (May 17), following a weather-delayed performance at the stadium’s first of three dates Thursday night. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up",
