  "text": "The heavy metal world is mourning the death of its most iconic voice, as legendary Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne passed away on the morning of July 22, 2025, at the age of 76. His death comes less than three weeks after what would become his final live appearance—a historic reunion with Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward at Villa Park in Birmingham, UK, the very city where the pioneering metal band was born. In a heartfelt statement, Ozzy's family confirmed the tragic news: \"It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.\" Ozzy's passing follows Back to the Beginning, a sold-out global livestream event and in-person concert at Villa Park that brought Black Sabbath's original lineup together onstage for the first time in over 20 years. The event, which featured tributes from bands like Metallica, Tool, and Guns N' Roses, drew over 40,000 fans in person and nearly 6 million viewers online. It marked a triumphant, emotional farewell for the godfathers of metal — and ultimately, for Ozzy himself. Following the announcement of his death, Ozzy's Black Sabbath bandmates issued deeply personal tributes to their fallen brother. Guitarist Tony Iommi expressed the pain of losing his longtime friend and bandmate: \"I just can't believe it! My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park. It's just such heartbreaking news that I can't really find the words, there won't ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz.\" Bassist Geezer Butler reflected on their journey from humble beginnings in Aston to global superstardom: \"Goodbye dear friend—thanks for all those years—we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston—who'd have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.\" Drummer Bill Ward, whose reunion with Ozzy on stage at Villa Park was their first in decades, shared an emotionally poetic message: \"Where will I find you now? In the memories, our unspoken embraces, our missed phone calls, no, you're forever in my heart. Deepest condolences to Sharon and all family members. RIP Sincere regrets to all the fans. Never goodbye. Thank you forever.\" Ozzy Osbourne's death marks the end of an era in heavy music. But thanks to his decades of unforgettable performances and genre-defining albums, the legacy of the godfather of metal will live on forever. Want More Metal?
