  "text": "A jury reached a verdict, last week, in the federal trial of the Bronx rapper Kay Flock. The 21-year-old musician, born Kevin Perez, was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy; attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon in aid of racketeering; and possession of a firearm in relation to attempted murder and assault. In addition, Kay Flock was found not guilty of murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise.Kay Flock was arrested in December 2021 and charged with murdering a 24-year-old man named Hwascar Hernandez. The rapper’s case was moved to federal court in February 2023 as the government alleged that Kay Flock was a member of a gang called “Sev Side” or “DOA” (short for “Dead on Arrival”) that was committing racketeering crimes.In a statement released after the federal jury reached its verdict, Matthew Podolsky, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said, “Perez can no longer hide behind his music, and instead will be held to account for his violent crimes.”In an audio message posted on Instagram, Kay Flock thanked his supporters, his attorneys, and the federal judge presiding over his case. He specifically shared his gratitude for attorney Michael T. Ashley. In a statement shared with Pitchfork, Ashley wrote:Today begins a new phase of a long and challenging legal journey for my client, Kevin Perez better known as Kay Flock, who was recently convicted on charges of Racketeering Conspiracy, Violent Crimes in Aid of Racketeering, and a Firearms Offense. We respect the verdict reached by the jury, it is however important to note that my Mr. Perez was acquitted of the most serious charge—Murder in Aid of Racketeering—a charge that carried with it a mandatory life sentence.Throughout the past few weeks, we have witnessed my client’s strength, resilience, and determination to fight for justice. While the outcome on some counts may not be what we had hoped for, we remain focused on his future. We will continue to pursue all avenues available, including an appeal, to ensure that my client’s rights are protected and to challenge the portions of the verdict we believe are against the weight of the evidence.In the face of his trial, Kevin Perez has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to his family and community, and this conviction, while a setback, does not define who he is or the potential he has moving forward in life and in his music career. This case has underscored the importance of due process and the legal system’s ability to provide an opportunity for fair evaluation, and we are optimistic about what the next steps will bring.Thank you to everyone who supported Mr. Perez through this difficult process. We remain hopeful that the appellate process will result in a fairer outcome, and I am committed to advocating tirelessly on behalf of my client.Kay Flock is due for sentencing on Wednesday, July 16, according to the New York Post and XXL.",
