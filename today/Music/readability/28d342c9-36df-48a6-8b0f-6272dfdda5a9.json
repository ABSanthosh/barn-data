See the album cover for The Execution of All Things (Frozen Lake Edition) below.Rilo Kiley—the quartet of Jenny Lewis, Blake Sennett, Pierre de Reeder, and Jason Boesel—haven’t performed together live since 2008. In a press statement about the tour, Lewis said, “It’s going to be wonderful for us, like going back to the purest version of yourself, that early twenties place where everything is possible. You’re in a van and Jason’s got the map, Pierre is behind the wheel, and I’m on the shitty acoustic guitar on the bench seat working out a new song with Blake. I don’t think it’s ever been as good as that, when it was just us against the world.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
