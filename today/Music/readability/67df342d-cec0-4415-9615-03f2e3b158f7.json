  "text": "Listen via Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Amazon Music | More Platforms This week on Stanning BTS, Kayla and Bethany share their experience watching Jin’s “RUNSEOKJIN_EP.TOUR” concert – a mix of excitement, sleep deprivation, and tech hiccups! Of course, there’s some major BTS news as the band has reunited and plans for a 2026 album and tour, but this episode was recorded prior to that major announcement. So, you’ll have to tune in to the next episode to hear how Stanning BTS responds; for now, listen as our hosts recount their chaotic journey to watch Jin’s livestream and break down their favorite moments from the show, including stunning performances and fan interactions. Listen to the episode above or wherever you get your podcasts. Get Jin Tickets Here The episode kicks off with a discussion about K-Pop Demon Hunters, the Netflix animated film that’s been getting a lot of love lately. With its fantastic music, great storyline, and Korean cultural references, it’s a must-see for K-Pop fans. Kayla and Bethany dive into their favorite tracks from the movie and explain why it’s become their latest obsession. The main focus, however, is Jin’s concert! From his “super tuna” performance to his impressive vocals throughout the show, Kayla and Bethany discuss their favorite moments, including tracks like “Running Wild,” “Falling,” “Abyss,” and some BTS classics like “Microcosmos” and “Spring Day.” They talk about the fun surprises, including an outfit change and Jin’s playful interactions with the audience. Listen in as they share their recap of Jin’s show and livestream, and be sure to subscribe and review wherever you listen. Plus, get ready for Jin’s upcoming tour dates (get tickets here), which hit the US this month.
