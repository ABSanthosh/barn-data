  "text": "Even cutting-edge technology can benefit from an occasional reboot.Tokyo Machine is back with a new EP, Factory Reset, which sees the Japanese-inspired producer reclaim his position amongst bass music's elite. Out now via Monstercat, the five-track collection marks a creative turning point for the virtuosic producer, combining his signature chaotic basslines with darker, more brooding soundscapes. Thematically, the EP lives up to its name. The accompanying artwork—a half-human, half-cybernetic Tokyo Machine mid-reboot—echoes the sonic evolution inside. This is music for festivals, rave caves and the video game world all at once.\"I wanted Factory Reset to feel like a live show in your headphones,” Tokyo Machine explained in a press release. “It’s a more mature, dark and live-based sound that still keeps the nostalgic and synthetic core of Tokyo Machine.\"Opening track “THE FURIOUS” sets the tone with a concoction of digitized dubstep and glitchy bass house, crackling with robotic samples and frenetic vocal chops. Tokyo Machine's love of genre fluidity is on full display here. “MVP” follows, detonating with distorted guitar and laser synths before swerving into a pounding techno finale. It’s intense and cinematic in a way that evokes the feeling of a final boss fight. Scroll to ContinueRecommended Articles“SCREW UR FACE UP” does exactly what it promises, bringing twisted glitches and moshpit-level bass, while the previously released singles “LOCK N LOAD” and “WATCH OUT!” deliver rave maximalism with nostalgic, arcade-style flair.Backed by over 300 million streams, a Gold record and syncs across Rocket League, Meta, F1 and more, Tokyo Machine is hardly an underground name. But Factory Reset plays like an origin story reimagined and recharged. In the midst of his debut \"CHOMPO\" tour, he’s been selling out venues across the US and proving this reset is anything but quiet.
