Upon learning that it was a Boy George demo, he came up with the version that became “Let the Flowers Grow.” Take a listen below.Boy George added, “When I heard the mix, I was satiated in every way. I have always loved Pete’s voice and his writing on this adds a beautiful darkness. The production feels very epic, like Scott Walker.”The pair first met decades ago, when Boy George went backstage to meet Howard Devoto at a Magazine show that Bauhaus were supporting. “He struck me as a super-original, self-styled 17th-century fop,” Murphy said in the press release. “The second time I met him was when we walked into the BBC to do ‘Ziggy Stardust’ on Top of the Pops where Culture Club were also making their debut on the show. George greeted me very warmly and I discovered he was a Bauhaus fan.”",
