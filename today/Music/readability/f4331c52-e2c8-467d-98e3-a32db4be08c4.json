  "text": "Irish rap trio Kneecap have faced backlash from parts of the Jewish community and celebrities like Sharon Osbourne following their strong pro-Palestine, anti-Israel messaging during both weekends of Coachella. Now, the group has released a statement alleging that they’ve faced a “smear campaign” for their efforts. “Since our statements at Coachella — exposing the ongoing genocide against the Palestinian people — we have faced a coordinated smear campaign,” their statement reads. “For over a year, we have used our shows to call out the British and Irish governments’ complicity in war crimes.” Get Kneecap Tickets Here Kneecap added that they are already taking action against these “malicious efforts,” which they state are “largely emanating from the US” and based on “deliberate distortions and falsehoods.” The statement continues: “The reason Kneecap is being targeted is simple — we are telling the truth, and our audience is growing. Those attacking us want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide. We do not give a f*ck what religion anyone practices. We know there are massive numbers of Jewish people outraged by this genocide just as we are. What we care about is that governments of the countries we perform in are enabling some of the most horrific crimes of our lifetimes — and we will not stay silent. No media spin will change this. Our only concern is the Palestinian people — the 20,000 murdered children and counting. The young people at our gigs see through the lies. They stand on the side of humanity and justice. And that gives us great hope. Kneecap ❤️ It’s unclear whether this statement is related to Kneecap recently parting ways with their booking agency, Independent Artist Group, a move that could impact their ability to play US shows (IAG reportedly sponsored the group’s work visas). As a refresher, Kneecap led “Free Palestine” and anti-Margaret Thatcher chants during the first weekend of Coachella that were cut from the official livestream. They doubled down during their weekend two performance by bringing out streamer Hasan Piker to broadcast their protest and displaying, “Fuck Israel, free Palestine” on the screens behind them. “Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,” another message read on their stage screens. “It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes.” Kneecap member Mo Chara also gave a speech in which he said, “The Palestinians have nowhere to go, it’s their fucking home and they’re bombing them from the skies. If you’re not calling it a genocide what the fuck are you calling it?” He then led a “Free, free Palestine” chant. Following the second Coachella performance, groups like the pro-Israel nonprofit Creative Community for Peace criticized festival organizer Goldenvoice, and it was reported that CEO Paul Tollett was “blindsided” by the incident. Celebrities like Disturbed’s David Draiman and Sharon Osbourne spoke out against Kneecap’s actions, with the latter calling for the revocation of their work visas. Responding to Osbourne, Mo Chara pointed out that his group has consistently stood with Palestine since its formation and urged her to listen to Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs.”",
