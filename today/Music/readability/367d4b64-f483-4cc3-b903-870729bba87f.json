  "text": "After some internet sleuthing, the original 1998 pilot of Family Guy has resurfaced. Lost Media Wiki users recently uncovered the 16-minute episode on the online portfolio of Robert Paulsen, one of the animators who worked on it. Watch the long-lost pilot below. Originally, fans have only been able to watch the pilot’s first seven minutes, which were included as bonus content in the Family Guy Volume 2 DVD. That segment has been on the internet for a while now, but the complete version was found on the website of Paulson, who is credited at the end of the episode for work on compositing and digital ink and paint. After Fox provided him with $50,000, Seth MacFarlane created the 1998 pilot to convince the executives to greenlight the animated series. After liking what they saw, they went ahead with producing the show, which premiered in 1999 with the formal pilot “Death Has A Shadow.” Much of the plot from the 1998 version, like Stewie building a mind-control device and Peter getting wasted at a stag party, continued on in the official pilot. Notably, MacFarlane voices Chris Griffin with Seth Green having not been cast as the family’s son yet. Family Guy is currently running its 23rd season, which you can watch on Fox or Hulu.",
