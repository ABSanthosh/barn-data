  "text": "Tame Impala appear to have announced a new single, “End of Summer,” by posting a cryptic teaser on X/Twitter with the caption: “Clear 7 minutes of your schedule.” The clip shows a couple making out next to a motorbike in a dreamy natural setting, before a stranger walks up, rides off on the bike, and the screen fades to the words: “End Of Summer — Friday,” with trippy psychedelic electronic music playing underneath. Watch it below. The Tame Impala website further hints at the new release with a countdown set to expire this Friday. This is likely the first single from their long-awaited follow-up to The Slow Rush, which Kevin Parker teased on social media last week. Shortly afterward, they made a 12-inch untitled vinyl available for pre-order on their official store, which quickly sold out. Parker also premiered a brand new Tame Impala track during a surprise DJ set at Nitsa Club in Barcelona, following Primavera Sound. Clear 7 minutes of your schedule. pic.twitter.com/WzEV0IG7xC — Tame Impala (@tameimpala) July 23, 2025",
