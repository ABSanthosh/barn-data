  "text": "Closely following in second place was V's BTS bandmate Jung Kook with \"Never Let Go.\" V Courtesy Bighit Music V and Park Hyo Shin got festive to wrap up 2024, and it earned them a win on Billboard‘s recent fan-voted poll for best K-pop song of the year. Getting into the spirit of the season, fans voted for V and Park Hyo Shin’s collaboration, “Winter Ahead,” which won the competition with 50% of the votes. Closely following in second place was V’s BTS bandmate Jung Kook with “Never Let Go.” ATEEZ’s “Ice on My Teeth” came in third, followed by TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s “Deja Vu” and aespa’s “Supernova.” V has long been open about his love of jazz, and personally reached out to Park — with whom he has a “longstanding friendship,” according to a press release — to record “Winter Ahead” together. The track was written by Jesse Harris, the songwriter behind Norah Jones’ contemporary jazz-pop staple “Don’t Know Why.” Explore Explore BTS V See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news The 29-year-old superstar also released a hardcover photo book called TYPE 1 over the summer. “V participated in every step of the planning and production, from selecting the travel destination to deciding on the title and the photobook’s components, culminating in a 224-page photobook packed with various moments he wishes to share with ARMY,” according to a post about the project on HYBE’s app. Trending on Billboard Back in March, V dropped his first post-military enlistment single, “FRI(END)S,” which was written entirely in English. The song followed his September 2023 EP Layover. For 2025, V is set to reunite with his BTS bandmates after the group members all complete their mandatory South Korean military service.
