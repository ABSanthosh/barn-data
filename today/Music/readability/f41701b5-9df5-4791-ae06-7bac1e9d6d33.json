  "text": "Heart’s Nancy Wilson said the usage of their song “Barracuda” during Donald Trump’s parade celebrating the US Army’s 250th birthday on Saturday was done “without permission or authorization” from the hard rock duo. The parade coincided with Trump’s 79th birthday. “Earlier today, during a parade held in support of our nation’s military and organized by President Donald Trump, the song ‘Barracuda’ by Heart was played without permission or authorization from us,” Wilson wrote a post to Instagram late Saturday. The post was accompanied by a photo of Wilson donning a “No Kings But Us” hat, referencing that same weekend’s nationwide anti-Trump marches. Get Heart Tickets Here “‘Barracuda,’ written and performed by Ann [Wilson] and I, is a powerful piece of music that was never intended for political use,” she continued. “As daughters of a U.S. Marine Corps major, we hold a deep and abiding respect for the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. On a day meant to honor that service, it’s important that music used in such settings reflects not only the tone of the event but also the wishes of the artists who created it.” It’s no surprise the Wilson sisters are upset about Trump using “Barracuda” for his celebratory purposes. In March, Nancy said the track originated after facing continued misogyny in the ’70s rock industry. She believes “[‘Barracuda’] is “even more relevant in the salacious billionaire culture with the grab-them-by-the-p*ssy mentality” today, specifically pointing out Trump’s crude statements about women from the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape. In that same interview, Nancy pointed out how in the ’70s they felt embarrassed to call themselves Americans, but remarked “it’s more embarrassing now.” Heart’s “Barracuda” wasn’t the only questionable song choice during Saturday’s military parade—Creedence Clearwater Revival’s infamous anti-Vietnam War anthem “Fortunate Son” also blared as troops marched down Constitution Avenue.",
