  "text": "As anticipation builds for Black Sabbath's historic farewell concert in Birmingham this weekend, Sharon Osbourne recently revealed that a major artist was removed from the event's lineup after demanding to be paid — a move that apparently went against the all-charity ethos of the show. Speaking with Billboard, Sharon confirmed that one high-profile performer was cut from the Back To The Beginning concert after insisting on making a profit. \"And it's not the time to make a profit,\" she stated. \"After the show, I'll let everybody know who it was. I think people will be shocked.\" Last month, Sharon told Metal Hammer that she had clashed with a band's management during the planning stages of the event. \"I had a huge, huge to-do with a manager over this celebration for Ozzy and Sabbath,\" she said. \"It was probably the worst way I've felt in years… He's now going around making up bullshit lies because I threw his band off the bill.\" While Sharon has not named the artist or band involved, she clarified that it was not Iron Maiden — quelling speculation due to the band's past feud with the Osbournes during the 2005 Ozzfest tour. Fans online had also speculated that Tool had been dropped from the lineup after their name was omitted from livestream promotions, but the band — led by Maynard James Keenan — is confirmed to still be performing. Ozzy and Sharon's daughter, Kelly Osbourne, further shut down rumors that Megadeth was the mystery band. When someone speculated on Instagram that it was Dave Mustaine's group, Kelly replied, \"Nope! Not him!\" So far, only one confirmed artist, Wolfgang Van Halen, has been removed from the Back To The Beginning lineup — and only due to scheduling conflicts. This has led many to believe the mystery artist was cut before the lineup was publicly revealed in February. Set to take place this weekend at Villa Park in Birmingham, Back To The Beginning is being billed as Black Sabbath's final hometown performance, featuring the band's original lineup: Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward — marking their first time playing together in 20 years. The all-day event is produced by Live Nation, livestreamed globally by Mercury Studios in partnership with Kiswe, and hosted by actor Jason Momoa. The lineup also includes performances by Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Lamb of God, Anthrax, and more. A special \"supergroup\" of musicians will also perform throughout the day. Want More Metal?
