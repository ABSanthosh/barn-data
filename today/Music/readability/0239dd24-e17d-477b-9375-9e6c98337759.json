  "text": "The White Stripes have shared a new music video for “Red Rain” to commemorate a special, 20th anniversary edition of Get Behind Me Satan that dropped today, June 27th. Orders are ongoing. The stop-motion video relies on a classic color palette of black, white, and red, and was directed by Conor Callahan. With surreal imagery — including Jack and Meg White sharing a stage; now there’s a thought — this explosive track has taken on a new form. Get Jack White Tickets Here The video features the recently released Super7 action figures of Jack and Meg White as seen on the cover of their penultimate album. Kooky and quaint, the audio-visual project also features a wall made out of 5,980 miniature bricks held together by royal icing. Get Behind Me Satan, which won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album in 2006, turned 20 years old on June 7. The reissue is a double-LP package that comprises one red-smoke vinyl record and one clear vinyl record with red and black smoke. Earlier this month, The White Stripes’ sophomore album De Stijl also celebrated its 25th anniversary. Read Consequence‘s retrospective of the sleeper hit here. The pair from Detroit officially disbanded in 2011, but Jack White has continued to release new music and perform it across the world. After recently wrapping up his “No Name” tour, which Consequence named one of the Best Live Shows of last year, he will return to the stage for a series of headlining performances at Bourbon \u0026 Beyond, Riot Fest, and CBGB Festival. Get your passes here.",
