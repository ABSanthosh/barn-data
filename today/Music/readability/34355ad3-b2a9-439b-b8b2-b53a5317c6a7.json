  "text": "Among the many tributes pouring in for Ozzy Osbourne upon news of the metal legend’s death on Tuesday morning (July 22nd), his longtime Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi has declared “there won’t ever be another like him.” Iommi founded Sabbath in 1968 with Ozzy, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward. They came to be known as the “godfathers of heavy metal” for pretty much inventing the genre. “I just can’t believe it,” the guitarist wrote on his X/Twitter account. “My dear dear friend Ozzy has passed away only weeks after our show at Villa Park. It’s just such heartbreaking news that I can’t really find the words, there won’t ever be another like him. Geezer, Bill and myself have lost our brother. My thoughts go out to Sharon and all the Osbourne family. Rest in peace Oz. Tony.” It was only 17 days ago that Ozzy and Sabbath gave their final performances at the historic “Back to the Beginning” concert at Villa Park in their hometown of Birmingham, England. The all-day lineup also included sets from Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Tool, Slayer, Pantera, and more. Butler and Ward have also paid tribute to Ozzy, with Geezer writing, “Goodbye dear friend – thanks for all those years – we had some great fun. 4 kids from Aston- who’d have thought, eh? So glad we got to do it one last time, back in Aston. Love you.” Ward wrote, “Where will I find you now? In the memories, our unspoken embraces, our missed phone calls, no, you’re forever in my heart. Deepest condolences to Sharon and all family members. RIP Sincere regrets to all the fans. Never goodbye. Thank you forever.” See the tributes to Ozzy Osbourne from his Black Sabbath bandmates below. I just can’t believe it!
