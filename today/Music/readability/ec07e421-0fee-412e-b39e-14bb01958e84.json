Travis Scott appears at CACTI Park in the Palm Beaches, Florida, to throw the ceremonial first pitch for the Houston Astros' Spring Training Opening Day game against the Washington Nationals on Feb. 23, 2025. Courtesy of the Houston Astros Travis Scott had an eventful Sunday in sunny Florida, where he was not only the one to throw the ceremonial first pitch for the Houston Astros at the team’s spring training opener, but was also the face of a bobblehead created in his likeness for the occasion. The February Billboard cover star appeared at the Feb. 23 Astros game against the Washington Nationals at CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches, the Major League Baseball training facility for which the rapper, a longtime Astros fan, has a multi-year, naming-rights deal; he’s also got a hard seltzer brand named CACTI, and a record label and publishing company called Cactus Jack — plus his non-profit that provides young people with educational and creative resources, Cactus Jack Foundation. According to a press release issued on Sunday, the first 2,000 fans at CACTI Park were given a limited edition Travis Scott bobblehead that has him up at bat and decked out in a custom “CACTI” baseball uniform. Scott’s bobblehead is perched upon a base featuring his name and the CACTI brand logo. The Travis Scott limited-edition bobblehead, designed with Scott’s signature style. Courtesy of the Houston Astros At the game, Scott — whose Days Before Rodeo mixtape re-release on vinyl earned him his fourth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart in fall 2024 — was photographed meeting with Astros pitcher Bryan Abreu and the team’s green alien-inspired mascot, Orbit.

Courtesy of the Houston Astros Earlier in the week, on Wednesday (Feb. 19), Scott unveiled the Sealie Flood + Bernice Webster Corner garden, named after his two grandmothers, with students at Houston’s Highland Heights Elementary School. The Cactus Jack Foundation initiative will provide food for food-insecure youth across the city. Scott hosted his annual Cactus Jack HBCU Softball Classic at Daikin Park in Houston last week. The event welcomed Tyla, Swae Lee, Metro Boomin, Teyana Taylor, Mariah the Scientist, BIA and more. Also among Scott’s many endeavors in February was the announcement of his foundation’s partnership with the Fashion Scholarship Fund to launch the Cactus Jack Design Ethos 101 Program, an online program that will award students with $10,000 each and mentorship.
