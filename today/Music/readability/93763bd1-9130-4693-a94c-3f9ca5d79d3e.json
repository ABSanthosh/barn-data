  "text": "Vocalist and drummer Joshua \"Nassaru\" Ward – best known for his work in Voraath, Xael, and Olkoth – was sadly killed on December 31. Both Lambgoat and Ghost Cult report that Ward was killed in a drunk driving accident, though local news in the Greenville County area have only released the names of two victims at this time – Audrey Marie Ross and Amanda Lynn Leroux. A GoFundMe has also been launched to help with Ward's funeral costs, which you can donate to right here. A description on that page reads: \"Our close friend and family member, Josh Ward, passed away last night in a traffic accident. Josh dedicated his life to the music he created, the martial arts he practiced and instilled into everyone who had the privilege of training with him, and last but not least his son, Kai. \"We are all devastated by this loss and were not prepared for the high cost of a funeral service. We want to give Josh the memorial he deserves, to honor his memory and say our last goodbyes. I am currently asking for donations to help cover the cost of Josh's funeral. All donations would go to the memorial and funeral. All remaining will be gifted to his son, Kai.\" News of Ward's death has quickly spread throughout social media. We extend our deepest condolences to Ward's friends and family at this time. Sick Drummer Magazine: \"Woke up to hear the horrible news about the passing of our dear friend, drummer Joshua Nassaru Ward of Voraath. Our deepest condolences go to his family, friends, and bandmates. Josh was killed by a drunk driver in an accident last night. A great drummer and a really good person. \"Josh will also be missed by his community who he helped by delivering goods and services to people stranded in remote areas after the recent floods. He looked out for everyone. R.I.P. If you can, please go to his page and donate to his family fund.\" Scott Eames of Extreme Management Group: \"Heavy hearted news to begin the new year Our brother Joshua Nassaru Ward passed last night. A true and honest friend; his laughter, kindness \u0026 blast-beats will forever ignite our torches. Josh was a modern day warrior. We will miss him deeply.\" Reaping Asmodeia drummer Daniel Koppy: \"Not the things I wanted to read to start the 2025. So sad to hear the passing of Joshua Nassaru Ward and his fiance and 2 friends. Why are people such heartless scum to disregard other humans, along with themselves, to drink and drive. So fucking senseless and sad. I only got to know josh over the last year or so, having exchanges about fitness and drums. He seemed to have a big heart and helped a lot of people. Take care of the ones you love my friends. Our time is never guaranteed. My sincere condolences to his family/friends/loved ones. Rest easy my drum brother.\" Want More Metal?
