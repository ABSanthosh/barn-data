  "text": "Little Miley makes an adorable appearance in Billy Ray's slideshow. Billy Ray Cyrus and Miley Cyrus Vijat Mohindra/Peacock/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Billy Ray Cyrus is celebrating Father’s Day with a trip down memory lane. The “Achy Breaky Heart” star posted several family photos in honor of the day on Instagram and X, and wished a “Happy Father’s Day” to all those around him. The mini picture collection includes snapshots of Billy Ray and family members throughout the years. One cute highlight is a very young Miley Cyrus giving the camera quite a serious gaze while riding a pink, toddler-sized trike with handlebar tassels. “‘My Grandfather told my Father’… and luckily he taught me ….when your lost …. ‘Stand Still’. Happy Father’s Day to everyone ! Mothers… sisters ….brothers ….friends included !” Cyrus captioned the picture slideshow on Sunday (June 15). Trending on Billboard Apparently not shown in the country singer’s Father’s Day post is son Trace, who’s seemingly had a fraught relationship as of late with Billy Ray, whom he recently said is “the lamest man ever to walk planet earth.” The Metro Station musician referred to him as a “delusional, evil person” last week — claiming he skipped the funeral of his “Mammie,” the late mother of Tish Cyrus, back when Billy Ray was still married to Tish. His comments came upon seeing that Billy Ray “flew to Italy for a fashion show” (with girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley). “This man is so hungry for fame it’s pathetic,” wrote Trace on June 10. Miley’s had more positive thoughts to share. In an interview with The New York Times, the Something Beautiful singer shared candid remarks on her father’s current relationship with the English actress. “As I’ve gotten older, I’m respecting my parents as individuals instead of as parents,” she said. “My mom’s really loved my dad for her whole life, and I think being married to someone in the music industry and not being a part of it is obviously really hard,” Miley explained. “And so I think I took on some of my mom’s hurt as my own, because it hurt her more than it hurt me as an adult, and so I owned a lot of her pain. But now that my mom is so in love with my stepdad, who I completely adore, and now that my dad, I see him finding happiness, too — I can love them both as individuals instead of as a parental pairing.” “I’m being an adult about it,” she added. “At first it’s hard, because the little kid in you reacts before the adult in you can go, ‘Yes, that’s your dad, but that’s just another person that deserves to be in his bliss and to be happy.’ My child self has caught up.” See Billy Ray’s Father’s Day post on Instagram here.
