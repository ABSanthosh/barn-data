Barbra Streisand and Paul McCartney attend Apollo in the Hamptons at The Creeks on August 16, 2014 in East Hampton, New York. Kevin Mazur/WireImage Barbra Streisand has recruited Paul McCartney to join forces for a new version of his 2012 single “My Valentine,” which was released Friday (May 16) via Columbia Records. “What if it rained? We didn’t care/ He said that someday soon the sun was gonna shine/ And he was right, this love of mine/ My valentine,” Babs coos on the opening verse before Sir Paul, takes over to sing, “As days and nights would pass me by/ I’d tell myself that I was waiting for a sign/ Then she appeared, a love so fine/ My valentine” over a lush combination of strings and piano. The cozy love song originally served as the lead single from the former Beatle’s 2012 solo album Kisses on the Bottom, where it was one of just two original songs on the LP and featured a starry assist from Eric Clapton on guitar. Trending on Billboard Now, the reimagined version for two is the second preview of Streisand’s upcoming duets album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, which is out June 27 and acts as a sequel 11 years in the making to her Grammy-nominated No. 1 LP Partners from 2014. Ahead of releasing the duet, the legendary Funny Girl star shared a snap of the longtime friends on her Instagram, writing, “What a joy it was to record ‘My Valentine’ with @paulmccartney. To share time with him in the studio was truly special.” Streisand’s 37th studio set will also feature guest turns from A-listers like Hozier (the previously released “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face”), James Taylor (“Secret O’ Life”), Bob Dylan (“The Very Thought of You”), Tim McGraw (“I Love Us”) and Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande (“One Heart, One Voice”).
