  "text": "There can be only one Highlander, but it’d be a weird movie if there was only one actor in it. Hence the news that Russell Crowe has been cast in the upcoming remake of Highlander, starring one-time Superman Henry Cavill and directed by John Wick co-creator Chad Stahelski. Collider reports that Crowe has been cast in an unspecified role, which means he could either follow in the footsteps of Clancy Brown’s memorable performance as the first film’s villainous Kurgan, or play a role similar to that of Sean Connery’s mentor figure. (Connery was a Scot playing a Spaniard in the Highlander films, so maybe the Australian Crowe can play a South African or something equally out of nowhere.) Stahelski’s Highlander is set to go into production this fall as an Amazon Studios movie. For more, check out where the series lands on our ranking of the best action movie franchises.",
