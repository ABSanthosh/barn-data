Fire personnel respond to homes destroyed while a helicopter drops water as the Palisades Fire grows in Pacific Palisades, California on January 7, 2025. A fast-moving wildfire in a Los Angeles suburb burned buildings and sparked panic, with thousands ordered to evacuate January 7, 2025 as \"life threatening\" winds whipped the region. Frightened residents abandoned their cars on one of the only roads in and out of the upscale Pacific Palisades area, fleeing on foot from the 770-acre (310-hectare) blaze engulfing an area crammed with multi-million dollar homes in the Santa Monica Mountains. DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images Español Since Tuesday (Jan. 7), ferocious wildfires have been blazing through the greater Los Angeles region, causing extensive damage to life and property, including those of many individuals working in the music business. With nearly 180,000 residents impacted by evacuation orders, at least five dead and thousands of structures damaged or destroyed, music industry organizations are finding ways to provide relief for impacted music workers. Below, find a list of some of the music organizations offering relief for L.A. industry workers. We will continue to update this list as more announcements are made. (For health alerts, evacuation updates and shelter information, check out L.A. County’s emergency website here.) MusiCares The Recording Academy’s philanthropic arm MusiCares is offering financial assistance. A representative from MusiCares stated, “MusiCares is a resource to music professionals impacted by the fires in the Los Angeles area. MusiCares provides short-term disaster relief, including $1,500 in financial assistance and a $500 grocery card, to music professionals impacted. MusiCares disaster relief is intended to cover short-term costs, should you incur costs from evacuating (hotel, food, supplies). MusiCares is also able to provide additional support for individuals with considerable impact, including damage to their homes, medical issues, damaged music equipment or longer-term relocation needs. MusiCares support is available to music professionals (in any capacity) with 5 years employment or credit on 6 commercially-released recordings. If you would like to request support from MusiCares, please reach out to musicaresrelief@musicares.org.” Along with The Recording Academy, MusiCares announced Thursday (Jan. 9) that it had launched a Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort to support music professionals impacted by the crisis. The organizations kicked off the fund with a joint $1 million donation. We Are Moving the Needle Microgrants Wildfire Relief Fund Launched on Thursday (Jan. 9), the fund is designed to support “early and mid-career producers, engineers, and creators who have lost studio space or gear” in the wildfires.

Entertainment Community Fund Emergency financial assistance from the Entertainment Community Fund is open to “eligible performing arts and entertainment professionals” who are “in times of unexpected critical need.” It can help with “basic living expenses” including health care and housing.

Once we receive the application, we will work with you to complete the application.” You can apply for relief here. Backline Mental health non-profit Backline is sharing resources for musicians in Los Angeles via social media and offering its own services. “Know that Backline is here for you and that you are not alone,” the organization wrote on Instagram. “You can reach out to us via our case submission form and a Case Manager will contact you to help you get the long-term support you need. If you need immediate assistance, please reach out to the Disaster Distress Hotline for free 24/7 support by calling 1-800-985-5990.” Sweet Relief Musicians Fund Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, the non-profit helping musicians and music industry workers in need, has launched a natural disaster relief fund for those in Los Angeles County and the surrounding areas. Applications are also open for those seeking relief, with funds raised going toward loss of music-related equipment, medical bills related to the fires and other vital living expenses. Head here to donate or fill out an application. Guitar Center Music Foundation The Guitar Center Music Foundation has announced on its website that it is offering support to L.A.-area musicians and music programs affected by the devastating fires.
