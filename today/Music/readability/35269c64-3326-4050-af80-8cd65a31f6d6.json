  "text": "If the all-star lineup for the final Black Sabbath show wasn’t already enough for you, Guns N’ Roses and Tool have now been added to the historic concert event. As previously reported, the “Back to the Beginning” concert at Villa Park in Birmingham, England, on July 5th will mark the final shows for both Black Sabbath and their singer, Ozzy Osbourne. Guns N’ Roses, Tool, and Rival Sons are among the newly added bands for the all-day extravaganza, joining an already jam-packed lineup of Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Gojira, Halestorm, Alice in Chains, Lamb of God, Anthrax, Mastodon, and more. Other new acts include producer Andrew Watt, David Ellefson (ex-Megadeth), Mike Bordin (Faith No More), Vernon Reid (Living Colour), Whitfield Crane (Ugly Kid Joe), and the host of the event, actor Jason Momoa. They join previously announced individual musicians such as Billy Corgan, Chad Smith, Fred Durst, Jonathan Davis, Ghost’s Papa V Pepetua (Tobias Forge), and the show’s musical director, Tom Morello. Ozzy just revealed that he won’t be playing a full set with Sabbath, rather “little bits and pieces” due to his various health issues, including his battle with Parkinson’s disease. See the updated lineup poster for the “Back to the Beginning” concert below. Tickets to the event sold out within 16 minutes of going on sale this past Friday (February 14th).",
