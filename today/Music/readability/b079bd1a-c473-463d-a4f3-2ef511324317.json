  "text": "Wednesday 13 knows the music is campy – but that's half the fun. His newest single, \"In Misery,\" saw the release of the accompanying music video on Thursday. The whimsical frontman's upcoming record, Mid Death Crisis, is due out on April 25th, with his North American There's No Such Thing As Monsters tour currently underway. The song is fun, and the accompanying record was dubbed by Wednesday 13 as a \"leave-your-brain-at-the-door\" rager. With 12 tracks, one featuring Faster Pussycat's Taime Downe, the record is chalk full of horror-inspired anthems. The current tour is celebrating 20 years of Wednesday 13's record Transylvania 90210 while showing off Murderdoll hits. Check out live dates below. You can preorder the record here.
