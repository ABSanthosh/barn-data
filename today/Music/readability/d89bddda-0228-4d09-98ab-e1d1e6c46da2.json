  "text": "John Mulaney is set to host a weekly live variety talk show for Netflix. The news was announced by Netflix chief content officer Bela Bajaria during the Bloomberg Screentime conference on Thursday. Get John Mulaney Tickets Here Set to debut in 2025, the upcoming series will be modeled after John Mulaney Presents: Everybody’s in LA, the limited run of live shows he hosted as part of Netflix is a Joke Festival in May 2024. “I was there at a couple of the tapings, and it was so bold and original and fresh and unprecedented, unpredictable,” Bajaria said (via THR). “And I think it’ll be really fun to get to do a live show with him. Each episode of Everybody’s in LA’s six-episode run involved a non-topical topic (coyotes, helicopters, paranormal) with Mulaney joined by an all-star panel of guests that included the likes of David Letterman, Jon Stewart, Nate Bergatze, Hannah Gadsby, John Carpenter, Nikki Glaser, and Earthquake, as well as experts on the topic at hand. It’s worth noting that those topics were rarely actually discussed. In lieu of commercials, the episodes aired sketches and interstitials, some featuring other comics and others involving human interest pieces. There was also an announcer (the great Richard Kind!), a robot that delivered refreshments to the guests, and musical performances from Beck, Weezer, and Joyce Manor. At other points in the show, Mulaney took calls from viewers. Needless to say, we absolutely loved the show, ranking it as one of our favorite watches from the first half of 2024. In the meantime, Mulaney is set to host Saturday Night Live on November 2nd in an episode featuring musical guest Chappell Roan. He’s also set to star in the Broadway production of All In: Comedy About Love by Simon Rich.",
