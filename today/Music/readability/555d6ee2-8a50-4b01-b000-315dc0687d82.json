  "text": "Kvelertak has sadly split with longtime guitarist Bjarte Lund Rolland, who played for the band between 2007 and present day. Furthermore, Kvelertak says their upcoming shows up to and including the one in Germany on February 28, 2025 will be their last ones \"to experience Kvelertak live for the foreseeable future.\" Hopefully Kvelertak isn't going on a hiatus or anything like that, but I guess we'll see what happens. Read the band's full statement below and check out their live dates here. \"Guitarist Bjarte Lund Rolland is leaving Kvelertak and will therefore not be joining the upcoming tour. After five albums and countless concerts around the world, Bjarte and Kvelertak are now going their separate ways,\" wrote Kvelertak. \"The upcoming tour will proceed as planned, starting in Norway on October 31, 2024, and ending in Germany on February 28, 2025. This will be the last chance to experience Kvelertak live for the foreseeable future. \"Bjarte's talent, riffs, songs and stage personality have been a central part of putting Kvelertak on the world map. We thank him for 5 albums and many great years on the road. Right now we don't know what the future holds. But the Krøterveg Te Helvete Tour continues with full force until what will be the last concert for the forseeable future in Munich, February 28, 2025. We want to thank the fans for their support and look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming months!\" Want More Metal?
