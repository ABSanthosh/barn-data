  "text": "Disturbed frontman David Draiman has (predictably) voiced sharp criticism toward Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello following Morello's recent public praise of Irish hip-hop group Kneecap. Morello, known for his outspoken political views, recently cited Kneecap as the most powerful modern successor to Rage Against The Machine's activist legacy. However, Kneecap's controversial stance on Israel and ongoing war in Gaza has sparked backlash—most vocally from Draiman, who took to social media to condemn Morello's remarks. In a recent appearance on The Strombo Show, Morello lauded Kneecap for their bold political messaging and activism, calling them \"clearly the Rage Against The Machine of now.\" He elaborated, \"What they're doing in their art is what people could probably stand to do more in their lives: to really speak truth to power.\" He further defended the group against accusations of extremism, stating: “What they’re doing in their art is what people could probably stand to do more in their lives: to really speak truth to power. And, you know, Kneecap are not terrorists. What is terroristic is, you know, 20,000 dead Palestinian children. That’s the story. Not, I mean, some Irish rappers who don’t like that that’s happening. [That] should not be the story.” Kneecap's vocal criticism of Israel and its military actions in Gaza has made international headlines in recent months. One of the group's members, Mo Chara, was charged in the UK with a terror-related offense after allegedly brandishing a Hezbollah flag during a live show in late 2024. The trio further stirred controversy during their Coachella performances this past April, using their platform to accuse Israel of genocide. The backlash from that appearance led to their removal from the roster of the Independent Artist Group talent agency. Draiman, who has long been an outspoken supporter of Israel and a proud advocate of his Jewish identity, was quick to respond to Morello's endorsement of the group. Posting to X (formerly Twitter) this morning, July 12, Draiman wrote: \"Shameful. Truly. Wish I could say I was shocked. Guess my family doesn't count, when it comes to my ‘friend's' virtue signaling for those who support terror, and incite Jew hatred.\" The statement drew immediate attention from both fans and fellow musicians, with reactions reflecting the increasingly polarized discourse surrounding the Gaza conflict and the intersection of art, activism, and identity. Draiman has drawn some pretty hefty criticism over the past two years ever since he visited Israel with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and signed an artillery shell with the phrase \"Fuck Hamas.\" Draiman was also booed during the Back To The Beginning show, which he's since addressed. To reiterate – Draiman signed the missile in June 2024. This was after the events of October 7, 2023 when Palestinian militant groups led by Hamas, launched a large-scale, coordinated attack on Israel from Gaza. The assault resulted in the deaths of approximately 1,300 Israelis – most of them civilians – in areas near the Gaza border and at a music festival. Additionally, over 200 individuals were taken hostage and transported into Gaza. Since that attack, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has drawn widespread international criticism, with tens of thousands of Palestinians killed and more than 1.9 million displaced. Numerous global leaders, human rights organizations, and legal experts have raised alarms to the points where the word \"genocide\" is being used quite a bit (and \"war crimes\") to describe Israel's actions.
