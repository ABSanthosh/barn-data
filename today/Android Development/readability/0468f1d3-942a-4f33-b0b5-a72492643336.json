  "text": "Kotlin has been around for quite a few years. Like any other excited developer, I picked it up right after Google announced first-class support for Kotlin for Android app development. Using the language and reading articles on it, I wasn't convinced that there couldn't be a better publication on the language. A lot of publications leaned towards hands-on tutorials with Kotlin, mostly on the transition from Java. A good number focused on Kotlin from the perspective of an Android developer. They are doing an outstanding job in those niches. I wanted to do something different. Reading blogs like Swift by Sundell and Flavio Copes for over a year, I wanted to take a similar approach. Pick out specific language feature or aspect and discuss on that, casually — no tutorials on how to get stuff done. There's plenty already. What I want to do is to have an open discussion on Kotlin topics and show you some cool tricks that I have learnt while writing Kotlin code for over two years. And that was the primary motivation behind starting this publication. Share my knowledge with the community by publishing one article every Sunday. If you are looking for a similar publication, you have come to the right place. Bookmark this site or subscribe to the RSS feed to get notified whenever I publish an article. You can also subscribe to the monthly newsletter, which will cover all things OkKotlin and more. Read the newsletter page for more information on that. That said, I will try to do justice to this idea by putting up my best work, every single week, hoping that you will join me on this journey.",
