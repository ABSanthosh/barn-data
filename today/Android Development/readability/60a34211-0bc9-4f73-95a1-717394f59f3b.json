  "text": "In Jetpack Compose, you’ll often deal with “one-time” events — ephemeral actions like navigating to a new screen or showing a toast message once. These aren’t ongoing states you want to continuously observe; they’re moment-in-time signals that should occur once and then vanish.Two popular tools for delivering events from your ViewModel to the UI are Channels and SharedFlow. While both can emit values, they differ in fundamental ways. Channels naturally align with one-time events, while SharedFlow is more suited for continuous, shared data streams.Understanding One-Time EventsA one-time event is something like:Navigation: After a network call completes, navigate to a detail screen just once.Toast Messages: Show a “Hello!” toast after a button click and don’t repeat it unless explicitly triggered again.The challenge lies in ensuring these events happen exactly once. After a screen rotation or returning to a screen, you don’t want old events replaying themselves.Why Channels Are Ideal for One-Time EventsA Kotlin Channel works like a one-way mailbox. You send an event from the ViewModel, and once the UI reads it, that event is gone. No automatic replay, no old messages showing up again later.Key Advantages:No Automatic Replay: Once the UI consumes the event, it disappears. You don’t need special logic to prevent “old” events from re-firing after a rotation.Easy Re-Emission: If you want to show the same toast message again later, just send it again. Each send() call is a fresh event. You don’t have to “reset” anything.Buffering with Channel.BUFFERED: Using Channel.BUFFERED gives your channel a small queue. If the UI isn’t ready to collect at the exact moment you send the event, that event is stored until the UI starts collecting. Without buffering, the producer may have to suspend until the consumer is ready, or events could be missed depending on the channel type.Example Using a Channel to Show a Toast:// In the ViewModelprivate val eventChannel = Channel\u003cUiEvent\u003e(Channel.BUFFERED)val events = eventChannel.receiveAsFlow()fun showHelloToast() { viewModelScope.launch { eventChannel.send(UiEvent.ShowToast(\"Hello!\")) }}sealed class UiEvent { data class ShowToast(val message: String): UiEvent()}// In the Compose UI@Composablefun MyScreen(viewModel: MyViewModel) { val context = LocalContext.current LaunchedEffect(Unit) { viewModel.events.collect { event -\u003e if (event is UiEvent.ShowToast) { Toast.makeText(context, event.message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show() } } }}When showHelloToast() runs, the UI displays “Hello!” exactly once. Rotate the screen? No replay. Need to show it again? Just call showHelloToast() again. The UI receives it as a brand-new event.What If Multiple Events Accumulate?If you send multiple events in quick succession and the UI hasn’t collected them yet, the channel’s buffer stores these events. The UI will process them one by one when it’s ready. Without Channel.BUFFERED, you risk the sender suspending until the consumer catches up, which can complicate timing. With buffering, you get a small queue ensuring smoother delivery of multiple back-to-back events.SharedFlow for One-Time Events: Potential PitfallsSharedFlow is designed as a hot stream to broadcast values to multiple subscribers. It can replay recent values to new collectors, ensuring that late subscribers don’t miss critical updates. While powerful, this design isn’t naturally aligned with pure one-time events.No Built-In One-Time Guarantee: You must carefully configure replay = 0 to avoid old events. With no replay, if the UI isn’t collecting at the moment of emission, that event is lost. If you do set replay \u003e 0, you risk serving old events to new or returning collectors.How Replay Works and Why It Can Be Dangerous:SharedFlow’s replay mechanism stores the last N events. When a new collector starts collecting—or when an old one stops and re-subscribes—it immediately receives those replayed events. While a continuously observing subscriber never sees the same event twice, a new or re-subscribing collector does see those old events.For ephemeral UI actions, this can cause unintended re-triggers. Imagine the user leaves a screen and returns later. If the UI re-subscribes to a SharedFlow with replay = 1, it will immediately receive the most recent event—potentially showing a stale toast or triggering an old navigation again. It’s not that the same subscriber sees the same event twice continuously, but re-subscription makes SharedFlow treat them like a new collector, delivering old events as if they were new.Example With SharedFlow (Not Recommended for One-Time):// In the ViewModelprivate val _uiEvents = MutableSharedFlow\u003cUiEvent\u003e(replay = 0)val uiEvents = _uiEvents.asSharedFlow()fun showHelloToast() { viewModelScope.launch { _uiEvents.emit(UiEvent.ShowToast(\"Hello!\")) }}If the UI isn’t collecting at the moment showHelloToast() runs, the event is missed. To fix that, you might set replay = 1, but then a new subscriber joining later gets the last event as if it were fresh, potentially causing a stale action to repeat. It’s a delicate balancing act that channels avoid altogether.When SharedFlow ShinesThough less suited to one-time events, SharedFlow excels when you need continuous, broadcasted data. Consider a live scoreboard:Live Scoreboard Example:With replay = 1, a new subscriber immediately gets the current score and all future updates, ensuring everyone stays in sync. Here, old events are beneficial since the latest score is relevant state, not an ephemeral trigger.Summaries at a GlanceChannel (for one-time events):What It Is: A one-way queue that discards events after consumption.Why Ideal: No automatic replay. Just send events as needed, and each new emission is a fresh event. Buffering ensures timing isn’t an issue. Perfect for quick, vanish-after-use triggers like a single toast.SharedFlow (for one-time events):What It Is: A hot stream that can replay recent values to new or re-subscribing collectors.Why Less Ideal: Avoiding stale replays is tough. Without replay, you might miss events entirely; with replay, new or returning subscribers might receive old events as if they were new. This can cause duplicate triggers of actions that should only happen once. SharedFlow is better for ongoing data streams where replaying the latest value is actually helpful.ConclusionFor simple one-time events in Jetpack Compose — actions that must be delivered once and then forgotten — Channels provide a clean, predictable path. With buffering, you ensure events aren’t lost due to timing. Each emission is a new event, and nothing ever comes back to haunt you.SharedFlow’s real strengths lie in scenarios where continuous data updates and multiple subscribers benefit from replaying the latest values. For strictly ephemeral, single-fire actions, SharedFlow often introduces more complexity than necessary.Armed with these insights, you can confidently choose the right tool. For that one-time toast or navigation command, reach for a channel. For ongoing, shared data streams, SharedFlow is your best friend.",
