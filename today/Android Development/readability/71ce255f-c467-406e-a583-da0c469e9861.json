  "text": "AI Assistant JetBrains AI News JetBrains launches Mellum, a proprietary large language model (LLM) specifically designed to assist software developers. Currently available only with JetBrains AI Assistant, Mellum provides faster, smarter, and more contextually aware cloud code completion. Please note that cloud-based code completion in AI Assistant is only available with the AI Pro subscription or in the trial version. Local code completion is bundled and enabled by default in all paid IntelliJ-based IDEs. There are hundreds of LLMs. Why Mellum? Unlike typical large language models, Mellum is built specifically for coding. We are focused on creating a smaller, optimized model that significantly reduces latency, offering developers suggestions almost instantly. This makes Mellum more efficient than many of the third-party models currently available on the market. Mellum already supports code completion for popular programming languages like Java, Kotlin, Python, Go, and PHP. To get support for even more languages, join our Early Access Program.  How does Mellum perform? Currently, we don’t offer the ability to switch between different LLMs for code completion. Instead, JetBrains AI Assistant automatically selects Mellum for this task. It’s worth noting that since Mellum has been powering code completion in AI Assistant, it has delivered the following remarkable results: Completion latency has been reduced to one third of its previous time, reflecting a significant decrease in the time taken to complete tasks. The acceptance rate of the completion suggestions powered by the Mellum model is about 40%, which is considered a solid benchmark in the industry. The cancel rate is now three to four times lower compared to the previous version of AI Assistant. The total number of completions shown has more than doubled compared to the previous version. Mellum’s performance is also backed up by user reviews. By the way, thanks for being so active in the comments. We read each and every piece of feedback you give us! For more on how Mellum enhances code completion, visit our latest blog post. Deep integration with JetBrains IDEs Mellum’s power isn’t just in its speed and accuracy; it also benefits from deep integration with JetBrains IDEs. This synergy between the client-side IDE and server-side AI logic allows Mellum to deliver contextually aware code suggestions that are tailored to each project’s needs. A commitment to privacy JetBrains has always been committed to privacy, and Mellum continues this tradition. The model has been trained solely on publicly available, permissively licensed code.  Ready to see what Mellum can do for you? Check out JetBrains AI Assistant today.
