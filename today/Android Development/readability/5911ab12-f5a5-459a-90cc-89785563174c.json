This release brings stability and final APIs for developers to test and integrate into their apps.The blog covers the removal of the legacy PNG-based emoji font, which means some devices will only have the vector-based COLRv1 file. Android 15 also introduces several new features that you can take advantage of, including predictive back animations, Low Light Boost for improved low-light photography, a variable font for CJK languages, insights into app startup, screen recording detection, partial screen sharing, linking specific views with Credential Manager requests, edge-to-edge drawing by default, and generated previews for app widget providers.You are encouraged to test your apps, libraries, tools, and game engines for compatibility with Android 15 and update any necessary SDKs.Android Developers blog üìùSamsung‚Äôs Galaxy Unpacked event unveiled the latest foldables, wearables, and more, including the Galaxy Z Fold6, Z Flip6, Galaxy Watch7, and Watch Ultra.
