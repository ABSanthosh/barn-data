  "text": "Internal Testing in PracticeEven in my personal projects, I follow the same internal testing workflow I use in production environments. This section outlines the full process — from uploading a build to promoting it — step by step.Step 1 — Google Play Console: Entry PointEverything starts in Google Play Console. Under the Test and release section, there are several release tracks available: internal, closed, and open. For pre-production validation, I use the Internal Testing track.It simulates the real user flow while keeping the release limited to selected testers.Step 1 — Google Play Console: Entry PointStep 2 — Uploading the Release BuildNext, I upload the new app bundle to the Internal Testing track. This is the same build that will go to production — no debug-only configurations, no test flags.Starting internal testing with the actual release artifact helps ensure that the upgrade path and runtime behavior match what users will experience after the rollout.Step 2 — Uploading the Release BuildStep 3 — Adding a TesterAfter the upload, I add testers to the internal track — in my case, it’s just me.Even when working alone, I go through the full process: joining the tester list, accessing the app via Google Play, and testing the update as a regular user. This helps eliminate inconsistencies that can occur when installing manually.Step 3 — Adding a TesterStep 4 — Installing the Update on a Real DeviceThe internal build is delivered through Google Play, just like a production release.In this case, I’m testing my personal app, MovieLand, using the same flow I follow for team projects. The update is installed over the existing version on my device — not as a clean install.Most production issues related to migrations or state restoration show up specifically during upgrade flows, and this step helps expose them.Step 4 — Installing the Update on a Real DeviceStep 5 — Promoting the Verified BuildAfter the update is tested and verified, I don’t create a new build or make any changes.Instead, I promote the exact same bundle from the internal track to production. This avoids discrepancies between tested and shipped versions and makes the release process more predictable.Step 5 — Promoting the Verified BuildIf you found this helpful, feel free to leave a few claps — it helps others discover the post.Many of my articles focus on practical case studies and real development insights, with clear explanations and hands-on examples.If you’re looking to grow through useful, honest, no-fluff content — feel free to follow along.",
