  "text": "At JetBrains, we’re committed to fostering education and nurturing young programming talents. Our support extends to various educational initiatives, such as scholarships for bachelor’s degrees in Germany and Cyprus, the Algorithm and Code Training School in Romania, and the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC).  This year, we’re excited to announce our sponsorship of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), which will take place early September in Alexandria, Egypt. As part of our sponsorship, we’re providing IOI participants with free access to our software tools, including CLion for C and C++ development. What is IOI? “IOI is an algorithmic programming competition that allows the best and brightest young students from across the globe to compete against one another. Besides the competition, we also aim to provide an environment where those leaders of tomorrow can learn from each other, make new friends, and get introduced to different cultures. The support from JetBrains is very important and helps with both the competitive side as well as the social program.”, states Eljakim Schrijvers, member of the International Committee of the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The IOI is among the most prestigious international science Olympiads for high school students. This annual event brings together exceptional talents from over 100 countries to compete in an algorithmic challenge that tests their informatics skills, including problem analysis, design of algorithms and data structures, programming, and testing. Each participating country selects a team of up to four contestants to represent their nation. Competitors work individually to solve three algorithmic problems within five hours, striving to maximize their scores. “For over two decades, we’ve focused on nurturing talented individuals, beginning with local schools and universities. Last year, we started supporting top talents on the international stage,” says Andrey Ivanov, SVP of Investments, Research, and Education at JetBrains. “At IOI contestants can use our cutting-edge product, CLion, to solve their tasks. We hope this helps them get comfortable with the tools professional programmers use and sets them up for future career success.” Come join us in Alexandria on September 2 – 7 at the JetBrains Booth! And good luck to IOI 2024 participants! Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates Discover more",
