I also took three months off work this summer and I didn't much feel like doing anything tech then! I suspect that 2022 won't be much more productive, but maybe in 2023 (when my toddler has aged out of being a toddler, and COVID is hopefully less in our minds) I'll start picking things back up again. Articles A Warning Regarding Android App Startup with Multiprocess Apps A small note on a niche problem. I write these posts in the hopes that someday someone else will save a bit of time by Googling the right keywords and finding their way here. RxJava vs. Coroutines With the coming of Kotlin Flow, I decided to really evaluate a question many have posed to me: what do I think of RxJava vs. Flow? Almost a year later, I still stand by everything I wrote here, especially the conclusion - even though I think coroutines will do better in the long run, there is a lot of mistakes to be made before we master it. Stop Nitpicking in Code Reviews A post about a big change I made in my development life: no longer nitpicking code reviews. I got some pushback here, but no one convinced me that going back to be an annoying twat in code reviews is actually beneficial to a team. Do or do not; there is no tryEmit() Simulating RxJava's PublishSubject in coroutines is harder than it looks! The dangers of JSON + default values Another niche post about a random problem I ran into around JSON libraries and Kotlin default constructor values. Edina School Board Election (2021) I'm making a habit of writing about local elections. No one else is doing it, so my posts tend to rise to the top of Google results quickly! If you want to influence a surprising number of people, write about politics in a way no one else is (because they're so focused on national politics). My Programming Earworms I've always wanted to share some of my biggest influences as a developer, so here you are. How Trello Android converted from Gson to Moshi Trello Android switched JSON libraries (from Gson to Moshi), and I figured a write-up of the project could be helpful for others doing the same sort of work in the future. Talks I didn't do any! This is the first year I haven't given a single talk since 2011. I give talks primarily because I enjoy the experience of crafting and delivering information. Since the pandemic started, I've found that online talks completely guts half of that experience - it feels like talking to myself, or to a wall. I've got talks in mind I want to give, but they will have to wait until I can give them in person again. Podcasts Homeopathic ASMR This dumb project made me realize that most people don't know what homeopathy or ASMR are. Open Source joda-time-android Still maintaining this library after all these years! We still use it at Trello Android (because migration is a pain), and maintaining it is not difficult.",
