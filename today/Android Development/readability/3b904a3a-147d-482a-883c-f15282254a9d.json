  "text": "Releases Toolbox App Read this post in other languages: JetBrains IDEs, .NET tools, and AI Assistant are ready to be updated to the 2024.2 versions, which introduce a plethora of new features and improvements.  We’ve seen high adoption rates for the new UI, and in the 2024.2 versions of JetBrains IDEs, the new UI is now the default for all users. The classic UI is still available as a plugin. You can learn more about the update in this blog post. Full line code completion (FLCC) is now enhanced with code highlighting, new shortcuts to accept individual words and lines from longer suggestions, and a refined process for integrating changes that eliminates formatting issues.  Other UX changes introduced in 2024.2 include: A new Preview option for the codebase elements in the Search Everywhere dialog. Auto-detection of system proxy settings, enabled by default. A new layout of the Customize Main Toolbar dialog.  For Linux users, window control settings automatically adhere to your desktop configuration, and the window control buttons have been redesigned. Sticky lines are now language-aware: You can choose your language preferences in Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Sticky Lines or in the context menu. In JetBrains IDEs version 2024.2, debugging and browsing complex data formats is now much easier with string variable visualizers for JSON, XML, HTML, JWT, and URL, which you can enable by simply clicking the View link next to a variable. The 2024.2 versions also come with several VCS improvements. The UI of the Local History dialog now features a diff view when accessed for a directory, and the Local History action is now available for multiple files or directories simultaneously. All settings related to the Log tool window have now been consolidated into a dedicated settings page, which you can access via Settings/Preferences | Version Control | Log. Additionally, the Git log can be opened as a tab in the editor and the branch lines in the Log tab have been refined with a new layout and colors, making them easier to identify and follow. Remote development in JetBrains IDEs also got a few enhancements. The settings changes made in the locally installed IDE are now automatically synced with the remote IDE via the JetBrains Client, ensuring a consistent development environment. We’ve also added reverse port forwarding for remote development, and screen sharing in Code With Me is now redirected to a browser with the option to choose which specific window you want to share. You can now run and debug TypeScript files without any additional setup in any JetBrains IDE with web development features. We’ve also improved support across major web frameworks, including Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Astro. With the 2024.2 versions of JetBrains IDEs, support for the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages comes bundled with the IDEs. You can change the language settings in Settings/Preferences | Appearance \u0026 Behavior | System Settings | Language \u0026 Region. Each JetBrains IDE also comes with IDE-specific improvements:  IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 Ultimate lets you run Spring Data JPA methods directly in the IDE for instant repository query verification. It also simplifies the management of cron expressions by providing inline descriptions and advanced autocompletion, and it upgrades the HTTP Client to use the GraalJS execution engine. Additionally, this version enhances IntelliJ IDEA’s overall startup efficiency by enabling key functionalities during project indexing, and it integrates K2 mode, now in Beta, to further boost the IDE’s performance and stability for Kotlin, as well as its support for Kotlin 2.X language features. PyCharm 2024.2 is here with revamped Jupyter notebooks, and new AI cells to iterate faster on your data analysis workflows.

WebStorm 2024.2 introduces support for special path resolution for frameworks with file-system-based routing such as Next.js, debugging support for Bun, the ability to run .ts files directly, and more. PhpStorm 2024.2 features a heap of new functionality, including viewing log files directly in the IDE, adding Laravel, Symfony, and Composer command autocompletion to the terminal, refactoring in a floating toolbar, out-of-the-box support for the PER coding style, and more. DataGrip 2024.2 introduces customizable import from tabular data files, including JSON and Excel, to a database. AI Assistant now turns your prompts into SQL, offering a new way of writing queries. Additionally, AI Assistant helps you with modifying tables and understanding and fixing SQL problems. The latest version of DataGrip also features simplified navigation to related rows, automatic value completion, and easier column selection for an improved experience working with tables. Finally, the Database tab in the Search Everywhere popup has been enhanced with filtering and better scopes. CLion 2024.2 provides a set of new features when the ReSharper C++ language engine (also known as CLion Nova) is enabled.

Also, the speed of node expansion in GDB has been improved. Rider 2024.2 introduces a new type of code completion: gray text single-line suggestions that complete statements based on the context of the current file. This LLM-powered full line code completion is available for C#, С++, JS/TS, and CSS. Rider’s debugging capabilities have been enhanced with the introduction of a Tasks tab and a task dependency graph to help you manage and monitor asynchronous operations. Updates for game development include the bundling of the Godot plugin and enhanced Unreal Engine debugging. This release also introduces support for .NET 9 Preview SDK, including initial support for C# 13 features. GoLand 2024.2 introduces new IDE functionality, such as the Add method to interface and all its implementations refactoring and support for the latest Go features.
