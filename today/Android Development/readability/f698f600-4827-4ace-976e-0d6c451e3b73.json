It offers up a lot of insight into an appâ€™s performance â€“ from device characteristics to insights on issue commonalities. If, like my current project, obfuscation is enabled in an app, Crashlytics has a Gradle plugin that uploads the mapping file so that we end up with readable crash reports. There are times though where I may not want to upload the mapping file, like if I am just debugging an issue locally. According to the official documentation, the way to do this is to add this configuration to the build.gradle.kts file: firebaseCrashlytics { mappingFileUploadEnabled = false } However, when I tried it with v2.8.1 of the Crashlytics Gradle plugin, I get an unresolved reference error: Unresolved reference error The correct syntax for Kotlin Gradle DSL is somewhat buried in a comment in this Github issue: import com.google.firebase.crashlytics.buildtools.gradle.CrashlyticsExtension buildTypes{ getByName(\"debug\") { ... configure\u003cCrashlyticsExtension\u003e { mappingFileUploadEnabled = false } } } Itâ€™s unfortunate that the official documentation hasnâ€™t been updated in the eight months since this issue has been known (apparently it appeared in v2.6.0 of the plugin), but such is life.",
