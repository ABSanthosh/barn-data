  "text": "We’re excited to announce the new “Testing at scale” blog series! In these posts, industry experts working on different apps share their testing strategies, tips, and obstacles found along the way.This series complements the new Testing Strategies documentation, going beyond general advice with real-world examples that showcase the importance of considering specific circumstances — technical, infrastructure, and even human.While most apps don’t have millions of users or hundreds of contributors, and you might not need your own device farm with a cellular tower (!), there’s a great deal of valuable insights that you can apply as your app grows.The first article, which you can read now, is How Netflix tests at scale, written by Ken Yee.If you want to contribute to this series, drop me a note!Happy testing!Many thanks to Ken Yee, who had the idea to extend Netflix’s case study into a series with more partners!",
