  "text": "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the need for robust and efficient on-device AI software solutions is crucial. Qualcomm’s Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE) has been a key component for development in this arena. Designed to streamline the execution of Gen AI model on-device, GENIE is a comprehensive software library that offers a suite of tools tailored for developers who are looking to deploy generative AI models at the edge.Gen AI models, such as large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs), are inherently more complex than classical AI models when it comes to on-device inferencing. This complexity stems from their size and computational requirements, which necessitate more advanced hardware and optimized software to manage the increased data processing and execution commands. Unlike traditional AI models, which typically involve a single binary containing the optimized model, Gen AI models, due to their complexity and larger size, result in multiple binaries after optimization. These binaries must be executed in a specific order to utilize the amazing power of the Neural Processing Unit (NPU).Empowering Developers to develop and deploy On-Device AI and Generative AI with Qualcomm AI HubQualcomm AI Hub is designed to streamline and accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools, and resources that enable developers to optimize, test and deploy AI models on the edge. One of its key advantages is the ability to seamlessly integrate models processed through the AI Hub with our proprietary Qualcomm AI Engine Direct framework. This integration empowers developers to harness the full power of Qualcomm’s state-of-the-art AI hardware, ensuring AI models operate at peak performance and efficiency.GENIE integration with Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDKQualcomm Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE) is tightly integrated with our Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK. This allows for the seamless execution of LLMs and LVMs directly on Snapdragon and Qualcomm platforms. By facilitating this process, GENIE not only simplifies the deployment of complex AI models but also significantly enhances their performance by utilizing AI acceleration offered by our NPU. The result is faster inferencing, quicker response times, and more efficient operation of AI-driven applications.Who Should Use Qualcomm Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE)?Qualcomm Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE) is specifically designed for developers engaged in the deployment of on-device Gen AI applications. GENIE provides the necessary infrastructure to ensure smooth and efficient execution. Its user-friendly instructions, coupled with sample tools and source code examples, make it an invaluable resource for developers looking to leverage advanced Gen AI capabilities in their applications.Qualcomm Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE) benefits and impactThe synergy between GENIE and the Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK translates into numerous benefits for developers. This integration not only simplifies the technical complexities associated with AI model deployment but also optimizes performance to meet the demands of modern applications. For developers, this means less time troubleshooting and more time innovating.Get started with Llama sample app available on Qualcomm AI HubFor a practical demonstration, developers can explore the Llama sample application available on AI Hub. The sample app not only showcases Qualcomm Gen AI Inference Extensions (GENIE) in action but also provides detailed instructions for deploying your own Gen AI models at the edge. It’s an invaluable tool for developers eager to see the real-world applications of GENIE and to learn how to leverage its capabilities in their projects.Ready to start your on-device AI journey? Visit Qualcomm AI Hub today, dive into the Llama sample application, and begin deploying powerful AI models right at the edge.Visit our Github to find AI Hub llama demo and generate GENIE compatible assets.Join Qualcomm Developer Discord to connect with fellow developers, get real-time support from our technical experts and benefit from exclusive virtual live events.",
