  "text": "Community JetBrains News JetBrains is devoted to bringing the latest ideas and technologies to developers worldwide. Many innovations are born in academia, and researchers are often looking for practical applications for their projects. We are introducing the IDE Research Integration Grant Program, aimed at computer science researchers who have already completed research projects they would like to deploy in practice by creating a plugin for an IntelliJ-based IDE. Let’s collaborate! Grant recipients will receive USD 5,000 to support the development of their plugins. We do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support, as we believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work. The application deadline is June 30, 2024, and you can apply for the grant here: https://lp.jetbrains.com/ide-research-grant To qualify for the grant, your project must meet the following requirements: Your research should be published in a scientific journal or the proceedings of an academic conference, or it should be available on arXiv. The plugin you create must be available under a permissive open-source license, such as Apache 2.0 or MIT. The development of the plugin must not be carried out by a commercial, for-profit company that is not a research institute or a university. The plugin should be developed within one year. Submissions will be evaluated based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on IDE users and the supporting technology ecosystem, the maturity of the supporting technology, and the applicant’s track record of research and engineering projects. If you have additional questions, please contact us at ide-research-grant@jetbrains.com. We look forward to reviewing your applications! Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates Discover more",
