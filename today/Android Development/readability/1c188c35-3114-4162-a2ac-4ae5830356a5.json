  "text": "1. Stable Ktor 3.0.0 supportWith the release of a stable Ktor 3.0.0 version, it was important for Inspektify to support this version. Even though we already had a library available for the Ktor 3.0.0 pre-release versions, it crashed when a stable version of Ktor was used. Now, you can seamlessly integrate Inspektify into your projects that use a stable version of Ktor 3.0.0.2. Shortcut for mobile clientsBy default, Inspektify can be presented by shaking gestures on mobile targets. However, not all projects can use shake gestures as the default way of presenting the Inspektify window. That is why we always had a public method to start the Inspektify window directly inside your code. But now we’ve added another way of doing that on mobile clients with the help of Android shortcuts and iOS Home screen quick actions.If you enable the shortcutEnabled flag for the InspektifyKtor config you will get shortcut capability out of the box for your application. Android will work without any additional configurations, but for iOS there are some additional requirements that need to be done in order to use this feature. You can read more about how to configure iOS targets here.Android:iOS:3. Pretty print of request and response payloadsWe all know how hard it can be to work with raw JSON data, especially when we read through complex payloads. With Inspektify’s new Pretty Print feature, your request and response payloads will be automatically formatted in a clean and easy-to-read manner.This makes inspecting network data more manageable, allowing you to debug faster and find information more effectively.4. Search in Details Pages of Network TrafficWhen dealing with extensive network logs, finding specific data can sometimes be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Inspektify now provides a Search feature on the details pages, enabling you to locate specific data quickly across all 3 tabs on the Network Traffic details page.5. Text Selection Enabled on Details PagesUntil now, there was only one way of copying network traffic details with action that copied all the data for you. But now you can select what you want to copy with Selection Capability on all Network Traffic details pages.",
