Introduction to ViewModel Nathan Kayumba dives into what a ViewModel is, why it’s essential, and how it integrates within the architecture of an Android app. Inspektify got even better. Blaž Vantur announces new and exciting features that make Inspektify even more robust, intuitive, and user-friendly. Comparing SupervisorScope with viewModelScope Leo N explores differences, focusing on how they handle exceptions, manage child coroutines, and why choosing the right scope for each task is crucial Credential Manager Kai Cilliers looks at the Jetpack Compose API that isolates the intergration for credential management of our user’s into a single API and supports multiple sign-in options. Extension Shadowing for Actual Declarations in KMP Marcello Galhardo looks at why the EXTENSION_SHADOWED_BY_MEMBER warning is expected to be removed in Kotlin version 2.1.0. Top Nine Android Developer Interview Questions You Should Know Jaewoong Eum helps you prepare for an interview by mastering the fundamental knowledge essential for working as an Android developer.
