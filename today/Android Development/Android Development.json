    "description": "There is documentation on the Android Developer website sharing tips to run Android UI tests via the command-line which I’ve found super useful. It provides examples on how to run specific tests (instead of running them all) including running by package, class or method. This documentation is fantastic, but it doesn’t include the tests_regex argument […]",

It looks exciting and I want it to succeed. At the same time, I’ve learned to be cautiously optimistic about hot-reload solutions. The dream of hot-reloadable android code is old — and frankly, cold.

For years Android developers have used Dave Morrissey’s excellent library, subsampling-scale-image-view for displaying large bitmaps with deep zoom. It optimizes memory usage by loading lower resolution bitmaps whenever possible and avoiding loading parts of the original […] The post Building a sub-sampling image viewer for Compose UI appeared first on Saket Narayan.",
