It looks exciting and I want it to succeed. At the same time, I’ve learned to be cautiously optimistic about hot-reload solutions. The dream of hot-reloadable android code is old — and frankly, cold.

For years Android developers have used Dave Morrissey’s excellent library, subsampling-scale-image-view for displaying large bitmaps with deep zoom. It optimizes memory usage by loading lower resolution bitmaps whenever possible and avoiding loading parts of the original […] The post Building a sub-sampling image viewer for Compose UI appeared first on Saket Narayan.",
