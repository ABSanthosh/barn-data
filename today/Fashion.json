This week, Alex is after skincare tipsThere is so much confusing information on social media about skincare, but it’s crucial to get advice from experts. When puberty starts, hormone levels shift and the skin sometimes becomes oilier and more acne-prone. “The oil can mix with dead skin cells and bacteria which can clog pores, leading to pimples, blackheads, inflammation and acne,” says dermatologist Dr Anna Protasova at Evolution Aesthetics Clinic.The ideal is to balance your skin’s oil production, so using a gentle cleanser, a lightweight moisturiser and sunscreen of SPF30 or above is key. “Choose a cleanser that is mild and right for your skin type. Use it morning, evening and after strenuous exercise,” Protasova adds. Applying acne products with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can be helpful. Follow this with a light moisturiser with SPF.

    "description": "Hot stylists, smart gadgets and miraculous serums… Here’s everything you need to make every day a good hair dayThere is something about hair that sparks conversations (and questions! So many questions!) often riddled with frustration. It is a reminder that our hair isn’t simply this thing that sprouts from our scalps. It is much more complex than that. It’s about the right products, people and places that help you achieve something that makes you feel amazing. Which we all want. Post summer, when we see our hair in a different (autumnal) light, makes us consider what we can do to make it thicker, shiner, stronger, fuller, healthier… And sometimes we simply want hair that looks less basic. The industry understands this all too well, which is why so many brands launch a ton of product and treatments at this time.We have sifted through many of their offerings and pulled together a hair special to tackle not every single question, but some of the key ones around hair that I hear time and time again. Why is the Dyson so expensive? How do I combat hair loss? What shampoos will give me thicker hair? Do supplements actually work? Who on social media might just inspire me to have a new style or simply embrace the one I already have? I can’t promise you we have all the answers you want, but hopefully it’s an inspiring start.

    "description": "It’s time to start moving your wardrobe across to the new season, and for cooler days warm burgundy is the standout colourAs autumn sets in, seek a splash of mood-enhancing colour with winter’s new hottest hue – rich burgundy. We have Gucci’s creative director Sabato de Sarno to thank for the shade, which featured prominently in his debut SS24 collection, inspired by the elevator interior of the Savoy hotel in London where founder Guccio Gucci once worked as a porter. De Sarno used it liberally across both men’s and womenswear, on bags, high-shine leather goods and separates. Tip: the wallet-friendly way to buy into the Gucci red universe is the Rosso Ancora lipstick (£37).There are many variations of the shade in winter collections, from deep oxblood to rich merlot, even tipping into dark aubergine. The burgundy bag is a great place to start with this trend. Arket’s crescent-shape shoulder bag (£189) is roomy enough to stash a laptop, while Mango’s mini crossbody shopper (£35.99) has room for a phone and essentials. The high street has not only jumped on the burgundy bandwagon, but embraced it with gusto, from John Lewis’s rich wrap double front coat (4) to Reiss’s blazer (2). These rich tones add depth to your wardrobe and look chic paired with jeans and a knit. Try the Frankie Shop’s elegant long wool coat (£359) or Kitri’s high-shine belted vinyl trench version (£220). Not only is burgundy a timeless colour, but it also marries well with neutrals, pinks and reds, as seen with Mint Velvet’s burgundy with pink spot print dress (£150), Albaray’s jacquard dress styled with an oversize grey knitted tank (5) or accessorised with a high-shine red bag at Essentiel Antwerp (3).

Right now, the erogenous zone of the catwalk is your neck. Don’t stress about what hemline to wear. Don’t waste time worrying whether black opaque tights are in or out.

Why is the industry so slow to reform?In just over a fortnight, some of the UK’s biggest fashion brands will showcase their new collections at London fashion week. Organised by the British Fashion Council (BFC), it’s always an exciting moment, bringing together some of the country’s top creative talent. But it also highlights entrenched problems in fashion. Only 3.4% of BFC members have published public targets to reduce their emissions aligned with the Paris Agreement, according to a new report by ethical fashion not-for-profit Collective Fashion Justice.The BFC is a body of organisations from the industry who are responsible for overseeing, supporting and advising on the key issues facing the British designer industry, with members including publishing houses, high street brands and retail destinations, including household names like Yoox, Net-a-Porter and Savile Row. Of these members, only five brands – Burberry, Mulberry, Margaret Howell, Rixo and Kyle Ho – have published science-based targets aligned with the Paris agreement, which would, according to CFJ, “make them effective targets worth working towards”. By stark contrast, 44% of all UK companies have a structured plan to reduce their carbon footprint and climate impact, according to recent data from the Climate Ready Index. Continue reading...",

In the meantime, textiles that are unsuitable for charitable donations remain a forgotten waste stream, making it tempting to look for alternative solutions.

SLIPPERS ARE NOT SHOES”. Suffice to say, its patrons remain untroubled by wider conversations about the etiquette of workout clothes, both inside and outside the gym. (My view: it’s increasingly standard to wear athleisure anywhere you’d wear jeans, especially if it’s mixed with smarter pieces.)

    "description": "Don’t listen to the tiresome, stuffy naysayers: shorts can look sensational, even in the office, as long as you do them rightThe year is 2224. AI Donald Trump is entering his 50th term. Polar bears have gone the way of the dodo. Happily, Cher remains entirely unchanged. A magazine headline asks: “Should men be allowed to wear shorts?” It’s my belief that the perennial debate over whether men can wear shorts should have been put to bed the moment Paul Mescal was papped in a minuscule O’Neills pair, sending the global happiness index soaring by approximately 10,000 points. Here was a way for a man to wear the equivalent of Diana’s revenge dress – or Beyoncé’s freakum dress, for younger readers – while looking like he’d made no effort whatsoever (leg days at the gym notwithstanding).Earlier this summer, Mescal sported a dressier version of the look at the Gucci menswear show, pairing striped cotton shorts with a blue Oxford shirt, white crew and the brand’s horsebit loafers. Stunning, no notes whatsoever, thank you Paul for your service. Heartbreakingly, we can’t all be Paul Mescal. But it’s my belief that no man should have to swelter through a summer heatwave in a pair of trousers just because … well, I’m never entirely sure of the reasoning. Is it that we associate shorts with childhood, so struggle to take a man in a pair of them seriously? (And if that’s the case, wouldn’t the solution be for more high-powered men to wear shorts?)

It’s easy to see why, because LED therapy is already used widely in doctors’ surgeries.

    "description": "Every year at this time, we find ourselves craving new sweaters - you just can't beat that thrill of finding a new knit or sweatsuit sets to cozy up in all season long. And while we're firm believers that you can never have too many sweaters in your clothing stock (especially if you live somewhere cold), dishing out the money to spend on a variety of styles is often a burden on our wallets. Fortunately, there are plenty of stylish sweaters out there that are equal parts cozy and affordable, and we've recently discovered a few of our favorites from Amazon. It's no secret that the retailer is a hub for deals across pretty much every major category. But when it comes to fashion, the retailer delivers in more ways than one with a massive selection of knits and other top-rated clothing, all at unbelievably low prices - we're talking so affordable, you won't have to spend a penny over $21. Whether you want an elevated yet comfortable sweatshirt or a fitted turtleneck for layering, we've got choices that'll impress you. Take a look at our favorite Amazon sweater options for $21 and under, and score a few before they sell out. With deals like this, we have no doubt they'll be gone in the blink of an eye.

    "description": "Dressing everyone from Lady Gaga to Kerry Washington, Brandon Maxwell is a name synonymous with luxury celebrity fashion. Met Gala red carpets, runway shows, state dinners, and daytime talk shows - his designs have graced the most iconic carpets and venues, and now everyone can have a piece of Maxwell's midas design touch. Since 2021, Maxwell has been applying his high-fashion flair to Walmart as creative director for Walmart's Free Assembly and Scoop brands, designing elegant yet accessible clothing for everyday wear. \"My job as creative director for Scoop and Free Assembly allows me to combine all of my favorite creative endeavors, and I feel incredibly grateful to be making this work for our customers,\" Maxwell tells PS. For his latest Free Assembly Fall 2024 collection, Maxwell embraces the essence of modern Americana with high-waisted jeans, quilted jackets, ruffled blouses, and a color palette that includes olive, navy, mustard, and, of course, red, white, and blue. The collection, available in sizes XS-XXXL / 0-20, features a range of chic wardrobe essentials, from denim midi dresses and chevron knit cardigans to classic staples like white tees and trench coats. \"Free Assembly is all about individuality, and the variety of products allows you to freely assemble a look that represents who you want to be on any given day,\" says Maxwell. This spirit of freedom and diversity is reflected in the star-studded campaign, which features Danielle Brooks, Jeremy Pope, Lana Condor, and Max Greenfield. \"They have strong individual personalities and styles with a point of view, and I think they perfectly represent what the brand is about,\" Maxwell shares about the campaign stars. \"Beyond that, they were just incredibly kind and fun to work with.\" Each model speaks to this theme of freedom with the message: \"I'm free to open up, I'm free to go with the flow, I'm free to show my stripes.\" Image Source: Walmart The self-taught designer has envisioned this collaboration with Walmart \"for many, many years.\" He explains, \"I always wanted to work with Walmart because I have always believed that everyone should have access to fashion that helps them feel their best, no matter the price. For years, I would tell anyone who would listen how much I wanted to collaborate with Walmart, so it is quite literally a dream come true to be doing what I am doing now, and I am thrilled with the experience thus far.\" He adds, \"Building these Walmart brands together with the talented, best-in-class design teams I work with every day has been such a joy. Putting my years of experience into creating images, campaigns, and fashion experiences has been a big highlight for me.\" The designer's runway shows are a staple of the New York Fashion Week schedule (his Fall 2023 show on Valentine's Day featured individualized boxes of chocolate for guests) - but how does he unwind after? Maxwell says spending time at home reading the newspaper with his dog on his lap and setting a beautiful table for dinner are \"big hallmarks of a perfect weekend.\" Sure fans of both his eponymous line and Walmart collaboration would agree. Ahead, discover some of Maxwell's favorite pieces from his latest Free Assembly collection. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

    "title": "I Tried the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Bunny Dress Everybody Wants",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kacey-musgraves-reformation-bunny-dress-review-49397411",
    "description": "I won't lie to you, the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection does not align with my typical aesthetic. But the 36-year-old singer, who is currently on tour promoting \"Deeper Well\" - which was just nominated for CMA's album of the year - wears it well. The 17-piece capsule collection aims to showcase Musgraves's personal style and music evolution. It has an English countryside feeling, composed of rich plaids, delicate lace, Victorian bows, equestrian boots, and vintage denim corsets. In a word, it's romantic - which is not how you'd describe even a small chunk of my wardrobe. While I love avant-garde shapes and bold colors, and would even describe my fashion sensibility as ever-changing, I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress ($248). Since the collaboration was dropped in stores and online on Sept. 16, this dress has quickly become one of the most popular silhouettes, largely thanks to Musgraves's appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" The Bunny was the first item she wore from the line she helped design, teamed with a pair of simple black heeled mules. I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress. \"I got to curate every single detail of this whole line,\" she told Meyers. \"There's denim, there's headscarves, there's boots, dresses - it's very romantic and I'm really proud of it.\" She continued, \"It wasn't something I just slapped my name on. I really wanted to bring the 'Deeper Well' aesthetic into a different dimension.\" Musgraves went on to reveal that she worked with Reformation for a full year on production, and then shot the campaign in the Cotswolds in England, with her little sister Kelly Christine Sutton behind the camera. \"I keep saying this is the perfect line for you to just frolic around in,\" Musgraves said. And while I've never bought a dress that made me think of frolicking in the meadow (what meadow?), Musgraves's on-screen look was so appealing, I knew I wanted to put my personal touch on it and try to make it my own. What happened when I actually got my hands on the Bunny mini and tried it on surprised me even more. Not only did I feel comfortable enough to embrace my girlier, dare I say demure-leaning, side, I also accessorized with frilly socks and Mary-Janes, a nod to Musgraves's iconic campaign. Scroll to learn a bit more about the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collaboration ahead, then read my full review of the Bunny Dress. Related: Taylor Swift Rehearses in a Denim Workout Dress - Here's How It Holds Up in the Gym What Are the Most Popular Pieces in the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Collection? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection is comprised of 17 pieces that range in price from $28 to $498. The Bunny dress is definitely one of the most popular pieces, likely because it was the first style Musgraves debuted when she paid a visit to Seth Meyers. The exact version she wore is still in stock in every size, except for in petite, where most sizes are currently waitlist only. According to Reformation, the collection sold very quickly, with the Deeper Well Denim Shirt and Dallas Denim Corset being first to sell through - although most sizes are currently restocked at this time. The Silver Lining Cashmere Two Piece also gets plenty of search, and it's currently available in both gray, and almost every size in camel. Is the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Collection Sustainable? Like all of Reformation's clothing, Kacey Musgraves x Ref prioritizes sustainability. You can read about the brand's commitment to sustainable production methods here, but the 17-piece collection does incorporate deadstock fabrics, regenerative wool, and recycled cashmere, minimizing every shopper's carbon footprint. About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress It comes in three different shades: Brown Plaid, Black, and Chianti (a wine red). It's available in sizes 0-12 and is designed to be fitted at the bodice with an A-line skirt that slightly fans out at the hemline. It's available in petite sizing in all three colorways. You can visit any US Reformation store that offers hemming to have the dress altered for free. The dress material is crafted from deadstock fabric that consists of polyester, rayon, wool, and spandex, and it is dry clean only. Shipping is free, and you can finance your purchase in $62 increments. What I Like About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection comes with a signature tag that suggests exclusivity, which is especially appealing for fans. Like most of Reformation's clothing, the Bunny Dress feels well-made and isn't too flimsy or thin. It comes lined and the scoop-neck is comfortable. Neither the elastic at the sleeves or the lace trim felt itchy against my skin during wear. But I think I discovered my favorite element of this dress before I even left the house: It's actually very versatile. We saw Musgraves wear it with mules on the aforementioned talk show; I liked how it looked in the mirror with knee-high boots, my Steve Madden loafers, and the cranberry Mary-Janes and socks combination that Musgraves and I both successfully pulled off; and podcast host and author Tinx even wore it with the Franklin Boots that are part of the collection. Finally, the dress definitely fits true to size. I'm wearing a 0, which is my typical size, and it fit like a glove. What to Consider Before Buying the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress If you love a dress that's machine washable, unfortunately, the Bunny is dry clean only to preserve all the delicate details. However, in my opinion, this is a year-round investment piece that works with tights and boots in the winter and bare legs and flats in the summer, so I think it's worth the trip to the cleaners. Price-wise, this dress does err on the expensive side when it comes to a minidress, but, again, it can be dressed up or down and works for many different occasions. If you're considered petite like me (I'm 5'1\"), I would recommend trying out the shorter iteration, but I actually felt satisfied with the length of the regular size, which suggests a petite cut might have been too short for my liking. Where Can You Buy the Kacey Musgraves Bunny Dress From Reformation? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Bunny Dress is currently only available on the brand's website.

    "title": "Confirmed: This Free People Jacket Is the Perfect All-Seasons Style",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/free-people-chloe-jacket-review-49396350",
    "description": "In my world, some things are inevitable come fall: cooler temperatures, pumpkin spice products consuming my local Trader Joe's, my mom playing Christmas music in her car as early as September, and - perhaps most predictable of all - me buying a new Free People jacket that I'll wear through the new year. While some people might kickstart their autumnal festivities with an apple-picking excursion, my fall doesn't really begin until I've added a cozy, new Free People style to my closet. Last year's elected favorite was none other than the Pippa Packable Puffer Jacket - which is still my go-to travel jacket. My style of choice this season, however, is the Free People Chloe Jacket ($198). I'm far from the first person to fall in love with the comfy jacket; not only has it been bubbling up on TikTok, but the topper is also regarded as one of Free People's bestselling styles. With its flattering fit, quilted composition, and wide array of pattern options, it's not hard to see why this statement piece has garnered so much attention - along with a permanent spot in my wardrobe. Ahead, I break down what makes this Free People jacket one of fall 2024's best coats. What I Like About Free People's Chloe Jacket First and foremost, I love just how endlessly comfortable this jacket is. It's made from a lightweight cotton and rayon material, with a polyester filling that's plush and squishy; it's like getting all the benefits of a cozy down jacket rolled into the structure of a chunky cardigan. The material isn't so heavy that I feel overwhelmed or constricted, but it's also just thick enough to where I can comfortably wear it in lower winter temperatures. This jacket's styling versatility is also endless - whether I want to layer it with a basic T-shirt or team it with a bulky sweater, the product's oversize fit makes it functional enough to work with so many different clothing types. And I appreciate that despite having a steeper price tag, I feel like I'm getting the most for my money with this Free People jacket. I've been wearing it nonstop already this fall (even in 70-degree temperatures) and I know that I'll have no issue wearing it throughout the colder winter months, too. With its floral design, I could probably even get away with donning it throughout the spring season! Its lightweight build is so unique, I honestly forget that I'm often wearing a jacket at all. Plus, the style's packable design makes it a great option for travel. Whether I'm embarking on a road trip or jet setting to another country, it's a style that doesn't take up too much packing space in my carry-on suitcase. What's Worth Noting Unlike traditional zippered or button-down jackets, this style is fitted with hook closure accents, which keep both sides of the jacket pulled together for a more closed-in look. On occasion, the hooks will unlatch and I'll have to reattach them; overall, I find myself fidgeting with this jacket more as opposed to standard zippered styles. Additionally, because of its dolman silhouette, the layer also has a boxier design. The looser fit gives the jacket a lived-in feel that I enjoy, but other reviewers noted it was a bit too oversize for their preferences. I recommend referencing Free People's style guide to source your perfect size, and consider sizing down if you're concerned about it being too large on you. Who Is Free People's Chloe Jacket Best For? If you're in the market for a style that you can comfortably wear through even the most confusing transitional weather - from chilled mornings to warm afternoons and cold nights - this Free People jacket will be your new go-to. It's breathable enough that you won't feel bogged down by heavy material, but its quilted design also ensures ample warmth and insulation in lower temperatures. With a wide variety of pattern and color options, you won't have any trouble finding your dream style - or even stocking up on the jacket in multiple variations (because the more, the merrier!). Additional Details The jacket is available in US women's sizes XS through XL. It comes in 12 different pattern and color options, including a checkered black and white style, striped red and brown variation, and a floral maroon combo (my print of choice). This jacket is crafted from a quilted fabrication that's plush and surprisingly warm, with an insulated design that'll help users stay warm in brisk seasonal temperatures.

    "description": "For us, we think the key to nailing fall fashion is all in the layering. Sure, it's important to have a few staple sweaters and coats incorporated into your closet, but the real trick is figuring out how to style all of those pieces together. Enter the cardigan - aka one of fashion's most timeless and trusted wardrobe essentials that you could argue is a basic worth having on hand in any season (though it's especially great for fall and winter). Cardigans have long had a reputation for being more of an understated, even boring, layer, but our latest online shopping spree proves that they're actually anything but. We've fallen back in love with the classic cardigan style, not only because of all the modern silhouettes you can shop, but also because there are so many creative ways to wear them. So long as you've got a white tank top, a great pair of jeans, and a cute cardigan, you have an outfit that can take you pretty much anywhere you need to go. Our shopping experts narrowed down our picks for the best cardigans for women that we think are worth adding to your fall wardrobe ASAP. Whether you want an editor-loved cashmere piece, something vibrant and colorful, or a cropped cardigan that's cut in all the right ways, the options are endless. Keep reading to shop our selects!

    "title": "Gigi Hadid and I Are Both Fans of These Cozy UGG Slippers - and They're Back in Stock",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/ugg-tasman-slippers-review-49308616",
    "description": "If celebrity street style is any sort of indicator on what's cool and trendy in the world of fashion, then UGG platform slippers might be the most popular style this season. The cozy shoes certainly aren't new to mainstream fashion, but with celebrities like Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, and Hailey Bieber constantly donning the slippers - whether it be while trotting around New York or in between red carpet events and Pilates classes - the comfy shoes have definitely ascended into a new realm of popularity (and I'm not the least bit mad about it). In fact, I've been so mesmerized by the overwhelming love that celebrities have for the UGG Tasman Slippers ($110) in particular, I decided to purchase a pair for myself and lucked out that they just happened to be in stock (the slippers are seemingly always sold out). Could I get away with wearing them to the grocery store? Are they durable enough to hold up on my evening walks? Do they truly look good on everyone, or are they just cute on Hadid? (This is actually a recurring thought in my day-to-day life.) These were just a few of the questions I sought to answer when testing out UGG's bestselling slippers. Now that they're back in stock (and likely only for a limited time), ahead, I break down my full experience with the shoe - including how they fit, where they're available to shop, and whether they're truly worth the splurge (spoiler alert: they totally are). What I Like About These UGG Slippers The obvious appeal of these shoes is just how comfy they are - and yes, they're as irresistibly soft and cushiony as you'd imagine. The style boasts a durable leather composition that's sturdy but not too firm to the point where it feels uncomfortable to wear them. Dyed sheep fur lines the inside of the style, and while it certainly creates a cozier feel, I appreciate that the material isn't too thick or overbearing to the point that my feet start to feel sweaty. Unlike other everyday slippers, this style has a rubber sole base that's thick and designed to last, so I don't have to worry about whether it can withstand being worn on surfaces like concrete, tile, or grass - it holds up well and has just enough of a platform that the slipper's material doesn't dirty when being worn beyond my apartment. I love that these shoes seamlessly blend comfort with functionality and the fact that they're versatile enough to be worn in a number of environments, such as running errands, grabbing brunch, going to and from the gym, or even just around my home. What's Worth Noting I've had these slippers for almost eight months now, so I've had plenty of time to break them in. Because I work from home and generally only wear them inside or whenever I need to run a quick errand outside of my apartment, I'm not wearing them super extensively, which is why I've been pretty surprised by how worn down the inside of the shoe feels, particularly around the toe area. I've definitely noticed a change in the cushioning of the shoe, as the inside lining feels more worn down (almost like it's disintegrating or caving into itself), and several knots have even started forming toward the upper sole of the slipper, making it feel bumpy when I walk. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this, especially considering I've owned a handful of UGG boots in the past and never had any issue with them before. Perhaps this is simply the nature of what happens when you wear a pair of slippers as frequently as I do - things do eventually have to wear down, after all. However, it's worth noting that if you want these slippers to be a mainstay in your closet, you'll likely have to factor in buying a new pair every year - at least if you plan on wearing them as regularly as I do. Who Are These UGG Slippers Best For? If you want a pair of shoes you can comfortably wear around the house, out to run errands, or even for a quick walk through the neighborhood, these UGG slippers are a worthwhile investment. I appreciate their versatility and the fact that besides being a great everyday shoe, they're also incredibly comfortable and easy to slip into - even if I'm in a rush or literally running out the door. Additional Details These everyday slippers are crafted in a dyed sheep fur material and feature a rubbed sole base that's designed to be worn outdoors. The shoes are available to shop in a handful of colors, including chestnut brown (my coloring of choice), dark gray, samba red, burnt olive, and more. The UGG slippers come in US women's sizes 5 through 11. Where Are These UGG Slippers Available to Shop? The UGG Tasman Slippers are available to shop at Amazon, Anthropologie, and Zappos.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-printed-midi-dresses-48898839",
    "description": "Printed dresses are arguably one of the most essential styles to have on hand for transitional weather. From a morning brunch to a happy hour date, a printed dress really is the ultimate frock - perfect for helping you to create a lightweight, hassle-free outfit that will still keep you looking fresh through even the busiest schedules. When it comes to playful fall fashion, we're convinced that perhaps the only thing better than a printed dress is a halter, cutout, and maxi printed dress. We love a good pattern as much as the next fashionista - especially if it helps to elevate an otherwise breezy or minimalistic style with a more statement-making touch. So it's no surprise that we're equally as taken with the bold elegance provided by a chic, printed dress. Spend a few minutes browsing the internet for one of these styles and you'll find, evidently, that there are a lot of printed dress options to shop at the moment - with gowns that feature everything from geometric designs and floral-adorned prints to so many other eye-catching styles that are perfect for nailing all your fall weddings and events, no matter the dress code. We've shopped out a few of our favorite printed dresses below, with styles from Amazon, Nordstrom, Asos, Anthropologie, and more. Read on to browse our picks.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/street-style-trends-48961602",
    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style snapshots. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. After several seasons of digital-only or hybrid-presentation models due to the pandemic, New York Fashion Week has officially returned back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. From Sept. 6-10, Fashion Week brought together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the spring/summer 2025 season. They stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts (especially coming off the US Open), texture play, co-ord sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites, when necessary given the humidity in New York, were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS senior content director Jessica Andrews, PS associate director of Shopping Sarah Wasilak, and PS assistant editor of Shopping Kyley Warren attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.

    "description": "In the latest batch of reimagined Y2K trends, TikTok has managed to resurrect a peak early '00s staple: charm jewelry. That's right - the chunky charm necklaces and metallic charm bracelets that once dominated your accessories drawer are proving to be fashion's most coveted commodity this fall. And they're not just here to take over standard jewelry pieces; bag charms are also popping up on the arms of A-listers and style influencers alike, with designer brands like Coach and Kate Spade New York releasing their own novelty pieces. So, what's inspired this charmcore craze? For starters, few fashion accessories provide a more failsafe way to turn heads the moment you walk into a room - in part, because of their notoriously loud, jangly design. Charm jewelry also offers a more sustainable route for updating your wardrobe each season; rather than investing in a new work bag or necklace, you can simply reimagine your older pieces with charm accessories that'll add some welcomed character (and color) to any style. Much like friendship bracelets, the charmcore trend is all about wearing things that showcase your personality and play up your interests. It's kitschy, it's niche, and oftentimes even a little tacky - but that's what makes it so fun. And if you're looking to test out the charm jewelry trend for yourself but don't know where to start, fear not - we've got you covered. From earring charms to charm keychains that you can use to dress up your bags, boots, and more, we've rounded up the best charm jewelry to wear this season and beyond. Our top picks come from both charm jewelry brands and larger retailers like Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters. Looking for a specific style? Browse through our categories below.

    "title": "This Barefoot Dreams Robe Is the Epitome of Cozy Luxury - and It's on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/barefoot-dreams-cozychic-robe-review-49264346",
    "description": "I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to shopping for new fashion pieces or trendy products, I'm easily influenced - especially if the recommendation comes from a celebrity with notoriously impeccable test. Last fall I interviewed celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe (who I've long been an admirer of), and during our phone conversation, she divulged a few of her all-time favorite products. These items ranged in everything from a beaded necklace and an anti-aging serum to a retro pair of Adidas sneakers and a cozy, oversize robe - well, the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe ($127, originally $138), to be more specific. Zoe couldn't say enough great things about the robe style, even acknowledging it as being one of her go-to \"sleeping essentials,\" and noting that her entire family is fitted with their own Barefoot Dreams' robes (talk about a testimony!). Now, I'm no stranger to Barefoot Dreams - and if you're someone who (like me) regularly scrolls TikTok or keeps tabs on celebrity-favorite products, then you're probably all too familiar with the brand, too. The loungewear and apparel label is hailed as having some of the most addictively soft, comfortable, and downright luxurious products on the market. Hailey Bieber has made her love for the brand's CozyChic Blanket widely known, and Kourtney Kardashian and Brie Larson are also huge fans. Coziness is at the heart of everything that Barefoot Dreams creates, and since cozy season is officially here (at long last!), I figured now would be the perfect time to test out the brand's bestselling CozyChic Robe to see if it actually lives up to all of the internet hype. Keep reading for my honest review of this Barefoot Dreams robe to see why I think it would make the perfect gift for your friend (or really the perfect gift for any woman) in your life. What I Like About the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe The obvious answer is that I love how ridiculously cozy and comforting this robe feels while on - it's genuinely the softest thing in my entire apartment, and oftentimes even feels warmer than some of my larger blankets. The style is made from a plush polyester microfiber material that's irresistibly cozy and somehow manages to relax my body the moment I put it on; literally any tensions within my body become relieved. But the deeper, much more layered answer, is that I appreciate just how much this robe has managed to elevate my post-shower routine. While the style isn't strictly reserved for bathroom wear, it has been a great addition to my own evening bathroom regimen, particularly when I step out of the shower. I'll usually dry off my body with one of my normal cotton towels and then immediately slip into this robe for all of my post-shower tasks - which involves working through my nightly skin-care routine, brushing my hair, applying lotion on my body, and (depending on my breakfast or dinner schedule) brushing my teeth, too. Usually these tasks feel more like chores rather than things to genuinely get excited about. But because of how luxurious this robe feels, it's almost like my morning and nighttime routines have somehow been elevated into a much more enjoyable experience. The product itself it so decadent, wearing it feels comparable to a spa-like experience - except it's one that I get to enjoy from the comfort of my home everyday. I was definitely not expecting to fall in love with this robe as much as I did, but now I completely understand why Zoe had seemingly endless compliments for the product. What's Worth Noting About the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe Because it's made from a polyester microfiber material, the robe does have pretty specific care instructions. Per the Barefoot Dreams website, it's recommended that you machine wash the piece cold in a gentle cycle. Once the washing process is done, you can lay it flay to dry, or even tumble dry it on low. If needed, users can steam or cool iron the robe's fabric, though it's recommended that the style is never washed with bleach, dryer sheets, or fabric softener. Following these steps will help to preserve the quality of your robe and ensure it doesn't start to pill too much over time. Who Is the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe Best For? Honestly it's hard to even pinpoint a target audience for this robe because it's so perfect for everyone. The style has a cozy fit that wraps seamlessly around the body and literally makes you feel like you're being hugged by a cloud. It's heavier than most robes that I've worn, but not so much so that it feels overbearing - in fact, I think it'd actually be a great investment or gift for someone with anxiety as it almost feels comparable to a weighted blanket (though again, by no means as heavy). The robe's rich texture is soft to the touch and incredibly luxurious. If you're someone who's looking to elevate their at-home bathroom experience - and especially your post-shower routine - this robe will definitely do the trick. Best of all, it has an oversize fit that ensures you're completely covered, without any room for slips or peeks. When I've had friends over for a girl's night, I've felt completely comfortable wearing this plush robe around my apartment because it fits like a dream and is arguably the comfiest thing I own - even comfier than some of my go-to cashmere loungewear pieces, which says a lot. Additional Details This robe is made from a 100 percent polyester microfiber material and has special care instructions which are designed to ensure the material is well-preserved over time - more specifics can be found in the above sections. The style is available to shop in three unique sizes: 1, 2, and 3. It's recommended that you reference the Barefoot Dreams size guide before purchasing anything, as the brand has unique size charts for different products - including the CozyChic robe. Similar to other Barefoot Dreams' products, this cozy robe is available to shop in a variety of different colorways, including: white, dove gray (my shade of choice), pearl, and slate blue. Where to Shop the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe This plush robe is available to shop at Amazon, Barefoot Dreams, and Zappos.

    "description": "When finding the perfect pair of work shoes, style ranks high on our wish lists - but naturally, so does comfort. From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair. Depending on your job or daily journey, your comfort (and commute) requirements might have different needs. If you work in a more dressed-up environment with a walking commute, opt for classic, comfortable flats that you can wear with trousers.

And, of course, we also made sure to include some versatile sneakers that pair well with all clothing items - and are even favorites of our own editors. Keep reading for our complete guide to the best women's work shoes. With styles from brands like Old Navy, Rothy's, and Everlane, there's something at every price point and markdown.

The recent spring/summer 2025 shows may have had brighter days in mind but the layering, structured outerwear, and bold prints we saw on the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris work just as well for fall.In London, Chopova Lowena showcased patterned tights alongside metal hardware and three-quarter-length, snake-print leather jackets. In New York, all eyes were on LaQuan Smith’s military-style shirts, translucent trench coats, and oxblood feathered jackets. And was there anyone who didn't go weak at the knees for Saint Laurent? The show in Paris brought back the brand founder’s famous tailored look with 1980s-style shoulder pads, polka dot ties, and heavy leather bomber jackets.When it came to beauty, Tolu Coker made the case for 1960s glamour at her London Fashion Week show, with models donning voluminous beehives and graphic black and white eyeliner with diffused corners. Harris Reed went one step further with full doll eyes complete with long, sticky lashes and warm, golden bronze eyeshadows. But it was perhaps Luar who best channeled the vampiness of the season with glossy black lips and exaggerated brows.If all that isn’t enough inspiration for the season ahead, we’ve got plenty of new launches on our radar which are sparking our imagination this October.

Now, the brand is bringing two new dreamy fragrances into the fold, this time with more distinctive personalities. Housed in a crushed grape-colored bottle, You Rêve is all about sweet warmth with notes including buttercream, toasted almond and plum butter alongside spicy sandalwood. For those in search of something less fruity, You Doux is the sophisticated older sister scent, offering a softer mix of notes. Blending earthy palo santo, frankincense and sweet violet, the perfume delivers a musky woodiness that’s perfect for fall. Both fragrances are vegan and cruelty-free.Shop now at GlossierGlossier Glossier You Rêve, $, available at GlossierUGG New Heights CollectionIt’s officially “boots with the fur” season, which makes UGG’s latest platform footwear perfectly timed. Featuring the brand’s first-ever heeled designs, the New Heights collection adds a touch of glamour to the everyday with a range of heel heights across classic and new silhouettes. The stand-out for sure is the Xtra Boot, a full suede, knee-high design that we wouldn’t be shocked to see Sabrina Carpenter wearing on her upcoming Christmas special. If you’re searching for something more subtle, there’s also an ultra mini low boot with a 1.5\" heel height and a range of heeled cozy clogs in neutral colorways that could rival the Tasman’s popularity.

It continues to innovate, this season tapping pop/R\u0026B icon Ciara as creative director for a capsule collection. While many of the looks are ready for center stage (the leopard-print catsuit is giving serious Scary Spice vibes), there are plenty of casual date-night pieces. However, if what you want this season is to be toasty and talked about, look no further than the head-turning, faux-fur olive maxi coat.Shop now at BebeBebe x Ciara Faux Fur Maxi Coat, $, available at bebeDr Dennis Gross DermInfusions Blur + Repair CreamWe all know that colder weather can lead to dry, inflamed skin, which is why a nourishing moisturizer is a must come autumn.

Ahead of Wicked’s release on November 22, retailers like Béis and Target are channeling the magic of Oz into limited-edition products inspired by the movie starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande as Elphaba and Glinda, respectively. It would be truly wicked of us to gatekeep these film-meets-fashion collaborations, so we’re here to inform you of one the best we’ve seen yet, courtesy of H\u0026M.Inspired by the two main characters, the retailer’s 20-piece Wicked collection has apparel styles you can wear to the theater (graphic T-shirts and logo sweatshirts that you can cozy up in all spooky season long), plus pieces that your favorite Ozians might even wear themselves (such as an asymmetric mini-dress, sharp-shouldered blazer, and curvy handbag that can make any fall outfit more chic, not kitsch). If you were already planning a Wicked-themed Halloween costume, cart up the black corset to wear as Elphaba or the chandelier earrings for Glinda. Prices range between $9.99 and $59.99. There are even a few beauty products, like a green-bristled makeup brush set and satin bow scrunchie to help you get ready in wickedly beautiful style. Whether you identify as a good witch or a bad witch — or are just a fan of all things Wicked —  you’ll have to hop on your broom or wave your wand ASAP to get hold of these limited-edition styles.The H\u0026M x Wicked collection is available to shop online and in select H\u0026M stores now.

The holiday season is fast approaching, which means we’re already thinking about what we’ll be wearing to every festive event coming up. But it looks like we can check “outfit planning” off our to-do list thanks to the new Gap x Cult Gaia collaboration.  Launching on October 10, the 35-piece collection fuses Gap’s timeless everyday essentials with the LA-based brand’s occasion-worthy flair. The line comprises modern takes on pieces that can be worn to parties and out or, on the other end of the style spectrum, while running errands or cozying up at home. Find a denim bustier, a matching chocolate brown leather pants and jacket set, a backless white button-up, cropped knit cardigans, a vegan suede coat, and crewneck sweatshirts with “GAIA” adorned on the front in the classic Gap font.  Of course, as should be expected from the It Girl brand that rose to popularity for celeb-beloved styles like Cult Gaia’s Serita, the collection also features dresses, like the mini slip with chain-link shoulder straps and a long-sleeve maxi with hip cut-outs. Alongside the womenswear pieces, the collection also includes kids’ apparel.  562821012 WOMENS WOMENS KNITS ACT TOPS GAP X CG LOGO CREWNECK ONLINE , 562951012 WOMENS WOMENS BOTTOMS LONG PAN GAP X CG CARGO PANT ONLINE , 646752002 WOMENS WOMENS OUTRWR/ITEMS LTHR/SDE GAP X CG FAUX SEUDE COAT ONLINE “Reimagining Gap’s classic icons through Cult Gaia’s lens has been an amazing journey. The collaboration brought together Gap’s classics and everyday wearability with Cult Gaia’s sculptural and artistic approach, merging our two distinct creative forces,” said Cult Gaia designer and founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat in a press release. “Each piece in this collection is thoughtfully designed to inspire creativity, blending art and function in a way that feels unique and timeless.”  The collab is the most recent covetable fashion-forward launch from the Gap. This year alone, the American brand has teamed up with lifestyle brand Madhappy and LA label Dôen, as well as released a version of the viral shirtdress Anne Hathaway wore on a red carpet that was designed by new creative director Zac Posen.  Gap x Cult Gaia will be available to shop online on October 10 at noon ET and in select Gap stores.  Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Spooky season has finally arrived, so it’s time to decide which Halloween costume you’ll be wearing on October 31 and Halloweekend. While you can go as a tried-and-true witch or cat, with the simple addition of a hat or ears, this past year has brought us many notable pop culture moments that are too good to pass up on. The 2024 Paris Olympics captured the world’s attention with viral athlete memes, while a baby hippopotamus warmed our hearts.This year’s film and music releases provided plenty of costume inspo, too. From blockbuster movies like Challengers and the much-anticipated Wicked film adaptation to chart-topping music releases from the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Beyoncé and Chappell Roan’s festival performances, there’s been no shortage of entertainment (or style). With that in mind, read on to get inspiration for your DIY Halloween costume this year, which will no doubt get you best-dressed status at your upcoming parties. Aside from the occasional kitschy prop, we’ve curated pieces that may already live in your closet, or ones you’ll be able to wear outside of spooky holiday festivities.Whether you want to dress up with your friends and relive Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour or keep it more simple (yet still recognizable) as a chef from The Bear, there are many pop culture Halloween costume ideas to be excited about ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 Wicked Witch Costume: Glinda \u0026 Elphaba Duo There’s no question that Wicked will be one of the biggest moves of 2024, and a major fashion presence this fall, with Wicked collaborations already dropping. This Halloween, dress up as Ariana Grande’s Glinda or Cynthia Erivo’s Elphaba solo or as a duo costume.To channel Elphaba, put together a dramatic black outfit using a satin corset, tulle skirt, and sheer cape. And don’t forget to swipe some green onto your face and arms for the full effect. For Glinda, be pretty in pink in a ruffled or puff-sleeve dress. Accessorize with a tiara, wand, and statement heels that are just as whimsical.Now, the only question is… are you a good witch or a bad witch? DashDividers_1_500x100 Sabrina Carpenter “Taste” Duo Costume View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter) Carpenter knows a thing or two about dropping drool-worthy music videos and looks (from the red carpet to the stage). Her recent video, for Taste, features the performer alongside Beetlejuice star Jenna Ortega rivaling over a boy while looking drop-dead gorgeous. Dress up as Sabrina in a ‘50s-inspired gingham capri set covered in washable fake blood. And have your bestie join in on the fun, wearing a sleek tweed dress while holding an inflatable chainsaw balloon. DashDividers_1_500x100 Challengers Costume: Tashi Duncan Oh, the whirlwind experience that was watching the Challengers film… and admiring the on-theme press tour looks that came before it. When she wasn’t wearing a 2000s velour tracksuit jacket in the film, Zendaya’s tennis star Tashi Duncan sported classic activewear like tennis dresses, court sneakers, and the Loewe graphic T-shirt. If you want to turn this into a group costume, recreate the film’s love triangle with characters Art and Patrick in their striped button-downs and backwards hats. Or channel the final scene with the jaw-dropping tennis racket moment for the ultimate photo op. DashDividers_1_500x100 Beyoncé Costume: Cowboy Carter Cowgirl View this post on Instagram A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce) Beyhive assemble, because Beyoncé has brought us yet another era of music (Country) and fashion identity (Western) that we’re eager to replicate. Rather than dressing up as your average cowgirl this Halloween, be Cowboy Carter herself. Take inspiration from Beyoncé’s album cover art, music videos, or new Levi’s campaign and create an ensemble full of denim and leather, accessorizing with statement cowboy boots and a customized sash. DashDividers_1_500x100 Olympian Costume: Team USA Stars The 2024 Summer Olympics brought out some of the most wholesome and inspiring moments of the year. Team USA brought home 126 medals across all the sports, but there were certain moments and athletes that made an even bigger impact than any medal could. From gymnastics superstars like Simone Biles, Suni Lee, and Stephen Nedoroscik (AKA pommel horse guy AKA Clark Kent) to the “fastest woman in the world” Sha’Carri Richardson and TikTok-viral rugby player Ilona Maher, we’re excited to channel America’s real-life superheroes this Halloween.Look out for a red-white-and-blue activewear, bedazzled leotards, rugby jerseys, or official Team USA Ralph Lauren merch. Bonus idea: Make it a group costume by dressing like the gymnastics “Golden Girls” crew. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Bear Costume: Season 3 Chefs Everyone’s favorite stress-inducing “comedy” series made another splash this year with a third season. We’re talking about the award-winning dramedy The Bear. Channel any of the loveably flawed characters by wearing a dark blue apron and a white top (fashion props if it’s from Thom Browne). Draw on faux tattoos with an eyeliner pencil like Carmi, or throw on a colorful headscarf like Sydney. Complete your look with chef-approved on-trend clogs, some beat-up dish towels, and go on your way shouting “Yes, chef!” to everyone you cross paths with. DashDividers_1_500x100 Moo Deng Costume A viral baby hippo wasn’t on our 2024 Bingo card, but we’re glad it happened. Moo Deng, which translates to “bouncing pig,” is a pygmy hippo in a Thailand zoo who went viral after videos of her sassiness and wet-glazed donut-meets-glass skin appearance quickly spread in September.If you want to channel the adorable Rhode-worthy ambassador, embrace blushed cheeks, glossy lips, and slicked-back hair. Then wear any gray or metallic silver dress you desire (and can wear again afterward). Accessorize with light pink jewelry, bags, or shoes, and throw on hippopotamus ears for good measure. DashDividers_1_500x100 Chappell Roan Costume: “Pink Pony Club” View this post on Instagram A post shared by ･ﾟ: *✧ Chappell Roan ✧*:･ﾟ (@chappellroan) Although The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess album debuted in 2023, it wasn’t until 2024 that Roan exploded on the mainstream music scene. Now, the pop diva’s campy songs, high-energy performances, maximalist stage costumes, and drag queen-inspired makeup are ubiquitous.While the singer’s costumes and color palettes constantly shift and evolve from performance to performance, many of her signature looks include cowboy hats, bedazzled bodysuits, fringe, and lots of pink. Join the “Pink Pony Club” this Halloween by wearing pink-everything and donning a red curly wig. Or if you want to switch it up, replicate other iconic Chappell looks, like the Statue of Liberty at Governor’s Ball. DashDividers_1_500x100 Bridgerton Costume: Season 3 Featherington Era Season 3 of Bridgerton put Penelope Featherington (AKA Lady Whistledown) into the spotlight as she unwillingly searched for a husband. At first a wallflower dressed in cutsey florals, Penelope’s confidence and style evolved into more mature, deep gem tones. This Halloween, dress up like Lady Whistledown (or her comical sisters) in a bright citrus-hued dress and lots of feathers (from a hairpiece to a quill pen for writing the town’s gossip column).However, if you connect more with the Bridgerton sisters, instead wear pink, purple, and blue pastels and delicate lace. Better yet, make it a group costume, and dress up as this season’s frenemy duo Penelope and Eloise. DashDividers_1_500x100 Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour Group Costume One of the biggest cultural phenomenons of 2024 was (and still is) Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, where the star performs songs from her many original and re-recorded albums. These fashion-forward mega concerts have inspired fans to dress up like the singer’s different “eras,” from Lover and Red to Reputation and Folklore (or 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department).Relive your concert by re-wearing your concert outfit and commemorating the magic that was the Eras Tour. Or if you didn’t get a ticket, take Halloween as your chance to finally dress up with your besties in styles that symbolize your favorite Taylor Swift album, or replicate the costumes the singer wore on stage herself.

    "title": "Lady Gaga’s Costumes In Joker: Folie À Deux Reference CBGB, Amy Winehouse \u0026…Lady Gaga",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lady-gaga-joker-folie-a-deux-costumes-references?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In Joker: Folie à Deux, the titular alter ego of failed comedian Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and the enigmatic Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) develop a dangerous bond as inmates in the notorious Arkham State Hospital, a bond they express through elaborate song and dance numbers. (“Folie à deux” refers to a medical term for a shared psychosis.) But are these fantastical, often foreboding musical sequences just in Arthur’s head, or somehow a deeper connection between the two? That’s up to audiences to decide. Behind the scenes, though, dance parties regularly went down in Gaga’s costume, hair and makeup trailer, which even had a nickname. “‘Camp Lee’ was fantastic,” says Arianne Phillips. “It was so much fun.” From pre-production through filming, the three-time Oscar-nominated costume designer meticulously plotted Lee’s journey, along with Gaga (whom Phillips refers to by the star’s birth name, Stefani), Frederic Aspiras (Gaga’s hairstylist) and makeup artist Sarah Tanno. The team took the character from an inpatient at the bleak psychiatric facility to her bold self-actualization as mercurial antihero Harley Quinn.  “What’s unique about Stefani is that she really understands costume, hair, and makeup — and she understands character,” says Phillips, who took over as costume designer from Joker’s Mark Bridges (who received an Oscar nod for that film). The sequel is set in the early 1980s, and the costume aesthetic emphasizes a grimy, gritty realism. Phillips took inspiration from authentic sources, from ‘70s downtown New York City hallmarks to the golden age of Hollywood to Lady Gaga herself.  “She was really honest and very generous with sharing some of her own personal experience that she felt related to Lee, and that those were really morsels that I could take in,” says Phillips. She keeps the actual details close to her vest, simply sharing: “You can see it throughout the whole film.” Ahead, Phillips discusses Lee’s custom-designed wardrobe evolution through three different worlds: Arkham, the courtroom, and a fantastical wedding.  Lee’s “Cozy Sweaters” At Arkham State Hospital As he awaits trial for mass murder in high-risk block E of the corrupt Gotham psychiatric facility, Arthur ventures into the minimum-security B ward. The world slows down for a moment when he spots Lee outside a music class: Swaddled in an oversized marigold mohair cardigan over her hospital-issue white scrubs, she meets his eye and makes a finger gun gesture to her head.  Like many headline-grabbing mass murderers before him, Arthur’s the subject of a TV movie, which an enamored Lee has watched countless times. “She’s this little street urchin,” says Phillips. “She really made herself small in order to get his attention… This is really a love story, and we wanted to create a vulnerability with her in this institution.”  Lee’s “cozy sweaters” — her trusty mustard one, and a two-tone blue cardigan — set a backstory for the character, according to the costume designer: “The idea is that maybe she found it in a thrift store or it belonged to her father.” (For the Superman-level vision-enhanced viewer, Phillips also wove subtle, foreshadowing diamond patterns into both cardis.) A sweet, dainty bow at the neckline of Lee’s tank and her scruffy ballet slippers (a reference to Amy Winehouse — who sported a visibly worn-in pair on more than one occasion — and director Todd Phillips’ idea) also convey vulnerability. And an origin story.  “There’s a little infantilizing of her in the beginning,” says Phillips. “She has this bravado — a fearlessness that you really experience in a young person — and then you see her as her determination grows over time.” Lee’s Downtown NYC-Influenced Courtroom Outfits  Out of Arkham, Lee gradually shows her support of (or fixation on?) Arthur and his Joker persona by moving up the gallery to sit front row at his trial. Her courtroom dresses undergo a progression, too, starting with a floaty, light blue floral mini before evolving to a sheer black tunic with velvet diamond shapes and a navy, flower-print “church”-type dress with an exaggerated Peter Pan collar. “[The early ‘80s] was the time when the East Village scene and CBGB on the Bowery were starting up,” says Phillips about the inspiration for Lee’s supposedly thrifted, ‘70s “babydoll, [designer] Biba-esque dresses” worn with discordant oversize cardigans and chunky punk rock outerwear. “She has a fake fur jacket and a thrift store men’s sweater. She would have cobbled these looks together, but, still, there’s a vulnerability and bizarre innocence — she’s this sycophant who’s obsessed with Joker. That mix, to me, shows that.”  On the final day of Arthur’s trial, Lee strides into court in full Harley Quinn regalia: a red blazer with raised diamond patterns and pleated ruffle cuffs, a theatrical corset and graphic tights. “Along with [embracing] her determination, she has taken on this persona inspired by Joker,” says Phillips. She imagines that Lee thrifted the red jacket from an old circus uniform, ripped the muslin and ruffle-trimmed corset off a period costume gown, and maybe copped the leather mini from the Gotham outpost of Trash and Vaudeville. “You see the diamond pattern throughout,” she adds. Lee’s Showstopping Fantasy Looks During an extremely tense trial moment, Arthur dissociates into one of his most heightened musical sequences: a wedding.  Lee walks down the aisle toward Joker in a V-neck mini dress with a delicate diamond trapunto pattern and gleaming ribbons streaming down the shoulders — “playing into what Arthur would be attracted to,” says Phillips. “In her fantasy, and his fantasy, what would that look like?” Phillips referenced ‘60s icons like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis for the block-heel Mary Janes, plus Doctor Zhivago-era Julie Christie and the late ‘60s/‘70s silhouettes of Ossie Clark and Biba. “[The dress is] pretty inspired by my aunt, who got married in the ‘70s,” she adds. “I was a flower girl.” The nuptials transition into a raucous jazz performance at the ill-fated (and ominously named) Pogo’s comedy club. Lee smashes the keys on a baby grand as she belts out a banger, wearing a silver metal mesh dress that sways with her bombastic movements, bringing to mind…well, Lady Gaga. Phillips — who’s designed six world tours for Madonna — collaborated with Michael Schmidt (a go-to for the likes of Dua Lipa, Sabrina Carpenter and Olivia Rodrigo) on the sparkly stage-wear. “I made a diamond-shaped collar that just gave a certain energy to that scene,” she says. The costume designer also worked with Lady Gaga’s sister, Natali Germanotta, and her atelier, Topo Studio, which built the white bias-cut gown for a rooftop dance number straight out of a silver screen classic. “Totally Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire,” says Phillips, “and [the dress inspiration] was in the script, so I leaned into that.” She also sketched and designed the sleek, fluid gown to allow for Gaga and Phoenix’s upbeat choreography. For another bit, a striking marigold two-piece set with a smattering of delicate beading references Bob Mackie’s work for Cher. “The beauty of this movie is that there’s so much realism,” she says, “yet we get to be in Arthur’s mind, where we blur reality and fantasy.” Joker: Folie à Deux is out in theaters on October 4.
