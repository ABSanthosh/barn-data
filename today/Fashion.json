    "description": "Great products that work on your skin while you sleepIt is 2.30am, and I am exhausted yet struggling to sleep. The irony that I am writing about skincare for night-time is not lost on me. But when you have to go out into the world having existed on little or no sleep, it will help you look a little less shattered. Your skin operates differently in the early hours, a time when it renews itself. As we get older, however, the ability of the skin to do this is reduced. So a product created specifically to work at night makes all the difference. And there’s choice. Some are really technologically advanced – Clinique detects specific skin concerns and treats them accordingly. There are masks, too: Sisley’s is soothing and great for dehydrated skin; Laneige’s is super-hydrating, has a clear, water-like texture that goes on like moisturiser and is perfect for oilier skins; retinol boosts cell turnover as it brightens and unclogs pores. And then you have the stalwarts, such as Estée Lauder’s popular Advanced Night Repair that produces amazing results – increased hydration, smoother skin, more glow – after just one night. Its latest iteration is an overnight treatment that has all the benefits of its predecessor except your skin looks like it has had two nights’ sleep as opposed to one. For any insomniac that’s the dream.1. Medik8 Crystal Retinal 24 £109, medik8.com 2. L’Occitane Overnight Reset Oil-in-Serum £59, loccitane.com 3.

    "description": "A new report claims that fewer than 4% of London fashion week designers have published emissions reduction targets, compared with 44% of all UK companies. Why is the industry so slow to reform?In just over a fortnight, some of the UK’s biggest fashion brands will showcase their new collections at London fashion week. Organised by the British Fashion Council (BFC), it’s always an exciting moment, bringing together some of the country’s top creative talent. But it also highlights entrenched problems in fashion. Only 3.4% of BFC members have published public targets to reduce their emissions aligned with the Paris Agreement, according to a new report by ethical fashion not-for-profit Collective Fashion Justice.The BFC is a body of organisations from the industry who are responsible for overseeing, supporting and advising on the key issues facing the British designer industry, with members including publishing houses, high street brands and retail destinations, including household names like Yoox, Net-a-Porter and Savile Row. Of these members, only five brands – Burberry, Mulberry, Margaret Howell, Rixo and Kyle Ho – have published science-based targets aligned with the Paris agreement, which would, according to CFJ, “make them effective targets worth working towards”. By stark contrast, 44% of all UK companies have a structured plan to reduce their carbon footprint and climate impact, according to recent data from the Climate Ready Index. Continue reading...",

The 32-year-old self-styled “fashion educator” from north London is a reformed fashion influencer. She now reviews clothes for her 248,000 TikTok and 152,000 Instagram followers, analysing clothing, accessories and shoes with an unsparing eye for cost, quality, construction and materials. Cheong operates without fear or favour, and is as likely to flame Prada as she is Primark. Her videos are addictively watchable, mostly because Cheong is scathing and hilarious. “Is everyone OK?” she asks in one review of a fraying Mango dress. “If this is what they call premium, I’m genuinely quite concerned.” But these videos are also informative: educating viewers about what to expect of their clothes, and how to spot indicators of poor quality.If Cheong has one ethos, it is this: we need to start reading the care labels in our clothes the same way we would read the ingredients on a packet of crisps. This is because, as she writes in her 2023 book Why Don’t I Have Anything to Wear?, “the story is in the care label … We can’t keep going for style over substance.” Continue reading...",

SLIPPERS ARE NOT SHOES”. Suffice to say, its patrons remain untroubled by wider conversations about the etiquette of workout clothes, both inside and outside the gym. (My view: it’s increasingly standard to wear athleisure anywhere you’d wear jeans, especially if it’s mixed with smarter pieces.)

AI Donald Trump is entering his 50th term. Polar bears have gone the way of the dodo. Happily, Cher remains entirely unchanged. A magazine headline asks: “Should men be allowed to wear shorts?” It’s my belief that the perennial debate over whether men can wear shorts should have been put to bed the moment Paul Mescal was papped in a minuscule O’Neills pair, sending the global happiness index soaring by approximately 10,000 points. Here was a way for a man to wear the equivalent of Diana’s revenge dress – or Beyoncé’s freakum dress, for younger readers – while looking like he’d made no effort whatsoever (leg days at the gym notwithstanding).Earlier this summer, Mescal sported a dressier version of the look at the Gucci menswear show, pairing striped cotton shorts with a blue Oxford shirt, white crew and the brand’s horsebit loafers. Stunning, no notes whatsoever, thank you Paul for your service. Heartbreakingly, we can’t all be Paul Mescal. But it’s my belief that no man should have to swelter through a summer heatwave in a pair of trousers just because … well, I’m never entirely sure of the reasoning. Is it that we associate shorts with childhood, so struggle to take a man in a pair of them seriously? (And if that’s the case, wouldn’t the solution be for more high-powered men to wear shorts?)

She proved as much with her latest collection, a musing on the act of dressing, which she showed in a decidedly autumnal Paris on Friday night.The collection made for a neat framing for the launch of her new scent. “I think that using this as an opportunity to launch our fourth fragrance, it was about our relationship with our skin, about how we dress ourselves, in our wardrobes,” she said to a small scrum of gathered press backstage. “This time it was about taking the clothes off.” Continue reading...",

In the centre of the marquee was a life-size bronze sculpture of a small bird by Tracey Emin. Around the bird, which gazed down on the room from a 13ft pole, were seated an audience including the actors Jeff Goldblum, Rob Lowe and Ayo Edebiri, each clutching the heavy golden Tudor love rings that were their invitations to the Loewe fashion show, in preparation for which this scene had been created.Of all the many unexpected elements of the world designer Jonathan Anderson has built at Loewe, the strangest part of all is that this esoteric universe is a smash hit. Loewe, a venerable Spanish brand that had previously enjoyed a respectable 150 years making elegant handbags for Madrid’s ladies who lunch, has in Anderson’s era become the fastest-growing house in the LVMH luxury stable.

The 17-piece capsule collection aims to showcase Musgraves's personal style and music evolution. It has an English countryside feeling, composed of rich plaids, delicate lace, Victorian bows, equestrian boots, and vintage denim corsets. In a word, it's romantic - which is not how you'd describe even a small chunk of my wardrobe. While I love avant-garde shapes and bold colors, and would even describe my fashion sensibility as ever-changing, I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress ($248). Since the collaboration was dropped in stores and online on Sept. 16, this dress has quickly become one of the most popular silhouettes, largely thanks to Musgraves's appearance on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" The Bunny was the first item she wore from the line she helped design, teamed with a pair of simple black heeled mules. I had yet to dabble in pouf sleeves and doily trims until I met the Bunny Dress. \"I got to curate every single detail of this whole line,\" she told Meyers. \"There's denim, there's headscarves, there's boots, dresses - it's very romantic and I'm really proud of it.\" She continued, \"It wasn't something I just slapped my name on. I really wanted to bring the 'Deeper Well' aesthetic into a different dimension.\" Musgraves went on to reveal that she worked with Reformation for a full year on production, and then shot the campaign in the Cotswolds in England, with her little sister Kelly Christine Sutton behind the camera. \"I keep saying this is the perfect line for you to just frolic around in,\" Musgraves said. And while I've never bought a dress that made me think of frolicking in the meadow (what meadow?), Musgraves's on-screen look was so appealing, I knew I wanted to put my personal touch on it and try to make it my own. What happened when I actually got my hands on the Bunny mini and tried it on surprised me even more. Not only did I feel comfortable enough to embrace my girlier, dare I say demure-leaning, side, I also accessorized with frilly socks and Mary-Janes, a nod to Musgraves's iconic campaign. Scroll to learn a bit more about the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collaboration ahead, then read my full review of the Bunny Dress. Related: Taylor Swift Rehearses in a Denim Workout Dress - Here's How It Holds Up in the Gym What Are the Most Popular Pieces in the Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Collection? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection is comprised of 17 pieces that range in price from $28 to $498. The Bunny dress is definitely one of the most popular pieces, likely because it was the first style Musgraves debuted when she paid a visit to Seth Meyers. The exact version she wore is still in stock in every size, except for in petite, where most sizes are currently waitlist only. According to Reformation, the collection sold very quickly, with the Deeper Well Denim Shirt and Dallas Denim Corset being first to sell through - although most sizes are currently restocked at this time. The Silver Lining Cashmere Two Piece also gets plenty of search, and it's currently available in both gray, and almost every size in camel. Is the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Collection Sustainable? Like all of Reformation's clothing, Kacey Musgraves x Ref prioritizes sustainability. You can read about the brand's commitment to sustainable production methods here, but the 17-piece collection does incorporate deadstock fabrics, regenerative wool, and recycled cashmere, minimizing every shopper's carbon footprint. About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress It comes in three different shades: Brown Plaid, Black, and Chianti (a wine red). It's available in sizes 0-12 and is designed to be fitted at the bodice with an A-line skirt that slightly fans out at the hemline. It's available in petite sizing in all three colorways. You can visit any US Reformation store that offers hemming to have the dress altered for free. The dress material is crafted from deadstock fabric that consists of polyester, rayon, wool, and spandex, and it is dry clean only. Shipping is free, and you can finance your purchase in $62 increments. What I Like About the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation collection comes with a signature tag that suggests exclusivity, which is especially appealing for fans. Like most of Reformation's clothing, the Bunny Dress feels well-made and isn't too flimsy or thin. It comes lined and the scoop-neck is comfortable. Neither the elastic at the sleeves or the lace trim felt itchy against my skin during wear. But I think I discovered my favorite element of this dress before I even left the house: It's actually very versatile. We saw Musgraves wear it with mules on the aforementioned talk show; I liked how it looked in the mirror with knee-high boots, my Steve Madden loafers, and the cranberry Mary-Janes and socks combination that Musgraves and I both successfully pulled off; and podcast host and author Tinx even wore it with the Franklin Boots that are part of the collection. Finally, the dress definitely fits true to size. I'm wearing a 0, which is my typical size, and it fit like a glove. What to Consider Before Buying the Kacey Musgraves Reformation Bunny Dress If you love a dress that's machine washable, unfortunately, the Bunny is dry clean only to preserve all the delicate details. However, in my opinion, this is a year-round investment piece that works with tights and boots in the winter and bare legs and flats in the summer, so I think it's worth the trip to the cleaners. Price-wise, this dress does err on the expensive side when it comes to a minidress, but, again, it can be dressed up or down and works for many different occasions. If you're considered petite like me (I'm 5'1\"), I would recommend trying out the shorter iteration, but I actually felt satisfied with the length of the regular size, which suggests a petite cut might have been too short for my liking. Where Can You Buy the Kacey Musgraves Bunny Dress From Reformation? The Kacey Musgraves x Reformation Bunny Dress is currently only available on the brand's website.

    "title": "Confirmed: This Free People Jacket Is the Perfect All-Seasons Style",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/free-people-chloe-jacket-review-49396350",
    "description": "In my world, some things are inevitable come fall: cooler temperatures, pumpkin spice products consuming my local Trader Joe's, my mom playing Christmas music in her car as early as September, and - perhaps most predictable of all - me buying a new Free People jacket that I'll wear through the new year. While some people might kickstart their autumnal festivities with an apple-picking excursion, my fall doesn't really begin until I've added a cozy, new Free People style to my closet. Last year's elected favorite was none other than the Pippa Packable Puffer Jacket - which is still my go-to travel jacket. My style of choice this season, however, is the Free People Chloe Jacket ($198). I'm far from the first person to fall in love with the comfy jacket; not only has it been bubbling up on TikTok, but the topper is also regarded as one of Free People's bestselling styles. With its flattering fit, quilted composition, and wide array of pattern options, it's not hard to see why this statement piece has garnered so much attention - along with a permanent spot in my wardrobe. Ahead, I break down what makes this Free People jacket one of fall 2024's best coats. What I Like About Free People's Chloe Jacket First and foremost, I love just how endlessly comfortable this jacket is. It's made from a lightweight cotton and rayon material, with a polyester filling that's plush and squishy; it's like getting all the benefits of a cozy down jacket rolled into the structure of a chunky cardigan. The material isn't so heavy that I feel overwhelmed or constricted, but it's also just thick enough to where I can comfortably wear it in lower winter temperatures. This jacket's styling versatility is also endless - whether I want to layer it with a basic T-shirt or team it with a bulky sweater, the product's oversize fit makes it functional enough to work with so many different clothing types. And I appreciate that despite having a steeper price tag, I feel like I'm getting the most for my money with this Free People jacket. I've been wearing it nonstop already this fall (even in 70-degree temperatures) and I know that I'll have no issue wearing it throughout the colder winter months, too. With its floral design, I could probably even get away with donning it throughout the spring season! Its lightweight build is so unique, I honestly forget that I'm often wearing a jacket at all. Plus, the style's packable design makes it a great option for travel. Whether I'm embarking on a road trip or jet setting to another country, it's a style that doesn't take up too much packing space in my carry-on suitcase. What's Worth Noting Unlike traditional zippered or button-down jackets, this style is fitted with hook closure accents, which keep both sides of the jacket pulled together for a more closed-in look. On occasion, the hooks will unlatch and I'll have to reattach them; overall, I find myself fidgeting with this jacket more as opposed to standard zippered styles. Additionally, because of its dolman silhouette, the layer also has a boxier design. The looser fit gives the jacket a lived-in feel that I enjoy, but other reviewers noted it was a bit too oversize for their preferences. I recommend referencing Free People's style guide to source your perfect size, and consider sizing down if you're concerned about it being too large on you. Who Is Free People's Chloe Jacket Best For? If you're in the market for a style that you can comfortably wear through even the most confusing transitional weather - from chilled mornings to warm afternoons and cold nights - this Free People jacket will be your new go-to. It's breathable enough that you won't feel bogged down by heavy material, but its quilted design also ensures ample warmth and insulation in lower temperatures. With a wide variety of pattern and color options, you won't have any trouble finding your dream style - or even stocking up on the jacket in multiple variations (because the more, the merrier!). Additional Details The jacket is available in US women's sizes XS through XL. It comes in 12 different pattern and color options, including a checkered black and white style, striped red and brown variation, and a floral maroon combo (my print of choice). This jacket is crafted from a quilted fabrication that's plush and surprisingly warm, with an insulated design that'll help users stay warm in brisk seasonal temperatures.

Sure, it's important to have a few staple sweaters and coats incorporated into your closet, but the real trick is figuring out how to style all of those pieces together. Enter the cardigan - aka one of fashion's most timeless and trusted wardrobe essentials that you could argue is a basic worth having on hand in any season (though it's especially great for fall and winter). Cardigans have long had a reputation for being more of an understated, even boring, layer, but our latest online shopping spree proves that they're actually anything but. We've fallen back in love with the classic cardigan style, not only because of all the modern silhouettes you can shop, but also because there are so many creative ways to wear them.

    "title": "Gigi Hadid and I Are Both Fans of These Cozy UGG Slippers - and They're Back in Stock",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/ugg-tasman-slippers-review-49308616",
    "description": "If celebrity street style is any sort of indicator on what's cool and trendy in the world of fashion, then UGG platform slippers might be the most popular style this season. The cozy shoes certainly aren't new to mainstream fashion, but with celebrities like Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, and Hailey Bieber constantly donning the slippers - whether it be while trotting around New York or in between red carpet events and Pilates classes - the comfy shoes have definitely ascended into a new realm of popularity (and I'm not the least bit mad about it). In fact, I've been so mesmerized by the overwhelming love that celebrities have for the UGG Tasman Slippers ($110) in particular, I decided to purchase a pair for myself and lucked out that they just happened to be in stock (the slippers are seemingly always sold out). Could I get away with wearing them to the grocery store? Are they durable enough to hold up on my evening walks? Do they truly look good on everyone, or are they just cute on Hadid? (This is actually a recurring thought in my day-to-day life.) These were just a few of the questions I sought to answer when testing out UGG's bestselling slippers. Now that they're back in stock (and likely only for a limited time), ahead, I break down my full experience with the shoe - including how they fit, where they're available to shop, and whether they're truly worth the splurge (spoiler alert: they totally are). What I Like About These UGG Slippers The obvious appeal of these shoes is just how comfy they are - and yes, they're as irresistibly soft and cushiony as you'd imagine. The style boasts a durable leather composition that's sturdy but not too firm to the point where it feels uncomfortable to wear them. Dyed sheep fur lines the inside of the style, and while it certainly creates a cozier feel, I appreciate that the material isn't too thick or overbearing to the point that my feet start to feel sweaty. Unlike other everyday slippers, this style has a rubber sole base that's thick and designed to last, so I don't have to worry about whether it can withstand being worn on surfaces like concrete, tile, or grass - it holds up well and has just enough of a platform that the slipper's material doesn't dirty when being worn beyond my apartment. I love that these shoes seamlessly blend comfort with functionality and the fact that they're versatile enough to be worn in a number of environments, such as running errands, grabbing brunch, going to and from the gym, or even just around my home. What's Worth Noting I've had these slippers for almost eight months now, so I've had plenty of time to break them in. Because I work from home and generally only wear them inside or whenever I need to run a quick errand outside of my apartment, I'm not wearing them super extensively, which is why I've been pretty surprised by how worn down the inside of the shoe feels, particularly around the toe area. I've definitely noticed a change in the cushioning of the shoe, as the inside lining feels more worn down (almost like it's disintegrating or caving into itself), and several knots have even started forming toward the upper sole of the slipper, making it feel bumpy when I walk. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of this, especially considering I've owned a handful of UGG boots in the past and never had any issue with them before. Perhaps this is simply the nature of what happens when you wear a pair of slippers as frequently as I do - things do eventually have to wear down, after all. However, it's worth noting that if you want these slippers to be a mainstay in your closet, you'll likely have to factor in buying a new pair every year - at least if you plan on wearing them as regularly as I do. Who Are These UGG Slippers Best For? If you want a pair of shoes you can comfortably wear around the house, out to run errands, or even for a quick walk through the neighborhood, these UGG slippers are a worthwhile investment. I appreciate their versatility and the fact that besides being a great everyday shoe, they're also incredibly comfortable and easy to slip into - even if I'm in a rush or literally running out the door. Additional Details These everyday slippers are crafted in a dyed sheep fur material and feature a rubbed sole base that's designed to be worn outdoors. The shoes are available to shop in a handful of colors, including chestnut brown (my coloring of choice), dark gray, samba red, burnt olive, and more. The UGG slippers come in US women's sizes 5 through 11. Where Are These UGG Slippers Available to Shop? The UGG Tasman Slippers are available to shop at Amazon, Anthropologie, and Zappos.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-shoes-for-standing-all-day-49395982",
    "description": "It sounds sort of funny, but there are so many reasons to stand all day, whether you prefer a raised desk at the office; are constantly on the go, taking meetings all over your city; or traveling often, and for long periods of time. The need for stylish and comfortable walking shoes to get you from point A to point B is crucial, which is why we've curated a list of comfy heels and work shoes that provide support and durability. Of course, this all comes down to footwear construction - no matter how much we can appreciate an eye-catching upper. Many of the shoe brands on this list are well-known for their science-backed insole designs, including Marion Parke, started by a podiatrist and foot surgeon-turned-designer; and Vivaia, a sustainable label turning recycled plastic water bottles into machine washable shoes with a honeycomb cushioned footbed. We kept a wide range of styles, budgets, and needs in mind when building this shopping list, so whether you're more of a demure-leaning ballet flats person or a '90s grunge connoisseur, there will be a pair of shoes here for you.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/best-printed-midi-dresses-48898839",
    "description": "Printed dresses are arguably one of the most essential styles to have on hand for transitional weather. From a morning brunch to a happy hour date, a printed dress really is the ultimate frock - perfect for helping you to create a lightweight, hassle-free outfit that will still keep you looking fresh through even the busiest schedules. When it comes to playful fall fashion, we're convinced that perhaps the only thing better than a printed dress is a halter, cutout, and maxi printed dress. We love a good pattern as much as the next fashionista - especially if it helps to elevate an otherwise breezy or minimalistic style with a more statement-making touch. So it's no surprise that we're equally as taken with the bold elegance provided by a chic, printed dress. Spend a few minutes browsing the internet for one of these styles and you'll find, evidently, that there are a lot of printed dress options to shop at the moment - with gowns that feature everything from geometric designs and floral-adorned prints to so many other eye-catching styles that are perfect for nailing all your fall weddings and events, no matter the dress code. We've shopped out a few of our favorite printed dresses below, with styles from Amazon, Nordstrom, Asos, Anthropologie, and more. Read on to browse our picks.

    "description": "A new season is the perfect opportunity to restock your closet. For us, that means hunting down everything from seasonal shoes to handbags, and although we might not be experiencing sun-soaked days anymore, fall is also a great time to pick out a new pair of sunglasses. At Nordstrom, you can browse through an expansive inventory that includes all sorts of brands and styles. Whether you're looking to incorporate a new trend or you want something timeless, we've pored over the options to curate a stellar list of favorites. In fact, we've even tested some of these sunglasses ourselves - wearing them to gauge their comfort level and durability. The result? A fail-proof selection that will work with a variety of face shapes, styles, and budgets. If you're looking for a modern cat eye, our editor found the perfect black pair that she wears with everything. Prefer an oversize shape? We uncovered an editor favorite for that category as well.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/street-style-trends-48961602",
    "description": "Fashion Week introduces trends for the season to come, but it also keeps us firmly rooted in the current moment through street style snapshots. What people wear while skipping from one show to the next is often just as inspiring as anything you'll see walking down the runway - if not more so. After several seasons of digital-only or hybrid-presentation models due to the pandemic, New York Fashion Week has officially returned back to its roots with a packed schedule of in-person shows and events, running over the course of five days. From Sept. 6-10, Fashion Week brought together style enthusiasts from across the world, all looking toward the spring/summer 2025 season. They stepped out in bold sartorial statements, from charmcore jewelry and accessories to corpcore suiting that turned heads. Other noteworthy street style trends included tenniscore skirts (especially coming off the US Open), texture play, co-ord sets, and dopamine dressing. On the footwear front, show goers continued to favor platforms and also took a tip from the runways by opting for stylish and comfortable walking shoes. But kitten heels, sneakers, and ballet flats remained a go-to for those looking to strike a balance between fashion and function. Outerwear favorites, when necessary given the humidity in New York, were primarily bold-hued and worn oversize, with statement trench coats cinched at the waist reigning supreme. And some of the top handbag brands spotted on style stars? Prada, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Staud, Coperni, and Brandon Blackwood, just to name a few. This season, PS senior content director Jessica Andrews, PS associate director of Shopping Sarah Wasilak, and PS assistant editor of Shopping Kyley Warren attended NYFW shows sporting many shoppable new trends. Still, looks worn by past editors continue to remain relevant. Keep reading for a full recap on what the editorial team wore to Fashion Week through the season, and refresh your wardrobe with their exact items.

    "description": "In the latest batch of reimagined Y2K trends, TikTok has managed to resurrect a peak early '00s staple: charm jewelry. That's right - the chunky charm necklaces and metallic charm bracelets that once dominated your accessories drawer are proving to be fashion's most coveted commodity this fall. And they're not just here to take over standard jewelry pieces; bag charms are also popping up on the arms of A-listers and style influencers alike, with designer brands like Coach and Kate Spade New York releasing their own novelty pieces. So, what's inspired this charmcore craze? For starters, few fashion accessories provide a more failsafe way to turn heads the moment you walk into a room - in part, because of their notoriously loud, jangly design. Charm jewelry also offers a more sustainable route for updating your wardrobe each season; rather than investing in a new work bag or necklace, you can simply reimagine your older pieces with charm accessories that'll add some welcomed character (and color) to any style. Much like friendship bracelets, the charmcore trend is all about wearing things that showcase your personality and play up your interests. It's kitschy, it's niche, and oftentimes even a little tacky - but that's what makes it so fun. And if you're looking to test out the charm jewelry trend for yourself but don't know where to start, fear not - we've got you covered. From earring charms to charm keychains that you can use to dress up your bags, boots, and more, we've rounded up the best charm jewelry to wear this season and beyond. Our top picks come from both charm jewelry brands and larger retailers like Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters. Looking for a specific style? Browse through our categories below.

    "title": "This Barefoot Dreams Robe Is the Epitome of Cozy Luxury - and It's on Sale",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/barefoot-dreams-cozychic-robe-review-49264346",
    "description": "I'll be the first to admit that when it comes to shopping for new fashion pieces or trendy products, I'm easily influenced - especially if the recommendation comes from a celebrity with notoriously impeccable test. Last fall I interviewed celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe (who I've long been an admirer of), and during our phone conversation, she divulged a few of her all-time favorite products. These items ranged in everything from a beaded necklace and an anti-aging serum to a retro pair of Adidas sneakers and a cozy, oversize robe - well, the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe ($127, originally $138), to be more specific. Zoe couldn't say enough great things about the robe style, even acknowledging it as being one of her go-to \"sleeping essentials,\" and noting that her entire family is fitted with their own Barefoot Dreams' robes (talk about a testimony!). Now, I'm no stranger to Barefoot Dreams - and if you're someone who (like me) regularly scrolls TikTok or keeps tabs on celebrity-favorite products, then you're probably all too familiar with the brand, too. The loungewear and apparel label is hailed as having some of the most addictively soft, comfortable, and downright luxurious products on the market. Hailey Bieber has made her love for the brand's CozyChic Blanket widely known, and Kourtney Kardashian and Brie Larson are also huge fans. Coziness is at the heart of everything that Barefoot Dreams creates, and since cozy season is officially here (at long last!), I figured now would be the perfect time to test out the brand's bestselling CozyChic Robe to see if it actually lives up to all of the internet hype. Keep reading for my honest review of this Barefoot Dreams robe to see why I think it would make the perfect gift for your friend (or really the perfect gift for any woman) in your life. What I Like About the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe The obvious answer is that I love how ridiculously cozy and comforting this robe feels while on - it's genuinely the softest thing in my entire apartment, and oftentimes even feels warmer than some of my larger blankets. The style is made from a plush polyester microfiber material that's irresistibly cozy and somehow manages to relax my body the moment I put it on; literally any tensions within my body become relieved. But the deeper, much more layered answer, is that I appreciate just how much this robe has managed to elevate my post-shower routine. While the style isn't strictly reserved for bathroom wear, it has been a great addition to my own evening bathroom regimen, particularly when I step out of the shower. I'll usually dry off my body with one of my normal cotton towels and then immediately slip into this robe for all of my post-shower tasks - which involves working through my nightly skin-care routine, brushing my hair, applying lotion on my body, and (depending on my breakfast or dinner schedule) brushing my teeth, too. Usually these tasks feel more like chores rather than things to genuinely get excited about. But because of how luxurious this robe feels, it's almost like my morning and nighttime routines have somehow been elevated into a much more enjoyable experience. The product itself it so decadent, wearing it feels comparable to a spa-like experience - except it's one that I get to enjoy from the comfort of my home everyday. I was definitely not expecting to fall in love with this robe as much as I did, but now I completely understand why Zoe had seemingly endless compliments for the product. What's Worth Noting About the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe Because it's made from a polyester microfiber material, the robe does have pretty specific care instructions. Per the Barefoot Dreams website, it's recommended that you machine wash the piece cold in a gentle cycle. Once the washing process is done, you can lay it flay to dry, or even tumble dry it on low. If needed, users can steam or cool iron the robe's fabric, though it's recommended that the style is never washed with bleach, dryer sheets, or fabric softener. Following these steps will help to preserve the quality of your robe and ensure it doesn't start to pill too much over time. Who Is the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe Best For? Honestly it's hard to even pinpoint a target audience for this robe because it's so perfect for everyone. The style has a cozy fit that wraps seamlessly around the body and literally makes you feel like you're being hugged by a cloud. It's heavier than most robes that I've worn, but not so much so that it feels overbearing - in fact, I think it'd actually be a great investment or gift for someone with anxiety as it almost feels comparable to a weighted blanket (though again, by no means as heavy). The robe's rich texture is soft to the touch and incredibly luxurious. If you're someone who's looking to elevate their at-home bathroom experience - and especially your post-shower routine - this robe will definitely do the trick. Best of all, it has an oversize fit that ensures you're completely covered, without any room for slips or peeks. When I've had friends over for a girl's night, I've felt completely comfortable wearing this plush robe around my apartment because it fits like a dream and is arguably the comfiest thing I own - even comfier than some of my go-to cashmere loungewear pieces, which says a lot. Additional Details This robe is made from a 100 percent polyester microfiber material and has special care instructions which are designed to ensure the material is well-preserved over time - more specifics can be found in the above sections. The style is available to shop in three unique sizes: 1, 2, and 3. It's recommended that you reference the Barefoot Dreams size guide before purchasing anything, as the brand has unique size charts for different products - including the CozyChic robe. Similar to other Barefoot Dreams' products, this cozy robe is available to shop in a variety of different colorways, including: white, dove gray (my shade of choice), pearl, and slate blue. Where to Shop the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Robe This plush robe is available to shop at Amazon, Barefoot Dreams, and Zappos.

From the subway to the office to after-work cocktails with your friends and beyond, these are the shoes you'll practically be living in daily, so it's important to shop for a pair that'll keep you feeling comfortable, supported, and chic. Ahead, we curated a list of this season's best and most comfortable work shoes for women, from slingback heels and black flats to business-casual shoes that can meet any office's dress-code requirements. Most importantly, they all have one thing in common: they'll become your go-to everyday pair.

    "title": "Nordstrom's Latest Fashion Collab Spotlights Black Culture",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/nordstrom-harlems-fashion-row-49392645",
    "description": "While fashion is far from lacking in the area of collaborations, Harlem's Fashion Row just created a new standard through its partnership with Nordstrom. The company, which champions diversity by bridging the gap between brands and Black designers, has worked with everyone from Nike and LeBron James to Banana Republic. Partnering with a retail behemoth like Nordstrom, however, hits differently. In fact, HFR founder \u0026 CEO Brandice Daniel calls it \"a celebration of Black consumers' cultural and economic power.\" Daniel has dedicated her career to amplifying Black voices in fashion, so it was only fitting that she highlighted three monumental Black-owned brands with this Nordstrom collaboration: House of Aama, Harbison, and Megan Renee. The Nordstrom by Harlem's Fashion Row collab arrives just in time for the summer-to-fall transition and features pieces that speak to the longstanding impact of Black culture in fashion. House of Aama's signature feminine aesthetic is elevated by unique tailoring inspired by African Diaspora Dandy culture. Highlights include jewelry adorned with etching-type motifs you would normally see in antiquity pottery. Meanwhile, Harbison's designs serve as an ode to his mother, who he says navigated society with unmatched poise as a working-class, utilitarian woman. He was also inspired by Simon Maris's \"Portrait of a Young Black Woman\" (1890), where the woman's eyes reflect innocence and curiosity, communicated in the abstract color-blocking and inviting florals of his designs. Image Source: Nordstrom While House of Aama and Harbison leaned into the visceral power of our culture, Megan Renee stuck to the undeniable elan of being a woman. The brand's eponymous founder Megan Smith is all about celebrating bold, strong womanhood, and her collection exudes just that. Wearable staples with exaggerated shapes and innovative proportions like silky button-ups, faux leather tiered skirts, and the quintessential suit all depict the image of the modern-day phenomenal woman Maya Angelou described. Smith's choice to collaborate with HFR and Nordstrom was a no-brainer, given she showcased her designs at the agency's annual Fashion Show and Style Awards in 2023. \"Retail placement has been at the forefront of initiatives for my brand, and I knew this opportunity would open so many doors,\" she says. \"Working with Harlem's Fashion Row is always seamless, and since connecting and working together, I've started to feel like they are family now.\" I built my brand around my love of strong suits and blazers and I feel like the piece really captures not only who I am but the woman I am dressing. When the time came to design the collection, Renee found inspiration from an unlikely source: a quote that motivated her to keep going when she found herself at a crossroads and uncertain about the brand's future. \"I was at a point with my brand where I wasn't sure what direction I wanted to take but I knew I still had more I needed to say to the world,\" she says. \"I came across this quote by Erin Hanson, 'What if I fall, but oh my darling what if you fly?' and that became my inspiration. Once I heard that, it made me think of birds flying so the feathers became the direction for the jewelry and print. I wanted the collection to feel very aspirational and forward. It really helped me envision where the Megan Renee brand should be headed.\" As for her favorite piece in the collection, Renee immediately names the structured blazer and wide-leg pantsuit. \"I built my brand around my love of strong suits and blazers and I feel like the piece really captures not only who I am but the woman I am dressing,\" she says. \"It's bold, strong, but still feminine. I played with the fit and proportions that really speak to a woman's body and it feels very fresh and chic.\" Image Source: Nordstrom Megan Renee's full collection is now available to shop, along with pieces from House of Aama and Harbison. With an impressive size range of XXS to 2XL - sizes 00 to 18 for women and S to 2XL for men - and prices as low as $45, there's truly something for everyone. You can shop directly on the Nordstrom website as well as in 20 stores across the country, including New York's flagship location.

    "title": "7 Paris Fashion Week Trends That’ll Get You Excited For Spring 2025",

    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. After four weeks of runways, presentations, and parties, Spring 2025 Fashion Month wrapped up with Paris Fashion Week. Some of the style trends we previously saw at New York, Milan, and London Fashion Weeks have reasserted their authority and solidified their bid for domination in the new year with a strong presence on the catwalks of Paris, too: bubble skirts, sharp tailoring, and butter yellow. But the fashion capital of the world also made a case for additional styles that we should expect to land in stores six months from now. With brands ranging from heritage house names like Dior, Chloé, and Louis Vuitton to retail favorites like Isabel Marant, Ganni, and Zimmermann and cool-for-school labels like Vaquera, Undercover, and Ann Demeulemeester, the fashion trends covered just as much ground as well. The arrival of Alessandro Michele at Valentino signified an eccentrically maximalist aesthetic for the brand that, in the last few years, has become known to dedicate its runways to a single color (see: 2022’s hot pink). Meanwhile, even after relocating its runway shows to Paris, New York’s Peter Do maintains its minimalism in the form of deconstructed suiting. Ahead, the fashion trends that marked Paris Fashion Week spring 2025 season. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Grandma Chic There was a lot of anticipation surrounding Michele’s debut runway for Valentino. And the former Gucci designer delivered with an over-the-top collection featuring eclectic pieces that felt borrowed from your grandmother’s closet. This more-is-more sentiment was also echoed in collections of Saint Laurent, which juxtaposed sharply tailored suits against looks that saw brocade jackets paired with lace-and-ruffle skirts; Dries Van Noten, who mismatched jacquard jackets with snake-print pants and beaded skirts; and Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood, who styled toile-print pants with a graphic sweatshirt. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Off To The Races Months after the 2024 Olympics, it seems like sports is still on Paris’ mind. Vaquera featured a racing-inspired tee on its runway on the opening day of Paris Fashion Week. The next day, Dior — which outfitted Lady Gaga and Celine Dion for the Olympics opening ceremony — sent out an evening take on track pants and basketball shorts, as well check-adorned moto jackets and pants, all while artist and archer Sagg Napoli shot arrows at a target at the end of the runway. Ganni entered the game by including sports jersey-like dresses and Loewe showed a jumpsuit with a “Moto Race” graphic. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Polo Shirts Preppy fashion had a moment on the spring 2025 runways. And no style was more ubiquitous than the polo shirt, offered in variations ranging from classic short-sleeves at Casablanca and three-quarter-sleeve versions at Gabriela Hearst to rugby-inspired styles at Vaquera. The more unexpected takes on the prep staple came from Lacoste which showed polo shirts featuring daring side cut-outs and Miu Miu which styled its polos à la 2000s with double-popped collars. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: High-Fashion Windbreakers Paris Fashion Week’s most exciting collaboration came courtesy of Cecilie Bahnsen, a Scandi-beloved brand known for its frothy dresses and girly silhouettes, who lent her romantic hand to North Face, a sensible outdoor favorite. And no doubt that the most covetable item will be the windbreakers that fuse Bahnsen’s signature sheer fabrics and florals with gorpcore details like adjustable strings and hoods. Other high-fashion windbreakers came from Zimmermann, whose version featured a high-low hemline, and Rabanne, whose cropped style came in a striped pattern with silver foil detailing. We’ve never looked more forward to a rainy spring day. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Pirate Pants While hot pants will still be having their moment in 2025, boudoir-style pants started trending this season as the more elegant alternative to the no-pants look. Somewhere in between pirate slacks and bloomers, these flowy pants are longer than Bermuda shorts and cinched at the calf. While Chloe pushed for lingerie-like lace styles paired with equally delicate, barely-there tanks, Louis Vuitton paired its cuff-detail versions with lace and embellished tunics. Meanwhile Undercover offered opaque pants that secured around the foot with multi-strap detailing. Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Skirt-over-pants Lacoste, Spring Summer 2025, pret a porter The 2010s are back and you don’t need further proof than the return of the skirt-over-pants trend. If you need to be re-convinced to embrace the look, take cues from the tasteful versions from H\u0026M’s latest collaborator Rokh, which featured asymmetrical ruffle skirts over slacks and sweatpants, the sheer monochrome look at Hermès, and the sporty pairing — in a trendy green hue — at Lacoste.  Paris Fashion Week Spring 2025 Trend: Seeing Double Yes, you’re seeing double. While pants with peeking boxers and whale tail-like cutouts have been trending for the last few years, Spring 2025 will take it a step up… with tops that feature double the number of sleeves and armholes (Paloma Wool), shirts with extra collars (Issey Miyake), and sweater dresses worn as skirts over, yes, sweaters (Acne Studios). On the shelves, this translates into deconstructed sleeves and layered tops that add interest to otherwise classic staples. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Volkan Yilmaz, better known by TikTok pseudonym Tanner Leatherstein, launched his channel in August of 2022, assessing the quality of popular leather handbags by conducting on-camera purse autopsies. Amidst the requests for the Gucci Dionysus and the Prada Cleo was a French brand heretofore unknown to him: Polène. He purchased its Numéro Un style to review, and, post-mortem, he was dumbstruck. “It changed my life,” he says.  Yilmaz has created a de facto rubric for his handbag assessments perched upon five major pillars: leather, hardware, design, architecture, and craftsmanship. “The Numéro Un checked all those boxes,” he says. “If this was a $2,000 bag, I wouldn’t be surprised, but it was only $430… Luxury brands created this impression that you need to spend thousands of dollars to get a good leather bag, but Polène proved you don’t.” So impressed by the “masterful” design, the embossed leather, the structural integrity — which he equates to that of renowned luxury brands like Loewe or Louis Vuitton — Yilmaz moved his family to Ubrique, Spain, to manufacture his own leather goods out of the same factories as Polène.  This rare quality-to-value ratio has struck incendiary fervor in the brand’s consumers. Search #Polene on TikTok to reveal 21k posts (with a 143% increase, comparing the first eight months of 2024 to that of 2023). Add “paris” to that hashtag to yield an additional 14.5k posts. TikTok after TikTok exhibits young women in minimalist ensembles unboxing their Cyme totes and documenting trips to one of the few in-person stores to secure the Numéro Un. (Those are two of the brand’s best-selling styles, alongside Numéros Neuf and Dix.) Positive reviews from influential creators like Yilmaz have only helped increase awareness for the French accessories label on the platform. They’re not the only ones paying attention: Earlier this year, L Catterton — the investment fund run by Catterton in partnership with LVMH and Groupe Arnault — acquired a stake in the brand. Siblings Elsa, Mathieu, and Antoine Mothay — the grandchildren of the founder of French ready-to-wear brand Saint James — launched Polène out of Paris in 2016 with ambitions to “capture the essence of a true leather goods house,” Antoine explains, “which we identified as creativity.” (Antoine is now the CEO and the sole family member still involved in the brand, and is directly responsible for operations, finance, creative direction, and production.) The passed-down sartorial know-how is evident: Polène began with the Numéro Un, and now has thirteen handbag styles (or “collections,” as it bills them), priced between $460 to $690 — luxury sans the status premium — as well as three different jewelry lines. Reaping the benefits of her first full-time job and corresponding salary, California resident Rida, 23, of Rida Media, was looking to scale up her wardrobe post-graduation, and landed on the best-selling Numéro Dix. She documented her thoughts on TikTok, as she embraced brands like Polène to achieve some semblance of a more sophisticated way of dressing. The subtly sculptural design of bags like the Numéro Dix, available in an array of muted colors, have helped Rida and many, many others achieve this, especially in the wake of  “quiet luxury.” Mothay isn’t mad about the brand’s seat on that train: “The quiet luxury movement speaks to us deeply and resonates with our aspiration for more meaningful fashion.” Ironically, one of Polène’s biggest, most consequential credits came from the maximalist herself: Emily Cooper of Netflix’s Emily in Paris. Cooper wore the Numéro Huit Mini in season two, then, later, in season three, the Yké. A more like-minded ambassador can be found in the Princess of Wales Kate Middleton, who, in 2022, carried the Numéro Sept Mini in blue twice in one week.  Nowhere is Polène’s fandom more evident than at one of its few brick-and-mortar locations — or the lines outside them. The brand began with a store in its hometown of Paris, then expanded to New York, Tokyo, Seoul, a secondary location in Paris on the iconic Champs-Élysées. (A London location is set to open later this year.) Each store is designed through the same lens as their handbags, thanks to French architect Valériane Lazard, who has engineered the physical manifestation of the brand’s minimalist tendencies. (Rida waited until a trip to New York to purchase her first Polène bag, where she was met with what she describes as excellent customer service.)  Mothay credits the appeal of the bags to the approach behind the design. “Instead of starting with sketches, we begin our process by manipulating microfiber, a material similar to leather,” he says. “This experimental and hands-on approach allows us to directly explore the shapes, curves, and folds that characterize our designs.” The Numéro Neuf, with its folded pillow-y silhouette, is a prime example of this. Polène places emphasis on modularity, as well: The Cyme tote, for example, boasts strategically placed snaps that can alter the silhouette of the bag, while the Numéro Dix comes with an adjustable shoulder strap not only to shift from shoulder to crossbody wear, but also to adhere to a range of torso lengths. (Rida is 5’1”, and often struggles to find a shoulder bag that hits the right place on her body. This style was her salve.)  The process of production and design, all of which is managed entirely in-house, takes between 16 and 20 months. The leather is sourced from Spanish and Italian certified tanneries. Polène produces everything in Ubrique, which is known for its artisanal capabilities, employing more than 700 craftsmen. New resident Yilmaz jokes they’ve “conquered” the town: “You see Polène cars and Polène people everywhere.” But with increased visibility comes greater scrutiny, as documented by trend-forecasting agency Fashion Snoops: The brand has faced criticism from some consumers due to significant price hikes (ranging from 10-25%) and concerns about a decline in quality. Price increases are, unfortunately, standard at this time — even market leaders like Chanel and Hermès do them — thanks to higher manufacturing and material costs post-pandemic and pent-up consumer demand. Mothay cites production costs as the reason for their shift. Fashion Snoops does, however, predict these price surges will taper off in the near future.  “I think it’s a good strategy to run the brand on minimum margins first, to build a name first, and then slowly increase your prices a bit to give you a bit of room to hire and grow further,” argues Yilmaz. He would put Polène in a bucket with contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel and A.P.C. in terms of its goals, but says it’s one of the best ones doing it. Yilmaz would put Polène in a bucket with contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel and A.P.C. in terms of its goals, but says it’s one of the best ones doing it. “Our focus continues to be on providing exceptional value,” reiterates Mothay, “standing firm in our belief that quality craftsmanship does not have to come at an exorbitant price.”  For his part, Mothay reiterates: “Our focus continues to be on providing exceptional value, standing firm in our belief that quality craftsmanship does not have to come at an exorbitant price.”  Like what you see?

    "description": "It’s finally time to embrace breezy-weather outings, spooky-season decorations, apple cider donuts, and, of course, fall fashion. As we move on from our summer favorites during this transitional weather period, Refinery29 editors have started taking our autumn must-haves out for a spin. From September onward, we reach for versatile staples like fall jackets (think: trench coats with a twist), spacious handbags (from oversized totes to slouchy shoulder bags), and boots (including tried-and-true knee-highs) from reader-favorite brands like Free People, Damson Madder, and Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch that can serve as outfit building blocks. For our athleisure needs, there’s an active onesie; for eveningwear, there’s a Brat green kaftan gown. We’re also staying up to date on trending items, such as burgundy jackets and not one, but two red bags, which add a pop of color to our tried-and-true neutrals.Read on to learn more about our favorite seasonal picks and get inspired for your own fall wardrobe. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.American Vintage BYMI Jumper“Sweater weather is upon us, and what better way to kick it off than with this cozy striped number from American Vintage. I don’t usually gravitate towards pink, but I absolutely love it in this color combo, and can definitely see myself wearing it throughout the seasons. Not only is this sweater warm, but it’s also the perfect length for me, which often feels like a rarity as someone with quite a short torso…” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop EvereveAmerican Vintage Bymi Pullover, $, available at EverevePhoto Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch Mid Trench Coat“I’m sure other short girlies will agree that it’s incredibly difficult to find a trench coat that fits our frame without making us look like a kid playing dress-up. I’ve given up on brands that don’t offer petite sizing for outerwear, as some full-length ones will literally drag on the floor for me. I was elated to find this midi trench coat, which hits just above the knee and comes with all the classic trench coat features, such as a back flap (which shields you from the elements) and sleeve buckles (which you can tighten to prevent water from getting in). The nylon fabric is water and wind-resistant, and can be machine washed, which makes this a winner in terms of easy upkeep.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop Abercrombie \u0026 FitchAbercrombie and Fitch Mid Trench Coat, $, available at Abercrombie and FitchPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.Square-Toe Water-Repellent Heeled Boots“These square-toe booties are one of my favorite shoes for the fall and winter, especially since the knitted fabric is cozy and water-repellent. The sock-like boots are so chic — I have them in Bordeaux Red and in the black-and-red colorway pictured here. If you want to experiment with red clothing and accessories (a big trend this fall), these are super wearable.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop VivaiaVivaia Square-Toe Water-Repellent Heeled Boots, $, available at VivaiaPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Haveli Yumi Satin Kaftan“Kaftan-style dresses were all over Copenhagen Fashion Week’s spring runways, and I’m so here for them. This frock from Jamaican-British label Haveli somehow manages to be glam and ultra-comfy at the same time. I love the bright, almost metallic green, and how the silk flows elegantly whether I’m walking or standing still. I wore this to London Fashion Week’s closing party, and it would be perfect for a fall wedding, too.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop HaveliHaveli Yumi Satin Kaftan, $, available at HaveliPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Little Liffner Pillow Shoulder Bag“Although suede is trending, it’s a material that never goes out of style. I’ve been on the hunt for a suede bag to add some texture to my fall wardrobe, and this black shoulder bag from Little Liffner has fit the bill. It’s super comfy to carry, can be dressed up or down, and is just the right medium size to fit all of my necessities.” — Kate Spencer, Sr. Affiliate Partnerships ManagerShop Little LiffnerLittle Liffner Pillow Shoulder Bag, $, available at Little LiffnerPhoto Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Lake Pajamas Relax Pants Set“I’m a big proponent of ‘inside clothes’ and love nothing more than adding a new set to my loungewear drawer come fall. This matching sweatsuit from Lake Pajamas is one of the softest I've ever touched, thanks to its modal blend. In addition to being impossibly cozy and silky, I love that it’s lightweight, which will come in use once the heaters start dialing up.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Lake PajamasLAKE Pajamas Relax Pants Set, $, available at LAKE PajamasPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Mother Petite Spitfire Nerdy Cuff High-Rise Relaxed-Leg Jeans “I’ve gotten the opportunity to test tons of jeans from different brands, most recently a range of  Mother wide-leg and flared jeans. While I enjoyed every style, this cuffed pair was a surprising favorite. Although they’re baggy and oversized, the petite fit isn’t overbearing on my 5’3” frame. I really like how relaxed these jeans and their faded wash are, and am excited to continue wearing them out for casual fall activities.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop AnthropologieMOTHER Spitfire Nerdy Cuff High-Rise Relaxed-Leg Jeans, $, available at AnthropologiePhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Damson Madder Dakota Blouse Check“I have Damson Madder’s dress in this style, with the elasticated waist and bows down the middle, and it’s one of my favorite pieces. I always get compliments on it, but, because I’m more of a jeans-and-top person, so every time I’ve worn it I’ve thought: ‘I wish they did this style as a top.’ Then, the brand launched its Fall/Winter 2024 collection, and, bam — there it was. The colors are perfection, the velvet bows add a little something special, and, best of all, it looks incredible with my wide-leg jeans. Add a necklace, and I’m good to go for the office, dinner, drinks, or just about any social occasion in my calendar right now.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Dakota Blouse - Blue Check, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Harley-Davidson Korsen Tall Waterproof Riding Boot“Finding a vintage gem has to be one of life's purest experiences, and it truly felt that way coming across these secondhand Harley-Davidson biker boots just in time for fall. I’m usually pretty bad at checking resale sites, but when I saw someone wearing similar boots in public and they told me they got them on Depop, I was scouring the site like my life depended on it. These boots are already worn in (a major plus for those of us who regularly get blisters), and make me look like I could easily jump on a motorcycle at a moment's notice (despite not having a driver's license). I can’t wait to wear them for years to come.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop Harley-Davidsonharley-davidson Korsen Tall Waterproof Riding Boot, $, available at Harley DavidsonPhoto Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.We The Free Emerson Tote Bag“It’s big boho bag fall, folks, and, unsurprisingly, Free People is nailing it. I was inspired by the Olsen twins and Jane Birkin in picking this one out — I wanted something cool and slouchy. The pop of red elevates all my autumnal outfits, and it carries everything I could need for work, running errands, or last-minute book shop visits.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Free PeopleFree People Emerson Tote Bag, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Jack Erwin Paz Satin Mules“Normally, I hate the idea of my foot being out in the elements, but for this mule, I'll do anything. Thanks to their sleek shape and satin fabric, they add just a little bit of oomph to any look. They're perfect for a more casual outfit as well as for more dressed-up occasions when I don’t want to wear heels.” — Becca Sax, Affiliate Coordinator  Shop Jack ErwinJack Erwin Paz Satin Mule, $, available at Jack ErwinPhoto Courtesy of Becca Sax.Uniqlo Cashmere Short Cardigan“I’ve regularly avoided styling cardigans over the years for fear of the outfit looking more Mrs. Doubtfire than Olsen twin. But this cashmere one from Uniqlo has changed all of that. The material is so soft, it feels like I’m being hugged when I wear it. The lightness of the cashmere means that I’m not overheating the minute I jump on the train to the office. I’m learning that cardigans are that perfect ‘it isn’t actually cold, but there’s definitely a chill in the air’ item of clothing. I’m ready for my new era of embracing this wonderful feat of fashion engineering.” — Alicia Lansom, Associate EditorShop UniqloUniqlo Cashmere Short Cardigan, $, available at UniqloPhoto Courtesy of Alicia Lansom.Away Large Featherlight Backpack“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of a commuter backpack that’s both nondescript and featherlight. I carry my MacBook Air with me everywhere, so I really need a bag that won’t weigh me down any further. (Sadly, no more leather satchels for me!) When Away released its Featherlight Collection, I knew it would be right up my street. The bags are meant to be clever travel accessories that can assist your travels while occupying as little of the weight limit as possible. I’ve been using the Large Backpack, and it comes with a slew of smart organization features that have made my life so much easier. I love the double side pockets for my water bottle and umbrella, a separate compartment for my work laptop, and a bunch of zip pockets and dividers for my essentials, from my keys to my passport. It weighs just 1.2 lbs, and the nylon fabric is water-resistant and easy to clean. No notes from this busy commuter who loves to lug all her stuff around town.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop AwayAway Featherlight Backpack, $, available at AwayPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.Sol Kyst Leo Blue Light Glasses“I’ve used blue light glasses on and off for years, but hadn’t found a pair that I absolutely loved. I have a feeling that these Sol Kyst glasses are going to be a long-time staple, though: Made specifically for wide faces (which are typical of, but not limited to, Black and Asian features), I love how this frame compliments my high cheekbones and wider nose bridge, and doesn't slide off my face like other glasses do.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop Sol KystSol Kyst Leo Blue Light Glasses, $, available at Sol KystPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Karen Millen Leather Trench Belted Mac Midi Coat“I’ve been after a leather burgundy trench coat for years now. I wanted to buy a vintage piece, but have struggled to find anything in this belted silhouette in my size. (I’m in between a UK 14 and 16.) Vintage resellers seem to prioritize smaller sizes, and I’m often left with big, boxy menswear-style coats. So, this year, just after I admitted defeat, this beautiful piece ended up in my Google search recommendations. Sure, it’s not vintage, but it’s just so beautifully cut, and the color is so rich (not too purple, not too red, not too brown) — I just know that I’ll be wearing and loving it for years to come.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop Karen MillenPhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Left On Friday Shoreline Playsuit“Fall weather inspires us to put together pieces that channel Princess Diana’s famous athleisure looks. Lady Di was the queen of pairing bike shorts with oversized crewnecks, and this compressive, fast-wicking playsuit may just be the perfect modern base layer to recreate her off-duty outfits. I can see myself wearing this one-shoulder style on its own to the gym, or with a cozy sweatshirt for hot girl walks and running errands.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Left On FridayLeft on Friday Shoreline Playsuit, $, available at Left on FridayPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Free People Roma Suede Tote Bag “This is my new favorite bag, and it’s my first-ever suede one — a timeless fabric I’m excited to now have in my collection. It fits a lot inside (including a laptop), but doesn’t look bulky; the red color sings against any neutral coat; the straps are long enough to wear it slung over my body. It really is a joy to use.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Free PeopleFree People Roma Suede Tote Bag, $, available at Free PeoplePhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Saint Art Talia Charmeuse Midi Skirt“Despite the black colorway, this midi skirt has become my must-pack on every trip this summer, thanks for the way it barely wrinkles in the suitcase and can be styled with everything from a T-shirt and sneakers for a day sightseeing to a silky cami and heels for a night out or dinner. That said, I already know I’ll be relying on it all fall as well, pairing it with black blazers, oversized sweaters, and knee-high boots for that monochrome look that I tend to come back to when the weather starts to cool down.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Saint ArtSaint Art Talia Charmeuse Midi Skirt, $, available at Saint ArtPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.Vagabond Jolin Shoes“These silver-toned flats from Vagabond are a fun addition to my fall wardrobe. I’ve been loving them with a simple top and barrel-leg pants — there’s something about a wider-cut trouser with a more narrow, dainty shoe that just works. I’m also a big fan of the darker, almost gunmetal silver color that makes them a bit more muted and timeless to style. I plan on wearing them on repeat while it’s still warm enough for a bit of foot to be exposed.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop VagabondVagabond Jolin Shoes, $, available at VagabondPhoto Courtesy of Kristine Romano.Quince 100% European Linen Smocked Mini Dress“I’ve long been a big fan of Quince’s affordable, high-quality linen clothing, and this breezy mini is one of the most frequently sold-out pieces in its collection. (The terracotta colorway I have is out of stock, but the navy option is still available.) This linen dress has been the perfect chic and carefree number to slip on whenever I have trouble coming up with an outfit. The fabric is soft and breathable, and looks good even with a few wrinkles — plus, I love how form-fitting the smocked bodice is. Bonus: This style is perfect for petite girlies since it’s quite short. (For reference, I’m 5 feet tall.)” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop QuinceQuince 100% European Linen Smocked Mini Dress, $, available at QuincePhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.This Story Sterling Silver Ribbon Letter Charm“I’m such a fan of This Story — I’ve slowly been building up a collection of its beautiful bow pieces. The latest addition is this delicate initial pendant which I’ve strung up with a butterfly charm from my childhood. These designs aren’t just whimsical and magical, they’re totally individual, each made with the intricate lost-wax casting method.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate WriterShop This StoryThis Story Sterling Silver Ribbon Letters A-Z, $, available at This StoryPhoto Courtesy of Esther Newman.Skies Are Blue Faux Leather Boyfriend Blazer“I recently tried Stitch Fix for the first time, and this blazer was in my first ‘fix'. It has become an instant go-to in my fall wardrobe, especially for the office and industry events. While the silhouette is classic and versatile, the burgundy faux leather is a bit more unique and edgy. I really like pairing it with dark denim and a range of tops, from suede vests and lightweight sweaters to glittery high-neck styles.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Stitch FixSkies Are Blue Faux Leather Boyfriend Blazer, $, available at Stitch FixPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.DL1961 Short-Sleeve Instasculpt Tee“While I love the look of tight-fitting baby tees, I hate that most of the options on the market are too cropped, no matter how high-waisted the pants or skirts are that I wear them with. This style from one of my favorite denim brands, DL1961, is not only the perfect length (aka stomach-covering while not being too long) but has the ideal opaqueness thanks to the wool-blend fabric that also makes it a perfect fall staple. I love this T-shirt so much, I get sad when I have to throw it in the hamper to be washed.” — Irina Grechko, Fashion DirectorShop Neiman MarcusDL1961 Short-Sleeve Instasculpt Tee, $, available at Neiman MarcusPhoto Courtesy of Irina Grechko.***Add in once Kelly submits photoLoie Black Winter Boots“I always struggle with finding knee-high boots because I’m petite (5’2”) with size 5 feet. That was until I came across Loie’s black winter leather boots. I instantly fell in love: They’re slightly pricier than my usual budget, but I’d argue they’re worth the investment because they’re so versatile, durable, and wearable — and I find the delicate red lining hard to resist. Compared to my beloved Docs (which ruin my heels on a regular basis), they’re unbelievably comfy. A true autumn staple, you can wear them to the office, date night, and even to the rave — plus, they keep you warm. I like to pair them with a playful light blue skort or a long flowy dress for a sophisticated twist. Loie, thank you! You’ve made the transition from summer to fall dressing a lot more enjoyable.” — Kelly Washington, Senior Social EditorShop Loie*using Alicia's Uniqlo cardigan instead Karen Millen Leather Trench Belted Mac Midi Coat, $, available at KAREN MILLENPhoto Courtesy of Kate Spencer.Asos Design Button Front Crew Neck Cardigan with Frill“Cardigans are sexy again and they’re the perfect summer-to-fall layer. This red cardigan is equal parts coquette and grandma-core, thanks to the slinky fit and frilly knit. Aside from this pairing with my Cos mini skirt, I have also styled it with baggy jeans and yoga pants, and on top of tank tops and bodysuits. I love its versatility and that I can easily pack it into a tote bag or purse for cooler nights. Oh, and cardigans were a major trend on Copenhagen Fashion Week runways, too.” — Ebony-Renee Baker, Fashion EditorShop AsosASOS DESIGN Button Front Crew Neck Cardigan, $, available at ASOSPhoto Courtesy of Ebony-Renee Baker.Damson Madder Peplum Blouse“I never thought I’d be saying this but I’m in my peplum era! I’ve been especially loving the silhouette of this striped one from Damson Madder as the peplum is on the more subtle side. Paired with bike shorts and tall boots — this is a simple and easy outfit combination I’ll be wearing all season long.” — Kristine Romano, Associate Editor, Photo \u0026 DesignShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Philly Peplum Blouse, $, available at Damson MadderDamson Madder Jennifer Check Puffer “Part of Damson Madder’s fall collection, this puffer immediately caught my eye. I love a check pattern, but even more so, I love a multi-purpose item. The sleeves on this style zip off, so I have a two-in-one: a vest for fall and a a warm coat for winter. It’s funny, clothing items that “convert” were something I deemed deeply uncool in my early youth. Now, I think they’re great. A sign of nearing 30, perhaps, but doing so in style.” — Tanyel Mustafa, Senior WriterShop Damson MadderDamson Madder Jennifer Check Puffer, $, available at Damson MadderPhoto Courtesy of Tanyel Mustafa.Moon River Shirred Cotton Midi Dress“I got this milkmaid dress at TJ Maxx for a steal, and I couldn’t be happier about it. In the summer, I’ve worn the olive-green frock with sandals and statement jewelry, and in the early fall, I plan on wearing it with a denim jacket and trendy sneakers or ballet flats.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop Bloomingdale’sMoon River Shirred Cotton Midi Dress, $, available at Bloomingdale'sPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Peppermayo Stealth Mode Vest \u0026 Mini Skirt“Yes, I know everyone has been wearing vests and waistcoats this year, but I can’t help but be drawn to this beige mini-skirt set. It looks very cute together, but the matching possibilities are endless: the beige button-up vest is polished on its own or when layered over a T-shirt, and will look great with tailored trousers or jeans. On the other hand, I can’t wait to pair the pleated mini skirt with my favorite fall sweaters. The best part? The skirt comes with a versatile brown belt, which I’ve already been wearing with all my pants and culottes. We love a multitasking outfit for fall.” — Venus Wong, Senior WriterShop PeppermayoPeppermayo Stealth Mode Vest, $, available at PeppermayoPeppermayo Stealth Mode Mini Skirt, $, available at PeppermayoPhoto Courtesy of Venus Wong.Gap x Madhappy Mad Full-Zip Cropped Hoodie“I was so excited when I got a sneak peek of the Gap x Madhappy collaboration because of the pieces’ nostalgic feel. And I was even more excited when I received this cropped sweat jacket (and matching sweatpants). The denim-blue color is perfectly faded; the oversized-yet-cropped shape is effortlessly relaxed; and the unexpected details like a double zipper, stitched hood, and “MAD” logo make my Y2k-loving heart happy. This sweatshirt is so cozy that I’ve already worn it out on breezy summer nights, but I’m looking forward to wearing it for casual fall festivities like apple picking or Halloween movie-watching.” — Victoria Montalti, Associate Fashion WriterShop GapGap x Madhappy Mad Full-Zip Cropped Hoodie, $, available at GapPhoto Courtesy of Victoria Montalti.Like what you see?

Last month, while most designers were debuting spring/summer 2025 collections, Cos took to the runway at New York Fashion Week with a collection that made the argument that fall/winter is the best fashion season. As part of its show, the London-based brand unveiled its latest Atelier capsule, the biannual offering that emphasizes craftsmanship, premium fabrics, and day-to-evening design. Cos Fall/Winter Atelier 2024 — which is available to shop on October 16 — does just that: Inspired by ballet and the fluidity of movement, the collection features timeless, sculptural pieces in an autumnal color palette (think shades of black, gray, and brown with green accents) that will fit into any cool-weather wardrobe. Whether you’re in search of the perfect fall blazer, chunky sweaters, tailored officewear, or stylish dresses that will take you through upcoming holiday events, there’s something for you in this collection. Ahead, discover our favorite pieces, as seen on the NYFW runway.  Cos Fall/Winter Atelier Dresses Many of the dresses in the Cos Fall/Winter Atelier 2024 capsule are ideal for those days you have to head to the office for work, then step out for evening plans — with no time to change in between. Standouts include a slinky silk shift dress with a scarf attached and an open-back maxi gown with a full skirt and drapey floor-length sashes. Cos Fall/Winter Atelier Tops The tops in this new collection are just as flowy as the dresses. Find crisp button-front shirts, cozy cashmere sweaters, a party-ready feathered bandeau, and so much more. Cos Fall/Winter Atelier Bottoms The attention to tailoring details is especially evident in the Atelier collection’s bottoms, from the draped silk skirts, barrel-leg trousers, and asymmetric wool skirts —  and even the sheer layered columned skirt. Cos Fall/Winter Atelier Outerwear Covetable outerwear is an essential component to any fall/winter collection, and this one — which includes a peak-lapel blazer, an oversized double-faced wool coat, and a leather jacket — is no different. Cos Fall/Winter Atelier Accessories Ballet flats (find them in a ruched style here) and crossbody bags are sticking around for fall/winter, according to Cos Atelier. Other accessories we’ve got our eyes on? Long leather gloves and long mesh socks that will take any outfit to the next level.  Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Party dressing season is here early thanks to the new collaboration between Rebecca Vallance and Nicky Hilton-Rothschild. The 31-piece capsule between the Australian brand that has become synonymous with occasion dresses and the American multihyphenate launched on Oct 1 to get shoppers into the holiday spirit early. “It’s the best time of the year. Everyone is happy and dressing up and going out,” Hilton-Rothschild tells Refinery29, referring to the drop as the “ultimate party dress collection.” The two designers met after Hilton-Rothschild, who was a fan and a “genuine client” she tells us of the brand prior to the partnership, “slid into the DMs” of Vallance to locate one of the brand’s dresses while pregnant: “We just became friends from there.”  When the two started discussing collaborating, a holiday capsule quickly became the “obvious choice,” according to Vallance. “We both love holiday time. We both have the same aesthetic,” she says. “We love dressing up.” Featuring mini dresses and gowns in silk and satin and colors like black and deep red, the collection boasts party-forward details like sequins, bows, and embellishments that shoppers have come to expect from the brand that is additionally known for its bridalwear. But Vallance is quick to point out how the design process was a true fifty-fifty effort. “Nicky was involved as much as I was. We would talk about silhouettes, fabric choices,” she says. “She is a trained designer so it’s not a situation where she just slapped her name on it. This is a genuine collaborative collection.” Vallance says that it’s that fashion experience — Hilton-Rothschild studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and Parsons The New School for Design, and previously had her own fashion lines — that appealed to her for the brand’s first collaboration of its kind. (While Rebecca Vallance has partnered with Australian Airline Qantas on business class pajamas and amenities kit, it’s the first time the label partnered with another fashion name.) “If you’re a trained designer, you know what’s going to work and what’s not,” she says. “It was never a crossword; it was easy and fun.” This came through in the designs, according to Vallance: “We showed the collection to our favorite department stores and online retailers through our illustrations, and they loved it so much, they bought it without seeing the samples. I think that speaks to the strength of the collection as well.”  When working on the dress styles, which range from a tuxedo-inspired mini to a sequin gown slip, Hilton-Rothschild wanted the clothes to be “sexy, sparkly, embellished”; feature Rebecca Vallance’s signature bow motifs; and highlight her go-to color: ice blue. “It’s my favorite color, I love it,” she says. “Rebecca was a little unsure about it [for the holidays]. She was like, ‘I was thinking more jewel tones, I don’t know about ice blue.’” After Hilton “stood firm” on the choice, the gown was created and, to Vallance’s surprise, became her favorite piece from the line when it went into production. “It actually turned into one of the best-sellers of the collection so it’s good to take chances when you’re designing a collection,” she says. “It often happens when you design a collection: the pieces you’re not sure about become your favorite by the time they get to stores.” The photos for the collection — which, in addition to being inspired by “all our favorite RV looks that Nicky has worn,” Old Hollywood, and ‘90s supermodels, according to Vallance — were also shot at a London location close to Hilton’s heart. “Claridge’s is one of my favorite hotels in the world. I’ve been going since I was a baby, and I stayed there during my wedding. It’s just so timeless, classic, elegant, and the perfect backdrop for the campaign,” Hilton-Rothschild says. With the collection arriving just before the kick-off of party season, Hilton-Rothschild hopes to see a lot of her friends and family wearing it throughout the holidays. “My family does their annual Christmas party, and I am so excited to dress everyone,” she says. “My mom and sister are big Rebecca Vallance fans, too” Naturally, Vallance is invited.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that Brat Green has made a real impact. Whether or not you find the divisive lime-meets-chartreuse hue — inextricable to Charli XCX’s Brat album — pleasing is an entirely different conversation. But it has proven itself to have staying power, now slithering its way into spooky season (and beyond) thanks to music, film, and Fashion Month. First, there’s Mother Brat, Charli XCX, touring through the end of October and dropping a Brat remix album on October 11. Then, blockbuster movies like Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (September 6) and Wicked (November 22) are bringing neon and emerald greens to the big screen, not just through the set designs and costumes, but also through thematic product drops releasing in tandem with the films. (Cynthia Erivo, who’s playing Elphaba in the former has even taken her character’s slime-green skin off the screen, implementing vibrant greens into her early press tour outfits.) Meanwhile, at the ongoing Spring 2025 Fashion Month, we’ve clocked several nods to the statement shade. From Bach Mai’s gowns in New York and Feben’s mini dresses in London to GCDS’ sheer separates in Milan and Ganni’s sweaters in Paris, Brat Green has inspired designer brands enough to ensure it sticks around in the new year. These designs have also proven that the color is more wearable than you may think. Much like on these runways, Brat green can be combined with darker, more neutral shades of green; worn as layering pieces (ie: sheer button-down tops and colored tights) under fall staples; or accessorized via oversized handbags and frilly scarves.The previous Fall 2024 fashion shows also cemented “lemon lime” green as a major trend that can transition from season to season. From designers like Victoria Beckham presenting green layered maxi dresses at Paris Fashion Week to runway attendees wearing green shearling-lined coats for their NYFW street-style looks, the color has been making its rounds and proving its versatility.  While you can still throw on a kitschy graphic T-shirt or black knee-high boots like Charli XCX did throughout Brat summer, we implore you to add Brat Green pieces (from sweaters to sneakers) into your fall outfits, too. This season, tread the waters with green accessories like handbags, scarves, and kitten heels for a pop of color when styled with neutral pieces. Or jump all in and try a green sweater dress, coat, or jeans for a grander statement. No matter how bold (or brat) you go, you’ll be sure to turn heads and make others green with envy.
