    "description": "We learned in December 2022 that a production company had signed on to turn Sloclap's excellent martial arts game Sifu into a film. Today, the news dropped that Netflix is involved with the project, which seems to have caused some personnel shuffling behind the scenes. The initial announcement saw Story Kitchen, which has since amassed a huge catalog of video game adaptations, securing a treatment of Sifu with John Wick creator Derek Kolstad attached as the writer. Story Kitchen is still working on the film, but Kolstad is no longer serving as the screenwriter and T.S. Nowlin has instead been tapped for that role. Nowlin's past credits include the screenplays for the Maze Runner adaptations and most recently he was a writer for Netflix's splashy Ryan Reynolds vehicle The Adam Project. However, there is still a John Wick connection with Sifu. The director for all four John Wick films, stunt performer Chad Stahelski, has joined the producer team, as have members of Stahelski's 87Eleven Entertainment company.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-hops-aboard-sifu-movie-adaptation-assigns-a-screenwriter-225324526.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Samwise Gamgee said, \"It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish.\" But then, he hadn't been exposed to the world of video game development. Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, a cozy take on the most idyllic pocket of Middle Earth, has been delayed. The new launch date is July 29. According to a post from the devs at WƒìtƒÅ Workshop Game Studio, this delay is about ensuring that all the project's supported platforms \"can enjoy the same cozy experience.\" It is currently slated to launch on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Steam and Xbox Series X. üì¢ Tales of the Shire needs a bit more simmering... Now coming July 29th, 2025. Thank you for your support and patience.üçΩÔ∏èü•ß#TalesOfTheShire #LOTR #cozygaming pic.twitter.com/8afaLnGfFL‚Äî Tales of the Shire (@talesoftheshire) February 20, 2025 This project has taken a couple tough hits over the past several months. The release date had already been pushed back in September, and it was axed from Netflix's planned game lineup earlier this month. Will there be more hurdles before we can finally enjoy our happy hobbit alternate lives? As a wise wizard once said: \"Who knows?
