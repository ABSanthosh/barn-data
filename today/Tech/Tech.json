    "description": "X has reached a settlement with President Donald Trump in a lawsuit over the president’s 2021 suspension from Twitter. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Elon Musk-owned company has agreed to pay “about $10 million” to settle the long-running case. Trump sued Twitter, along with Meta and YouTube, more than three years ago after the companies booted him off their platforms following the riots on January 6, 2021. His lawyers claimed that the suspensions were a violation of his First Amendment rights. The lawsuit against Twitter was dismissed by a judge in 2022, but Trump’s lawyers appealed that decision. X’s settlement comes shortly after Meta also reached an agreement with Trump. The company paid $25 million, much of which will go toward building Trump’s presidential library, the company confirmed. The Wall Street Journal reports that the president's lawyers “are also expected to pursue a settlement with Google.” X didn’t respond to a request for comment. The settlement with X is particularly notable given Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump. The owner of X reinstated Trump’s Twitter account soon after taking over the company in 2022 and spent at least $250 million on Trump’s campaign in 2024. The president's lawyers reportedly “considered letting the lawsuit fizzle out” ahead of the settlement. Since Trump took office less than a month ago, Musk has used his perch at the top of the “department of government efficiency” to wreak havoc across the federal government, in a series of moves that have prompted multiple lawsuits and growing concerns about a constitutional crisis.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-will-pay-about-10-million-to-settle-lawsuit-over-donald-trumps-twitter-suspension-234757817.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Other than a Days Gone remaster, Sony's first State of Play stream of the year was fairly light on first-party games. At least that was the case until the very end of the showcase. The company announced the long-awaited next game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The third-person action title is called Saros, and it stars the always-delightful Rahul Kohli. The actor plays Arjun Devraj, \"a powerful Soltari Enforcer searching for answers on a lost off-world colony,\" per the trailer's YouTube description.  The clip shows Arjun waking up on a beach with a gun by his side. \"Every time the sun dies, madness reigns,\" he says as an ominous eclipse occurs. Moments later, a giant being with eight arms and a broken, pointy headpiece emerges from the depths. The creature summons balls of fire in its hands as Arjun readies himself to battle it. Housemarque/PlayStation Studios Housemarque says Saros is a new game, but it's one that builds on the roguelite foundations of Returnal and its repeatable runs — just in case Arjun saying \"After every death, I always come back stronger\" in the trailer wasn't clear enough. In this game, your resources and progression persist after each run. You'll have an \"evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades\" to help upgrade your loadout, though as in Returnal, the world will change after every death.  One other major difference between Saros and Housemarque's last game is that Arjun isn't alone on this planet. Details about other characters in the ensemble cast, the story and gameplay will be revealed later. Sony liked Returnal enough to buy Housemarque and add the developer to its stable of PlayStation Studios, so it'll likely have high hopes for this one. Saros is slated to arrive on PS5 in 2026.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-to-ps5-in-2026-232243078.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Longtime Slashdot reader theodp writes: Monday brought chilling news reports of the all-count trial convictions of three individuals for a conspiracy to rob and drug people outside of LGBTQ+ nightclubs in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, which led to the deaths of two of their victims. The defendants were found guilty on all 24 counts, which included murder, robbery, burglary, and conspiracy. \"As proven at trial,\" explained the Manhattan District Attorney's Office in a press release, \"the defendants lurked outside of nightclubs to exploit intoxicated individuals. They would give them drugs, laced with fentanyl, to incapacitate their victims so they could take the victims' phones and drain their online financial accounts [including unauthorized charges and transfers using Cash App, Apple Cash, Apple Pay].\" District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. added, \"My Office will continue to take every measure possible to protect New Yorkers from this type of criminal conduct. That includes ensuring accountability for those who commit this harm, while also working with financial companies to enhance security measures on their phone apps.\" In 2024, D.A. Bragg called on financial companies to better protect consumers from fraud, including: adding a second and separate password for accessing the app on a smartphone as a default security option; imposing lower default limits on the monetary amount of total daily transfers; requiring wait times of up to a day and secondary verification for large monetary transactions; better monitoring of accounts for unusual transfer activities; and asking for confirmation when suspicious transactions occur. \"No longer is the smartphone itself the most lucrative target for scammers and robbers -- it's the financial apps contained within,\" said Bragg as he released letters (PDF) sent to the companies that own Venmo, Zelle, and Cash App. \"Thousands or even tens of thousands can be drained from financial accounts in a matter of seconds with just a few taps. Without additional protections, customers' financial and physical safety is being put at risk. I hope these companies accept our request to discuss commonsense solutions to deter scammers and protect New Yorkers' hard-earned money.\" \"Our cellphones aren't safe,\" warned the EFF's Cooper Quintin in a 2018 New York Times op-ed. \"So why aren't we fixing them?\" Any thoughts on what can and should be done with software, hardware, and procedures to stop \"bank jackings\"?

    "description": "Apple has released an official Apple TV app for Android phones and tablets that's now available in the Google Play Store. You can download it here. 9to5Google reports: The newest Apple app on Android has a bottom bar with Apple TV+, MLS (Major League Soccer), Downloads for offline viewing, and Search. [...] The video player takes after Apple TV on other platforms, with a portrait mode available. There are convenient shortcuts to activate picture-in-picture, which works inside the app (while browsing) and system-wide, and mute to bring up the system volume bar. Playback is smooth and more stable than other streaming services. At launch, the Apple TV app lacks Casting support and there do not appear to be new episode notifications. If you're already signed into Apple Music, you have to log in again to Apple TV. Another notable aspect is support for Google Play Billing instead of requiring out-of-app sign-up on another device. This applies to both the Google TV app (and Apple Music) today. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Stalling growth in the Dutch tech sector has sparked urgent calls for fresh funding streams. New data released today reveals the number of new startups in the Netherlands is declining. The country is also suffering from a severe lack of local investors.  The findings emerged in the State of Dutch Tech report by Techleap, a non-profit that supports startups and scaleups in the Netherlands.  The report raises concerns about the nation’s funding landscape. In 2024, only 104 startups raised over €100,000 — a 23% decline over the previous year. The number of deals, meanwhile, dropped by 20%.
