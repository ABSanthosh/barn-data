    "description": "The super slim Galaxy S25 Edge, which Samsung teased at the tail end of its January Unpacked event, has been officially revealed. During tonight's Unpacked, we got full specs, pricing and shipping dates for Samsung's latest phone, as well as a chance to put our hands on the new handset.  Pricing is set at $1,100 for 256GB of storage or $1,220 for the 512GB model and the phones ship May 30. Pre-orders are open at Amazon, Best Buy and directly from Samsung, which is offering a $50 pre-order store credit and a no-charge upgrade to the 512GB model.  The Edge's headline features include its thin build and AI-supported photography chops — both of which we'd suspected from various leaks, only to have the rumors confirmed by Samsung's own press release last week. And indeed, when Engadget's Mat Smith got his hands on an Edge, he immediately felt how much lighter the device was — yet, he noted, it still felt premium.  We now know for sure that the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch screen but measures just 5.8mm (0.22 inches) thick. That's slightly less surface area than the 6.9-inch Ultra, but a full 2.4mm thinner. It weighs 163 grams, nearly the same as the standard Galaxy S25, but the Edge measures more than 10mm taller and 5mm wider than its base-model sibling.   To shave off the grams and trim the width, Samsung developed a broader yet slimmer vapor chamber and a new Thermal Interface Material (TIM) for better heat dissipation. It uses Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 on the front display. It's the first phone to use the material, which Corning says offers \"enhanced drop performance on rough surfaces,\" allowing for a thinner glass layer. The frame is made from titanium, like the Ultra model, a material many phone manufactures have put in higher-end models for its lightweight strength.  As for camera power, the Edge has the same 200MP sensor as the S25 Ultra, which Samsung claims captures 40 percent brighter images in low light situations compared with the standard S25. There's also a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 12MP selfie cam up front. Those two rear cameras do protrude noticeably from the thin frame of the phone, but Mat was impressed how well-balanced the phone felt — it's not lopsided at all.  Of course, the phone also packs plenty of AI-powered tricks, including Pro Scaler, Audio Eraser and Drawing Assist. To support all the AI, Samsung is using the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip as the other S25 phones and comes with 12GB of memory and either 256 or 512GB of storage. It packs a 3,900mAh battery, which is smaller than both the 4,000mAh one found in the standard S25 and the 5,000mAH power supply in the Ultra. Though Samsung claims the Edge can run for 24 hours on a charge.  You can get the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in three color options: Titanium Silver, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Icy Blue. Samsung is promising seven years of security and software updates. We only spent a short time with the phone so far and our full review will be out shortly.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-pre-order-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-000029138.html?src=rss",

    "description": "After teasing us for months, Samsung has formally revealed the Galaxy S25 Edge. At just 5.8 millimeters (0.22 inches) thick, it’s the slimmest member of the S25 family — and its slimmest smartphone ever. It’s available to preorder now and launches on 30 May, starting at $1,100. Samsung said that S25 Edge “unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry\" — and it’s easy (too easy!) to cynically see this as a way of hawking another Samsung phone into a thinner — and yet similar — slice of hardware, with familiar cameras, technical specs and AI software. This isn’t an Ultra, nor is it a new foldable. However, it could be a new direction for Samsung’s flagship S series. What’s the difference between the S25 and S25 Edge? Image by Mat Smith for Engadget Surprise! The Edge is thinner. While the S25 Edge measures in at less than the base S25, which is 6.4mm (0.25 inches) thin, it weighs almost the same. In fact, there’s only a gram’s difference between the two, despite the S25 Edge packing a much bigger 6.7-inch screen than the S25’s 6.2-inch one. And boy, can you tell the difference. The most contemporary comparison I can make is when Apple switched to a titanium frame for the iPhone 15 Pro. Spec sheets and numbers be damned: I could sense how much lighter the device was. Despite having a much bigger screen than my iPhone 16 Pro, the thinner S25 Edge felt light yet premium. I easily slipped it in and out of my pants pockets, because, well, how else am I going to assess the biggest selling point for Samsung’s latest phone? Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The thing is: Device thickness isn’t an issue I have with flagship smartphones — it’s the screen size. The base Galaxy S25 (or the Pixel 9 Pro) hit the sweet spot for my hands. While this new S25 Edge may be easier to hold than similar-sized phones, a 6.7-inch screen isn’t for everyone. Like most phones (the Pixel 9a is a curious outlier), the S25 Edge still has a substantial camera unit derailing otherwise clean hardware lines. The dual-camera setup protrudes a good 4.5mm (0.17 inches), although it features the same 200-megapixel sensor packed into the pricier S25 Ultra. Samsung says it re-engineered the camera unit to ensure it could fit on the Edge, but it still sticks out — a lot. Before I got to handle the phone, I thought this would lead to the new phone being oddly unbalanced and top-heavy. But whatever Samsung has done to arrange the component furniture inside the S25 Edge, it worked. The phone doesn’t feel lopsided or fragile at all, but like any other premium flagship smartphone. The Galaxy S25 Edge’s cameras Image by Mat Smith for Engadget Alongside the primary 200MP sensor, Samsung included a 12MP ultrawide camera with autofocus and macro photography support. And… that’s it. There’s no dedicated telephoto system, which typically takes up more space however you position the camera. The two lenses are stacked in a vertical arrangement, which I think looks cleaner than the camera cornucopias found on other devices — but many folks are going to miss the versatility of a true telephoto. Sure, you can digitally zoom by cropping in on that huge 200MP sensor, but it’s not the same. The S25 Edge can also capture up to 8K video and packs all the other photography tricks you’d expect in an S-Series phone, like night photography and lossless zoom. Of cours,e it also handles post-capture AI tools like generative editing (removing photobombers and unwanted objects from your photos) and Audio Eraser for cleaning up video in loud environments. And when it comes to AI — or Galaxy AI — you’re getting the same array of features that we saw in the base S25 and S25 Ultra, powered by a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and 12GB of RAM. Those AI tools include the Now Brief and Now Bar which takes contextual clues from your apps and smartphone to lay out a plan for your day, remind you of the weather and more. Samsung’s integration of Google’s Gemini now includes Gemini Live, so you can tap into your camera feed to ask questions about your photos and things in your surroundings. It’ll likely pick up any future Gemini and Android upgrades, too: The Galaxy S25 Edge will receive seven generations of OS updates and seven years of security updates. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget At a media briefing, Samsung also outlined how it’s trying to ensure the S25 Edge runs cool despite all the packed-in hardware, using a new Thermal Interface Material (TIM) for better heat dissipation within that limited space. I didn’t really get the time to push the device to its limits during the briefing, so we’ll wait for a review to assess whether it works well enough. The company did have to make compromises to fit all the S25 Edge’s features into this svelte profile. It has a 3,900mAh battery, which is small for a phone with a 6.7-inch display that costs more than $1,000. In comparison, the base S25 has a 4,000mAh cell — that's a bigger battery on a cheaper phone with a smaller screen. Then, there's the S25+, which has a 4,900mAh battery with the same screen size as the S25 Edge. In its defence, Samsung has made considerable progress on the battery life of its devices (particularly with this year’s crop of Galaxy S phones). The company claims the S25 Edge can run video for up to 24 hours. However, with a bigger screen inside a thinner device, battery life may be the biggest compromise—and it’s something we will have to test when we review the Edge properly. The Galaxy S25 Edge is priced at $1,100 (£1,100) with 256GB of storage. It will launch on May 30 in three colors: Silver, Jet Black and Icy Blue. It’s hard to draw any concrete conclusions on whether the S25 Edge’s compromises for a smaller device footprint are worth it, but expect our review in the next few weeks.

As the rappers traded disses, a New York-based comedian named Willonius Hatcher — aka King Willonious — brought his own track to the beef. Inspired by a dubious claim that Drake had a Brazilian butt lift, “BBL Drizzy” blended AI, comedy, pop culture, and music. The song swiftly went viral.

The study found that leading models -- including OpenAI's GPT-4o, Mistral Large, and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet -- sacrifice factual accuracy when instructed to keep responses short. \"When forced to keep it short, models consistently choose brevity over accuracy,\" Giskard researchers noted, explaining that models lack sufficient \"space\" to acknowledge false premises and offer proper rebuttals. Even seemingly innocuous prompts like \"be concise\" can undermine a model's ability to debunk misinformation. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "In the rapidly advancing landscape of AI technology and innovation, LimeWire emerges as a unique platform in the realm of generative AI tools. This platform not only stands out from the multitude of existing AI tools but also brings a fresh approach to content generation. LimeWire not only empowers users to create AI content but also provides creators with creative ways to share and monetize their creations.As we explore LimeWire, our aim is to uncover its features, benefits for creators, and the exciting possibilities it offers for AI content generation. This platform presents an opportunity for users to harness the power of AI in image creation, all while enjoying the advantages of a free and accessible service.Let's unravel the distinctive features that set LimeWire apart in the dynamic landscape of AI-powered tools, understanding how creators can leverage its capabilities to craft unique and engaging AI-generated images.IntroductionLimeWire, a name once associated with the notorious file-sharing tool from the 2000s, has undergone a significant transformation. The LimeWire we discuss today is not the file-sharing application of the past but has re-emerged as an entirely new entity—a cutting-edge AI content publishing platform.This revamped LimeWire invites users to register and unleash their creativity by crafting original AI content, which can then be shared and showcased on the LimeWire Studio. Notably, even acclaimed artists and musicians, such as Deadmau5, Soulja Boy, and Sean Kingston, have embraced this platform to publish their content in the form of NFT music, videos, and images.Beyond providing a space for content creation and sharing, LimeWire introduces monetization models to empower users to earn revenue from their creations. This includes avenues such as earning ad revenue and participating in the burgeoning market of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). As we delve further, we'll explore these monetization strategies in more detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of LimeWire's innovative approach to content creation and distribution.LimeWire Studio welcomes content creators into its fold, providing a space to craft personalized AI-focused content for sharing with fans and followers. Within this creative hub, every piece of content generated becomes not just a creation but a unique asset—ownable and tradable. Fans have the opportunity to subscribe to creators' pages, immersing themselves in the creative journey and gaining ownership of digital collectibles that hold tradeable value within the LimeWire community. Notably, creators earn a 2.5% royalty each time their content is traded, adding a rewarding element to the creative process.The platform's flexibility is evident in its content publication options. Creators can choose to share their work freely with the public or opt for a premium subscription model, granting exclusive access to specialized content for subscribers.LimeWire AI StudioAs of the present moment, LimeWire focuses on AI Image Generation, offering a spectrum of creative possibilities to its user base. The platform, however, has ambitious plans on the horizon, aiming to broaden its offerings by introducing AI music and video generation tools in the near future. This strategic expansion promises creators even more avenues for expression and engagement with their audience, positioning LimeWire Studio as a dynamic and evolving platform within the realm of AI-powered content creation.AI Image Generation ToolsThe LimeWire AI image generation tool presents a versatile platform for both the creation and editing of images. Supporting advanced models such as Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, and DALL-E 2, LimeWire offers a sophisticated toolkit for users to delve into the realm of generative AI art.Much like other tools in the generative AI landscape, LimeWire provides a range of options catering to various levels of complexity in image creation. Users can initiate the creative process with prompts as simple as a few words or opt for more intricate instructions, tailoring the output to their artistic vision. What sets LimeWire apart is its seamless integration of different AI models and design styles.
