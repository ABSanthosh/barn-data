    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is finally a thing you can buy in the US — or at least, a thing you can try to buy. The $450 console officially went up for sale at midnight ET on June 5, with numerous retailers offering the device both online and in-store. Predictably, online stock dried up fairly quickly and remains highly limited as of Thursday evening. Broadly speaking, it appears people have had a bit more luck by heading to a physical retail store. There’s still no guarantee that you’ll be able to snag one that way, but a couple of Engadget staffers managed to grab a Switch 2 on Thursday at their local Target and GameStop, even with no pre-order in place.  If you can’t find the device out in the wild, your next best chance to get the Switch 2 online looks to be via Target. The retailer says it’ll resume selling the console online in the “early morning” on Friday, June 6, though it hasn’t confirmed an exact time beyond that. To make things a little easier for those still on the hunt, we’re rounding up all of the information we can find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch and tracking any restocks that pop up. Where to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Walmart opened up online purchases at midnight on June 5, but both the console alone and Nintendo's Mario Kart World bundle remain out of stock as of our latest update. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations. The company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location, but it's worth checking if any store near you still has devices available. Target began selling the Switch 2 in stores on June 5. The retailer has warned that supply will be limited, but some stores still appear to have the console in stock as of Thursday evening, so it's worth looking into the locations closest to you. Anecdotally, Engadget's Billy Steele was able to pick up the device at a Target just outside of Greensboro, North Carolina as late as 4:15pm ET on Thursday. The company says it'll restock its online inventory in the \"early morning\" on Friday, June 6, while supplies last. That may be the next best opportunity to secure the Switch 2 without going to a store. GameStop held launch events on Wednesday and is advertising in-store availability, though again this will vary by location. Engadget's Cherlynn Low was able to buy the console without a pre-order at a GameStop store in the New York City area on Thursday morning. That particular location had a little under 80 units available, but its manager told Low that inventory will differ at other stores based on population. As we write this, the device is unavailable on GameStop's website. A $625 bundle that includes Mario Kart World, a microSD Express card and a few other accessories has been in and out of stock more frequently than the standard SKUs, though it's sold out now (and kind of scummy anyway). We briefly saw it pop back up around 2:30pm ET, so it may be one to bookmark if you can stomach the extra cost. The listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle, meanwhile, now point to a \"Find a Store\" page. Best Buy held in-store launch events at midnight and said it'd have limited stock at its retail locations starting June 5. It is not selling the console online during launch week, however. You may also have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online membership has gone in and out of stock, while Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub available as well. You'll need a membership to check on either of those, though. We've also seen online stock at BJ's, but those listings are unavailable as of our most recent update. Verizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on Thursday morning, but that's dried up, and only those with Verizon service were able to order. As of now, Amazon is the only major retailer that doesn't have some form of Switch 2 listing on its website. The company didn't take any pre-orders for the Switch 2 either, so it's unclear if and when it will sell the device. Newegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it hasn't started sales yet.  With all of these stores, we've generally seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But considering Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing. Nintendo, meanwhile, is still only selling the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to put your name on the list if you meet that criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit anytime soon — several people who registered in April still haven't received an invite, and shipments haven't gone out yet for many of those who did order (including yours truly). You can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second. Where to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle: Walmart GameStop GameStop ($625 bundle with various accessories) Best Buy Target Costco (membership required) Sam's Club (membership required) BJ's (membership required) Verizon (service required) Where to buy Switch 2: Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target BJ's (membership required) Verizon (service required) Where to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories Nintendo is also selling a bunch of new accessories for the Switch 2, most of which became available on June 5 alongside the console. The same thing goes for games such as Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 title, Donkey Kong Bananza, won't be available until mid-July, though you can still pre-order it today. As of Thursday evening, just about all Switch 2 games remain widely available. Stock for the accessories is a little patchier, but most devices are generally in stock at certain retailers. Note that you'll need to have received an invite to purchase most accessories at Nintendo's online store.

    "description": "Virtual and augmented reality are still pretty new frontiers with a lot of potentially cool ideas yet to be developed. The latest product in the mixed reality space could be coming from a startup called Dopple Works. Lowpass reported that the secrecy-shrouded business from Etsy co-founder and former CEO Robert Kalin is working on a new device called Loop. Dopple Works has submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission. Many of the details are not publicly available, but that filing indicates that Loop is battery-powered and will use both WiFi and Bluetooth networks. Lowpass also unearthed a patent application that dubs Loop a \"dedicated hand-held spatial computing device.\" The application comes with images that show a camera, speaker and tracking sensor that could capture details on an environment, along with a screen for viewing the mixed reality content. At this stage, there's not enough information available to speculate on what Loop's purpose will be. But the photos from the government filings do spark some entertaining mental images of a future where people wandering about doing their best Sherlock Holmes imitations with mixed reality magnifying glasses. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/etsy-co-founders-new-startup-is-making-what-really-looks-like-a-mixed-reality-magnifying-glass-224247515.html?src=rss",

    "description": "UK tech job openings have surged 21% to pre-pandemic levels, driven largely by a 200% spike in demand for AI skills. London accounted for 80% of the AI-related postings. The Register reports: Accenture collected data from LinkedIn in the first and second week of February 2025, and supplemented the results with a survey of more than 4,000 respondents conducted by research firm YouGov between July and August 2024. The research found a 53 percent annual increase in those describing themselves as having tech skills, amounting to 1.69 million people reporting skills in disciplines including cyber, data, and robotics. [...] The research found that London-based companies said they would allocate a fifth of their tech budgets to AI this year, compared to 13 percent who said the same and were based in North East England, Scotland, and Wales. Growth in revenue per employee increased during the period when LLMs emerged, from 7 percent annually between 2018 and 2022 to 27 percent between 2018 and 2024. Meanwhile, growth in the same measure fell slightly in industries less affected by AI, such as mining and hospitality, the researchers said. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Intel has implemented a strict new policy requiring all new projects to demonstrate at least a 50% gross margin to move forward. CEO Lip-Bu Tan explained Intel's new risk-averse policy as \"something that we probably should have had before,\" later clarifying that the number is a figure the company is aspiring toward internally. Tom's Hardware reports: Tan is reportedly \"laser focused on the fact that we need to get our gross margins back up above 50%.\" To accomplish this, Tan is also said to be investigating and potentially cancelling or changing unprofitable deals with other companies. Intel's margins have slipped to new lows for the company in recent months. MacroTrends reports Intel's trailing 12 months gross margin for Q1 2025 was as low as 31.67%. Intel's gross margins had hovered around the 60% mark for the ten years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, falling beneath 50% in Q2 2022 and continuing to steadily fall ever since. Holthaus predicts a \"tug-of-war\" to ensue within Intel in the coming months as engineers and executives reckon with being forced between a rock and a hard place. \"We need to be building products that... fit the right competitive landscape and requirements of our customers, but also have the right cost structure in place. It really requires us to do both.\" [...] Tan is also quoted as wanting to turn Intel into an \"engineering-focused company\" again under his leadership. To reach this, Tan has committed to investing in recruiting and retaining top talent; \"I believe Intel has lost some of this talent over the years; I want to create a culture of innovation empowerment.\" Maintaining a culture of empowering innovation and top talent seems, on its face, at odds with layoffs and a lock on projects not projected to gross 50% margins, but Tan seemingly has Intel investors on his side in these pursuits.
