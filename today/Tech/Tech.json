    "description": "The World Video Game Hall of Fame welcomed its 2025 inductees today. The Strong National Museum of Play announced that the newest entries are GoldenEye 007 from Rare, Quake by id Software, Defender from Williams Electronics and Tamagotchi by Bandai. The four games chosen \"have significantly influenced popular culture and the video game industry,\" the museum said in its press release. The other impactful games nominated for inclusion this year are Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4, Frogger, Golden Tee, Harvest Moon, Mattel Football and NBA 2K. The selections may spark some serious nostalgia for those of us who grew up in the 90s. I remember being deeply envious of my classmates who had little Tamagotchi pets to care for, and I have fond memories of smack-talking my friends during late-night GoldenEye matches. Last year's inductees also highlighted favorites from that era like Myst, Resident Evil and SimCity.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-on-roku-130009703.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The Roku smart TV platform is an accessible way to watch your favorite streaming content in a centralized location. You can either get a Roku TV with the platform built in, or add a miniature box or dongle to an older-model TV. One big advantage of the Roku platform is that it's always getting free software updates to keep it current, like the cool new feature that turns your TV into a virtual art museum by displaying famous paintings as a screensaver. There's one feature missing right out of the box, though — the ability to watch shows and events inaccessible in your home country. Using a VPN is a common way to tackle this issue, but unlike Fire TV, Apple TV and other rivals, Roku systems don’t have native VPN support. But that’s not the end of the story. You can still use a VPN to access a wider range of programming with your Roku — you just need to use a workaround. We'll show you the simplest way. The benefits of using a VPN A VPN can change your IP address to make it look like you're getting online from a different region. When you mask your IP with a VPN, Netflix sees the VPN server's location, rather than your own. You’ll then have access to a different set of programming. For example, you need Max to stream Friends, The Big Bang Theory or Rick and Morty in the US, but they're all available on Netflix in the UK. So if you're in, say, Texas, but your VPN server is in London, Netflix will show you the British programming menu instead.  VPNs have several other privacy and security benefits. The connection between your home device and the VPN server is encrypted, so — if everything's working properly — nobody should be able to connect you to anything you do online. That means no worries about getting banned from streaming sites for using a proxy. It also means your Internet service provider can’t see all of your browsing destinations (and sell your viewing habits to data brokers). The easiest way to use a VPN on Roku Although Roku doesn’t natively support VPNs, there are a few workarounds. You can, for instance, set up a VPN on your home’s router. That allows you to protect your whole network and every device that connects to it, keeping everyone in your household anonymous online. But it can be inconvenient if you have to switch your server location often, and with a few exceptions (like ExpressVPN's Aircove), it demands some technical knowledge. Instead, we recommend a far easier method: connecting a VPN to your Roku via AirPlay or screencast. To do this, subscribe to a VPN and install it on your smartphone or laptop. Then, stream content on that device and AirPlay or screencast it to your Roku TV. The icon to do this should look like a TV with Wi-Fi rays. Engadget We prefer this method because it’s simpler overall than managing a VPN through your router. You can access any geo-blocked content on your smartphone or laptop first and then cast it on your smart TV. You can make sure your Roku model is AirPlay-compatible by checking this resource on Roku’s site. If it isn’t, you can always just directly patch your phone or laptop to the TV using an HDMI cable or an appropriate dongle. Choosing the best VPN Using a phone or laptop as the ultimate source for your VPN-routed streams gives you a wider list of services to choose from. Although each VPN has the same basic functionalities, their prices and extra features vary. Before deciding which one is right for your needs and the devices you have, take some time to look at what each one offers and see what other users have to say. Start by checking out our list of best VPNs. If you're looking to stream content that's only available in a specific region, check your chosen VPN's website to make sure it has a server location in that region. VPN options for other streaming platforms Don't have a Roku? Good news: Robust VPN options (or alternatives) exist for the other major streaming platforms, too.

    "description": "President Trump on Thursday attacked a law signed by President Joe Biden aimed at expanding high-speed internet access, calling the effort \"racist\" and \"totally unconstitutional\" and threatening to end it \"immediately.\" The New York TimesL: Mr. Trump's statement was one of the starkest examples yet of his slash-and-burn approach to dismantling the legacy of his immediate predecessor in this term in office. The Digital Equity Act, a little-known effort to improve high-speed internet access in communities with poor access, was tucked into the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that Mr. Biden signed into law early in his presidency. The act was written to help many different groups, including veterans, older people and disabled and rural communities. But Mr. Trump, using the incendiary language that has been a trademark of his political career, denounced the law on Thursday for also seeking to improve internet access for ethnic and racial minorities, raging in a social media post that it amounted to providing \"woke handouts based on race.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has \"made progress\" on a chip for a product that could rival the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The company is also reportedly working on glasses that use augmented reality. The Verge reports: The chip is apparently based on the chips Apple uses for the Apple Watch, though the company has removed parts and is being designed in such a way that it can handle the \"multiple cameras\" that the smart glasses might have, Bloomberg reports. Apple wants mass production of the chip to start by the end of 2026 or sometime in 2027, so the glasses themselves could come out within that timeframe. [...] Apple is developing chips for camera-equipped Apple Watch and Airpods as well, and the goal is for those chips to be ready \"by around 2027,\" Bloomberg says. The company is also developing new M-series chips and dedicated AI server chips, per the report. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
