    "description": "Threads is adding a new feature that lets users get a little more creative in remixing posts from other people. The app now has a ‚Äúmarkup‚Äù tool that allows users to scribble on top of posts they want to reshare, Adam Mosseri shared in a post. Markup abilities appear in the menu for quoting and reposting. But instead of simply quoting a post, it launches an editing tool where you can add highlights, arrows or doodles on top of a screenshot of the post. Mosseri said the feature is intended ‚Äúso you can add your creative take‚Äù on posts, but the tools are fairly limited for now. You can only add yellow highlights or red arrows and doodles, though Mosseri said there would be ‚Äúmore to come soon‚Äù from Meta. A Threads spokesperson confirms that the feature will function similarly to quote posts in that the original user is notified if someone chooses to mark up their post. You can also use the ‚Äúwho can reply and quote‚Äù setting to disable markups on your own posts. The app is also making two other features it‚Äôs already previewed official: post scheduling and analytics. The features will likely be particularly useful for brands, creators and others who manage a professional presence on the site, which has so far lacked many of the more advanced business-focused tools Meta‚Äôs other platforms have. Both could also come in handy should Meta begin to introduce ads to Threads, a move that‚Äôs reportedly in the works for the beginning of 2025.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/threads-now-lets-you-scribble-on-top-of-other-users-posts-231129612.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If you subscribe to Amazon Prime or Prime Video and are looking to expand your streaming horizons, Amazon has a deal for you. Prime subscribers can get a bundled subscription to the ad-free version of Max and Starz for just $21 per month, $7 off the bundle's normal $28 per month price. Max has a solid back catalog of classic Hollywood films programmed by Turner Classic Movies, original films and TV shows from HBO, and cartoons from Cartoon Network, on top of a chaotic collection of reality TV programming from HGTV, Food Network, and more. If you were thinking of checking out The White Lotus¬† when the show returns in February or the second season of The Last of Us in April, this bundle is a pretty good reason to hop on the Max bandwagon. Starz has a less must-see original programming when compared to Max or Prime Video ‚Äî outside of the ever-popular Outlander ‚Äî but it's a great streaming service if you're looking to watch movies that recently left theaters. You're able to get this bundle deal even if you don't currently have a Prime subscription. You can sign-up for a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime to enjoy the bundle at $21 per month, and just add on an extra $15 a month once your trial is up. Prime Video itself has an interesting library worth combing through, too. Including a recent adaptation of Fallout if shows based on video games are what floats your boat. Because this deal is through Prime Video, you'll have to access Max and Starz as Prime Video Channels rather than through their individual streaming apps, but it's a small annoyance for an otherwise solid deal.
