    "description": "Microsoft says it‚Äôs working with Ubisoft to fix a problem with its latest Windows 11 update that‚Äôs been crashing some games, and it‚Äôs put the update‚Äôs release on pause for devices with those games in the meantime. Following users‚Äô reports of issues after installing the Windows 11 24H2 update, Microsoft confirmed this weekend that certain games may become unresponsive or display a black screen. The problem affects Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Assassin's Creed Origins, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Ubisoft has released a temporary fix for Star Wars Outlaws, but there still may be some issues, Microsoft says. ‚ÄúTo safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed,‚Äù the company said on its support blog. ‚ÄúThese devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel.‚Äù It goes on to say, ‚ÄúWe recommend that you do not attempt to manually update to version 24H2 using the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or the media creation tool until this issue has been resolved.‚Äù This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-24h2-update-is-crashing-some-ubisoft-games-215748241.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It‚Äôll soon be possible to replace the speakers in recent MacBook Pro models without having to replace the entire top case, as has long been the procedure. A memo seen by Macrumors¬†reportedly informed Apple Stores and Authorized Service Providers this week that speakers will be available as standalone components for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 family of chips. A source also told the publication that this will be an option for repairs on earlier MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon as well. The change should make for a less expensive repair. Up until now, the process entailed replacing the whole top case, including the battery and other parts, which works out to be pretty costly. It‚Äôs been that way since 2016. The repair manual with the new steps for speaker replacement is available online now from Apple Support. It may not necessarily be a simpler repair ‚Äî the guide shows a process that‚Äôs rather involved ‚Äî but not having to also replace other parts like the battery just to change out the speakers should cut costs significantly.

    "description": "Microsoft's controversial \"Recall\" feature (in a public preview of Windows 11) already has some known issues, Microsoft admitted Friday. For example: - Recall can be enabled or disabled from \"Turn Windows features on or off\". We are caching the Recall binaries on disk while we test add/remove. In a future update we will completely remove the binaries. - You must have Secure Boot enabled for Recall to save snapshots. - Some users experience a delay before snapshots first appear in the timeline while using their device. If snapshots do not appear after 5 minutes, reboot your device. If saving snapshots is enabled, but you see snapshots are no longer being saved, reboot your device. - Clicking links within Recall to submit feedback may experience a delay in loading the Feedback Hub application. Be patient and it will display. CNBC adds that according to Microsoft Recall \"won't work with some accessibility programs, and if you specify that Recall shouldn't save content from a given website, it might get captured anyway while using the built-in Edge browser...\" But those aren't the only issues CNBC noticed: - While you might expect that your computer will be recording every last thing you look at once you've turned on Recall, it can go several minutes between making snapshots, leaving gaps in the timeline. - Recall allows you to prevent screenshots from being made when you're accessing specific apps. But a few apps installed on my Surface Pro are not shown on that list. - When you enter a search string to find words, results might be incomplete or incorrect. Recall clearly had two screen images that mention \"Yankees,\" but when I typed that into the search box, only one of them came up as a text match. I typed in my last name, which appeared in eight images, but Recall produced just two text matches. - Recall made a screenshot while I was scrolling through posts on social network BlueSky, and one contains a photo of a New York street scene. You can see a stoplight, a smokestack and street signs. I typed each of those into the search box, but Recall came up with no results... - The search function is fast, but flipping through snapshots in Recall is not. It can take a couple of seconds to load screenshots as you swipe between them. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from the New York Times: Between the time [construction worker Florencio] Rendon applied for the coding boot camp and the time he graduated, what Mr. Rendon imagined as a \"golden ticket\" to a better life had expired. About 135,000 start-up and tech industry workers were laid off from their jobs, according to one count. At the same time, new artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, an online chatbot from OpenAI, which could be used as coding assistants, were quickly becoming mainstream, and the outlook for coding jobs was shifting. Mr. Rendon says he didn't land a single interview. Coding boot camp graduates across the country are facing a similarly tough job market. In Philadelphia, Mal Durham, a lawyer who wanted to change careers, was about halfway through a part-time coding boot camp late last year when its organizers with the nonprofit Launchcode delivered disappointing news. \"They said: 'Here is what the hiring metrics look like. Things are down. The number of opportunities is down,'\" she said. \"It was really disconcerting.\" In Boston, Dan Pickett, the founder of a boot camp called Launch Academy, decided in May to pause his courses indefinitely because his job placement rates, once as high as 90 percent, had dwindled to below 60 percent. \"I loved what we were doing,\" he said. \"We served the market. We changed a lot of lives. The team didn't want that to turn sour.\" Compared with five years ago, the number of active job postings for software developers has dropped 56 percent, according to data compiled by CompTIA. For inexperienced developers, the plunge is an even worse 67 percent. \"I would say this is the worst environment for entry-level jobs in tech, period, that I've seen in 25 years,\" said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. A Stack Overflow survey of 65,000 developers found that 60% had used AI coding tools this year, the article points out. And it includes two predictions about the future: Armando Solar-Lezama, leader of MIT's Computer-Assisted Programming Group, \"believes that A.I. tools are good news for programming careers. If coding becomes easier, he argues, we'll just make more, better software. We'll use it to solve problems that wouldn't have been worth the hassle previously, and standards will skyrocket.\" Zach Sims, a co-founder of Codecademy, said of the job prospects for coding boot camp graduates\" \"I think it's pretty grim.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
