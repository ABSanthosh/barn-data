    "description": "According to a report from The Washington Post, DOGE is using an AI tool to analyze federal regulations and determine which to get rid of. A DOGE PowerPoint presentation obtained by the publication notes that its \"AI Solution\" — reportedly called the DOGE AI Deregulation Decision Tool — found that 100,000 out of over 200,000 regulations \"can be deleted.\" The document sets a September 1 goal deadline for agencies to complete their own deregulation lists using the tool, which it says can be done in under four weeks, and then \"DOGE will roll-up a delete list of 50% of all Federal Regulations (100k Regulatory Rules).\" The tool is targeting regulations that are no longer required by law, The Washington Post reports. After it makes its suggestions, staffers would review the proposed deletions before finalizing a plan. According to the PowerPoint, the tool has already been tried out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), where it's been used to write \"100% of deregulations,\" and by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for decisions on 1,083 regulatory sections. The Washington Post spoke to three HUD employees who confirmed it was recently used. One also said that the tool got things wrong on several occasions, misreading the language of the law at times. DOGE will reportedly start training other agencies on the tool this month. Head over to The Washington Post to read the full report.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/doge-is-reportedly-pushing-an-ai-tool-that-would-put-half-of-all-federal-regulations-on-a-delete-list-212053871.html?src=rss",

    "description": "For less than the price of a fully decked-out MacBook Pro, you can buy Unitree's latest humanoid robot called the R1. You only have to shell out $5,900 for a robot that weighs around 55 lbs, stands about four feet tall, and is built with a Large Multimodal Model to handle complex tasks.  If you're wondering what the R1 will be used for, your guess is as good as ours. Unitree said its robot is \"fully customizable\" and demoed its capabilities in a video showing off cartwheels, handstands, boxing, roundhouse kicks and running downhill, but didn't offer examples with any practical use yet. The lightweight robot has an ultra-wide view and a four-microphone array to help it recognize voices and images, but was also built with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. It's not hard to envision a world where people program the R1 as a robot butler to handle daily chores, much like what Meta is reportedly working on. However, you might even be able to square up two R1s to fight each other, as evidenced by Unitree promoting a unique fighting tournament that felt like a less aesthetically polished version of 2011's Real Steel. The latest R1 is a much lower entry point than Unitree's previous humanoid robot, the G1, which starts at $16,000 and was demoed at CES 2025 with somewhat disastrous results. Even though the R1's sub-$6,000 price tag is arguably high, it's still much cheaper compared to other similar options, like Tesla's Optimus bot that's expected to go for at least $20,000.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/this-humanoid-robot-can-do-cartwheels-handstands-and-roundhouse-kicks-at-less-than-6000-184500276.html?src=rss",

Actress/businesswoman Paltrow \"was married to Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin for 13 years,\" reports CBS News. In the video posted Friday, Paltrow says she was hired by Astronomer as a \"very temporary\" spokesperson. \"Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days,\" Paltrow begins, \"and they wanted me to answer the most common ones...\" As the question \"OMG! What the actual f\" begins appearing on the screen, Paltrow responds \"Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow, unifying the experience of running data, ML, and AI pipelines at scale. We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.\" (Paltrow also mentions the company's upcoming Beyond Analytics dataops conference in September.) Astronomer is still grappling with unintended fame after the \"Kiss Cam\" incident. (\"Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,\" Coldplay's lead singer had said during the viral video, in which the startled couple hurries to hide off-camera). The incident raised privacy concerns, as it turns out both people in the video were in fact married to someone else, though the singer did earlier warn the crowd \"we're going to use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen,\" according to CNN. The New York Post notes the woman's now-deleted LinkedIn account showed that she has also served as an \"advisory board member\" at her husband's company since September of 2020. The Post cites a source close to the situation who says the woman's husband \"was in Asia for a few weeks,\" returning to America right as the video went viral. Kristin and Andrew Cabot married sometime after her previous divorce was finalized in 2022. The source said there had been little indication of any trouble in paradise before the Coldplay concert video went viral. \"The family is now saying they have been having marriage troubles for several months and were discussing separating...\" The video had racked up 127 million videos by yesterday, notes Newsweek, adding that the U.K. tabloid the Daily Mail apparently took photos outside the woman's house, reporting that she does not appear to be wearing a wedding ring.

    "description": "\"Google has signed its first partnership with a long-duration energy storage company,\" reports Data Center Dynamics. \"The tech giant signed a long-term partnership with Energy Dome to support multiple commercial deployments worldwide to help scale the company's CO2 battery technology.\" Google explains in a blog post that the company's technology \"can store excess clean energy and then dispatch it back to the grid for 8-24 hours, bridging the gap between when renewable energy is generated and when it is needed.\" Reuters explains the technology: Energy Dome's CO2-based system stores energy by compressing and liquefying carbon dioxide, which is later expanded to generate electricity. The technology avoids the use of scarce raw materials such as lithium and copper, making it potentially attractive to European policymakers seeking to reduce reliance on critical minerals and bolster energy security. \"Unlike other gases, CO2 can be compressed at ambient temperatures, eliminating the need for expensive cryogenic features,\" notes CleanTechnica, calling this \"a unique new threat to fossil fuel power plants.\" Google's move \"means that more wind and solar energy than ever before can be put to use in local grids,\" Pumped storage hydropower still accounts for more than 90% of utility scale storage in the US, long duration or otherwise... Energy Dome claims to beat lithium-ion batteries by a wide margin, currently aiming for a duration of 8-24 hours. The company aims to hit the 10-hour mark with its first project in the U.S., the \"Columbia Energy Storage Project\" under the wing of the gas and electricity supplier Alliant Energy to be located in Pacific, Wisconsin... [B]ut apparently Google has already seen more than enough. An Energy Dome demonstration project has been shooting electricity into the grid in Italy for more than three years, and the company recently launched a new 20-megawatt commercial plant in Sardinia. Google points out this is one of several Google clean energy initiatives: In June Google signed the largest direct corporate offtake agreement for fusion energy with Commonwealth Fusion Systems. In October Google agreed to purchase \"advanced nuclear\" power from multiple small modular reactors being developed by Kairos Power. Google also partnered with a clean-energy startup to develop a geothermal power project that contributes carbon-free energy to the electric grid. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

The technology, called Dynamic Targeting, was tested by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) earlier this month. It was installed aboard a briefcase-sized satellite built and operated by UK-based startup Open Cosmos, and carried a machine learning processor developed by Dublin-based firm Ubotica.   In the test, the satellite tilted forward to scan 500km ahead of its orbit and snapped a preview image.

Jua claims its model — dubbed EPT-2 — is faster and more accurate than both Microsoft’s Aurora and Google DeepMind’s Graphcast. In separate, peer-reviewed studies, both of those models were shown to be more accurate than the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)’s ENS forecast, widely regarded as the world leader.
