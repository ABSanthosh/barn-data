    "description": "Elon Musk has reportedly fired Omead Afshar, Tesla's head of manufacturing and operations in North America and Europe, according to Forbes. Both CNBC and Bloomberg corroborated the report. Afshar's exit follows Milan Kovac, the head of engineering on Tesla's Optimus robot, who left the company in early June. Afshar was promoted to the role last year, Bloomberg reports, after working for multiple different Musk-owned companies since 2017. The timing of his exit isn't particularly surprising given the trouble Tesla has faced selling cars. Sales in Europe have shrunk for a fifth consecutive month and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reports that registrations of new Teslas dropped by nearly 41 percent in May. The company is also struggling in China, where sales fell 15 percent in the same month. While Musk appears to be holding Afshar responsible, the blame clearly lies at Musk's feet. Helping to fund President Donald Trump's re-election in the US, running the destructive DOGE cost-cutting efforts after his election and just generally maintaining a noxious public presence have permanently tainted Musk and his companies. While SpaceX still benefits from government contracts, Tesla's sales are vulnerable to public opinion, something the Tesla Takedown movement has been leveraging to its advantage with protests outside of the company's dealerships.  Firing Afshar, leaving his position in the US government and launching Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin are all different attempts from Musk to change the narrative around Tesla. It's not clear yet whether they'll actually help.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/elon-musk-reportedly-fired-a-key-tesla-executive-following-another-month-of-flagging-sales-205118891.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple has introduced new fee structures for developers using the App Store in the EU in order to meet the requirements of the bloc's Digital Markets Act. Last month, the European Commission ruled that Apple was not in compliance the legislation and ordered the company to make changes within 30 days. Apple can still file an appeal of the decision until July 7. The new terms make things a little complicated. When apps promote offers for digital goods or services in the EU, they'll be subject to an \"initial acquisition fee\" and a \"store services fee\" as well as a Core Technology Fee for apps with more than 1 million annual installs. Developers who agree to the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (EU) Addendum will be charged a Core Technology Commission (CTC) of 5 percent rather than the CTF. The CTC applies to \"all sales of digital goods or services that occur within a 12-month period from the date of an install, including app updates and reinstalls\" rather than the CTF approach based on installation numbers. The exact rules and exemptions are now listed on a dedicated support page. There are also two separate tiers of fee structures. Tier 1 is for apps using mandatory store services and Tier 2 covers apps using optional store services. The initial acquisition fee is 2 percent for both tiers, although participants in the Apple Small Business Program and recurring subscriptions after the first year will not be subject to that charge. The Tier 1 store services fee is 5 percent, while Tier 2 is 13 percent normally or 10 percent for program participants. That's the approach for the remainder of this year, although Apple said it plans to adopt a single business model of the Core Technology Commission for all developers in the EU beginning January 1, 2026. Apple is also offering new terms about how developers can promote and communicate offers to users in the EU. The destination for a promo can now be \"a website, alternative app marketplace, or another app, and can be accessed outside the app or within the app via a web view or native experience.\" The company is also toning down language in the \"scare sheets\" it displays when a user follows a link to outside the App Store. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-details-new-fee-structures-for-app-store-payments-in-the-eu-204253948.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Apple's Swift programming language is expanding official support to Android through a new \"Android Working Group\" which will improve compatibility, integration, and tooling. \"As it stands today, Android apps are generally coded in Kotlin, but Apple is looking to provide its Swift coding language as an alternative,\" notes 9to5Google. \"Apple first launched its coding language back in 2014 with its own platforms in mind, but currently also supports Windows and Linux officially.\" From the report: A few of the key pillars the Working Group will look to accomplish include: - Improve and maintain Android support for the official Swift distribution, eliminating the need for out-of-tree or downstream patches - Recommend enhancements to core Swift packages such as Foundation and Dispatch to work better with Android idioms - Work with the Platform Steering Group to officially define platform support levels generally, and then work towards achieving official support of a particular level for Android - Determine the range of supported Android API levels and architectures for Swift integration - Develop continuous integration for the Swift project that includes Android testing in pull request checks. - Identify and recommend best practices for bridging between Swift and Android's Java SDK and packaging Swift libraries with Android apps - Develop support for debugging Swift applications on Android - Advise and assist with adding support for Android to various community Swift packages Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Comcast is introducing new simplified, contract-free broadband plans that eliminate its unpopular 1.2TB data cap for residential customers. \"The company began enforcing a data cap in 2008, when it set that limit at 250GB,\" notes PCMag. \"Four years later, it raised that to 300GB, then lifted it to 1TB in 2016 and inched it up again to 1.25TB in 2020 after suspending it entirely during the early months of the pandemic.\" The report notes that existing customers will need to switch to these updated plans to benefit from the cap removal. PCMag reports: Steve Croney, Comcast's COO for connectivity and platforms, describes these new \"everyday price plans\" as \"built on simplicity and transparency -- no hidden fees, no confusion.\" Comcast began showing the new plans on its sign-up pages Thursday morning. The monthly rates largely match those announced when Comcast advertised a rate-lock offer in April: - 300Mbps downloads for $40 with a one-year lock or $55 with a five-year lock, then $70 a month - 500Mbps for $55 with a one-year lock or $70 with a five-year lock, then $85 - 1Gbps for $70 with a one-year lock or $85 a month with a five-year lock, then $100 - 2Gbps for $100 with a one-year lock or $115 with a five-year lock, then $130 Upload speeds on those plans will vary by location but should start at 40Mbps. These plans also include one year of Xfinity Mobile wireless service, which combines Verizon's coverage with Comcast's Wi-Fi network. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
