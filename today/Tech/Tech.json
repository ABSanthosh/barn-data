    "description": "Amazon won’t need to pay the European Union €250 million ($263 million) in back taxes. On Wednesday, the bloc’s executive branch said it was closing three separate state aid investigations, including one involving Amazon. The decision ends one of the company’s longest-running legal sagas. In 2017, the European Commission found that, from 2006 to 2014, Amazon had used an operating company in Luxembourg to pay substantially less tax to the European Union. The shell company had no offices or staff, and was, according to the Commission, used solely by Amazon to lower its tax bill. By the Commission’s estimate, the e-commerce giant avoided taxation on three quarters of all the profit it made from online sales in the EU during that period. In 2021, however, Amazon won an appeal against the ruling. Although the company changed its tax structure following the investigation, it argued at the time that the Commission’s decision was full of \"methodological errors.” It also said the payments were legal per international tax principles, an argument Europe’s second-highest court agreed with after finding Amazon’s structure didn’t confer it an advantage over other companies. Subsequently, the court ordered the Commission’s decision annulled. With this week’s announcement, the Commission said it was “taking into account the guidance of the EU Courts” in closing the case against Amazon. Amazon did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. While the end of its case against Amazon is a setback for the European Commission, earlier this year the body won a decisive victory against Apple. In September, Europe’s highest court ordered the tech giant to pay back a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) tax break from Ireland that was found to be illegal in 2016.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/european-commission-ends-state-aid-case-against-amazon-with-no-tax-payout-004438602.html?src=rss",

    "description": "When it comes to keeping your iPad safe and functional, a protective case can be a real lifesaver. Whether you're looking to shield your device from everyday bumps and scratches or need something a bit more rugged, there are options for every budget. Some cases go beyond protection and add extra functionality, like built-in keyboards that turn your iPad into a productivity powerhouse, ideal for work or note-taking on the go.From slim, stylish folio cases to tough covers with soft microfiber linings, there’s a wide variety of choices to suit your style and needs. No matter what you're after, the perfect iPad case is out there waiting to keep your device safe and make it even more versatile. Best iPad cases iPad case FAQs Should you keep your iPad in case? It’s almost always a good idea to keep your iPad in a case so it’s protected against hazards and accidents. The best iPads are expensive — even the most affordable model will set you back nearly $300 — so you’ll want to safeguard your gear as much as possible. What is the difference between an iPad case and an iPad cover? All iPad covers are cases, but not all iPad cases are covers — yes, it’s a bit confusing, but allow us to explain. Most iPad covers are cases that surround the back of your tablet and have a flap that covers the screen, so it provides protection for the body as well as its display. Plenty of iPad cases also have screen covers, but you don’t have to get one with that feature. Instead, you could just get a case that hugs the back of the tablet and nothing else. Those accessories will be marginally thinner and lighter than their cover-toting counterparts, and give your iPad a more svelte profile. How often should I charge my iPad? How often you charge your iPad will depend on how often you use it. Most iPads will last at least a regular work day with frequent usage, which is one of the reasons why many have opted to use their iPads as laptop replacements. But with heavy usage, like constant video streaming or gaming, will come more rapid battery drain. A good rule of thumb is to charge your iPad when you go to sleep each night, that way you’ll have a topped-up device waiting for you in the morning.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-ipad-cases-to-protect-your-tablet-130033533.html?src=rss",
