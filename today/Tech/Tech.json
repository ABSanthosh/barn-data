    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-updates-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-models-with-its-data-234207599.html?src=rss",
    "description": "X is updating its privacy policy with new language that allows it to provide users’ data to third-party “collaborators” in order to train AI models. The new policy, which takes effect November 15, 2024, would seem to open the door to Reddit-like arrangements in which outside companies can pay to license data from X. The updated policy shared by X includes a new section titled “third-party collaborators.” Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X’s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise. While the policy mentions the ability to opt out, it’s not clear how users would actually do so. As TechCrunch notes, the policy points to users’ settings menu, but there’ doesn’t appear to be an control for opting out of data sharing. The policy doesn’t go into effect until next month, though, so there’s still a chance that could change. X didn’t respond to a request for comment. If X were to begin licensing its data to other companies, it could open up a significant new revenue stream for the social media company, which has seen waning interest from major advertisers. In addition to the privacy policy, X is also updating its terms of service with stricter penalties for entities that are caught “scraping” large numbers of tweets. In a section titled “liquidated damages” the company states anyone viewing or accessing more than a million posts a day will be subject to a penalty of $15,000. Protecting our users’ data and our system resources is important to us. You further agree that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if you violate the Terms, or you induce or facilitate others to do so, in addition to all other legal remedies available to us, you will be jointly and severally liable to us for liquidated damages as follows for requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts (including reply posts, video posts, image posts, and any other posts) in any 24-hour period - $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts. X owner Elon Musk has previously railed against “scraping.” Last year, the company temporarily blocked people from viewing tweets while logged out, in a move Musk attributed to fending off scrapers. He also moved X’s API behind a paywall, which has drastically hindered researchers’ ability to study what’s happening on the platform. He’s also used allegations of “scraping” to justify lawsuits against organizations that have attempted to study hate speech and other issues on the platform.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-updates-its-privacy-policy-to-allow-third-parties-to-train-ai-models-with-its-data-234207599.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Sam Altman’s Worldcoin is going to need some new business cards printed up because it’s dropping the “coin” in its name. The OpenAI CEO’s startup is shifting from cryptocurrency to focus more on its identification technology and it just unveiled a new version of its signature gadget. Bloomberg reported that the new company called (wait for it) World will focus its eye scanning tech on confirming identities, something that could come in handy in a world of deep fake videos popping up all over the internet. Co-founder and CEO Alex Blania introduced the World’s newest device called Orb, a biometric eye scanner used to confirm human identities through an identity service called Deep Face. The latest model of the Orb, which uses NVIDIA’s Jetson chipset, will roll out to customers as the need arises. Chief Device Officer Rich Heley said at the San Francisco event that access to the Orb will be on demand and delivered the same way that people order pizza. A company statement says, “These advancements make it possible to offer new ways of providing World ID’s proof of human verification in more places around the world.” According to the company’s website, almost 7 million people have been scanned by World Orbs to date. Everyone in attendance at the San Francisco launch event received a free Orb for their human identifying needs.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/sam-altmans-worldcoin-startup-is-dropping-the-coin-and-doubling-down-on-orbs-232105287.html?src=rss",

    "description": "During its MAX event yesterday, Adobe teased some experimental photo and video editing tools for PhotoShop and Premiere Pro. There are a total of nine features, which include being able to rotate vector images, produce sound effects from text descriptions, and generate images in various shapes and sizes. Engadget reports: [W]e'll start with Project Perfect Blend for PS, which improves natural blending and makes shadow casting more realistic, creating more lifelike images. Project Clean Machine removes photo flashes, fireworks and objects blocking the camera's view. One feature that stands out is Project In Motion, which lets users transform custom shape animations into video by entering a prompt, while Project Know How is a content authenticator tool that can search for a video file's source online. Project Turntable lets users rotate 2D vector art in 3D, thereby allowing the 2D vector art to face a direction of their choice. The generative AI model fills in any blanks to create presentable 3D vector art. Another standout tool is Project Super Sonic, which generates sound effects via prompts or clicking on objects in a video. The latter method can create sounds without typing prompts into the generative AI model. Project Super Sonic seems helpful for people looking to design the sounds they want. Adobe is also working on Microsoft Copilot integration in Project Scenic. This tool creates 3D scene layouts using Copilot prompts, and the camera and objects in the layout can be tweaked. Project Remix A Lot leverages generative AI to create images in various shapes and sizes, all fully editable. In other words, users can \"remix\" creations into shapes they like, including unusual ones. Finally, we have Project Hi-Fi. With this tool, it's possible to transform sketches and concepts into high-quality images. These images can easily be dragged into PhotoShop for editing. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Google's NotebookLM app has been updated to let you generate custom podcasts from almost any source material. The AI software is also dropping the \"experimental\" tag. Wired reports: To make an AI podcast using NotebookLM, open up the Google Labs website and start a New Notebook. Then, add any source documents you would like to be used for the audio output. These can be anything from files on your computer to YouTube links. Next, when you click on the Notebook guide, you'll now see the option to generate a deep dive as well as the option to customize it first. Choose Customize and add your prompt for how you'd like the AI podcast to come out. The software suggests that you consider what sections of the sources you'd like highlighted, larger topics you want further explored, or different intended audiences who you want the message to reach. One tip [Raiza Martin, who leads the NotebookLM team inside of Google Labs] shares for trying out the new feature is to generate the Audio Overview without changes, and while you're listening to this first iteration, write down any burning questions you have or topics you wish it expanded on. Afterwards, use these notes as a launching pad to create your prompts for NotebookLM and regenerate that AI podcast with your interests in mind. [...] Yes, Google's NotebookLM might flatten the specifics of a big document or get some details mixed up, but being able to generate more personalized podcasts from disparate sources truly does feel like a transformation -- and luckily nothing like turning into a giant bug.
