    "description": "Amazon Roku, Apple TV and Google TV (aka Chromecast) are all worthwhile streaming platforms. Each of them lets you view thousands of movies and TV shows on major apps like Disney+ and Netflix. And seeing all your favorites on a big-screen TV is way better than watching it on a smaller laptop or smartphone screen. But Amazon's Fire TV has a leg up on them when it comes to built-in VPN compatibility. Unlike archrival Roku, Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV system offers VPN apps straight through its built-in app store. That's important if you want to watch a show or movie that's otherwise unavailable in your country. Fire up a VPN, set your virtual location and you'll likely get a different set of viewing options on many streaming services ‚Äî or the ability to access ones to which you otherwise didn't have access. We‚Äôll explain the details and tell you how it works. Choose the right VPN for your Fire TV For starters, we‚Äôre going to assume you have a Fire TV device. If you don‚Äôt, we have good news: If your TV doesn‚Äôt already have Fire TV streaming built-in, the add-on devices are frequently on sale at Amazon for as little as $25 or less. Grab the Fire Stick 4K Max if you want a good balance of price versus performance ‚Äî just make sure it‚Äôs on sale for $40 or less. (See how the Fire TV streamers compare to rivals from Roku, Google, Apple and more by checking out our list of best streaming devices.) Once you have your Fire TV hardware set up, it‚Äôs time to choose a VPN ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where the Fire TV operating system shines. A long list of VPNs, including all of our current top picks for the best VPNs, are available on the platform and they‚Äôre as easy to download and install as any of the video apps. The Engadget-approved VPNs currently available on Fire TV include: ProtonVPN Windscribe ExpressVPN CyberGhost Surfshark We‚Äôll leave it to you to research which VPN offers the best combination of features and value for you, but a word of warning: With the exception of the first two listed above, we don‚Äôt recommend using a free VPN, as they‚Äôre notorious for collecting and selling your data to advertising networks to fund shoddily-protected servers. Note you can install as many VPNs as you‚Äôd like on Fire TV, if you‚Äôd like to cross-test them at your leisure. Installing the VPN Installing it is easy once you know which Fire TV VPN you want to use. Head to Find \u003e on the main menu and simply search the name of your preferred VPN ‚Äì just type ‚ÄúVPN‚Äù if you‚Äôd like to scroll through all of the options available. There, you can find the service you want (or are already subscribed to) and start installing. The process shouldn‚Äôt take too long. Once it‚Äôs completed, you‚Äôre ready to start using it. Using your Fire TV VPN Once you‚Äôve downloaded the app, navigate to it on your Fire TV dashboard. You‚Äôll have to enter your username and password or sign up to create an account. Some VPNs might require you to create an account on your smartphone or computer beforehand. Once logged in, you can either click the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button on your VPN or browse the server list to choose which country you want to tunnel to. Once connected, return to the Fire TV home screen and reload your streaming platform of choice to verify if the content is different. If it is, your VPN is working and you‚Äôre ready to stream.¬† VPN options for other streaming platforms Don't have a Fire TV? Good news: Robust VPN options (or alternatives) exist for the other major streaming platforms, too.

    "description": "Pebble is back, baby. On Monday, Google (which owns Pebble‚Äôs IP via its Fitbit purchase) open-sourced the OG modern smartwatch‚Äôs software. Although that paves the road for anyone to make new Pebble-esque wearables (or custom firmware for the old models), one high-profile figure has already raised his hand: Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky. Google says the open-source PebbleOS includes most of the software‚Äôs source code. The only exceptions are proprietary code for chipset and Bluetooth software. Google‚Äôs Matthieu Jeanson, Katharine Berry and Liam McLoughlin wrote that developers face ‚Äúa non-trivial amount of work‚Äù in finding replacements for the stripped-out pieces of code. Migicovsky says he spurred the project by asking friends at Google if they would open-source the software. The Pebble founder, who went on to run Beeper (the iMessage for Android app that sparked a short-lived war with Apple), wrote on his blog that he wants his planned smartwatch to be a modern take on the original Pebble ‚Äî a spiritual successor that doesn‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel. ‚ÄúNo one makes a smartwatch with the core set of features I want,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI had really, really, really hoped that someone else would come along and build a Pebble replacement. But no one has.‚Äù Kickstarter His wishlist for the as-yet-unnamed product includes an always-on e-paper screen, long battery life, a ‚Äúsimple and beautiful user experience,‚Äù physical buttons and hackability (like custom watch faces). Those were indeed the hallmarks of the innovative and charming Pebble, which broke Kickstarter records and preceded Apple, Samsung and Google‚Äôs models by several years. ‚ÄúThe new watch we‚Äôre building basically has the same specs and features as Pebble, though with some fun new stuff as well,‚Äù the Pebble founder wrote, adding that his team still needs to nail down the product‚Äôs exact specifications and timeline. ‚ÄúIt runs open source PebbleOS, and it‚Äôs compatible with all Pebble apps and watchfaces.‚Äù Developers can get Google‚Äôs open-sourced Pebble OS on GitHub. And if you‚Äôre interested in Migicovsky‚Äôs as-yet-unnamed spiritual successor to the 2013 smartwatch, you can sign up for updates on its webpage.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/google-open-sources-the-pebble-smartwatchs-software-and-its-creator-is-making-a-new-model-220526568.html?src=rss",

    "description": "West Sussex County Council is using up to $31 million from the sale of capital assets to fund an Oracle-based transformation project, originally budgeted at $3.2 million but now expected to cost nearly $50 million due to delays and cost overruns. The project, intended to replace a 20-year-old SAP system with a SaaS-based HR and finance system, has faced multiple setbacks, renegotiated contracts, and a new systems integrator, with completion now pushed to December 2025. The Register reports: West Sussex County Council is taking advantage of the so-called \"flexible use of capital receipts scheme\" introduced in 2016 by the UK government to allow councils to use money from the sale of assets such as land, offices, and housing to fund projects that result in ongoing revenue savings. An example of the asset disposals that might contribute to the project -- set to see the council move off a 20-year-old SAP system -- comes from the sale of a former fire station in Horley, advertised for $3.1 million. Meanwhile, the delays to the project, which began in November 2019, forced the council to renegotiate its terms with Oracle, at a cost of $3 million. The council had expected the new SaaS-based HR and finance system to go live in 2021, and signed a five-year license agreement until June 2025. The plans to go live were put back to 2023, and in the spring of 2024 delayed again until December 2025. According to council documents published this week [PDF], it has \"approved the variation of the contract with Oracle Corporation UK Limited\" to cover the period from June 2025 to June 2028 and an option to extend again to the period June 2028 to 2030. \"The total value of the proposed variation is $2.96 million if the full term of the extension periods are taken,\" the council said.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: On Thursday, Anthropic announced Citations, a new API feature that helps Claude models avoid confabulations (also called hallucinations) by linking their responses directly to source documents. The feature lets developers add documents to Claude's context window, enabling the model to automatically cite specific passages it uses to generate answers. \"When Citations is enabled, the API processes user-provided source documents (PDF documents and plaintext files) by chunking them into sentences,\" Anthropic says. \"These chunked sentences, along with user-provided context, are then passed to the model with the user's query.\" The company describes several potential uses for Citations, including summarizing case files with source-linked key points, answering questions across financial documents with traced references, and powering support systems that cite specific product documentation. In its own internal testing, the company says that the feature improved recall accuracy by up to 15 percent compared to custom citation implementations created by users within prompts. While a 15 percent improvement in accurate recall doesn't sound like much, the new feature still attracted interest from AI researchers like Simon Willison because of its fundamental integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. In a detailed post on his blog, Willison explained why citation features are important. \"The core of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern is to take a user's question, retrieve portions of documents that might be relevant to that question and then answer the question by including those text fragments in the context provided to the LLM,\" he writes. \"This usually works well, but there is still a risk that the model may answer based on other information from its training data (sometimes OK) or hallucinate entirely incorrect details (definitely bad).\" Willison notes that while citing sources helps verify accuracy, building a system that does it well \"can be quite tricky,\" but Citations appears to be a step in the right direction by building RAG capability directly into the model. Anthropic's Alex Albert clarifies that Claude has been trained to cite sources for a while now. What's new with Citations is that \"we are exposing this ability to devs.\" He continued: \"To use Citations, users can pass a new 'citations [...]' parameter on any document type they send through the API.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
