    "description": "Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows may be shaping up to be the hit Ubisoft needed. On social media, the Assassin‚Äôs Creed team announced that the game, which was released on Thursday, has so far drawn in two million players. Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows was originally slated to come out last fall, but was delayed twice as developers worked to further polish the game and try to ensure everything would be running smoothly on day one.¬† So far, (mostly) so good, it seems. Engadget‚Äôs Kris Holt noted in his review¬†this week that the game is for the most part running well on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC. üî• 2 MILLION PLAYERS! üî•We‚Äôre thrilled to celebrate this incredible milestone! Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey. Thank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan! #AssassinsCreedShadows pic.twitter.com/a6YezXNtYI‚Äî Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) March 22, 2025 According to Ubisoft, the launch of Shadows ‚Äúhas now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey.‚Äù In the tweet, the team added, ‚ÄúThank you for joining the journey in Feudal Japan!‚Äù Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows is available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Ubisoft+, Amazon Luna, Mac and PC, and is expected to come to iPad down the line. According to Holt‚Äôs review, there‚Äôs something in it for longtime players of the series and newcomers alike.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-ubisoft-says-213050072.html?src=rss",

    "description": "\"China is considering trying to blunt greater U.S. tariffs and other trade barriers,\" reports the Wall Street Journal, \"by offering to curb the quantity of certain goods exported to the U.S., according to advisers to the Chinese government.\" Tokyo's adoption of so-called voluntary export restraints, or VERs, to limit its auto shipments to the U.S. in the 1980s helped prevent Washington from imposing higher import duties. A similar move from Beijing, especially in sectors of key concern to Washington, like electric vehicles and batteries, would mitigate criticism from the U.S. and others over China's \"economic imbalances\": heavily subsidized companies making stuff for slim profits but saturating global markets, to the detriment of other countries' manufacturers... The Xi leadership has indicated a desire to cut a deal with the Trump administration to head off greater trade attacks... Similar to Japan, the Chinese advisers say, Beijing may also consider negotiating export restraints on EVs and batteries in return for investment opportunities in those sectors in the U.S. In some officials' views, they say, that might be an attractive offer to Trump, who at times has indicated an openness to more Chinese investment in the U.S. even though members of his administration firmly oppose it. The article notes agreements like this are also hard to enforce, \"particularly when Chinese companies export to the U.S. from third countries including Mexico and Vietnam.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Besides administering standardized pre-college tests, America's nonprofit College Board designs college-level classes that high school students can take. But now they're also crafting courses \"not just with higher education at the table, but industry partners such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the technology giant IBM,\" reports Education Week. \"The organization hopes the effort will make high school content more meaningful to students by connecting it to in-demand job skills.\" It believes the approach may entice a new kind of AP student: those who may not be immediately college-bound.... The first two classes developed through this career-driven model ‚Äî dubbed AP Career Kickstart ‚Äî focus on cybersecurity and business principles/personal finance, two fast-growing areas in the workforce.\" Students who enroll in the courses and excel on a capstone assessment could earn college credit in high school, just as they have for years with traditional AP courses in subjects like chemistry and literature. However, the College Board also believes that students could use success in the courses as a selling point with potential employers... Both the business and cybersecurity courses could also help fulfill state high school graduation requirements for computer science education... The cybersecurity course is being piloted in 200 schools this school year and is expected to expand to 800 schools next school year... [T]he College Board is planning to invest heavily in training K-12 teachers to lead the cybersecurity course. IBM's director of technology, data and AI called the effort \"a really good way for corporations and companies to help shape the curriculum and the future workforce\" while \"letting them know what we're looking for.\" In the article the associate superintendent for teaching at a Chicago-area high school district calls the College Board's move a clear signal that \"career-focused learning is rigorous, it's valuable, and it deserves the same recognition as traditional academic pathways.\" Also interesting is why the College Board says they're doing it: The effort may also help the College Board ‚Äî founded more than a century ago ‚Äî maintain AP's prominence as artificial intelligence tools that can already ace nearly every existing AP test on an ever-greater share of job tasks once performed by humans. \"High schools had a crisis of relevance far before AI,\" David Coleman, the CEO of the College Board, said in a wide-ranging interview with EdWeek last month. \"How do we make high school relevant, engaging, and purposeful? Bluntly, it takes [the] next generation of coursework. We are reconsidering the kinds of courses we offer....\" \"It's not a pivot because it's not to the exclusion of higher ed,\" Coleman said. \"What we are doing is giving employers an equal voice.\" Thanks to long-time Slashdot reader theodp for sharing the article.
