    "description": "Google is reportedly working on a new Android API for what it’s calling Rich Ongoing Notifications, which would allow apps to display at-a-glance information in a status bar much like Apple’s Live Activities in the Dynamic Island on iPhone. This is according to journalist Mishaal Rahman, who spotted the code in the Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3 release. It could work a lot like the time tracker that currently appears when you’re on a phone call, with a bit of text in a bubble at the top of the display that you can tap to open the app for more details. Writing for Android Authority, Rahman says the API “will let apps create chips with their own text and background color that live in the status bar.” It could be especially useful for things like transit updates, allowing users to keep track of pertinent information like departure times or an Uber’s ETA while using other apps. The feature isn’t yet complete, though, and it could still be some time before we see it. Rahman predicts it’ll arrive with Android 16.

    "description": "NoWayNoShapeNoForm writes: OpenVault believes that data caps on broadband are not a problem because most people do not exceed their existing data caps. OpenVault contends that people that do exceed their broadband data caps are simply being forgetful — leaving a streaming device on 24x7, or deploying unsecure WiFi access points, or reselling their service within an apartment building. Yes, there may be some ISPs that have older networks that they have not upgraded. Or maybe they are unable to increase network capacity in \"the middle mile\" of their networks, but the Covid pandemic certainly encouraged many ISPs to upgrade their networks and capacity while many ISPs that had broadband data caps ended that feature. Perhaps the biggest problem, according to OpenVault, is that most broadband users do not really have any idea how much bandwidth they \"consume\" every month. If Internet access is a service that people want to treat as a \"utility\", then you have to ask, Would they keep the water running after finishing their shower? In the article Ookla's VP of Smart Communities adds that \"Scrolling through social media feeds for hours can 'push' hundreds of videos to the user, many of which may be of no interest — they just start running.\" So the main driver for usage-based billing wasn't to increase revenue, OpenVault CEO Mark Trudeau tells the site, but to \"balance the network a little more...\" (Though he then also adds that sometimes a subscriber could also be reselling broadband service in their apartment building, \"And that's not even legal.\") \"If one or two customers on a given node is causing issues for 300 others, where those 300 are not getting the service that they paid for, then that's a problem right?\" he said. Having said that, the article also points out that \"Many major fiber providers, like AT\u0026T, Frontier, Google Fiber and Verizon Fios, don't have data caps at all.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "\"The world's largest renewable energy and transmission project has received key approval from government officials,\" reports New Atlas. Solar power from Australia will be carried 2,672 miles (4,300 kilometers) to Singapore over undersea cables in what's being called \"the Australia-Asia Power Link project.\" Reuters reports that SunCable \"aims to produce 6 gigawatts of electricity at a vast solar farm in Northern Australia and ship about a third of that to Singapore via undersea cable.\" More from New Atlas: [The project] will start by constructing a mammoth solar farm in Australia's Northern Territory to transmit around-the-clock clean power to [the Australian city] Darwin, and also export \"reliable, cost-competitive renewable energy\" to Singapore... with a clean energy generation capacity of up to 10 gigawatts, plus utility scale onsite storage. [The recently-obtained environmental approval] also green lights an 800-km (~500-mile) overhead transmission line between the solar precinct and Murrumujuk near Darwin... If all of the dominoes line up perfectly, supply of the first clean electricity is estimated to start in the early 2030s. An overview graphic on the project page shows that the eventual end game for the Powell Creek development appears to be the generation of up to 20 GW of peak solar power and have some 36-42 GWh of battery storage on site.
