    "description": "If you‚Äôre at least in your mid-30s (give or take), you know the voice of Elwood Edwards, realize it or not. He recorded the phrase, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got mail!‚Äù and three other lines for Quantum Computer Services in 1989. That company later rebranded to America Online, and the rest is early internet history. Edwards died on Tuesday. WKYC first reported (via Variety) that Edwards passed away one day before what would have been his 75th birthday. He was a longtime off-camera presence at the Cleveland TV station, working as a graphic designer, camera operator and jack-of-all-trades employee. His wife, Karen Edwards, worked at Quantum when she heard the company‚Äôs then-CEO talking about needing a voice for the software that would soon bombard mailboxes across the US. ‚ÄúSo, she volunteered my voice,‚Äù Edwards said in a 2012 video. ‚ÄúAnd on a cassette deck in my living room, I recorded the phrases that you‚Äôve come to know.‚Äù He was paid a grand total of $200 for his voiceover work. The new-message catchphrase, recorded in Edwards‚Äô calm and welcoming voice, became a cultural phenomenon in AOL‚Äôs ‚Äò90s and early 2000s heyday. Of course, that included inspiring the 1998 Nora Ephron rom-com‚Äôs title. Edwards also contributed three (lesser known but still remembered by many) AOL sayings: ‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù ‚ÄúFile‚Äôs done‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye.‚Äù In the 2012 video, he‚Äôs depicted getting hounded by various employees, prompting him to say the thing. (AOL is currently owned by Yahoo, Engadget‚Äôs parent company.) ‚ÄúSo, that‚Äôs the story behind the catchphrase,‚Äù he said in the clip, ‚Äúwhich, well, I have a certain amount of trouble trying to escape.‚Äù This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-voice-of-aols-youve-got-mail-has-died-at-74-214247947.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It‚Äôs almost time again for Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), the zany speedrun-fest for a good cause. The hook for this year‚Äôs event is a run of the Dreamcast classic Crazy Taxi with a live backing band. Funds raised from this year‚Äôs showcase will benefit the nonprofit Prevent Cancer Foundation. AGDQ 2025 runs from January 5 to 12 in Pittsburgh. The live instrumental band rocking out during a Crazy Taxi run sounds like a fun centerpiece. You can check out a preview in the video below, which showed the same band rocking out to a recorded run of the game at Summer Games Done Quick (SGDC) 2024. On Saturday, January 11 at 4:48PM ET, you can catch a fully live version. Other highlights on the agenda include a run of the instant PlayStation classic Astro Bot on Sunday, January 5 at 6:30PM ET, a speedrun of Pok√©mon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire for 3DS on January 11 at 8:18AM ET and a play-through of the Wii port of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the same day at 4PM ET. You can check out the full schedule for more. Last year‚Äôs AGDQ (also in Pittsburgh) raised $2.5 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Among its best bits were a no-hit run of Resident Evil 2 (2019), Super Mario 64 completed on an electric drum kit and a pup named Peanut Butter lending a paw to help his person beat the NES classic Gyromite. The Games Done Quick Organization has raised $51.8 million for various charities throughout its 15 years. You can stream AGDQ 2025 on Twitch. Or, if you want to attend live at the Wyndham Grand in downtown Pittsburgh, you can register now.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/awesome-games-done-quick-2025-will-include-crazy-taxi-with-a-live-backing-band-203426032.html?src=rss",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: The FBI is warning that hackers are obtaining private user information ‚Äî including emails and phone numbers ‚Äî from U.S.-based tech companies by compromising government and police email addresses to submit \"emergency\" data requests. The FBI's public notice filed this week is a rare admission from the federal government about the threat from fraudulent emergency data requests, a legal process designed to help police and federal authorities obtain information from companies to respond to immediate threats affecting someone's life or property. The abuse of emergency data requests is not new, and has been widely reported in recent years. Now, the FBI warns that it saw an \"uptick\" around August in criminal posts online advertising access to or conducting fraudulent emergency data requests, and that it was going public for awareness. \"Cyber-criminals are likely gaining access to compromised US and foreign government email addresses and using them to conduct fraudulent emergency data requests to US based companies, exposing the personal information of customers to further use for criminal purposes,\" reads the FBI's advisory. [...] The FBI said in its advisory that it had seen several public posts made by known cybercriminals over 2023 and 2024, claiming access to email addresses used by U.S. law enforcement and some foreign governments. The FBI says this access was ultimately used to send fraudulent subpoenas and other legal demands to U.S. companies seeking private user data stored on their systems. The advisory said that the cybercriminals were successful in masquerading as law enforcement by using compromised police accounts to send emails to companies requesting user data. In some cases, the requests cited false threats, like claims of human trafficking and, in one case, that an individual would \"suffer greatly or die\" unless the company in question returns the requested information. The FBI said the compromised access to law enforcement accounts allowed the hackers to generate legitimate-looking subpoenas that resulted in companies turning over usernames, emails, phone numbers, and other private information about their users. But not all fraudulent attempts to file emergency data requests were successful, the FBI said. The FBI said in its advisory that law enforcement organizations should take steps to improve their cybersecurity posture to prevent intrusions, including stronger passwords and multi-factor authentication. The FBI said that private companies \"should apply critical thinking to any emergency data requests received,\" given that cybercriminals \"understand the need for exigency.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Starting November 11, TSMC plans to stop supplying 7 nm and smaller chips to Chinese companies working on AI processors and GPUs. \"The move is reportedly to ensure it remains compliant with US export restrictions,\" reports The Register. From the report: This will not affect Chinese customers wanting 7 nm chips from TSMC for other applications such as mobile and communications, according to Nikkei, which said the overall impact on the chipmaker's revenue is likely to be minimal. TrendForce further cites another China-based source who claims the move was at the behest of the US Department of Commerce, which informed TSMC that any such shipments should not proceed unless approved and licensed by its BIS (Bureau of Industry and Security). We asked the agency for confirmation. Any moves by the silicon supremo is likely to be out of caution to pre-empt accusations from Washington that it isn't doing enough to prevent advanced technology from getting into the hands of Chinese entities that have been sanctioned. As TrendForce notes, it \"highlights the foundry giant's delicate position in the global semiconductor supply chain amid the heating chip war between the world's two superpowers.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
