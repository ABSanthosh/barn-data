    "description": "Minecraft is no longer (officially) available on virtual and mixed reality platforms. The change was confirmed in today's patch notes for the game's Bedrock edition following an announcement from developer Mojang in October. Those fall patch notes suggested that the platforms would be removed in March, so players who favored VR wound up getting a few extra weeks to fully immerse themselves in their blocky worlds. Removing entire platforms isn't a choice game devs make lightly. Especially when Minecraft's player base still numbers in the hundreds of millions at any given time, it seems unlikely that Mojang would take away virtual and mixed reality unless it wouldn't cause a serious disruption for its many fans. There are still plenty of critically received games that make VR ownership worthwhile (Beat Saber, anyone?), but a title as major as Minecraft abandoning the hardware isn't a great look.

    "description": "Bungie laid out its plans for the next year of Destiny 2 content, and the back half of 2025 could be particularly exciting for Star Wars fans. The studio teased an expansion titled Renegades that draws inspiration from the sci-fi universe. Destiny has always featured classic space opera themes about battles between the light and the darkness, so maybe it was inevitable that the game would one day pay homage to Star Wars. If you fear that there will suddenly be Skywalkers and Fetts running around your game a la Fortnite or Call of Duty, that does seem like a possibility. The teaser video features a guardian wielding an iconic green light saber, and there are some recognizable nods to the Imperial alarm sounds and uniforms in a few close-up shots. And if you really want to embrace the dark side, the most expensive pre-order option for this year's content includes armor ornaments that can turn your guardian into Darth Vader, Kylo Ren or General Grievous. Bungie More information about the Renegades expansion will be announced on September 9 ahead of the update's arrival this December.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/destiny-2-will-get-a-star-wars-expansion-this-december-220446525.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon's Zoox said it has issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis after a crash in Las Vegas last month. CNBC reports: The recall surrounds a defect with the vehicle's automated driving system that could cause it to inaccurately predict the movement of another car, increasing \"the risk of a crash,\" according to a report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on May 1. Zoox submitted the recall after an April 8 incident in Las Vegas in which an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi collided with a passenger vehicle, the NHTSA report states. There were no injuries in the crash and only minor damage occurred to both vehicles. \"After analysis and rigorous testing, Zoox identified the root cause,\" the company said in a blog post. \"We issued a software update that was implemented across all Zoox vehicles. All Zoox vehicles on the road today, including our purpose-built robotaxi and test fleet, have the updated software.\" Zoox paused all driverless vehicle operations while it reviewed the incident. It has since resumed operations after rolling out the software update. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "According to the Washington Post (paywalled), the Trump administration plans to eliminate the Energy Star program -- a long-standing EPA initiative that has saved Americans over $500 billion in energy costs since 1992. \"The organization states that the average American saves about $450 per year on energy bills by choosing appliances that have been Energy Star-certified,\" adds Engadget. From the report: The EPA hasn't said when this would go into effect and when consumers would stop seeing Energy Star certifications on home appliances. It's technically illegal for a presidential administration to end this program without Congress, but the same goes for many of Trump's pronouncements and executive orders. \"Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration's promise to reduce household energy costs,\" Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN. \"For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That's a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
