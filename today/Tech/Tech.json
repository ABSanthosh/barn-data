    "description": "The Federal Trade Commission has delayed the start of a rule that aims to make the process of canceling subscriptions less of a nightmare. Last year, the FTC voted to ratify amendments to a regulation known as the Negative Option Rule, adding a new \"click-to-cancel\" rule that requires companies to be upfront about the terms of subscription signups and prohibits them \"from making it any more difficult for consumers to cancel than it was to sign up.\" Surprising no one, telecom companies were not happy, and sued the FTC. While the rule was nevertheless set to be implemented on May 14, the FTC now says enforcement has been pushed back 60 days to July 14. Some parts of the updated Negative Option Rule went into effect on January 19, but the enforcement of certain provisions were deferred to May 14 by the previous administration to give companies more time to comply. Under the new administration, the FTC says it has \"conducted a fresh assessment of the burdens that forcing compliance by this date would impose\" and decided it \"insufficiently accounted for the complexity of compliance.\"  Once the July 14 deadline hits, the FTC says \"regulated entities must be in compliance with the whole of the Rule because the Commission will begin enforcing it.\" But, the statement adds, \"if that enforcement experience exposes problems with the Rule, the Commission is open to amending\" it. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/ftc-pushes-the-enforcement-of-its-click-to-cancel-rule-back-to-july-201353413.html?src=rss",

    "description": "As first reported by 9to5Mac, PS5 users now have a direct way to buy games in the PlayStation store with Apple Pay. When you purchase a game on your PS5 with Apple Pay, you'll be shown a QR code that you can scan with your iPhone or iPad to complete the transaction from there. Previously, PS5 users had to go through the console's browser or the PlayStation App on iOS to buy games with Apple Pay. The latest update is a simple quality of life upgrade for PS5 owners since most already have a credit card tied to their PlayStation account. However, Apple Card owners can more easily take advantage of their 2 percent cash back on Apple Pay purchases when buying PS5 games. Besides using a traditional card on file, Apple Pay joins PayPal as an alternative payment method. The Apple Pay compatibility on the PS5 was made possible through an iOS 18 update that allows users to buy things on third-party browsers like Chrome and Firefox with a unique QR code. This change lays the groundwork for more Apple Pay implementation with other browsers and devices, including support for the PS4 in a later software update, as indicated by 9to5Mac.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/your-ps5-now-natively-accepts-apple-pay-193606732.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Back in 2000, Slashdot founder CmdrTaco marked the 4th anniversary of Jennifer Ringley's pioneering \"JenniCam\" livestream (saying \"It sure beats the Netscape FishCam. It's nuts how Jenni's little cam became such a fixture on The Internet...\") But a new article in the Washington Post remembers how \"Once, Ringley looked directly into the camera and held a note in front of her eye. It read: 'I FEEL SO LONELY.'\" By 2003, Ringley had shut down the site and disappeared. She began declining interview requests, saying she was enjoying her privacy; her absence on social media continues to this day. \"But by then, the human zoo was everywhere,\" they write including \"social media, where everyone could become a character in their own show.\" In 2007 Justin Kan launched Justin.TV, which eventually became Twitch, \"a thrumming online city for anyone wanting to, as its slogan said, 'waste time watching other people waste time.'\" But the article also notes 2023 stats from the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey that found Americans\"were spending far less time socializing than they had 20 years ago — especially 18-to-29-year-olds, who were spending two more hours a day alone.\" So how did this play out for the next generation of livestreaming influencers? Here's the origin story of \"a lonely young woman in Texas\" who's \"streamed every second of her life for three years and counting.\" One afternoon, her boyfriend told her to try Twitch, saying, as she recalled: \"Your life sucks, you work at CVS, you have no friends. ... This could be helpful.\" In her first stream, on a Friday night, she played 3Â½ hours of \"World of Warcraft\" for her zero followers. Eight years later... Six hundred and forty-two people are watching when Emily tugs off her sleep mask to begin day No. 1,137 of broadcasting every hour of her life... On the live-streaming service Twitch, one of the world's most popular platforms, Emily is a legendary figure. For three years, she has ceaselessly broadcast her life — every birthday and holiday, every sickness and sleepless night, almost all of it alone. Her commitment has made her a model for success in the new internet economy, where authenticity and endurance are highly prized. It's also made her a good amount of money: $5.99 a month from thousands of subscribers each, plus donations and tips — minus Twitch's 30-to-40 percent cut. But to get there, Emily, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her last name be withheld due to concerns of harassment, has devoted herself to a solitary life of almost constant stimulation. For three years, she has taken no sick days, gone on no vacations, declined every wedding invitation, had no sex. She has broadcast and self-narrated a thousand days of sleeping, driving and crying, lugging her camera backpack through the grocery store, talking through a screen to strangers she'll never meet. Her goal is to buy a house and get married by the age of 30, but she's 28 and says she's too busy to have a boyfriend. Her last date was seven years ago... But no one tells streamers when to record or when to stop. There are no labor codes, performance limits or regulations to keep the platforms from setting incentives impossibly high. Many streamers figure out the optimal strategy themselves: The more you share, the more successful you can be.... Though some Twitch stars are millionaires, most scramble to get by, buffeted by the vagaries of audience attention. Emily's paid-subscription count, which peaked last year at 22,000, has since slumped to around 6,000, dropping her base income to about $5,000 a month, according to estimates from the analytics firm Streams Charts... Sometimes Emily dreads waking up and clocking into the reality show that is her life. She knows staring at screens all night is unhealthy, and when she feels too depressed to stream, she'll stay in bed for hours while her viewers watch. But she worries that taking a break would be \"career suicide,\" as she called it. Some viewers already complain that she showers too long, sleeps in too late, doesn't have enough fun... She said she \"used to show true sadness on stream\" but doesn't anymore because it makes viewers uncomfortable. When she hits a breaking point now, she said, she closes herself in the bathroom.

    "description": "Long-time Slashdot reader mbessey (a Mac/iOS developer) writes: As we're coming up on the 50th anniversary of the first release of UCSD Pascal, I thought it would be interesting to poke around in it a bit, and work on some tools to bring this \"portable operating system\" back to life on modern hardware, in a modern language (Rust). Wikipedia describes UCSD Pascal as \"a version that ran on a custom operating system that could be ported to different platforms. A key platform was the Apple II, where it saw widespread use as Apple Pascal. This led to Pascal becoming the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and later, the Macintosh. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal source code.\" mbessey is chronicling their new project in a series of blog posts which begins here: The p-System was not the first portable byte-code interpreter and compiler system — that idea goes very far back, at least to the origins of the Pascal language itself. But it was arguably one of the most-successful early versions of the idea and served as an inspiration for future portable software systems (including Java's bytecode, and Infocom's Z-machine). And they've already gotten UCSD Pascal running in an emulator and built some tools (in Rust) to transfer files to disk images. Now they're working towards writing a p-machine emulator in Rust, which they can they port to \"something other than the Mac. Ideally, something small â\" like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
