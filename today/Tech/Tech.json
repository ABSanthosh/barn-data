    "description": "According to Mark Gurman in the Power On newsletter this weekend, we may see at least two devices with Apple’s upcoming M5 chip before the end of the year. Gurman reports that the M5 iPad Pro has reached the late stages of testing, putting it “on track for production in the second half of this year.” And the M5 MacBook Pro should be here sometime in the fall, in line with the timing of the past few years’ releases. This year’s iPad Pro likely won’t be the generation that adopts Apple’s in-house modem, though. According to Gurman, that shift is expected to happen in 2027 with the arrival of the M6 models — which he reports that Apple has already begun “early” work on. Apple introduced its first in-house cellular modem, the C1, with the iPhone 16e in February this year, and so far it seems to be performing pretty well.

    "description": "An AI overhaul may be on the horizon for Apple’s Health app. In the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that Apple is working on a much more comprehensive version of its Health app under the code name Project Mulberry, with plans to integrate an AI agent that would somewhat “replicate” a doctor and act as a personal health coach. In addition to making lifestyle recommendations based on users’ health data, the app will reportedly include educational videos from real doctors about an array of health topics. The Health app will also put a new emphasis on food tracking, and may even offer form correction tips for workouts using the device’s camera, Gurman reports. The service, unofficially being referred to as Health+, could arrive with iOS 19.4, which Gurman says is expected to be released next spring or summer. In the meantime, Apple reportedly has doctors on staff whose data is being used to train the AI agent, and it’s planning to open a studio near Oakland, California where they can film content. Don’t be surprised if Health+ arrives with a celebrity doctor on board, too — according to Gurman, Apple is on the hunt for a “major doctor personality” to be the face of the service.

    "description": "What happens when you ask Copilot to \"write a program that can be run on an iPhone 16 to select 15 random photos from the phone, tint them to random colors, and display the photos on the phone\"? That's what TouchDevelop did for the long-discontinued Windows Phone in a 2013 Microsoft Research 'SmartSynth' natural language code generation demo. (\"Write scripts by tapping on the screen.\") Long-time Slashdot reader theodp reports on what happens when, 14 years later, you pose the same question to Copilot: \"You'll get lots of code and caveats from Copilot, but nothing that you can execute as is. (Compare that to the functioning 10 lines of code TouchDevelop program). It's a good reminder that just because GenAI can generate code, it doesn't necessarily mean it will generate the least amount of code, the most understandable or appropriate code for the requestor, or code that runs unchanged and produces the desired results. theodp also reminds us that TouchDevelop \"was (like BASIC) abandoned by Microsoft...\" Interestingly, a Microsoft Research video from CS Education Week 2011 shows enthusiastic Washington high school students participating in an hour-long TouchDevelop coding lesson and demonstrating the apps they created that tapped into music, photos, the Internet, and yes, even their phone's functionality. This shows how lacking iPhone and Android still are today as far as easy programmability-for-the-masses goes. (When asked, Copilot replied that Apple's Shortcuts app wasn't up to the task).

    "description": "The U.S. and China \"are racing to build a truly useful humanoid worker,\" the Wall Street Journal wrote Saturday, adding that \"Whoever wins could gain a huge edge in countless industries.\" \"The time has come for robots,\" Nvidia's chief executive said at a conference in March, adding \"This could very well be the largest industry of all.\" China's government has said it wants the country to be a world leader in humanoid robots by 2027. \"Embodied\" AI is listed as a priority of a new $138 billion state venture investment fund, encouraging private-sector investors and companies to pile into the business. It looks like the beginning of a familiar tale. Chinese companies make most of the world's EVs, ships and solar panels — in each case, propelled by government subsidies and friendly regulations. \"They have more companies developing humanoids and more government support than anyone else. So, right now, they may have an edge,\" said Jeff Burnstein [president of the Association for Advancing Automation, a trade group in Ann Arbor, Michigan].... Humanoid robots need three-dimensional data to understand physics, and much of it has to be created from scratch. That is where China has a distinct edge: The country is home to an immense number of factories where humanoid robots can absorb data about the world while performing tasks. \"The reason why China is making rapid progress today is because we are combining it with actual applications and iterating and improving rapidly in real scenarios,\" said Cheng Yuhang, a sales director with Deep Robotics, one of China's robot startups. \"This is something the U.S. can't match.\" UBTech, the startup that is training humanoid robots to sort and carry auto parts, has partnerships with top Chinese automakers including Geely... \"A problem can be solved in a month in the lab, but it may only take days in a real environment,\" said a manager at UBTech... With China's manufacturing prowess, a locally built robot could eventually cost less than half as much as one built elsewhere, said Ming Hsun Lee, a Bank of America analyst. He said he based his estimates on China's electric-vehicle industry, which has grown rapidly to account for roughly 70% of global EV production. \"I think humanoid robots will be another EV industry for China,\" he said. The UBTech robot system, called Walker S, currently costs hundreds of thousands of dollars including software, according to people close to the company. UBTech plans to deliver 500 to 1,000 of its Walker S robots to clients this year, including the Apple supplier Foxconn. It hopes to increase deliveries to more than 10,000 in 2027. Few companies outside China have started selling AI-powered humanoid robots. Industry insiders expect the competition to play out over decades, as the robots tackle more-complicated environments, such as private homes. The article notes \"several\" U.S. humanoid robot producers, including the startup Figure. And robots from Amazon's Agility Robotics have been tested in Amazon warehouses since 2023. \"The U.S. still has advantages in semiconductors, software and some precision components,\" the article points out. But \"Some lawmakers have urged the White House to ban Chinese humanoids from the U.S. and further restrict Chinese robot makers' access to American technology, citing national-security concerns...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
