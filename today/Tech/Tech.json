    "description": "Elon Musk has launched a $97.4 billion bid to take control of OpenAI. The Wall Street Journal reports a group of investors led by Musk's xAI submitted an unsolicited offer to the company's board of directors on Monday. The group wants to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI's for-profit arm.  When asked for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson pointed Engadget to an X post from CEO Sam Altman. \"No thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,\" Altman wrote on the social media platform Musk owns.   no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want— Sam Altman (@sama) February 10, 2025 \"It’s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was,\" Musk said in a statement his attorney shared with The Journal. \"We will make sure that happens.\" OpenAI It's hard to say how serious this bid from Musk is and what — if any — chance it has to succeed. OpenAI is not a traditional company, and the nonprofit structure Sam Altman and others at the company want it to get away from may in fact protect it from Musk's offer. Were OpenAI purely a for-profit company with traditional shares Musk's bid would likely trigger what's known in corporate law as a Revlon moment, where, under certain circumstances, the company's board of directors would be forced to sell the company to the highest bidder to maximize shareholder profits.   Musk, as you can imagine, wasn't a fan of Altman's joke, writing \"Swindler\" in response and later calling him \"Scam Altman.\"   This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musk-wants-to-buy-openai-for-974-billion-215221105.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A new iPhone update patches a flaw that could allow an attacker to turn off a nearly seven-year-old USB security feature. Apple’s release notes for iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1 say the bug, which allowed the deactivation of USB Restricted Mode, “may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” The release notes describe the now-patched security flaw as allowing “a physical attack,” which suggests the attacker needed the device in hand to exploit it. So, unless your device was hijacked by “extremely sophisticated” attackers, there was nothing to panic about even before Monday’s update. USB Restricted Mode, introduced in iOS 11.4.1, prevents USB accessories from accessing your device’s data if it hasn’t been unlocked for an hour. The idea is to protect your iPhone or iPad from law enforcement devices like Cellebrite and Graykey. It’s also the reason for the message asking you to unlock your device before connecting it to a Mac or Windows PC. Aligned with its typical policy, Apple didn’t detail who or what entity used the attack in the wild, only noting that the company is “aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited.” Security researcher Bill Marczak of the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab reported the flaw. In 2016, while in grad school, he discovered the iPhone’s first known zero-day remote jailbreak, which a cyberwarfare company sold to governments. You can make sure USB Restricted Mode is activated by heading to Settings \u003e Face ID (or Touch ID) \u0026 Passcode. Scroll down to “Accessories” in the list and ensure the toggle is off, which it is by default. Somewhat confusingly, toggling the setting off means the security feature is on because it lists features with allowed access. As usual, you can install the update by heading to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your iPhone or iPad.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/apple-patches-iphone-exploit-that-allowed-for-extremely-sophisticated-attack-214237852.html?src=rss",

    "description": "With TikTok's U.S. ban temporarily paused, the company is encouraging Android users to sideload its app by downloading it directly from TikTok.com as an APK file, bypassing the Google Play Store. TechCrunch reports: The Android app download is being made available as an Android Package Kit, more commonly known as an APK file, which contains the app's code, assets, and other resources that TikTok needs to run. By offering a standalone download, TikTok can at least temporarily skirt the current app store ban, which still prevents both Google Play and Apple's App Store from hosting the app while the ban's enforcement remains paused.

    "description": "Brave Browser version 1.75 introduces \"custom scriptlets,\" a new feature that allows advanced users to inject their own JavaScript into websites for enhanced customization, privacy, and usability. The feature is similar to the TamperMonkey and GreaseMonkey browser extensions, notes BleepingComputer. From the report: \"Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience,\" explained Brave in the announcement. Brave says that the feature was initially created to debug the browser's adblock feature but felt it was too valuable not to share with users. Brave's custom scriptlets feature can be used to modify webpages for a wide variety of privacy, security, and usability purposes. For privacy-related changes, users write scripts that block JavaScript-based trackers, randomize fingerprinting APIs, and substitute Google Analytics scripts with a dummy version. In terms of customization and accessibility, the scriptlets could be used for hiding sidebars, pop-ups, floating ads, or annoying widgets, force dark mode even on sites that don't support it, expand content areas, force infinite scrolling, adjust text colors and font size, and auto-expand hidden content. For performance and usability, the scriptlets can block video autoplay, lazy-load images, auto-fill forms with predefined data, enable custom keyboard shortcuts, bypass right-click restrictions, and automatically click confirmation dialogs. The possible actions achievable by injected JavaScript snippets are virtually endless. However, caution is advised, as running untrusted custom scriptlets may cause issues or even introduce some risk. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
