    "description": "The Switch 2's Joy-Con \"mouse\" has some competition. At least one launch game for Nintendo's new console includes USB mouse support. Nobunga's Ambition: Awakening CE lets you plug in a traditional pointing device and get down to business. According to developer Koei Tecmo, the mouse will \"work seamlessly.\" Nobunga's Ambition will let you switch between controller and USB mouse on the fly. \"Once you connect the USB mouse, a message will appear in the top left indicating that the mouse is connected,\" Michi Ryu said in a video (translated from Japanese). \"When the USB mouse is connected, it takes priority over the Joy-Con 2. As you can see, you can switch instantly. It's very smooth.\" So, what does that mean for other mouse-friendly Switch 2 games? Civilization VII, another launch title, comes to mind. We emailed 2K Games to ask and will update this story if we hear back. To be fair, the Switch 2's Joy-Con mouse support is solid. Engadget's Sam Rutherford was pleasantly surprised with it in his hands-on. Still, it's nice to have options. (And let's be honest, a real mouse will be hard to beat.) Although it wasn't a well-known fact, the original Switch also supported USB mice. For example, Nintendo's visual programming tool Game Builder Garage worked with them. But the number of games supporting the Joy-Con mouse makes it a bigger deal on the Switch 2.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-regular-usb-mice-in-at-least-one-game-205725720.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Whoop's new screen-less, fitness-focused Whoop MG wearable might have a major bug that can leave the device unusable, according to reports from Android Police and TechIssuesToday. Whoop launched the Whoop MG and Whoop 5.0 at the beginning of May, the company's first major hardware release since it launched the Whoop 4.0 in 2021. According to complaints on Whoop's community forums and X, after setting up a Whoop MG, the wearable can mysteriously became unresponsive hours later, refusing to connect to a smartphone even when it should be charged. \"I wore it for about 20 hours or so, but then it suddenly disappeared from the app, no sensor lights on, nothing appearing in the app,\" one new Whoop MG owner shared on Reddit. On the company's forums, Whoop suggests trying things like charging the MG, reconnecting it to your phone or resetting the wearable to see if that fixes things. Whoop owners have also been directed to contact Whoop's Support team, and multiple faulty Whoop MG owners report that they're being sent replacement wearables. Engadget has contacted Whoop to get a sense for how widespread this issue is and what the company is doing to address it. We'll update this article if we hear back. Unlike other companies, Whoop doesn't expect customers to buy a fitness tracker and then pay a subscription; Whoop's subscription fee is inclusive of its hardware. With the Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG, the company is also hoping to expand the number of metrics it tracks beyond just activity and sleep tracking to things like real-time stress monitoring and, in the case of the MG, blood pressure and ECG readings. What features you're able to access ultimately depends on both the wearable you have and the subscription you're paying for, though. To access the Whoop MG in particular, you have to pay $359 annually, which starts to feel pretty egregious when the wearable might not work. Prior to this issue, Whoop was also caught denying free hardware upgrades to existing customers after previously suggesting it would send out new wearables to anyone who'd been a member for six months or more. Whoop reversed that decision a few days later.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/one-of-whoops-new-wearables-has-a-bug-so-bad-the-company-is-issuing-replacements-201550971.html?src=rss",

    "description": "In early 2025, U.S. solar power production jumped 44% compared to the previous year, driven by end-of-year construction to capture tax incentives and long-term cost advantages. \"The bad news is that, in contrast to China, solar's growth hasn't been enough to offset rising demand,\" notes Ars Technica. \"Instead, the US also saw significant growth in coal use, which rose by 23 percent compared to the year prior, after years of steady decline.\" From the report: Short-term fluctuations in demand are normal, generally driven by weather-induced demand for heating or cooling. Despite those changes, demand for electricity in the US has been largely flat for over a decade, largely thanks to gains in efficiency. But 2024 saw demand go up by nearly 3 percent, and the first quarter of 2025 saw another rise, this time of nearly 5 percent. It's a bit too early to say that we're seeing a shift to a period of rising demand, but one has been predicted for some time due to rising data center use and the increased electrification of transportation and appliances. Under those circumstances, the rest of the difference will be made up for with fossil fuels. Running counter to recent trends, the use of natural gas dropped during the first three months of 2025. This means that the use of coal rose nearly as quickly as demand, up by 23 percent compared to the same time period in 2024. Despite the rise in coal use, the fraction of carbon-free electricity held steady year over year, with wind/solar/hydro/nuclear accounting for 43 percent of all power put on the US grid. That occurred despite small drops in nuclear and hydro production. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Kraken is launching tokenized versions of U.S. equities for 24/7 trading outside the U.S., giving global investors blockchain-based access to major companies like Apple and Tesla. Reuters reports: Tokenization refers to the process of issuing digital representations of publicly-traded securities. Instead of holding the securities directly, investors hold tokens that represent ownership of the securities. The tokens' launch outside the U.S. comes amid growing interest in blending traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. While tokenized securities have yet to gain widespread adoption, proponents say they hold the potential to significantly reshape how people access and invest in financial markets. In a January opinion piece for the Washington Post, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said tokenization could also allow retail investors to access private companies' stocks. Kraken's tokens, called xStocks, will be available in select markets outside the United States, it said, without naming the markets. The move was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal. The offering is currently not available for U.S. customers. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
