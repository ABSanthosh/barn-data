    "description": "Wanna go outside and kick the ball around? The soccer story game Despelote is coming to the Nintendo Switch in early 2025. The game was previously announced for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. Despelote¬†is a story-driven game about people and the emotional spirit and camaraderie of football. You play as a plucky 8-year-old kid named Juli√°n from Quito, Ecuador who goes out with his friends for a fun-filled afternoon of neighborhood football after a long day of school. The game tells the story of Ecuador‚Äôs economic struggles in the late 1990s and the sense of community and unity that grew leading up to the 2002 World Cup. Developers Juli√°n Cordero and Sebasti√°n Valbuena based the game‚Äôs setting, dialogue and experiences on their own childhood memories and photos growing up in Ecuador. Despelote was an official selection of the 2023 Tribeca Festival. It‚Äôs also one of the games featured by Wholesome Games‚Äô Wholesome Snack Showcase ahead of The Game Awards.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/despelote-is-dribbling-its-way-to-the-nintendo-switch-231254398.html?src=rss",

    "description": "GM is giving up on its Cruise robotaxi subsidiary. The company announced today that it will fold Cruise into its own in-house technical team. Under the new strategy, this single unit will focus for now on developing advanced driver assistance programs, and in the future on fully autonomous personal vehicles. GM acquired Cruise in 2016. However, the robotaxi brand faced intense scrutiny last year after a pedestrian in San Francisco was struck and dragged by one of its driverless cars. The ensuing investigations saw Cruise stop all operations for driverless vehicles and for its manned robotaxi service, and several of the company's leaders resigned or were let go in the aftermath. In recent months, Cruise had resumed some limited activity, but the hit to public trust and safety after the pedestrian incident seem to have created an insurmountable hurdle for GM.

    "description": "An anonymous reader shares a report: Software vulnerability submissions generated by AI models have ushered in a \"new era of slop security reports for open source\" -- and the devs maintaining these projects wish bug hunters would rely less on results produced by machine learning assistants. Seth Larson, security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation, raised the issue in a blog post last week, urging those reporting bugs not to use AI systems for bug hunting. \"Recently I've noticed an uptick in extremely low-quality, spammy, and LLM-hallucinated security reports to open source projects,\" he wrote, pointing to similar findings from the Curl project in January. \"These reports appear at first glance to be potentially legitimate and thus require time to refute.\" Larson argued that low-quality reports should be treated as if they're malicious. As if to underscore the persistence of these concerns, a Curl project bug report posted on December 8 shows that nearly a year after maintainer Daniel Stenberg raised the issue, he's still confronted by \"AI slop\" -- and wasting his time arguing with a bug submitter who may be partially or entirely automated.

    "description": "Global antibiotic use in livestock varies dramatically across regions, with some Asian countries using up to 80 times more antibiotics per kilogram of meat than European nations, according to new research published by Our World in Data. Thailand leads global antibiotic consumption in livestock, while Norway reports the lowest usage rates. The study found that around 70% of global antibiotics are administered to farm animals rather than humans, raising concerns about antimicrobial resistance. Several European countries have successfully reduced veterinary antibiotic sales by more than half between 2011 and 2022 through stricter regulations, including requiring prescriptions and imposing taxes on sales. The Netherlands saw a 54% decrease in pig farm antibiotic use between 2004 and 2016 without negative impacts on animal welfare or farm economics. Researchers suggest global livestock antibiotic use could fall by two-thirds if consumption were reduced to 50 milligrams per kilogram of meat produced. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech/episodes/1009",
    "description": "Leo Laporte, Harry McCracken, Christina Warren, and Lou Maresca discuss the evolving relationship between the tech industry and the incoming Trump administration, the future of TikTok in the U.S., advances in AI and its impact on everything from weather forecasting to web browsing, and much more. ‚Ä¢ Elon Musk and other tech billionaires are playing a major role in shaping President-elect Trump's transition team. The panel debated what this could mean for issues like antitrust regulation of Big Tech. ‚Ä¢ Trump has named entrepreneur and investor David Sacks as the White House AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks is an Elon Musk ally who has been critical of OpenAI. ‚Ä¢ The Hak Tuah cryptocurrency project suffered a 90% price crash shortly after launch amid controversy, in what may have been a \"rug pull\" scam. ‚Ä¢ Trump's pick to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, is expected to push the agency to partner more with SpaceX and the commercial space industry. But his close ties to Elon Musk could face political hurdles. ‚Ä¢ TikTok's future remains murky as U.S courts uphold a potential ban. The crew discusses the free speech implications and the role of geopolitics. EU also probes TikTok over Russian election interference. ‚Ä¢ Entrepreneur Frank McCourt's Project Liberty consortium is reportedly advancing a bid to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations, positioning it as a \"people's bid.\" ‚Ä¢ The U.S. House is set to approve an additional $3 billion to fund the removal of Chinese telecom equipment like Huawei and ZTE from domestic networks. ‚Ä¢ Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger is departing after a challenging 3-year stint. The chip giant's future strategy is up in the air as it faces intensifying competition, but the chip company did outline breakthroughs at a conference in advanced transistors, packaging, and interconnects that could help it regain a manufacturing edge. ‚Ä¢ OpenAI is running a \"12 Days of OpenAI\" promotion highlighting new AI models and services. The TWiT panel debated whether it's mainly a technical showcase or a monetization push. ‚Ä¢ Google unveiled a weather forecasting AI model that it says outperforms the leading U.S. and European forecast systems, especially for predicting extreme events. ‚Ä¢ ElevenLabs launched a beta product that allows users to create and edit entire AI-generated podcast episodes, sparking discussions about the impact on human podcast creators. ‚Ä¢ With the rise of AI, could we see a new generation of AI-infused web browsers that better understand our behavior? A long blog post by tech guru Om Malik explored the possibilities. ‚Ä¢ In the wake of China's \"Salt Typhoon\" hacks of telecom networks, the FCC is proposing new cybersecurity rules - but with a twist that would allow law enforcement backdoor access. ‚Ä¢ In the latest twist in the CSAM scanning saga, Apple is being sued for abandoning the controversial child abuse image detection feature, after previously being pilloried for trying to implement it. ‚Ä¢ A sleeker, more accurate definition of a \"second\" based on atomic clocks using Strontium instead of Cesium atoms could be coming by 2030, enabling new scientific breakthroughs. ‚Ä¢ Just in time for Christmas, a pair of the iconic ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold at auction for a whopping $28 million, a new record for movie memorabilia.
