    "description": "Peloton is continuing to expand into products other than stationary bikes and treadmills with a new strength training app called Peloton Strength+. The iOS-only app will give current and future Peloton subscribers access to audio-guided strength workouts that can be performed at the gym. The fitness company initially started testing a beta version of the app in September, which Peloton says informed features like bookmarking custom workouts and the ability to swap and reorder movements. The final version also includes a tool for generating new workouts based on how much time you have, your experience level, or available equipment, instructional how-to videos and “in-ear coaching” to keep you on track while you’re working out. Like many other fitness apps, Strength+ can also connect to an Apple Watch to display metrics like your heart rate and calories burned and let you log weights and reps from your wrist. None of these features are radically different from what you can get from other popular apps like Fitbod or SmartGym, save for Peloton’s focus on audio and the company’s roster of popular fitness instructors. In the years following the pandemic, Peloton has struggled to adjust to the changing demand for its subscription hardware. Not everyone wanted a Peloton Tread or Bike in their living room when the option to pay less to use one in public became available. Peloton has tried various strategies to recapture its popularity since then, making it possible to access Peloton workouts without expensive hardware, launching a fitness-tracking camera called Guide with a strength workout focus similar to Strength and even selling a rowing machine. Nothing has matched the sales highs the company experienced during the pandemic. Selling subscriptions to the Peloton app and Strength+ seems like a viable way to grow in the inevitable future where most people don’t care about Peloton hardware. Peloton Strength+ will be available for a limited time at $1 per month for the first six months. Afterward, a subscription to Strength+ will cost $9.99 per month. Current Peloton All Access, Guide, and App+ subscribers can use Strength+ at no additional cost.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/peloton-is-introducing-a-new-audio-focused-strength-training-app-222145376.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI has partnered with defense startup Anduril Industries to develop AI for the Pentagon. The companies said on Wednesday that they’ll combine OpenAI’s models, including GPT-4o and OpenAI o1, with Anduril’s systems and software to improve the US military’s defenses against unpiloted aerial attacks. The deal comes less than a year after OpenAI softened its stance on using its models for military purposes. Although the ChatGPT maker’s policies still prohibit its models from developing or using weapons, it deleted a line in January that explicitly banned integrating its tech into “military and warfare” use. The company said at the time it was already working with DARPA on cybersecurity tools. In October, the company hired a former Palantir security officer and was reportedly pitching its products to the US military and national security establishment. An OpenAI spokesperson told The Washington Post that the deal complies with the company’s rules because it focuses on systems that defend against pilotless aerial threats. The company said the partnership doesn’t cover other uses. According to The Washington Post, the OpenAI-Anduril partnership will aim to improve the latter’s tech for detecting and shooting down drones threatening the US military and its allies. The Pentagon already buys Anduril’s Roadrunner drone interceptor (pictured above) to help counter the rise of smaller drones on the world’s battlefields. The startup sells sentry towers, comms jammers, military drones and an autonomous submarine, among other projects. The companies framed the partnership as a way to defend US military personnel and counter China’s advancing AI. “Our partnership with OpenAI will allow us to utilize their world-class expertise in artificial intelligence to address urgent Air Defense capability gaps across the world,” Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf wrote in a statement. “Together, we are committed to developing responsible solutions that enable military and intelligence operators to make faster, more accurate decisions in high-pressure situations.” Anduril was co-founded by Oculus Rift inventor (and Oculus VR co-founder) Palmer Luckey. That headset laid the foundation for the Meta Quest lineup, which today holds the lion’s share of the VR and AR market. Luckey left Meta (then Facebook) in 2017, months after news broke that he donated $10,000 to a group aiming to post 4chan-style anti-Hillary Clinton memes on roadside billboards. “OpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports U.S.-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a statement. “Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects U.S. military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-signs-deal-with-palmer-luckeys-anduril-to-develop-military-ai-213356951.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Bruce Perens wrote the original Open Source definition back in 1997, and then co-founded the Open Source Initiative with Eric Raymond in 1998. But after resigning from the group in 2020, Perens is now diligently developing an alternative he calls \"Post Open\" to \"meet goals that Open Source fails at today\" — even providing a way to pay developers for their work. To make it all happen, he envisions software developers owning (and controlling) a not-for-profit corporation developing a body of software called \"the Post Open Collection\" and collecting its licensing fees to distribute among developers. The hope? To \"make it possible for an individual developer to stay at home and code all day, and make their living that way without having to build a company.\" The not-for-profit entity — besides actually enforcing its licensing — could also: Provide tech support, servicing all Post-Open software through one entity.Improve security by providing developers with cryptographic-hardware-backed authentication guaranteeing secure software chain-of-custody.Handle onerous legal requirements like compliance with the EU Cyber Resilience Act \"on behalf of all developers in the Post Open Collection\".Compensate documentation writers.Fund lobbying on behalf of developers, along with advocacy for their software's privacy-preserving features. \"We've started to build the team,\" Perens said in a recent interview, announcing weeks ago that attorneys are already discussing the structure of the future organization and its proposed license. But what do you think? Perens has agreed to answer questions from Slashdot readers... He's also Slashdot reader #3,872. (And Perens is also an amateur radio operator, currently on the board of M17 — a community of open source developers and radio enthusiasts — and in general support of Open Source and Amateur Radio projects through his non-profit HamOpen.org.) But more importantly, Perens \"was the person to announce 'Open Source' to the world,\" according to his official site. Now's your chance to ask him about his next new big idea... Ask as many questions as you'd like, but please, one per comment. We'll pick the very best questions — and forward them on to Bruce Perens himself to answer! Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "America's next president \"announced Wednesday he has selected Jared Isaacman, a billionaire businessman and space enthusiast who twice flew to orbit with SpaceX, to become the next NASA administrator,\" reports Ars Technica: In a post on X, Isaacman said he was \"honored\" to receive Trump's nomination. \"Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,\" Isaacman wrote. \"On my last mission to space, my crew and I traveled farther from Earth than anyone in over half a century. I can confidently say this second space age has only just begun....\" \"Jared Isaacman will be an outstanding NASA Administrator and leader of the NASA family,\" said Jim Bridenstine, who led NASA as administrator during Trump's first term in the White House. \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\" Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator during the Obama administration, wrote on X that Isaacman's nomination was \"terrific news,\" adding that \"he has the opportunity to build on NASA's amazing accomplishments to pave our way to an even brighter future.\" Isaacman, 41, is the founder and CEO of Shift4, a mobile payment processing platform, and co-founded Draken International, which owns a fleet of retired fighter jets to pose as adversaries for military air combat training... Isaacman, an evangelist for the commercial space industry, has criticized some of NASA's decisions on the Artemis program. In several posts on X, he questioned the agency's decision to fund two redundant lunar landers, while not planning for any backup to the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which costs $2.2 billion per copy, not including expenses for ground infrastructure or the Orion spacecraft itself. One of those casualties might be the SLS rocket. The program is managed by NASA, with suppliers spread across the United States and prime contractors working under cost-plus arrangements with the space agency, meaning the government is on the hook to pay for any delays or cost overruns. If confirmed he'll be the 4th NASA administrator who's actually flown in space, according to the article. And according to Wikipedia, Isaacman was the commander of Inspiration4, a private spaceflight using SpaceX's Crew Dragon Resilience that launched in 2021. The crew returned to Earth on September 18, 2021, after orbiting at 585 km (364 mi) in altitude. The mission was part of a fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, to which Isaacman pledged to donate $100 million. Thanks to Slashdot reader FallOutBoyTonto for sharing the news.
