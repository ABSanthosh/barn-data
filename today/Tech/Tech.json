    "description": "AI company Perplexity announced in February that it was building its own browser called Comet. In a recent interview with the TBPN podcast, CEO Aravind Srinivas gave some insight as to why the business appeared to be branching out from its artificial intelligence focus: It's to collect user data and sell them targeted advertisements. \"That’s kind of one of the other reasons we wanted to build a browser, is we want to get data even outside the app to better understand you,\" he said. “We plan to use all the context to build a better user profile and, maybe you know, through our discover feed we could show some ads there.” If that all sounds familiar, it could be become Google's Chrome browser has taken a similar approach. In fact, Comet is built on Chromium, the open-source browser base from Google. That's not to say Perplexity wouldn't take the chance to go straight to the source and acquire Chrome in the aftermath of Google's recent monopoly court ruling regarding online search. In the ongoing hearings about Google and its potential sale of Chrome, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko said he thought Perplexity would be able to continue running the browser at its current scale. Unsurprisingly, he wasn't too keen on OpenAI acquiring the property.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-building-a-browser-in-part-to-collect-customer-data-for-targeted-ads-230132091.html?src=rss",

    "description": "After (what felt like) a long delay, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders have opened in the US and Canada. Nintendo finally opened up pre-orders in both regions on April 24, after previously announcing (and then retracting) an April 9 pre-order date due to tariffs. The official June 5 release date for the console remains the same, but if you signed up ahead of time on Nintendo’s site, you should have received an email that will give you access to place your order via Nintendo. If you didn't get an email and you registered your interest with Nintendo, you're not alone. The company updated its pre-order page to say that some may not receive their pre-order email until after the June 5 launch date. Third-party retailers also have Switch 2 pre-orders. Stores like GameStop, Walmart, Best Buy, Target and others are selling the $450 console and the $500 Mario Kart World bundle. But as of right now, the console and bundle are sold out or otherwise unavailable at most retailers. How to pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2 Along with Nintendo, third-party retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart and Target opened their pre-orders on April 24 as scheduled. Best Buy, Walmart and Target pre-orders opened at midnight, while GameStop in-person and online pre-orders started at 11am. As of now, all of those retailers have either sold out of their stock, or list the console as \"coming soon.\" We also expect the Switch 2 to be available from Amazon, but links are not live on the site yet. At this point, we recommend signing up via Nintendo's website if you haven't already. It's free to sign up and you'll eventually get an email that will allow you to order the console, even if you have to wait until after the June 5 launch day. We will continue to update this post as time goes on with the latest Switch 2 pre-order information. Pre-order Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Amazon* Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target Pre-order Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle Nintendo Amazon* Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target *As of 5pm ET on Thursday, April 24, Amazon has not listed either Switch 2 console package for sale. We will update this article with direct links when they arrive, until then we're linking to the site's Nintendo-focused hub. How to pre-order Switch 2 accessories The Switch 2 has a number of accessories that you can buy separately. While the console didn't get a price adjustment when Nintendo announced the new pre-order date, many of these accessories did. The new Switch 2 camera now costs $55 instead of the original $50 price tag; the new Switch 2 Pro controller costs $85 instead of $80; an extra pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers will set you back $95 instead of $90 and a Joy-Con charging grip is going for $40 instead of $35. Check out Nintendo's official statement for all of the accessory price adjustments. You can pre-order most of them now.

We will update this article with direct links when they arrive, until then we're linking to the site's Nintendo-focused hub. More Switch 2 details We knew from the teaser trailer for the Switch 2 that Nintendo's new hardware would be bigger and would have a new approach to the detachable Joy-Cons. The new Joy-Con 2 have a new C button, mouse controls and a built in gyroscope for tilt control. The console has a built-in mic to support a new feature called Game Chat that will let you communicate with friends in-game. The device is indeed a bit larger, with a 7.9-inch LCD screen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR and a 1080p resolution. When docked, you'll be able to play at up to 4K on your TV, and Nintendo says it improved the consoles internal speakers as well. The new dock also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and help maintain performance during long play sessions. The Switch 2 has dual USB-C ports for charging, and the base storage amount has increased to 256GB. The Switch 2's storage can be expanded like the previous model, but it will only work with newer microSD Express cards. Tariffs and the Nintendo Switch 2 During its most recent Direct presentation at the start of April, Nintendo showed off more of the Switch 2 than it ever had before. That included the reveal of the April 9 pre-order opening date, in addition to the original $450 starting price. Shortly after, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on China and other countries, prompting Nintendo to delay pre-orders in the US and Canada. In a reversal, President Trump then announced a 90-day pause on steep “reciprocal” tariffs affecting 75 countries, but also announced that the tariff imposed on China will go up even further (currently, it's up to 245 percent for that country). We now know that the original $450 price for the Switch 2 will remain the same in the US and Canada, but based on its official statement, it appears Nintendo is leaving the door open for potential future price increases. We also know that Nintendo started moving some of its Switch console manufacturing to Vietnam in 2019. The reciprocal tariff for Vietnam was set to be 46 percent, but that appears to be on hold for now in favor of a 10 percent reciprocal tariff that’s now in effect for the 90-day pause period. It has been speculated that Nintendo will boost production of Switch 2 consoles in Vietnam so it can stay on schedule, even if it sells the console at a loss in the short term. It appears the company will have to seriously ramp up production to keep up with Switch 2 demand: according to Nintendo, 2.2 million people entered the pre-order lottery in Japan alone, which is far more devices than it is expected to deliver in that region on launch day.

    "description": "ZipNada shares a report from ZDNet: Microsoft's latest research identifies a new type of organization known as the Frontier Firm, where on-demand intelligence requirements are managed by hybrid teams of AI agents and humans. The report identified real productivity gains from implementing AI into organizations, with one of the biggest being filling the capacity gap -- as many as 80% of the global workforce, both employees and leaders, report having too much work to do, but not enough time or energy to do it. ... According to the report, business leaders need to separate knowledge workers from knowledge work, acknowledging that humans who can complete higher-level tasks, such as creativity and judgment, should not be stuck answering emails. Rather, in the same way working professionals say they send emails or create pivot tables, soon they will be able to say they create and manage agents -- and Frontier Firms are showing the potential possibilities of this approach. ... \"Everyone will need to manage agents,\" said Cambron. \"I think it's exciting to me to think that, you know, with agents, every early-career person will be able to experience management from day one, from their first job.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

The leaked data is extremely sensitive, as millions of screenshots from employees' devices could not only expose full-screen captures of emails, internal chats, and confidential business documents, but also contain login pages, credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information that could be exploited to attack businesses worldwide. After the company was contacted, access to the unsecured database was secured. An official comment has yet to be received. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
