    "description": "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is coming to PlayStation 5 on June 26. At SXSW, Kojima Productions dropped a 10-minute trailer for the upcoming game, giving us our best look yet at the sequel to 2019’s Death Stranding. Pre-orders open on March 17 at 10AM local time, and those who buy the Digital Deluxe or Collector’s Edition will get early access two days before the game officially becomes available. Hideo Kojima was joined by Norman Reedus and Troy Baker on stage at SXSW 2025 to discuss the much anticipated new game. The trailer reveals Death Stranding 2 takes place 11 months after the creation of the United Cities of America. As previous glimpses have shown, Reedus is back as Sam, along with Léa Seydoux, who voices Fragile, and Baker as Higgs. There’s otherwise a lot to take in over the course of the video’s 10-minute run, including a slew of new faces joining the cast.  Death Stranding 2 was first announced back in 2022, and last year’s PlayStation State of Play brought a 9-minute look into the game. Come summertime, you'll finally be able to play it.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/death-stranding-2-just-got-its-release-date-and-a-10-minute-new-trailer-231240932.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A report from The Washington Post details allegations made by whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams about Facebook in a 78-page complaint filed last April with the SEC, including that the company built a censorship system in hopes to be allowed to operate in China and that it considered allowing the Chinese government to access users’ data in the country. Claims that Facebook developed a content suppression tool to appease China, where it has been blocked since 2009, were first reported as far back as 2016 by The New York Times. Wynn-Williams has a memoir about her time at Facebook, Careless People: A Story of Where I Used to Work, coming out this week. Wynn-Williams — a former Facebook global policy director who was fired in 2017 — said in the complaint that the company formed a team in 2014 focused on creating a version of Facebook that would comply with China’s laws, under the code-name “Project Aldrin,” The Washington Post reports. In addition to building a censorship system, it was reportedly proposed during negotiations with Chinese officials that the company allow a Chinese private-equity firm to review content posted by users in China, and that Facebook hire hundreds of moderators dedicated to the effort of squashing restricted content. In a statement to The Washington Post, spokesperson Andy Stone said the company's past interest in the Chinese market is “no secret,” and that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had announced a move away from these efforts in 2019. But Wynn-Williams’ complaint paints a fuller picture of how far Facebook (pre-Meta) was allegedly willing to go to gain a Chinese userbase. Read The Washington Post’s full report here. Zuckerberg has since become vocal about “free expression” and made changes to how Meta’s platforms approach moderation. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg announced that Facebook and Instagram would end fact-checking and instead adopt X-style Community Notes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/whistleblower-complaint-expands-on-claims-that-facebook-once-built-a-censorship-tool-to-win-over-china-215047102.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://science.slashdot.org/story/25/03/09/2316231/that-galaxy-next-door-its-home-to-a-monster-black-hole?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "NPR reports on \"a monster black hole that's been lurking unseen in the galaxy next door.\" This appears to be the closest supermassive black hole outside our Milky Way galaxy, according to a report that's appearing in The Astrophysical Journal... \"Now that there is strong evidence that it should be there, you can rest assured that we are very excitedly following up,\" says Jesse Han of the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard \u0026 Smithsonian, who led the study... Han and his colleagues realized that this black hole must exist when they were studying so-called hypervelocity stars... [T]hey started out as normal stars that were part of a binary system, or two stars orbiting each other. When that kind of pair ventures too close to a supermassive black hole, says Han, \"what can happen is one of the stars can get captured by the black hole. It is basically ripped apart from its companion.\" The bereft companion star, meanwhile, gets flung away, going at ridiculously high speeds. It's as if the black hole basically hurled it out of the galaxy. And that explains some of what's happening in our own galaxy, writes Space.com: Tracing the trajectory of these super-speed stars using the European Space Agency's star-tracking Gaia satellite, the researchers discovered that around half of them were accelerated by the Milky Way's own supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*. The other half, the team believes, likely fled to the outskirts of the Milky Way after a gravitational encounter with a supermassive black hole at the heart of the LMC separated these stars from their stellar binary partners. \"It is astounding to realize that we have another supermassive black hole just down the block, cosmically speaking,\" team leader Jesse Han of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard \u0026 Smithsonian (CfA) said in a statement. \"Black holes are so stealthy that this one has been practically under our noses this whole time.\" \"Their calculations suggest that the Large Magellanic Cloud must be harboring a black hole that's about 600,000 times the mass of our Sun,\" adds NPR. \"That's smaller than the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, which is about 4 million times more massive than the Sun.\" Astronomers had previously thought the Large Magellanic Cloud should have a big black hole, but until now there's been no evidence of it, says Han... Now, though, astronomers have a better sense of where to hunt for any X-ray, radio, or visible-light signatures that are the telltale signs of an invisible black hole that's devouring everything nearby. \"It is within the realm of possibilities that it is already detectable in radio and X-ray and optical,\" says Han. \"We just haven't looked at the right place.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "gdm (Slashdot reader #97,336) writes: A study published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives investigates how ants avoid traffic jams.... Quoting the abstract: \"The results show that ants adopt specific traffic strategies (platoon formation, quasi-constant speed and no overtaking maneuvers) that help avoid jam phenomena, even at high density.\" \"Researchers are now studying these insects' cooperative tactics to learn how to program self-driving cars that don't jam up,\" writes Scientific American: \"We're maximizing the interests of individuals, [which] is why, at a given point, you start to have a traffic jam,\" says study co-author Nicola Pugno, who studies sustainable engineering at the University of Trento in Italy. But self-driving cars, if they one day become ubiquitous, could have more cooperative programming. In one vision of this future, autonomous vehicles would share information with nearby cars to optimize traffic flow — perhaps, the researchers suggest, by prioritizing constant speeds and headways or by not passing others on the road... Today's drivers can learn at least one thing from ants to avoid causing a traffic jam, says Katsuhiro Nishinari [a mathematical physicist at the University of Tokyo, who studies traffic]: don't tailgate. By leaving room between their car and the one ahead of them, drivers can absorb a wave of braking in dense traffic conditions that would otherwise be amplified into a full-blown \"phantom\" traffic jam with no obvious cause. \"Just keeping away,\" he says, can help traffic flow smoothly. In the article the researchers admit there are differences between humans stuck in traffic and ants. \"Unlike cars, ants don't crash; they can literally walk over one another.\" And if they're backed up in a tunnel, \"they'll find a way to walk on the ceiling!\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
