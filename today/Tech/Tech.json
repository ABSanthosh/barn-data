    "title": "How to buy the Nintendo Switch 2: Latest stock updates at Walmart, Best Buy and more",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-buy-the-nintendo-switch-2-latest-stock-updates-at-walmart-best-buy-and-more-120039799.html?src=rss",
    "description": "The Nintendo Switch 2 has been available in the US for more than two weeks — but good luck finding one. While millions of people have been able to snag the $450 console since it officially went up for sale on June 5, online inventory dried up fairly quickly at most stores soon after launch and remains difficult to find today. Best Buy restocked as recently as June 23, but those units — which required in-store pickup — quickly went of out of stock. Target, likewise, has some stock in at least one locality we checked, but it requires in-store purchase. You may also be able to grab a bundle at Costco if you’re a member there. Otherwise, it's been slim pickings. As of today, we're not seeing almost no availability — though you may have different luck in your locality when checking inventory, online or in person. Again, venturing to a physical retail store can sometimes be the winning hack here. We can’t guarantee you’ll still be able to snag a Switch 2 the old-fashioned way, but it’s worth checking if a local Target, Best Buy, Walmart or GameStop — the four official retailers Nintendo lists on its store page — still has consoles in stock. For now, you can skip Amazon, though: For whatever reason, the biggest online retailer doesn't even have a product page for the Switch 2 (but it does seem to be selling games and accessories). All that said, if you're still on the hunt, we’ve rounded up all of the latest information we could find on how to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 and where you can pick one up. Where to buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Walmart began online purchases at midnight ET on June 5. Currently, both the Mario Kart World bundle and the standalone console are \"available\" via third-party retailers, but listed for much higher than their standard $500 and $450 price tags — with limited quantities available. We wouldn't recommend buying these; instead, wait for the console to be listed at its regular MSRP. Naturally, the world's largest retailer is also selling the console at its brick-and-mortar locations, though the company has noted that quantities are limited and inventory will vary by location. Best Buy started selling the Switch 2 at its retail locations on June 5. It previously said it wouldn't sell the handheld at its online store during launch week, but it made additional consoles available on June 11 around 12PM ET, and again on June 23. Those restocks lasted for the better part of an hour and required in-store pickup, but the device is now sold out again. Target had the Switch 2 in stores on June 5 and restocked its online inventory for at least a couple of hours starting around 3:30AM ET on June 6. It then had another restock on June 12 around 2:30PM ET, but that appears to have died out in less than an hour. As of June 24, we're seeing in-store stock in at least one Philadelphia location.  One Philadelphia area Target was showing \"limited stock,\" but couldn't be reserved online. Target GameStop has advertised in-store availability, though exactly how much stock your local store may have will vary by location. Online, the device has been unavailable for the past week, with the listings for the base console and Mario Kart bundle now pointing to a \"Find a Store\" page. We saw a $625 bundle that includes Mario Kart World, a microSD Express card and a few other accessories pop up a bit more frequently than the standard SKUs, but it's no longer listed (and it was kind of a raw deal anyway).  You may still have some luck at certain membership-based retailers. A Mario Kart World bundle at Costco that includes a 12-month Switch Online subscription has gone in and out of stock since launch day. Sam's Club has had a bundle without the Switch Online sub as well, though it's out of stock now. We also saw the console at BJ's early on June 5, but it's no longer live there. Verizon briefly had the Switch 2 available on launch day, but that's dried up. Only those with Verizon service were able to order, and the process was apparently somewhat rocky.  Amazon hasn't had any form of Switch 2 listing on its website, nor has it listed Mario Kart World. The company didn't take pre-orders for the Switch 2 either, so it's unclear if and when it will sell the device. You can, however, find some Switch 2 games.  Newegg has listed the Switch 2 on its site for several weeks, but it's given no indication as to when it'll begin sales. It previous showed a couple listings from a third-party seller, but at massively inflated prices. With all of these stores, we've seen the Mario Kart World bundle available in greater quantities online than the base console, which costs $50 less. But given that Mario Kart is the Switch 2's biggest launch game and retails for $80 on its own, that may not be the worst thing. Nintendo, meanwhile, is only offering the Switch 2 via an invite system. This requires you to have been a Switch Online member for at least 12 months and logged at least 50 hours of Switch 1 playtime as of April 2. It can't hurt to sign up if you meet the criteria, but don't expect it to bear fruit immediately — it's taken weeks for many people who registered in April to receive their invite. You can find a list of every Switch 2 retail listing we could find below. Just be aware that this is meant to be a reference, not a rundown of everywhere the device is available right this second. Where to buy Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle: Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target Costco (membership required) Sam's Club (membership required) Verizon (service required) Where to buy Switch 2: Walmart GameStop Best Buy Target BJ's (membership required) Verizon (service required) Where to buy Nintendo Switch 2 games and accessories Nintendo is selling a number of Switch 2 accessories alongside the console, from its (pricey) Pro Controller to cases to cameras for the new GameChat feature. Most of these became available on June 5. The same goes for games like Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Another big Switch 2 release, Donkey Kong Bananza, won't be available until mid-July but is still up for pre-order now. As of this publication, just about all Switch 2 games are broadly available. Stock for the accessories remains a little spottier, but most devices are still available at multiple retailers. Nintendo's official Switch 2 carrying cases have been the main exceptions, so you may need to look to third-party alternatives if you want some protection for your console right away.

    "description": "Diablo IV has been demonically chugging along since the release of the major Vessel of Hatred expansion last fall. The seasonal model usually brings temporary gameplay updates and storylines, but when Season 9 hits on July 1, it will add a couple of useful permanent changes. First, console players are getting support for mouse and keyboard controls. Second, there will be new additions to Nightmare Dungeons. The endgame of Diablo IV involves a lot of grinding Nightmare Dungeons, so even with a healthy dose of procedural generation, the landscape of those challenges starts to feel overly familiar. Season 9 will add some new wrinkles to the tile sets. Horadric Strongrooms are micro-dungeons within the Nightmare Dungeon that offer big potential rewards as well as a buff for the remainder of the main dungeon. Escalating Nightmares are a trio of dungeons in increasing challenges, and when tackled at Torment difficulty, they conclude with a riff on the Astaroth boss fight. It'll be a while yet before the developers bring another expansion on the scale of Vessel of Hatred, but Blizzard has been providing new twists on the game each season for the players who log hundreds of hours in Diablo IV. The Season 9 permanent additions, which also include some brand new dungeon affixes, could help keep things challenging and interesting for the game's hardcore fans.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-next-season-of-diablo-iv-adds-extra-challenges-to-the-endgame-203832761.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Longtime Slashdot reader williamyf writes: Firefox 140 just landed. Some user-facing features include: Vertical Tabs: You can now keep more -- or fewer -- pinned tabs in view for quicker access to important windows. Just drag the divider to resize your pinned tabs section. Unload Tabs: You can now unload tabs by right-clicking on a tab (or multiple selected tabs) and selecting \"Unload Tab.\" This can speed up performance by reducing Firefox's memory and CPU usage. But the most important feature? This release is an Extended Support Release (ESR). Why are ESRs so important? ESR is the Firefox version that ships as the default with many Linux distributions. Some downstream projects (like Waterfox) depend on the ESR version. Many enterprise software systems are tested only against ESR. When features are dropped -- like support for older operating systems or Flash -- ESR keeps that functionality around for longer. And speaking of old operating systems: If you are using Windows 7, 8.1, or macOS 10.12~10.15, note that FireFox ESR 115 (the last version supporting these OSs) will continue to receive patches until at least September 2025. So one can see why ESR is very important for some people. The release notes are available here. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Google DeepMind has launched Gemini Robotics On-Device, a new language model that enables robots to perform complex tasks locally without internet connectivity. TechCrunch reports: Building on the company's previous Gemini Robotics model that was released in March, Gemini Robotics On-Device can control a robot's movements. Developers can control and fine-tune the model to suit various needs using natural language prompts. In benchmarks, Google claims the model performs at a level close to the cloud-based Gemini Robotics model. The company says it outperforms other on-device models in general benchmarks, though it didn't name those models. In a demo, the company showed robots running this local model doing things like unzipping bags and folding clothes. Google says that while the model was trained for ALOHA robots, it later adapted it to work on a bi-arm Franka FR3 robot and the Apollo humanoid robot by Apptronik. Google claims the bi-arm Franka FR3 was successful in tackling scenarios and objects it hadn't \"seen\" before, like doing assembly on an industrial belt. Google DeepMind is also releasing a Gemini Robotics SDK. The company said developers can show robots 50 to 100 demonstrations of tasks to train them on new tasks using these models on the MuJoCo physics simulator. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Dutch tech scaleup Optics11 has launched an underwater monitoring system that uses light waves to “listen” for the presence of foreign objects. Called OptiBarrier, the system can detect enemy submarines, drones, and surface vessels from up to 150km away — without revealing its own position. “We listen with light,” the company’s CEO, Paul Heiden, told TNW. “That means our technology is entirely undetectable and can’t be jammed.”  The standard method for listening underwater is through electromagnetic fields. Devices emit electromagnetic pulses and detect the presence of an object, such as a ship or submarine, based on the waves that bounce…This story continues at The Next Web",

    "description": "Berlin-based startup Nox Mobility emerged this month with ambitious plans for a night train service connecting more than a dozen European cities. The network will feature sleek, private cabins — all for the price of a short-haul plane ticket.
