    "description": "SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service experienced a global outage on Thursday that lasted for over two hours. Reports of connectivity issues started around 3:20PM ET, based on DownDetector. SpaceX didn't acknowledged the outage until 4:05PM ET, via a post on the Starlink X account. Service began to come back for some at around 5:30PM ET, and Michael Nicolls, Starlink's VP of engineering, said the provider had \"mostly recovered\" at 6:23PM ET. Users across the US, Europe, the UK and Asia reported issues on r/starlink, the service's Reddit page, and SpaceX even acknowledged the outage on Starlink's website. The company hasn't shared the number of people who were actually impacted, but it could be in the millions — as of the last Starlink network update, the service has over six million active customers globally. The initial announcement that SpaceX was working on a fix didn't explain what cause the outage or what was being done to restore service. \"Starlink is currently in a network outage and we are actively implementing a solution,\" the company's X post said. \"We appreciate your patience, we'll share an update once this issue is resolved.\" Starlink is currently in a network outage and we are actively implementing a solution. We appreciate your patience, we'll share an update once this issue is resolved.— Starlink (@Starlink) July 24, 2025 In announcing the service's recovery, Nicolls explained that the outage was due to a \"failure of key internal software services that operate the core network,\" rather than any issue with SpaceX's satellite constellation or other hardware problems. Nicolls added that Starlink will \"fully root cause this issue and ensure it does not occur again. Starlink has now mostly recovered from the network outage, which lasted approximately 2.5 hours. The outage was due to failure of key internal software services that operate the core network. We apologize for the temporary disruption in our service; we are deeply committed to… https://t.co/ffFYM1Z7tD— Michael Nicolls (@michaelnicollsx) July 24, 2025 Starlink is designed to be accessible where traditional service providers can't reach, making it a common option for van lifers and anyone living without traditional internet infrastructure. SpaceX has also partnered with companies like T-Mobile to use Starlink to extend smartphone connectivity outside the bounds of traditional cell networks. It's not clear how T-Mobile's Starlink service was impacted as by the outage. Update, July 24, 6:30PM ET: Article has been updated to reflect that Starlink service is restored.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-outage-service-returns-after-over-two-hours-down-204002942.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Current and former members of the FDA told CNN about issues with the Elsa generative AI tool unveiled by the federal agency last month. Three employees said that in practice, Elsa has hallucinated nonexistent studies or misrepresented real research. \"Anything that you don't have time to double-check is unreliable,\" one source told the publication. \"It hallucinates confidently.\" Which isn't exactly ideal for a tool that's supposed to be speeding up the clinical review process and aiding with making efficient, informed decisions to benefit patients. Leadership at the FDA appeared unfazed by the potential problems posed by Elsa. \"I have not heard those specific concerns,\" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told CNN. He also emphasized that using Elsa and participating in the training to use it are currently voluntary at the agency. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told Engadget that \"the information provided by FDA to CNN was mischaracterized and taken out of context.\" The spokesperson also claimed that CNN led its story with \"disgruntled former employees and sources who have never even used the current version of Elsa.\" The agency claims to have guardrails and guidance for how its employees can use the tool, but its statement doesn’t address that Elsa, like any AI platform, can and will deliver incorrect or incomplete information at times. We have not yet received a response to our request for additional details. The CNN investigation highlighting these flaws with the FDA's artificial intelligence arrived on the same day as the White House introduced an \"AI Action Plan.\" The program presented AI development as a technological arms race that the US should win at all costs, and it laid out plans to remove \"red tape and onerous regulation\" in the sector. It also demanded that AI be free of \"ideological bias,\" or in other words, only following the biases of the current administration by removing mentions of climate change, misinformation, and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Considering each of those three topics has a documented impact on public health, the ability of tools like Elsa to provide genuine benefits to both the FDA and to US patients looks increasingly doubtful. Update, July 24, 2025, 6:35PM ET: Added a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/fda-employees-say-the-agencys-elsa-generative-ai-hallucinates-entire-studies-203547157.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Scientists at the University of Maryland are developing ErythroMer, a freeze-dried artificial blood substitute made from hemoglobin encased in fat bubbles, designed to be shelf-stable for years and reconstituted with water in emergencies. With promising animal trial results and significant funding from the Department of Defense, the team aims to begin human testing within two years. NPR reports: \"The No. 1 cause of preventable death on the battlefield is hemorrhage still today,\" says Col. Jeremy Pamplin, the project manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. \"That's a real problem for the military and for the civilian world.\" [Dr. Allan Doctor, a scientist at the University of Maryland working to develop the artificial blood substitute] is optimistic his team may be on the brink of solving that problem with ... ErythroMer. Doctor co-founded KaloCyte to develop the blood and serves on the board and as the firm's chief scientific officer. \"We've been able to successfully recapitulate all the functions of blood that are important for a resuscitation in a system that can be stored for years at ambient temperature and be used at the scene of an accident,\" he says. [...] Doctor's team has tested their artificial blood on hundreds of rabbits and so far it looks safe and effective. \"It would change the way that we could take care of people who are bleeding outside of hospitals,\" Doctor says. \"It'd be transformative.\" [...] While the results so far seem like cause for optimism, Doctor says he still needs to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that his artificial blood would be safe and effective for people. But he hopes to start testing it in humans within two years. A Japanese team is already testing a similar synthetic blood in people. \"I'm very hopeful,\" Doctor says. While promising, some experts remain cautious, noting that past attempts at artificial blood ultimately proved unsafe. \"I think it's a reasonable approach,\" says Tim Estep, a scientist at Chart Biotech Consulting who consults with companies developing artificial blood. \"But because this field has been so challenging, the proof will be in the clinical trials,\" he adds. \"While I'm overall optimistic, placing a bet on any one technology right now is overall difficult.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/07/24/2339237/intel-will-shed-24000-employees-this-year-retreat-in-germany-poland-costa-rica-and-ohio?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "Intel announced it will cut approximately 24,000 jobs in 2025 and cancel or scale back projects in Germany, Poland, Costa Rica, and Ohio as part of CEO Lip-Bu Tan's sweeping restructuring efforts. By the end of the year, the struggling chipmaker plans to have \"just around 75,000 'core employees' in total,\" according to The Verge. \"It's not clear if the layoffs will slow now that we're over halfway through the year, but Intel states today that it has already 'completed the majority of the planned headcount actions it announced last quarter to reduce its core workforce by approximately 15 percent.'\" From the report: Intel employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, of which 99,500 were \"core employees,\" so the company is pushing out around 24,000 people this year -- shrinking Intel by roughly one-quarter. (It has also divested other businesses, shrinking the larger organization as well.) [...] Today, on the company's earnings call, Intel's says that Intel had overinvested in new factories before it had secured enough demand, that its factories had become \"needlessly fragmented,\" and that it needs to grow its capacity \"in lock step\" with achieving actual milestones. \"I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come. Under my leadership, we will build what customers need when they need it, and earn their trust,\" says Tan. Now, in Germany and Poland, where Intel was planning to spend tens of billions of dollars respectively on \"mega-fabs\" that would employ 3,000 workers, and on an assembly and test facility that would employ 2,000 workers, the company will \"no longer move forward with planned projects\" and is apparently axing them entirely. Intel has had a presence in Poland since 1993, however, and the company did not say its R\u0026D facilities there are closing. (Intel had previously pressed pause on the new Germany and Poland projects \"by approximately two years\" back in 2024.) In Costa Rica, where Intel employs over 3,400 people, the company will \"consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into its larger sites in Vietnam.\" Metzger tells The Verge that over 2,000 Costa Rica employees should remain to work in engineering and corporate, though. The company is also cutting back in Ohio: \"Intel will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure spending is aligned with market demand.\" Intel CFO David Zinsner says Intel will continue to make investments there, though, and construction will continue.

    "description": "Swiss startup Jua has launched an AI-powered weather forecaster that it says beats leading models from tech giants — potentially making it the world’s most accurate weather forecasting system. Jua claims its model — dubbed EPT-2 — is faster and more accurate than both Microsoft’s Aurora and Google DeepMind’s Graphcast. In separate, peer-reviewed studies, both of those models were shown to be more accurate than the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)’s ENS forecast, widely regarded as the world leader. Jua backs up its bold claims with a new report, published today, that puts EPT-2 head-to-head with top-tier models…This story continues at The Next WebOr just read more coverage about: Google",

    "description": "Swedish AI startup Lovable says it has surpassed $100mn in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just eight months after launch. This makes it the fastest-ever software company to reach the milestone — eclipsing the historically rapid growth rates of companies such as Cursor and Wiz.  Lovable’s rise stems from the popularity of its generative AI platform. The system allows non-technical users to build apps or websites based on simple text prompts.  The platform is the brainchild of Anton Osika, who co-founded Lovable in 2023. “I decided what we needed to do is build for the 99% who do not create software,” he…This story continues at The Next Web",
