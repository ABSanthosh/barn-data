    "description": "The United Nations' Environmental Program has released a new report with yet more dire news about our odds of avoiding climate disaster caused by greenhouse gas emissions. According to this assessment, the current trajectory of international commitments will see the planet's temperature increasing 2.6 degrees Celsius or more over the course of this century. That amount of temperature change would lead to more catastrophic and life-threatening weather events. UN members are due to submit their latest Nationally Determined Contributions ahead of the COP30 conference in Brazil next year. The NDCs lay out each country's plan for reduced greenhouse gas emissions. One part of the NDCs are to reach the goal set by the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and one part targets keeping global temperature increases to within a less ideal 2 degrees Celsius. While the report says it is technically possible to reach the Paris Agreement goal, much larger actions will be required to cut emissions by the necessary amount.  \"Increased deployment of solar photovoltaic technologies and wind energy could deliver 27 percent of the total emission reduction potential in 2030 and 38 percent in 2035,\" the report gives as an example of what's still needed. \"Action on forests could deliver around 20 percent of the potential in both years.\" \"Every fraction of a degree avoided counts in terms of lives saved, economies protected, damages avoided, biodiversity conserved and the ability to rapidly bring down any temperature overshoot,\" UN Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen wrote in the report's forward. International collaboration, government commitments and financial contributions will also be essential for getting back on track to either the 2-degree or 1.5-degree goals. \"G20 nations, particularly the largest-emitting members, would need to do the heavy lifting,\" the report reads. If all of this sounds familiar, that's probably because the UN has issued the same stark warnings in each of its annual reports on emissions for several years now. And other reports have echoed their calls, such as damning findings earlier this year that just 57 companies are responsible for 80 percent of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/latest-un-report-demands-unprecedented-emissions-cuts-to-salvage-climate-goals-223450262.html?src=rss",

    "description": "There’s time for one more Armageddon for Amazon’s Good Omens but not much. Amazon Prime Video announced that Good Omens would return for one final season last year, but TVLine reports it’s only going to have one 90-minute episode that will begin filming in Scotland soon. Amazon originally confirmed that author Neil Gaiman, who co-wrote the book upon which Good Omens is based with Discworld creator Terry Pratchett, will continue through the final season as the show’s executive producer, writer and showrunner. TVLine says Gaiman “contributed to the episode’s writing,” but “he will not work on the production.” Gaiman has stepped out of the spotlight and away from several projects based on his works since his sexual assault allegations surfaced in July. The Tortoise Media podcast Master: The Allegations Against Neil Gaiman outlined the author’s alleged behavior with accounts from four women, one of whom signed a non-disclosure agreement. A fifth woman later stepped forward with similar accusations on the podcast. Gaiman denied the allegations and said he was “disturbed” by them, according to Rolling Stone. The allegations paused pre-production for Good Omens’ third season. Gaiman also offered to step away from the show in September, according to Deadline. Good Omens stars Michael Sheen as the angelic, fussy angel Aziraphale and David Tennant as the free-wheeling demon Crowley who formed an unlikely alliance to prevent the coming of the Antichrist and the fall of humankind. The dramatic comedy started as a limited series on Amazon’s streaming network in 2019 but the show’s popularity prompted a second season in 2020 with an expanded cast including Jon Hamm as the archangel Gabriel.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/good-omens-final-season-will-have-only-one-episode-212956591.html?src=rss",

    "description": "MojoKid writes: Intel has lifted the embargo on independent reviews of its new Core Ultra 200S series Arrow Lake-S processors, which mark a shift in its desktop CPU strategy with symmetrical core/thread counts (no Hyperthreading) and a dedicated 13 TOPS NPU. This series features a disaggregated tiled design for the first time in Intel's desktop chips, focusing on efficiency and power reduction. The Core Ultra 5 245, priced around $300, and the Ultra 9 285K at $589 deliver strong performance, particularly in creator workloads, competing well with AMD's Ryzen CPUs, while the Ultra 9 285K's price undercuts AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X significantly. While gaming performance shows slight regression in spots, the new chips are much more power-efficient than their predecessors. Overall, the platform offers leading-edge features, competitive pricing, and solid performance for creators, gamers and workstation pros. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: Smashing, a new app curating the best of the web from Goodreads co-founder Otis Chandler, is now available to the public. Like Goodreads, the app aims to create a community around content. But this time, instead of books, the focus is on web content -- like news articles, blog posts, social media posts, podcasts, and more. In addition, Smashing is introducing an AI Questions feature that allows you to engage with the content being shared in different ways, including by viewing a news story from different perspectives or asking the AI to poke holes in the story, among other things. By viewing different angles of a story, you can see how both the political left and right view the subject. Or, in the case of a company's stock, you might be presented with both the bull and bear case. There are a good handful of AI prompts available at launch, notes Chandler, and not all will make sense to use on every news story or piece of content. For instance, there's a silly \"make it funny\" prompt, and others that can simplify the story, display a timeline, or introduce \"unconventional\" takes that may involve thinking outside the box, helping you weigh ideas you hadn't considered yet. You can also ask your own questions, if you prefer. On the app, users are able to create multiple interest feeds to stay informed about the topics that matter to them, like politics, investing, parenting, health and wellness, and more, or even narrower interests like specific companies, sports teams, crypto, climate change, or other subtopics. The app also leverages AI to surface content from around the web and then match it to an individual reader based on what articles they tend to read, what subtopics they like, and what's already popular in the community, as determined by upvotes and downvotes. Combined, the signals tune Smashing to a user's particular interests. As part of the AI Questions feature, Smashing is also introducing AI-powered Story Overview pages, which offer grouped articles, blog posts, and social media posts all about the same story.

If the government goes ahead and is successful in the courts, it could mean the company being split into separate entities – a search engine, an advertising company, a video website, a mapping app – which would not be allowed to share data with each other. While this is still a distant prospect, it is being considered in the wake of a series of rulings in the US and the EU which suggest that regulators are…This story continues at The Next Web",

    "description": "In a simulation of Mars, a space rover is testing a control system with an unusual inspiration: insect brains. The software was created by Opteran, a startup based in the UK. But the idea originated from research on bugs. Scientists at the University of Sheffield had been studying the brains of insects. They discovered remarkable neurological efficiency. A honeybee’s brain, for instance, only contains about 1 million neurons. A human brain, by contrast, has around 86 billion. But the bee mind’s tiny size belies its impressive power. It’s capable of complex navigation, obstacle avoidance, and communication. It also functions with formidable energy…This story continues at The Next Web",
