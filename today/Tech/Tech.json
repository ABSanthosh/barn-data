    "description": "Roblox has adopted several new policies designed to give parents control over how their children use the sprawling online game platform. Bloomberg reported that the company has created a new type of parental account so that a guardian can oversee their kids' online activities and friends. Roblox is also now requiring parent permission for users under age 13 to access certain features. Users age 9 and younger will also need permission in order to access game modes with moderate violence or crude humor. The publication said these changes are slated to go into effect next month. Concerns about safety for young players have been a recurring issue for Roblox. The platform faced a lawsuit claiming exploitation of a minor in 2022. Sony was reluctant to host the game on its hardware over questions of whether Roblox exposed children to inappropriate sexual content, and the same justification led to a ban in Turkey earlier this year. Hindenburg Research recently released an expos√© about predatory behavior as well as misleading financial activity at Roblox (although that source has a shaky reputation of its own). An investigation by Bloomberg Businessweek found that at least two dozen people have been arrested by US law enforcement since 2018 for abusing or abducting child victims they met on Roblox.

    "description": "One of Tesla‚Äôs biggest downsides has always been the upfront cost of its electric vehicles versus gas models. The cheapest car it currently sells is $42,490 before subsidies, and the average Kelley Blue Book starting price of its 2024 models is just over $63,000. Tesla wrote in its third-quarter disclosure report that it‚Äôs making ‚Äúpreparations‚Äù to offer new vehicles with ‚Äúmore affordable models.‚Äù The EV maker‚Äôs cost of goods sold per vehicle also came down to ‚Äúits lowest level ever‚Äù at $35,1000. ‚ÄúPlans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025,‚Äù the report reads. ‚ÄúThese vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.‚Äù Tesla also says it plans to ‚Äúbegin launching‚Äù its cheaper EV models ‚Äúin the first half of 2025.‚Äù That wording is still fairly loose, so there‚Äôs no guarantee that a new model will ship the same year. The other surprise in Tesla‚Äôs report came from the numbers. It turns out that despite setbacks like the Cybertruck‚Äôs fifth recall and a federal investigation into its EVs‚Äô Full Self-Driving feature, Tesla had a fairly robust third quarter. The carmaker‚Äôs net income rose by 8 percent to $2.51 billion and sales rose by 2 percent year-over-year. The news also ends its four-quarter streak of missed earnings targets.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-says-it-will-begin-launching-new-and-more-affordable-evs-next-year-215038050.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The Register's Laura Dobberstein reports: Huawei formally launched its home-brewed operating system, HarmonyOS NEXT, on Wednesday, marking its official separation from the Android ecosystem. Huawei declared it released and \"officially started public beta testing\" of the OS for some of its smartphones and tablets that run its own Kirin and Kunpeng chips. Unlike previous iterations of HarmonyOS, HarmonyOS NEXT no longer supports Android apps. Huawei maintains top Chinese outfits aren't deterred by that. It cited Meituan, Douyin, Taobao, Xiaohongshu, Alipay, and JD.com as among those who have developed native apps for the OS. In case you're not familiar, they're China's top shopping, payment, and social media apps. Huawei also claimed that at the time of its announcement, over 15,000 HarmonyOS native applications and meta-services were also launched. That's a nice number, but well short of the millions of apps found on the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. The Chinese tech player also revealed that the operating system has 110 million lines of code and claimed it improves the overall performance of mobile devices running it by 30 percent. It also purportedly increases battery life by 56 minutes and leaves an average of 1.5GB of memory for purposes other than running the OS. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from SecurityWeek.com: White hat hackers taking part in the Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 contest organized by Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) have earned half a million dollars on the first day of the event, for exploits targeting NAS devices, cameras, printers and smart speakers. The highest single reward, $100,000, was earned by Sina Kheirkhah of Summoning Team, who chained a total of nine vulnerabilities for an attack that went from a QNAP QHora-322 router to a TrueNAS Mini X storage device. Another exploit chain involving the QNAP QHora-322 and TrueNAS Mini X products was demonstrated by Viettel Cyber Security, but this team earned only $50,000. A significant reward was also earned by Jack Dates of RET2 Systems, who received $60,000 for hacking a Sonos Era 300 smart speaker. QNAP TS-464 and Synology DiskStation DS1823XS+ NAS device exploits earned $40,000 each for two different teams. Participants also successfully demonstrated exploits against the Lorex 2K WiFi, Ubiquity AI Bullet, and Synology TC500 cameras, and HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP 3301fdw and Canon imageCLASS MF656Cdw printers. These attempts earned the hackers between $11,000 and $30,000. According to ZDI, a total of $516,250 was paid out on the first day of Pwn2Own Ireland for over 50 unique vulnerabilities.

Features: Automatically generates written or spoken text from structured data Can be integrated with a wide range of data sources Can be used for a variety of applications such as creating reports, summaries, and explanations Provides an API and a user-friendly interface Pros: Can automate the process of creating written or spoken content Can help users create more accurate and consistent content Can help users save time by automating repetitive tasks Can be integrated with a wide range of data sources Cons: The quality of the generated content may vary depending on the data source The generated content may not always be optimal or efficient The system may not be able to handle complex tasks Dependence on the tool may lead to a lack of understanding of the data if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); Overall, Compose AI's NLG software can be a useful tool for automating the process of creating written or spoken content from structured data. However, the quality of the generated content may vary depending on the data source, and it is essential to review the generated content before using it in a production environment. It is important to use the tool as an aid, not a replacement for the understanding of the data. Conclusion AI tools are becoming increasingly important in today's business and technology landscape. They are designed to automate repetitive tasks, improve workflow, and increase productivity. The top 10 AI tools included in this article are some of the most advanced and widely used in the market, and are suitable for various applications.

In 2023, he said there was less misinformation on the platform because of his efforts to tackle the bots. But others disagree, claiming that misinformation is still rife there.
