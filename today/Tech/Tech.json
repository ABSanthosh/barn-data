    "description": "Evan Feinman, who directed the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program meant to bring high-speed internet access to rural areas, exited the role on Friday after he was not reappointed for a new term, according to ProPublica‚Äôs Craig Silverman. In an email sent to staffers, which Silverman shared screenshots of on Bluesky, Feinman warned against changes proposed by the new administration that could ‚Äúbenefit technology that delivers slower speeds at higher costs to the household paying the bill‚Äù in order to line Elon Musk's pockets. BEAD was established in 2021, and the new Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick recently announced that the Commerce Department would be overhauling the program, which he said has ‚Äúnot connected a single person to the internet‚Äù due to the previous administration's handling of it. In a statement, Lutnick called for a ‚Äútech-neutral stance,‚Äù which would do away with the preference for faster fiber connections and open the door for a shift toward satellite internet like that offered by Elon Musk‚Äôs Starlink. Lutnick also slammed ‚Äúwoke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations.‚Äù In the email shared on Sunday, Feinman urged colleagues to speak up in favor of removing ‚Äúneedless requirements,‚Äù but warned against a shift away from fiber. The bottom line is, he wrote: The new administration seems to want to make changes that ignore the clear direction laid out by Congress, reduce the number of American homes and businesses that get fiber connections, and increase the number that get satellite connections. The degree of that shift remains unknown, but regardless of size, it will be a disservice to rural and small-town America. Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world‚Äôs richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/director-of-rural-broadband-program-exits-with-a-warning-about-shift-to-worse-satellite-internet-223204374.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If ever a game presents me with an opportunity to perform completely absurd aerial tricks, you best believe I will be flipping as much as possible. In¬†Jump Truck, a 3D solo racing game for Playdate by Tabortop Games, flips can work either to your benefit or detriment as you try to score the fastest finish time for each of a series of race tracks. Throwing in some flips may help to shave several seconds off your final time, but it could also send your truck hurtling into the abyss. It‚Äôs a delicate balance that I‚Äôve been having a real hoot pushing to its limit. Jump Truck features seven levels made up of straightaways, tight turns, long winding roads, ramps and short platforms with abrupt dropoffs to navigate at high speeds on your way to the floating vortex that serves as the finish line. You need to find the shortcuts to get the gold, and successfully making use of those often requires clearing huge gaps. That‚Äôs where flipping really comes in handy. Frontflips will give you more speed and help you cross greater distances in the air, while backflips will slow you down so you don‚Äôt overshoot your landing. You can flip using either the D-pad or the crank, but the latter can be pretty hard to coordinate if you want to seamlessly resume driving and steering. There are a bunch of silly achievements to unlock as you progress (or die over and over), like the ‚ÄúSoar Like an Eagle‚Äù award for spending a quarter of your time flying through the air on any given level. Jump Truck seems like it‚Äôd be the type of game that only holds your attention for a little while at a time, but I keep getting sucked into it for much longer than I expect to, thanks to the challenge of trying to hit certain shortcuts. It‚Äôs unexpectedly addicting. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-playdate-game-jump-truck-is-a-flippin-good-time-203140598.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman \"recently told Entrepreneur magazine that almost five years of remote work has 'been fantastic for us,'\" writes the Seattle Times. Zillow shifted to allowing people to work fully remote during the pandemic. It's been a recruiting and retention tool for Zillow as they \"now see four times the number of job applicants for every job we have versus what we did before the pandemic,\" Wacksman said. While Zillow still lists its corporate headquarters as Seattle, the company bills itself as \"cloud-headquartered,\" with remote workers and satellite offices. Wacksman's comments are backed by serious real estate moves the company has made over the past five years. An annual report detailing Zillow's financial results for 2024 shows its Seattle headquarters and offices across the country are shrinking. In 2019, Zillow had 386,275 square feet of office space in Seattle after steadily gobbling up floors of the Russell Investments Center downtown over the prior five years. The company reported it had 113,470 square feet in Seattle at the end of 2024... The company has drastically cut costs by shedding offices. Zillow's total leasing costs reached $54 million in 2022 and dropped to $34 million last year... It expects those costs to decrease even further, to $18 million by 2029. Zillow is also taking advantage of subleasing some of its office space and expects $26 million in sublease income between 2025 and 2030... Zillow's financial results from last year suggest the workforce has been productive while logging in from home. The company reported Tuesday that it beat Wall Street expectations for the last three months of 2024 with a quarterly revenue of $554 million. Wacksman said in a news release Tuesday that 2024 was a \"remarkable year for Zillow,\" as it reached its goal of double-digit revenue growth. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "link": "https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/03/16/2226230/intels-stock-jumps-188---but-whats-in-its-future?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "Intel's stock jumped nearly 19% this week. \"However, in the past year through Wednesday's close, Intel stock had fallen 53%,\" notes Investor's Business Daily: The appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO is a \"good start\" but Intel has significant challenges, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a client note. Those challenges include delays in its server chip product line, a very competitive PC chip market, lack of a compelling AI chip offering, and over $10 billion in losses in its foundry business over the past 12 months. There is \"no quick fix\" for those issues, he said. \"There are things you can do,\" a Columbia business school associate professor tells the Wall Street Journal in a video interview, \"but it's going to be incremental, and it's going to be extremely risky... They will try to be competitive in the foundry manufacturing space,\" but \"It takes very aggressive investments.\" Meanwhile, TSMC is exploring a joint venture where they'd operate Intel's factories, even pitching the idea to AMD, Nvidia, Broadcam, and Qualcomm, according to Reuters. (They add that Intel \"reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986,\" and talked to multiple sources \"familiar with\" talks about Intel's future). Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division. Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source. Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources. \"They say Lip-Bu Tan is the best hope to fix Intel ‚Äî if Intel can be fixed at all,\" writes the Wall Street Journal: He brings two decades of semiconductor industry experience, relationships across the sector, a startup mindset and an obsession with AI...and basketball. He also comes with tricky China business relationships, underscoring Silicon Valley's inability to sever itself from one of America's top adversaries... [Intel's] stock has lost two-thirds of its value in four short years as Intel sat out the AI boom... Manufacturing chips is an enormous expense that Intel can't currently sustain, say industry leaders and analysts. Former board members have called for a split-up. But a deal to sell all or part of Intel to competitors seems to be off the table for the immediate future, according to bankers. A variety of early-stage discussions with Broadcom, Qualcomm, GlobalFoundries and TSMC in recent months have failed to go anywhere, and so far seem unlikely to progress. The company has already hinted at a more likely outcome: bringing in outside financial backers, including customers who want a stake in the manufacturing business... Tan has likely no more than a year to turn the company around, said people close to the company. His decades of investing in startups and running companies ‚Äî he founded a multinational venture firm and was CEO of chip design company Cadence Design Systems for 13 years ‚Äî provide indications of how Tan will tackle this task in the early days: by cutting expenses, moving quickly and trying to turn Intel back into an engineering-first company. \"In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog,\" Tan said in a note to Intel employees on Wednesday. \"And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace....\" Many take this culture reset to also mean significant cuts at Intel, which already shed about 15,000 jobs last year. \"He is brave enough to adjust the workforce to the size needed for the business today,\" said Reed Hundt, a former Intel board member who has known Tan since the 1990s.
