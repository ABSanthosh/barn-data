    "description": "If you’ve been on the fence about buying the urban landscape sim Cities: Skyline II (and given the response following its launch, who could blame you?), here’s your chance to take it for a free test run. Paradox Interactive announced on Bluesky that players can play the city building game for free for a limited time. Cities: Skylines II is available to play from now until December 9. The free version is available to download and play for free on Steam and GeForce NOW. Colossal Order and Paradox’s sequel to its hit city construction experience got off to a very rocky start more than a year ago. Despite having a dedicated base of fans who provided a lot of insight into the development of Cities: Skylines II, the response to its release was far from positive. Fans were upset that Cities: Skyline II only launched on PC instead of a simultaneous PC and console release. There was also criticism over the increased spec requirements a month before the game’s launch. Players with powerful PCs experienced problems with the game even months after the initial release. Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen wrote a blog post the following January describing a “growing tendency of toxicity in our community, something we have not experienced to this extent before.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/cities-skylines-ii-is-free-to-play-until-december-9-002023815.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-great-movie-good-game-000029449.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has no business being as entertaining as it is. Outside of the superhero genre, there aren’t many high-quality licensed games out there, and this one comes with decades of film lore to live up to. And, frankly, it’s a little bit of a mess on Xbox Series S. Some of its scenes are stunning, but it’s also infested with resolution issues, mechanical glitches and silly animation bugs. In most other games, the combination of these problems would make me throw down the controller and uninstall. And yet, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is endlessly endearing. The game’s tone is pitch-perfect, it offers moments of earnest beauty and Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impersonation is a treat to witness, let alone embody. In fact, every actor in the game is fabulous, and its writing, audio and direction feel like classic Spielberg and Lucas fare — but this time it’s all in first-person, interactive form, courtesy of Wolfenstein studio MachineGames. I can’t speak highly enough of the writing in The Great Circle. Indy feels like an authentic extension of the film character, and his sassy remarks and dad-like frustration spill out in hilarious bursts throughout the game. His companion, Gina, is just as witty, mysterious and independent as Dr. Jones himself, expertly portrayed by actor Alessandra Mastronardi. The main bad boy, a Nazi archaeologist named Emmerich Voss (played by Marios Gavrilis), is supremely unsettling as he manipulates his troops and monologues at his captors, every word dripping with a dark sense of entitlement.  The story is set in 1937 between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, and it takes players to Rome, Giza, The Himalayas, Shanghai and the ancient kingdom of Sukhothai in north-central Thailand, on a quest to save the world from an old and powerful magic. Of course, it also involves punching lots of Nazis right in their stupid faces. Bethesda Softworks There are moments in The Great Circle where the music, environment, lighting and writing converge to create a memorable vignette, such as Indy’s first real conversation with Gina on a balcony in the Vatican. They banter back and forth as a Nazi airship docks on a domed turret behind them, afternoon sun glinting off gold roofs, and the music reacts to their strategizing and flirting with small trills. For a second, the game feels indistinguishable from a classic Indiana Jones movie, and it’s a real joy. There are a few cutscenes and gameplay bits that feel like this in The Great Circle, though there are just as many that look less polished on Series S, with stilted animations and too-harsh lighting. The writing and tone, however, is consistently top-notch. It almost feels like two studios made this game, and one of them was much better at taking advantage of the Xbox Series S hardware. The visual disparity is odd, with animation and resolution quality shifting from scene to scene. In between gorgeous set pieces, there are sequences that look like a remake of a game from the Xbox 360 era. It’s strange. However, I imagine playing on Xbox Series X or a capable PC would boost the resolution and stability nicely. Mechanically, the game is also hit-or-miss. Combat relies mainly on hand-to-hand fights, and while there are guns, they’re generally not the strongest weapon at Indy’s disposal. His whip is useful for stunning, creating distance and pulling enemies closer for a punch, and he’s able to pick up items like shovels, candlesticks, bottles and batons to use as projectiles or melee weapons. Random one-on-one fights against Nazis and fascists play out fine, with solid-sounding punches and sharp whip cracks, but the scripted melee battles tend to feel stagnant. Enemies don’t have a health bar and there’s little indication of how much damage Indy is inflicting at any given time. Dodging is a key element in these fights and it’s not the most responsive or forgiving system; inputs feel laggy or ineffective at times, and enemies are allowed to power up big hits even while they’re being punched. Bethesda Softworks Combat might be sluggish, but I had a great time playing The Great Circle as a stealth experience, crouching to sneak past Nazis and fascist guards like a fedora-wearing ghost. Stealth is a valid option in basically every scenario and it’s a simple, effective mechanic. Stay out of enemies’ sight lines, don’t shine lights in their direction and stay crouched, and you’re good to go. There’s usually enough time to adjust your position if you’re spotted, and guards are quick to move on once you’re properly hidden again. I truly enjoyed mapping out sneaky attack routes and then weaving between guards, throwing bottles every now and then as distractions. It’s kind of absurd when Gina tags along in these missions because she’s so, so awful at being stealthy, but the game never punishes you for the NPC’s missteps. Just enjoy the ridiculousness of your extremely obvious companion and keep slinking along. Puzzles are a major component of the game and they’re perfectly adequate. None of them stand out as being particularly challenging or innovative, but they’re built on clever ideas and executed well. There are light-reflecting puzzles, matching games, spatial-awareness tests and simple logic riddles, and they’re always finished with a cool item or a dramatic reveal. I may have missed some more advanced puzzles in the sidequests, and now that I’ve finished the main line I’m tempted to go back in and see what I missed, which is surely a sign of a successful game. Bethesda Softworks Exploration is The Great Circle’s most critical mechanic and thankfully, it feels great. Indy can climb and swing across gaps using his whip, and there are plenty of ledges, boulders, ladders and scaffolding to scale. Secrets, side missions and rewards are secreted around the maps, and curiosity is richly rewarded at every turn. Missions take Indy and Gina to snowy mountain peaks and down to murky, monster-filled waters, and there are moments of real terror and true beauty to be found. The game’s world feels alive, and it makes great use of vertical space. If you ever feel stuck in an area, just look up — that is, if you can. I encountered one game-breaking bug in The Great Circle. I was about 80 percent through the story, and I boarded a boat in the gunner seat as enemies raced us down the river and shot at us from the shores. I was unable to move the camera up and down, but I figured this was a weird restriction of the gunner mechanic. However, it persisted even after I stepped off the boat and entered the following scenes. I was unable to see climbing opportunities, never mind the problems with combat, sneaking and interacting. I tried restarting the game and the console to no avail, and I finally had to restore an old save and replay about 30 minutes of content. This worked, but the experience made me feel slightly crazy and a little sad (so, not too different from my baseline). Bethesda Softworks The feelings of unease didn’t last long, because I soon found myself trading punches and insults with a Nazi karate master in the middle of a raucous thunderstorm — you know, Indiana Jones shit. This was the cadence of my playthrough: Moments of satisfying climbing, puzzle and stealth gameplay interrupted by supremely silly glitches. What makes these bugs funny, rather than frustrating, is the game’s tone, writing and acting. With The Great Circle, MachineGames leans into the easy charm of Indiana Jones, highlighting his snark and the wild, unbelievable scenarios expected in popcorn action flicks. This game would make a great movie. And maybe that’s the thing about The Great Circle. MachineGames made a fabulous, classic-feeling Indiana Jones film, but they could’ve polished the game aspects a little more. So, set your expectations accordingly. Roll with the bugs, soak up the narrative, find all the secrets, and take a moment to laugh at Gina’s ludicrous running animation when she’s dressed as a nun.

    "description": "Today a group of German scientists presented data suggesting Earth is absorbing more sunlight than in the past, reports Ars Technica, \"largely due to reduced cloud cover.\" We can measure both the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun and how much energy it radiates back into space.... The new paper finds that the energy imbalance set a new high in 2023, with a record amount of energy being absorbed by the ocean/atmosphere system. This wasn't accompanied by a drop in infrared emissions from the Earth, suggesting it wasn't due to greenhouse gases, which trap heat by absorbing this radiation. Instead, it seems to be due to decreased reflection of incoming sunlight by the Earth.... Using two different data sets, the teams identify the areas most effected by this, and they're not at the poles, indicating loss of snow and ice are unlikely to be the cause. Instead, the key contributor appears to be the loss of low-level clouds [particularly over the Atlantic ocean]... The drop in low-level clouds had been averaging about 1.3 percent per decade. 2023 saw a slightly larger drop occur in just one year.... So, what could be causing the clouds to go away? The researchers list three potential factors. One is simply the variability of the climate system, meaning 2023 might have just been an extremely unusual year, and things will revert to trends in the ensuing years. The second is the impact of aerosols, which both we and natural processes emit in copious quantities. These can help seed clouds, so a reduction of aerosols (driven by things like pollution control measures) could potentially account for this effect. The most concerning potential explanation, however, is that there may be a feedback relationship between rising temperatures and low-level clouds. Meaning that, as the Earth warms, the clouds become sparse, enhancing the warming further. That would be bad news for our future climate, because it suggests that the lower range of warming estimates would have to be adjusted upward to account for it. If the decline in reflectivity wasn't just caused by normal variability, the researchers warn, \"the 2023 extra heat may be here to stay...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Wednesday Cuba's energy grid collapsed, \"leaving millions without power,\" CNN reported, calling it \"the latest in a series of failures on an island struggling from creaking infrastructure, natural disasters and economic turmoil.\" Today Reuters reports: Cuba said it had reconnected its national electrical grid on Thursday, though generation remained well below demand one day after a plant failure knocked out power to millions across the island... Around half of Cuba's power generation facilities are offline for maintenance or broken down. All are decades old and producing well under capacity. As a result, a majority of Cuba's residents suffer hours-long, rolling blackouts on a daily basis even when the grid is functional. Cuba's electrical grid has been on the brink of collapse for years, as fuel shortages, a string of natural disasters and an economic crisis have left the island's government unable to maintain the system's decrepit infrastructure. Dwindling oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico tipped the system into full crisis this year, leading to several nationwide blackouts that have sparked unrest and increasing anger among the population. The blackouts, together with food, medicine and water shortages, have vastly complicated life on the island and driven a record-breaking exodus of its residents since 2020. Authorities informed Cuba's citizens that scheduled power outages will now resume, reports ABC News. \"Cuban authorities said they will continue their current practice of implementing daily, five-hour power outages by block or zone as they have been doing for the past few months.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
