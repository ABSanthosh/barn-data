    "description": "As is tradition, LG is announcing several of its new OLED monitors before CES 2025 kickoffs in earnest. The new UltraGear GX9 series all feature curved WOLED panels, webOS and an anti-glare, low reflection coating that should make them pleasant to look at wherever your desk is stationed. LG is positioning the 45GX990A or LG UltraGear OLED Bendable Gaming Monitor as the star of this new lineup. It's a 45-inch, 5K2K bendable screen that can move \"from completely flat to a 900R curvature within seconds,\" according to LG. Like the 32-inch UltraGear OLED LG introduced in 2023, this new model has the company's Dual Mode feature for quickly toggling between resolutions and refresh rates with the push of a button, along with a 0.03ms GtG response time for smoother visuals when you do decide to play games. LG If you'd prefer a screen that doesn't move, the LG UltraGear OLED Gaming Monitor (45GX950A) gives you the same 45-inches of screen real estate along with a 21:9 format, 5K2K resolution, and ultra slim bezels. LG says the monitor also supports DisplayPort 2.1, HDMI2.1 and USB-C with 90W power delivery, and certified to work with AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA G-Sync.  For a smaller (and likely more affordable) option, the LG UltraGear 39GX90SA still gets you a curved display, but in a 39-inch size with a 21:9 aspect ratio. The monitors OLED panel means you'll get \"nuanced colors and deep, dark blacks,\" according to LG, and the multiple USB-C ports means you'll actually be able to connect the 39GX90SA to multiple devices at once. Having a smaller option might be a good thing too — finding extra desk space for last year's LG 49 UltraGear gaming monitor was one of the biggest problems with it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/lgs-new-ultragear-lineup-includes-a-bendable-5k-oled-010028431.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Hackers were reportedly able to modify several Chrome extensions with malicious code this month after gaining access to admin accounts through a phishing campaign. The cybersecurity company Cyberhaven shared in a blog post this weekend that its Chrome extension was compromised on December 24 in an attack that appeared to be “targeting logins to specific social media advertising and AI platforms.” A few other extensions were hit as well, going back to mid-December, Reuters reported. According to Nudge Security’s Jaime Blasco, that includes ParrotTalks, Uvoice and VPNCity. Cyberhaven notified its customers on December 26 in an email seen by TechCrunch, which advised them to revoke and rotate their passwords and other credentials. The company’s initial investigation of the incident found that the malicious extension targeted Facebook Ads users, with a goal of stealing data such as access tokens, user IDs and other account information, along with cookies. The code also added a mouse click listener. “After successfully sending all the data to the [Command \u0026 Control] server, the Facebook user ID is saved to browser storage,” Cyberhaven said in its analysis. “That user ID is then used in mouse click events to help attackers with 2FA on their side if that was needed.” Cyberhaven said it first detected the breach on December 25 and was able to remove the malicious version of the extension within an hour. It’s since pushed out a clean version.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/hackers-injected-malicious-code-into-several-chrome-extensions-in-recent-attack-220648155.html?src=rss",

Wicked 5. Dune: Part Two 4. Moana 2 3. Despicable Me 4 2. Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine 1. Inside Out 2 2024 was the year Godzilla celebrated its 70th year as a franchise — but it wasn't the only long-running franchise. \"When the Marvel Cinematic Universe went R-rated with Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine... it was literally more successful than any other R-rated movie in history,\" SlashFilm points out, while Venom: The Last Dance was the year's 9th highest-earner. (But several other big superhero movies flopped and \"the misses outweighed the hits this year, while DC sat it out entirely as the world waits for Superman to usher in James Gunn's new DC Universe.\") They also marvel that Wicked earned $572 million after opening on the same day as Ridley Scott's Gladiator II.... But in the end SlashFilm describes 2024 as \"a banner year for animation,\" with computer-animated movies filling four of the top ten spots (Kung Fu Panda 4, Moana 2, Despicable Me 4, and Inside Out 2). And another interesting trend? Though the world flocked to Tim Burton's first sequel to Beetlejuice after 36 years, Warner Bros. was, \"at one point, pushing for Beetlejuice 2 to go directly to streaming on Max.\" And Disney original had the same idea for Moana 2, leading SlashFilm to conclude that 2024's box office \"should be the death of the big direct-to-streaming movie.\" SlashFilm notes that Disney also sent several Pixar originals to Disney+ between 2020 and 2022, which \"did immeasurable damage to the brand, something that even CEO Bob Iger has acknowledged.\" And then after a theatrical debut Pixar's Inside Out 2 became \"the eighth biggest movie ever at the box office, with $1.698 billion to its name\" — and the highest-grossing animated film ever made. And Dune: Part Two? Denis Villeneuve accomplished nothing shy of a miracle with 2021's \"Dune,\" an adaptation of Frank Herbert's cherished sci-fi novel that was faithful to the material, massive in scale, but still felt like an auteur film... The only downside? 2021 was a terrible time to release a movie, particularly a Warner Bros. movie, as all of the studio's films were going to HBO Max the same day they hit theaters. Yet, \"Dune\" made $400 million in its original run, which was enough to justify a sequel. Evidently, the audience for this franchise grew exponentially in the years before \"Dune: Part Two\" hit theaters in early March... All told, Villeneuve's sweeping, epic sequel pulled in $714.4 million worldwide, all while garnering tons of acclaim once again. Also, not for nothing, Villeneuve got it made for less than $200 million... Without \"Dune: Part Two\" making what it made, the box office might have been in truly dire shape. As a relatively dead April and very weak May followed, this overperformance helped keep theaters afloat until greener pastures arrived in the back half of the year. The Spice must flow, as it were. The Hollywood Reporter offers another take on the significance of 2024: Total domestic box office revenue appears to be heading toward around $8 billion, down from 2023's exhilarating post-COVID turnaround of $9 billion, but the National Association of Theatre Owners prefers to accentuate the positive, attributing the dip to a shortage of product due to the labor strikes and taking encouragement from the renewal of the movie habit... Interestingly, or thankfully, the cinematic universes of Marvel, DC, and Star Wars failed to expand: except for Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, not one of the huge hits came from a comic book franchise or a galaxy far, far away. The article then complains about people using their phones during the movie for texting, talking, and photographing the movie itself. (Though it applauds a PSA against the practice in which Deadpool and Wolverine \"delivered the message in laudably blunt terms.\") And on Wikipedia, Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine and Dune: Part Two were the eighth and 23rd most popular articles of 2024.

    "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from the Wall Street Journal: The rich get richer — and older. People with high salaries and net worth tend to live longer lives, research shows. Once Americans make it to their late 50s, the wealthiest 10% live to a median age of around 86 years, roughly 14 years longer than the least wealthy 10%, according to a study published earlier this year in JAMA Internal Medicine. People with more money can afford healthier food, more healthcare and homes in safer, less-polluted neighborhoods, says Kathryn Himmelstein, a co-author of the study and a medical director at the Boston Public Health Commission. Though you can't add more months or years to your online shopping cart yet, health and aging researchers say there are ways to spend money to improve your chances of living longer. They suggest favoring purchases that help you track your health, stay active and reduce stress. \"We know the things that help us age better, and everyone's always disappointed when you tell them,\" says Andrew Scott, director of economics at the Ellison Institute of Technology in Oxford, England. \"Eat less and eat better, sleep more, exercise more and spend time with friends....\" But certain gadgets and luxuries can be worth the cost, some researchers say. Devices such as the Apple Watch and Oura Ring can instill healthy habits and catch worrying patterns that might emerge between annual checkups, says Joe Coughlin, the director of the MIT AgeLab... Coughlin says he once went to the emergency room because his Apple Watch detected a spike in his heart rate that he hadn't noticed himself. \"For the superwealthy, suddenly living longer and living better has become the new prestige,\" Coughlin says. Higher incomes correlate with longer lives, but there are diminishing returns. Each successive jump in pay is linked to smaller boosts in longevity, a 2016 study from the research group Opportunity Insights found... A key to the relationship between income and longevity is that money doesn't just buy stuff that helps you live longer. It also buys time and reduces stress. \"If you've got a nice place to live and you don't have to worry about food on the table, you have the mental head space and resources to prioritize your health,\" says Steven Woolf, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine... Moreover, many lower-income jobs are more physically taxing and more prone to workplace accidents and exposure to harmful substances. The article also includes examples of spending that promotes health, including things like home gym equipment and even swing-dancing lessons. But it also adds that \"plenty of things that are good for you don't come with a bill, such as going on a walk or minimizing screen time before bedtime.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

This consists of discarded electrical devices including laptops, smartphones, televisions, computer servers, washing machines, medical equipment, games consoles and much more. The amount of e-waste produced this decade could reach as much as 5 million metric tonnes, according to recent research published in Nature. This is around 1,000 times more e-waste than was produced in 2023. According to the study, the boom in artificial intelligence will significantly contribute to this e-waste problem, because AI requires lots of computing power and storage.

Tools now exist that offer instantaneous, high-quality results in improving certain operations without the burden of high costs or delays. In fact, generative AI could completely upend the traditional ways that we measure success in business. Generative AI refers to programs that produce high-quality text, images, ideas and even complex software code in response to prompts (questions or instructions) from a user.
