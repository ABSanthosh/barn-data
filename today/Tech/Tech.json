    "description": "After a couple years of having its open-source Llama AI model be just a part of its Connect conferences, Meta is breaking things out and hosting an entirely generative AI-focused developer conference called LlamaCon on April 29. The event is entirely virtual, and you'll be able to watch along live on the Meta for Developers Facebook page. LlamaCon kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT with a keynote address from Meta's Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, Vice President of AI Manohar Paluri and research scientist Angela Fan. The keynote is supposed to cover developments in the company's open-source AI community, \"the latest on the Llama collection of models and tools\" and offer a glimpse at yet-to-be released AI features. The keynote address will be followed by a conversation at 1:45PM ET / 10:45PM ET between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi on \"building AI-powered applications,\" followed by a chat at 7PM ET / 4PM PT about \"the latest trends in AI\" between Zuckerberg and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. It doesn't seem like either conversation will be used to break news, but Microsoft and Meta have collaborated before, so anything is possible. Meta hasn't traditionally waited for a conference to launch updates to Meta AI or the Llama model. The company introduced its new Llama 4 family of models, which excel at image understanding and document parsing, on a Saturday in early April. It's not clear what new models or products the company could have saved for LlamaCon. LlamaCon will stream live on April 29th through the Meta for Developers Facebook page and we'll be live-blogging the event right here on Engadget so you can get all the details as they happen.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/how-to-watch-llamacon-2025-metas-first-generative-ai-developer-conference-215241289.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Android tablet or foldable owners can now adjust the divider between Gmail's message list and conversation views. 9to5Google spotted the change, which arrived in version 2025.04.13.x of Gmail for Android. The update lets you drag your finger on the divider to dynamically change the sizes of the Gmail app's two panes: the list on the left with multiple messages and the pane on the right that shows individual emails and threads. Alternatively, you can drag the boundary to the display's edge to show only one or the other. The adjustable divider is also available in the Google Chat app for large-screen Android devices. The new feature is available to everyone with a personal Google or Google Workspace account in both apps.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/gmail-on-android-tablets-and-foldables-now-has-an-adjustable-layout-202111833.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/04/25/2139216/devs-sound-alarm-after-microsoft-subtracts-cc-extension-from-vs-code-forks?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "Some developers are \"crying foul\" after Microsoft's C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code stopped working with VS Code derivatives like VS Codium and Cursor, reports The Register. The move has prompted Cursor to transition to open-source alternatives, while some developers are calling for a regulatory investigation into Microsoft's alleged anti-competitive behavior. From the report: In early April, programmers using VS Codium, an open-source fork of Microsoft's MIT-licensed VS Code, and Cursor, a commercial AI code assistant built from the VS Code codebase, noticed that the C/C++ extension stopped working. The extension adds C/C++ language support, such as Intellisense code completion and debugging, to VS Code. The removal of these capabilities from competing tools breaks developer workflows, hobbles the editor, and arguably hinders competition. The breaking change appears to have occurred with the release of v1.24.5 on April 3, 2025. Following the April update, attempts to install the C/C++ extension outside of VS Code generate this error message: \"The C/C++ extension may be used only with Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Code, Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, and successor Microsoft products and services to develop and test your applications.\" Microsoft has forbidden the use of its extensions outside of its own software products since at least September 2020, when the current licensing terms were published. But it hasn't enforced those terms in its C/C++ extension with an environment check in its binaries until now. [...] Developers discussing the issue in Cursor's GitHub repo have noted that Microsoft recently rolled out a competing AI software agent capability, dubbed Agent Mode, within its Copilot software. One such developer who contacted us anonymously told The Register they sent a letter about the situation to the US Federal Trade Commission, asking them to probe Microsoft for unfair competition -- alleging self-preferencing, bundling Copilot without a removal option, and blocking rivals like Cursor to lock users into its AI ecosystem.

    "link": "https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/04/25/2129256/comcast-president-bemoans-broadband-customer-losses-we-are-not-winning?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon\u0026utm_medium=feed",
    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Comcast executives apparently realized something that customers have known and complained about for years: The Internet provider's prices aren't transparent enough and rise too frequently. This might not have mattered much to cable executives as long as the total number of subscribers met their targets. But after reporting a net loss of 183,000 residential broadband customers in Q1 2025, Comcast President Mike Cavanagh said the company isn't \"winning in the marketplace\" during an earnings call today. The Q1 2025 customer loss was over three times larger than the net loss in Q1 2024. While customers often have few viable options for broadband and the availability of alternatives varies widely by location, Comcast faces competition from fiber and fixed wireless ISPs. \"In this intensely competitive environment, we are not winning in the marketplace in a way that is commensurate with the strength of the network and connectivity products that I just described,\" Cavanagh said. \"[Cable division CEO] Dave [Watson] and his team have worked hard to understand the reasons for this disconnect and have identified two primary causes. One is price transparency and predictability and the other is the level of ease of doing business with us. The good news is that both are fixable and we are already underway with execution plans to address these challenges.\" [...] Cavanagh said that Comcast plans to make changes in marketing and operations \"with the highest urgency.\" This means that \"we are simplifying our pricing construct to make our price-to-value proposition clearer to consumers across all broadband segments,\" he said. Comcast last week announced a five-year price guarantee for broadband customers who sign up for a new package. Comcast said customers will get a \"simple monthly price starting as low as $55 per month,\" without having to enter a contract, giving them \"freedom and flexibility to cancel at any time without penalty.\" The five-year guarantee also comes with one year of Xfinity Mobile at no charge, Comcast said. [...] Additional offers are in the works, Cavanagh said. \"We are not done. Providing more value to our customers with less complexity and friction is a top priority and you will see our go-to-market approach continue to evolve over the coming months,\" he said. Comcast investors shouldn't expect an immediate turnaround, though. \"We anticipate that it will take several quarters for our new approach to gain traction and impact the business in a meaningful way,\" Cavanagh said.
