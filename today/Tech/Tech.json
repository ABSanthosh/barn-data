    "description": "Four years after Tesla filed a lawsuit against Rivian alleging that the company poached its employees with a goal of obtaining trade secrets, the two appear to be nearing a resolution. According to Bloomberg, Tesla says it’s reached a “conditional” settlement with Rivian and expects to seek the case’s dismissal by December 24. In the lawsuit filed in 2020, Tesla claimed Rivian encouraged exiting Tesla employees to steal information, and that it caught three employees taking “highly valuable, confidential information as they left for Rivian.” Rivian has denied the allegations from the start, calling them “baseless.” Rivian filed a motion for the lawsuit to be dismissed, but this was denied by a California judge who tentatively ruled earlier this year that Rivian would have to face a trial. The trial was expected to take place in 2025, but it now looks like the matter may be wrapped up before the end of the year without coming to that.

    "description": "Microsoft-owned GitHub published a blog post asking \"Does GitHub Copilot improve code quality? Here's what the data says.\" Its first paragraph includes statistics from past studies — that GitHub Copilot has helped developers code up to 55% faster, leaving 88% of developers feeling more \"in the flow\" and 85% feeling more confident in their code. But does it improve code quality? [W]e recruited 202 [Python] developers with at least five years of experience. Half were randomly assigned GitHub Copilot access and the other half were instructed not to use any AI tools... We then evaluated the code with unit tests and with an expert review conducted by developers. Our findings overall show that code authored with GitHub Copilot has increased functionality and improved readability, is of better quality, and receives higher approval rates... Developers with GitHub Copilot access had a 56% greater likelihood of passing all 10 unit tests in the study, indicating that GitHub Copilot helps developers write more functional code by a wide margin. In blind reviews, code written with GitHub Copilot had significantly fewer code readability errors, allowing developers to write 13.6% more lines of code, on average, without encountering readability problems. Readability improved by 3.62%, reliability by 2.94%, maintainability by 2.47%, and conciseness by 4.16%. All numbers were statistically significant... Developers were 5% more likely to approve code written with GitHub Copilot, meaning that such code is ready to be merged sooner, speeding up the time to fix bugs or deploy new features. \"While GitHub's reports have been positive, a few others haven't,\" reports Visual Studio magazine: For example, a recent study from Uplevel Data Labs said, \"Developers with Copilot access saw a significantly higher bug rate while their issue throughput remained consistent.\" And earlier this year a \"Coding on Copilot\" whitepaper from GitClear said, \"We find disconcerting trends for maintainability. Code churn — the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks after being authored — is projected to double in 2024 compared to its 2021, pre-AI baseline. We further find that the percentage of 'added code' and 'copy/pasted code' is increasing in proportion to 'updated,' 'deleted,' and 'moved 'code. In this regard, AI-generated code resembles an itinerant contributor, prone to violate the DRY-ness [don't repeat yourself] of the repos visited.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "June, 2023: \"Harvard Scholar Who Studies Honesty Is Accused of Fabricating Findings.\" November, 2024: \"The Business-School Scandal That Just Keeps Getting Bigger.\" A senior editor at the Atlantic raises the possibility of systemic dishonesty-rewarding incentives where \"a study must be even flashier than all the other flashy findings if its authors want to stand out,\" writing that \"More than a year since all of this began, the evidence of fraud has only multiplied.\" And the suspect isn't just Francesca Gino, a Harvard Business School professor. One person deeply affected by all this is Gino's co-author, a business school professor from the University of California at Berkeley — Juliana Schroeder — who launched an audit of all 138 studies conducted by Francesca Gino (called \"The Many Coauthors Project\"): Gino was accused of faking numbers in four published papers. Just days into her digging, Schroeder uncovered another paper that appeared to be affected — and it was one that she herself had helped write... The other main contributor was Alison Wood Brooks, a young professor and colleague of Gino's at Harvard Business School.... If Brooks did conduct this work and oversee its data, then Schroeder's audit had produced a dire twist. The Many Co-Authors Project was meant to suss out Gino's suspect work, and quarantine it from the rest... But now, to all appearances, Schroeder had uncovered crooked data that apparently weren't linked to Gino.... Like so many other scientific scandals, the one Schroeder had identified quickly sank into a swamp of closed-door reviews and taciturn committees. Schroeder says that Harvard Business School declined to investigate her evidence of data-tampering, citing a policy of not responding to allegations made more than six years after the misconduct is said to have occurred... In the course of scouting out the edges of the cheating scandal in her field, Schroeder had uncovered yet another case of seeming science fraud. And this time, she'd blown the whistle on herself. That stunning revelation, unaccompanied by any posts on social media, had arrived in a muffled update to the Many Co-Authors Project website. Schroeder announced that she'd found \"an issue\" with one more paper that she'd produced with Gino... [Schroeder] said that the source of the error wasn't her. Her research assistants on the project may have caused the problem; Schroeder wonders if they got confused... What feels out of reach is not so much the truth of any set of allegations, but their consequences. Gino has been placed on administrative leave, but in many other instances of suspected fraud, nothing happens. Both Brooks and Schroeder appear to be untouched. \"The problem is that journal editors and institutions can be more concerned with their own prestige and reputation than finding out the truth,\" Dennis Tourish, at the University of Sussex Business School, told me. \"It can be easier to hope that this all just goes away and blows over and that somebody else will deal with it....\" [Tourish also published a 2019 book decrying \"Fraud, Deception and Meaningless Research,\" which the article notes \"cites a study finding that more than a third of surveyed editors at management journals say they've encountered fabricated or falsified data.\"] Maybe the situation in her field would eventually improve, [Schroeder] said. \"The optimistic point is, in the long arc of things, we'll self-correct, even if we have no incentive to retract or take responsibility.\" \"Do you believe that?\" I asked. \"On my optimistic days, I believe it.\" \"Is today an optimistic day?\" \"Not really.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); Overall, Compose AI's NLG software can be a useful tool for automating the process of creating written or spoken content from structured data. However, the quality of the generated content may vary depending on the data source, and it is essential to review the generated content before using it in a production environment. It is important to use the tool as an aid, not a replacement for the understanding of the data. Conclusion AI tools are becoming increasingly important in today's business and technology landscape.
