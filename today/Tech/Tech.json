    "description": "Last month at Meta Connect, Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta AI was “on track” to become the most-used generative AI assistant in the world. The company has now passed a significant milestone toward that goal, with Meta AI passing the 500 million user mark, Zuckerberg revealed during the company’s latest earnings call. The half billion user mark comes just barely a year after the social network first launched its AI assistant last fall. Zuckerberg said the company still expects to become the “most-used” assistant by the end of 2024, though he's never specified how the company is measuring that metric.  Meta’s assistant isn’t the only AI tool that’s boosting the company’s business. Zuckerberg said that AI improvements in its feed and video recommendations have led to an 8 percent increase in time spent on Facebook and a 5 percent increase for Instagram this year. Advertisers are also taking advantage of the company’s AI tools, he said, with more than 15 million ads created with generative AI in the last month alone. “We believe that there's a lot more upside here,” Zuckerberg said. Outside of AI, Meta’s Threads app also continues to surge. The service now has “almost 275 million” monthly users, according to Zuckerberg. “It's been growing more than a million sign ups per day,” Zuckerberg said, adding that “engagement is growing too.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-ai-has-more-than-500-million-users-220353427.html?src=rss",

    "description": "CBS’ long-standing deal with the Grammys appears to be coming to an end. The Hollywood Reporter announced that the Grammy Awards inked a new deal that will move the music awards ceremony to ABC, Hulu and Disney+ starting in 2027. CBS will still be able to broadcast the Grammys in 2025 and 2026 on its broadcast network and its streaming service Paramount+, where the show has been available for a few years. Then the awards broadcast moves to its new home in 2027. The new deal will also keep the Grammys on ABC and its sister streaming sites through 2036. Getting the Grammys is a huge coup for the Disney media empire. ABC is also the home of the Oscars. The current deal keeps the Academy Awards on its network at least until 2028. The Grammys and the Oscars are also the two most watched awards broadcasts in the television industry. The last Grammy Awards attracted an audience of 16.9 million viewers this year. The 96th annual Academy Awards registered 19.5 million viewers in March, the biggest audience for any award show since 2020.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-nabs-the-broadcast-and-streaming-rights-to-the-grammys-away-from-cbs-214212558.html?src=rss",

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: Siemens will buy Altair Engineering for $10.6 billion, the American engineering software firm said on Wednesday, as the German company seeks to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing industrial software market. The offer price of $113 per share represents a premium of about 18.7% to Altair's closing price on Oct. 21, a day before Reuters first reported that the company was exploring a sale. The deal for Michigan-based Altair is Siemens's biggest acquisition since Siemens Healthineers bought medical device maker Varian Medical Systems for $16.4 million in 2020. [...] The transaction is anticipated to add to Siemens' earnings per share in about two years from the deal's closing, which is expected in the second half of 2025. It will also increase Siemens' digital business revenue by about 8%, adding approximately 600 million euros ($651.36 million) to the company's digital business revenue in fiscal 2023. The transaction would have a revenue impact of about $500 million per year in the mid-term and more than $1 billion per year in the long term, Siemens said. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
