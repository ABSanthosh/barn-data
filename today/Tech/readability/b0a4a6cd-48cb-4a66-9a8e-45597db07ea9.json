  "text": "Lenovo has a history of showing off weird and interesting new product ideas at trade shows. Remember the laptop with the rollable display from a few years ago? This year at MWC it's doing the same thing, with a host of unique, fun, and downright silly ideas, some of which could inform designs and decisions for future products.There are a few themes for Lenovo at MWC 2025. In classic Lenovo fashion, some of them have to do with finding ways to give you more screen real estate when you're using a laptop. Others have more to do with eco-friendliness, while others still, as you might expect, are built to take advantage of generative AI. Give me more screenThe central theme to most of Lenovo's concept ideas has to do with getting more screen from a traditional laptop. Perhaps the most unique concept for that comes in the form of the ThinkBook Flip AI PC Concept, which might look like a normal laptop from the front but has a whole second screen that can fold up from behind the first one. Essentially, that turns the top of your laptop screen into a hinge that connects the two sides of the screen. When folded out, the screen has a massive 18.1-inch display – and while it’s a little unsteady on a table, that could be fixed with a little kickstand or something. Credit: Christian de Looper The fold-out display can also be used in other ways. For example, it can be used as a second screen to show others what you're viewing on your laptop, or it allows you to use the laptop as a tablet when closed.It wasn't the only screen extension concept that Lenovo showed off. The company also showed off a dual-screen attachment that connects to its Magic Bay connector. The attachment basically adds two additional screens to the laptop, with one on either side of your main laptop screen. A smaller version of this concept adds one 8-inch display to the side of the screen, perfect for things like chat apps. Mashable Light Speed A Tamagotchi on your laptopMy personal favorite concept, however, had nothing to do with getting more display space from your laptop. Instead, it leverages the Magic Bay connector used for that dual-screen accessory to add a tiny companion device called Tiko to the top of your screen. Credit: Christian de Looper So what can Tiko do besides just look cute? Well, not a whole lot – looking cute is kind of the point. But it can use your webcam to interact with you when you do things like wave at it or give it a thumbs up.However, if you're looking for usefulness, perhaps more appropriate is the Tico Pro accessory. This accessory eliminates the normal Tico device's cuteness and shows always-on information through widgets on the screen. It can display a clock or calendar events, but it can also be used as a teleprompter or to show notes for a meeting.Other conceptOther Lenovo concepts revolved around different ideas. For example, the company showed off a laptop with a solar panel on the lid, which it says is among the most power-efficient solar panels and can give you two hours of video playback after charging. There are challenges associated with this idea, like heat, especially if you put your laptop in direct sunlight, which can impact its longevity and performance, but it's still a cool way to add some eco-friendliness to a laptop. Credit: Christian de Looper Last but not least, Lenovo also continued to show off 3D screens. However, new for this year is the fact that it has developed a technology that allows you to place both 3D and 2D content on the screen at the same time. That means that unless you're viewing 3D content, the screen will just look like a normal display. But with 3D content on the screen, it will add more depth to that content. 3D and 2D content can be on the screen at the same time, so you can have a window of something in 3D alongside all your other normal 2D windows.Regardless of if any of these concepts make it to consumer products, I’m glad Lenovo is still showing off its experiments. I just wish more companies were willing to do so",
