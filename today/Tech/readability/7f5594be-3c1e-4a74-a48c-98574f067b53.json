  "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Gizmodo: The Internet Archive and Wayback Machine went down on Tuesday following a sustained cyber attack. In addition, the Archive's user data has been compromised. If you've ever logged into the site to pore over its ample archives, it's time to change your passwords. [...] A pro-Palestenian hacktivist group called SN_BLACKMETA has taken responsibility for the hack on X and Telegram. \"They are under attack because the archive belongs to the USA, and as we all know, this horrendous and hypocritical government supports the genocide that is being carried out by the terrorist state of 'Israel,'\" the group said on X when someone asked them why they'd gone after the Archive. The group elaborated on its reasoning in a now-deleted post on X. Jason Scott, an archivist at the Archive, screenshotted it and shared it. \"Everyone calls this organization 'non-profit', but if its roots are truly in the United States, as we believe, then every 'free' service they offer bleeds millions of lives. Foreign nations are not carrying their values beyond their borders. Many petty children are crying in the comments and most of those comments are from a group of Zionist bots and fake accounts,\" the post said. SN_BLACKMETA also claimed responsibility for a six-day DDoS attack on the Archive back in May. \"Since the attacks began on Sunday, the DDoS intrusion has been launching tens of thousands of fake information requests per second. The source of the attack is unknown,\" Chris Freeland, Director of Library Services at the Archive said in a post about the attacks back in May. SN_BLACKMETA launched its Telegram channel on November 23 and has claimed responsibility for a number of other attacks including a six-day DDoS run at Arab financial institutions and various attacks on Israeli tech companies in the spring.
