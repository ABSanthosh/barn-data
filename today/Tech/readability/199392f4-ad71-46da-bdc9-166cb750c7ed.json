  "text": "Adult Swim hasn’t announced the exact release date for Rick and Morty season eight just yet, but at today’s New York Comic Con panel for the much-loved animated sci-fi series, there was still some outstanding news for fans: season 10 won’t be the end for the series. Seasons 11 and 12, baby! Let’s go! Speaking from the stage at the convention, co-creator Dan Harmon promised that means the show will be around until at least 2029, though the entire panel (which included the cast) echoed the oft-memed Rick quote by saying they hope it continues for “100 years.” We do know that season eight is coming sometime in 2025, and Adult Swim shared a tantalizing first look in the form of this animatic. As you’ll see, Rick and Morty (voiced by Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden) come across a cryo-ship in deep space… and curiosity, greed (specifically Rick’s greed), and catastrophic chaos rapidly ensue. Oh jeez! The rest of the main cast includes Chris Parnell as Jerry, Sarah Chalke as Beth, and Spencer Grammer as Summer. In a statement quoted by Deadline, Harmon and fellow executive producer Scott Marder shared their excitement about more Rick and Morty to come. “Nobody wants a universe without Rick and Morty. Fortunately, the list of places to go remains infinite,” Harmon said. Echoing the comments made on the NYCC stage, Marder added, “I couldn’t be prouder to have taken this baton pass of a lifetime during Rick and Morty’s fourth season and get us to season 10. Getting to go beyond that now is such a gift I can’t wait to give our fans. Rick and Morty—a hundred years—forever!” Want more io9 news?
