We have a primer on everything you need to know. Sales are accurate at the time of publication, but prices and inventory are always subject to change.I’m a professional carpenter, and I’ve been using DeWalt cordless tools almost since they came out in 1994, and I have to say: The current 20-volt battery system is light, well-balanced for comfort, and the batteries last for hours without needing to be charged. The 20-volt DeWalt cordless drill and driver set can become the cornerstone for your home DIY cordless set, and it’s 50% off for Prime Day. What’s includedThe DeWalt 20-volt drill and impact driver set comes with a ½-inch chuck drill, a ¼-inch chuck impact driver, two 20-volt, 2-amp-hour batteries, a charger, and a tool bag. The drill accepts bits with up to a ½-inch diameter base, and the driver has a quick-release ¼-inch chuck for swapping out bits quickly. The batteries are cross-compatible with other 20-volt DeWalt tools, allowing you to switch tools of the same brand and voltage as you work.A drill and driver are the cornerstone of a cordless tool set because they allow you to use fasteners on your projects, from building a shelf to installing gutter brackets. Beginning with a basic drill and driver set allows you to drill holes and drive fasteners for woodworking, hanging shelves, and making home repairs. You can also use a drill to mix paint with the right bit, or even clean your bathtub. Beginning your DIY kit with a brand that has a longstanding reputation for making durable cordless tools and batteries, like DeWalt, starts you off on a solid foundation that will help you grow your skills and your tool kit alongside each other. Since DeWalt batteries are cross-compatible with their whole line of 20-volt tools, you’ll be able to expand your kit as your interests and needs change without investing in a whole new battery set for each new tool. What do you think so far? Bits to go with your drill and driver setWhile your drill and driver set comes with batteries and a charger, it doesn’t have all the bits you’ll need to make your DIY dreams come true. There are a few Prime Day deals on bits that will help you get started on your DIY adventure and get the most out of your cordless drill and driver set:The 40-piece Bosch drill bit set is on sale for $24.99, 62% off its regular price. The set comes with drill bits ranging in size from 1/16-inch to ¼-inch, a variety of driver tips, a magnetic bit sleeve, and a case. The bits are compatible with a 14-inch chuck impact driver, or a ½-inch chuck drill, making them an ideal choice for your DeWalt drill and driver set. This bit set will give you a good start on the bits you will likely need for pre-drilling and driving fasteners.The 100-piece DeWalt bit set is on sale for $36.99, 44% off its usual price. It includes a set of standard drill bits ranging in size from 1/16-inch to ⅜-inch, a wide variety of driver tips, a magnetic sleeve, a bit extension base, a hex adapter that fits a drill chuck for swapping out shorter bit tips, and four carrying cases. This set has a lot of versatility, allowing you to use both your drill and your driver simultaneously, so it’s a good expansion to your DIY tool set.Looking for something else?
