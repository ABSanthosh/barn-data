  "text": "Every day, GOV.UK, the official website of the UK government, delivers crucial information, services and guidance to millions of people. And thanks to a partnership with Kin + Carta, the Valtech-owned digital transformation consultancy, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI Search, they recently unveiled a major upgrade to its search functionality, making it easier for citizens to get the information they need.With the goal of making search more intuitive and effective, Kin + Carta used Google Cloud’s customised Vertex AI Search solution. It uses natural language models that reflect the more “conversational” nature of modern search — creating a digital service that is both accurate and accessible to the public.Early testing has shown promising results, with a 14% increase in users clicking through to relevant results. The team has also seen a significant drop in people having to search multiple times to get what they want — and a reduction in people leaving the site when they can’t find what they need. These improvements show how effective AI solutions can be to help people quickly find the information they need.This collaboration between GOV.UK, Kin + Carta and Google Cloud highlights the potential of AI to enhance public services and improve the lives of citizens. By making government information more accessible, the new search engine contributes to a more efficient and user-friendly government website. “Millions of people visit GOV.UK every day to access public services and find essential information. Our goal is to make that experience as seamless and efficient as possible. Our new AI-powered search engine delivers faster, more relevant results and makes it easier for everyone - regardless of their digital skills - to find what they need.\"",
