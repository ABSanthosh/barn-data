  "description": "American Airlines has announced plans to finally offer free Wi-Fi on flights. The company said that its AT\u0026T-sponsored program will start offering free, high-speed Wi-Fi \"across more than 2 million American flights per year\" in January 2026. To be able to access free Wi-Fi you'll have to be a member of American's AAdvantage loyalty program, but once you're signed up, all you'll need to do is log in to access the internet. Wi-Fi will be offered on planes with \"Viasat and Intelsat high-speed satellite connectivity\", according to American, which includes 90 percent of the airline's fleet. \"American is also on pace to outfit more than 500 regional aircraft with high-speed Wi-Fi by the end of 2025,\" the company says. Nearly every major US-based airline offer some kind of free Wi-Fi program, and they're all able to do so thanks to satellite connectivity. United started using Starlink for Wi-Fi earlier this year, and both Hawaiian Airlines and Delta ran tests with SpaceX's satellite internet service back in 2022. Delta ultimately went with Viasat for its T-Mobile-sponsored Wi-Fi program in 2023, with the same loyalty program requirement as American Airlines.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/american-airlines-will-provide-inflight-wi-fi-for-free-starting-next-year-211243870.html?src=rss",
