  "text": "Musk ultimately received the security clearance, but since 2021, he has failed to self-report details of his life, including travel activities, persons with whom he has met, and drug use, according to the Times. The government is also concerned that SpaceX did not ensure Musk's compliance with the reporting rules. Government agencies \"want to ensure the people who have clearances don’t violate rules and regulations,\" Andrew Bakaj, a former CIA official and lawyer who works on security clearances, told the Times. \"If you don’t self-report, the question becomes: ‘Why didn’t you? And what are you trying to hide?'\" According to the report, Musk's handling of classified information has raised questions in diplomatic meetings between the United States and some of its allies, including Israel. Musk's national security profile has risen following his deep-pocketed and full-throated support of Donald Trump, who won the US presidential campaign in November and will be sworn into office next month. After this inauguration, Trump will have the power to grant security clearance to whomever he wishes.",
