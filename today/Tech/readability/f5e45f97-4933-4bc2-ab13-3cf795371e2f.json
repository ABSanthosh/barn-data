  "text": "Last year marked the 35-year anniversary of Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman film, which got a new follow-up in the sequel novel Resurrection. Turns out, that’s not the end of the ’89-verse, or whatever we’re calling it, because there’s another novel on the horizon telling another tale for Michael Keaton’s Caped Crusader. That would be Batman: Revolution, penned by Resurrection author John Jackson Miller. It’s the summer, Joker’s dealt with for good, and there’s an incoming Fourth of July festival meant to celebrate the occasion. Unfortunately, this is the perfect time for Norman Pinkus to strike. As the self-proclaimed “smartest man in Gotham,” Norman is a copy boy for the city paper and runs its popular Riddle Me word puzzles, and he’s been using his intellect to solve crimes in secret before Batman can. Having gone so long without proper recognition, Norman teams with some mysterious new allies to trap Batman in a game of riddles to determine who’s the true hero of Gotham. DC Yep, Norman is the Batman ’89 version of the Riddler. Back in the ’90s, Robin Williams was in talks to play him in what would become Batman Forever, but left the project, allowing Jim Carrey to inhabit the role. Revolution is expected to draw from plans for Burton’s would-be threequel, so much like the Batman ’89 comics, Miller is offering a look at what could’ve been had Burton kept making the movies. In a statement to ComicBook, Miller teased the book would show a side of Gotham that’s “just as active—and even more violent, with tensions rising with the temperatures.” He also teased connections to the comic and its own sequel, Batman ’89: Echoes. Batman: Revolution releases on print, digital, and audio on October 28. Want more io9 news?
