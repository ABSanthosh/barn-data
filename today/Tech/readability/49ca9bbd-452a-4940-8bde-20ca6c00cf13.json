Read Full Bio  on May 4, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Credit: Alex Cristi / iStock / Getty Images Plus Ever gotten a random text that starts with a name that’s not yours, in a scenario you’ve never been in? Maybe someone thinks you’re \"Emily from the gym\" or \"Daniel from the yacht club.\" You reply with the classic \"wrong number,\" but instead of backing off, the stranger suddenly wants to chat. Friendly. Curious. Weirdly persistent.Congratulations: you’ve just been targeted by a scam — and no, you’re not the only one. According to cybersecurity firm McAfee, as cited by CNBC, a staggering 25 percent of Americans have received these mystery messages. The scam isn’t new. In fact, it first started gaining traction back in 2022. What is new is how it’s evolving. These are called pig-butchering scams — a grotesque name with grotesque intent. Borrowed from the farming world, the term describes how scammers \"fatten up\" victims emotionally and psychologically before the financial slaughter. They operate like long-con romance scams: someone pretending to be rich and important, who just so happens to find you fascinating. Over time, they build trust, often steering the conversation toward crypto investments or too-good-to-be-true opportunities.Experts told CNBC that the rise of generative AI is supercharging these operations. It's letting scammers craft messages that feel more personal and making it easier to change up the script to sound more like a real person. And the numbers show it's working. Mashable Light Speed In 2024 alone, text message scams cost Americans $470 million, according to the Federal Trade Commission. That’s five times what it was in 2020.The bleaker reality behind these scams is that many are fueled by forced labor. Large-scale operations based in Southeast Asia are often behind the messages, with workers trafficked from across the region under false promises of legitimate employment. Once there, they’re coerced into running scams under constant surveillance and threats — essentially trapped in digital sweatshops. Not all participants are victims, though. Some of these operations are run by shady online gambling groups, staffed by people who know exactly what they’re doing.The simplest and most effective way to protect yourself? Don’t respond. If a text pops up from \"Emily from the gym\" or \"Daniel from the yacht club\" and you have no idea who that is, ignore it. If the number’s from an unfamiliar area code or a region you’ve never set foot in — ignore it. That’s it. No need to engage, correct them, or play along. Just block the number and move on.
