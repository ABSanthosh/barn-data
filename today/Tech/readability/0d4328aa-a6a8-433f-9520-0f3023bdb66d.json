  "text": "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds returns for a third season next month. Apart from a short teaser in April, we haven't seen much of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' upcoming third season, debuting next month. But Paramount+ has finally released the official trailer. (Spoilers for S2 below.) As previously reported, the S2 finale found the Enterprise under vicious attack by the Gorn, who were in the midst of invading one of the Federation's colony worlds. Several crew members were kidnapped, along with other survivors of the attack. Captain Pike (Anson Mount) faced a momentous decision: follow orders to retreat or disobey them to rescue his crew. Footage shown last October at New York City Comic-Con picked up where the finale left off, giving us the kind of harrowing high-stakes pitched space battle against a ferocious enemy that has long been a hallmark of the franchise. (Of course, Pike opted to rescue his crew.) Per the official synopsis: In Season 3, when we reconnect with the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, still under the command of Captain Pike, they face the conclusion of Season 2's harrowing encounter with the Gorn. But new life and civilizations await, including a villain that will test our characters' grit and resolve. An exciting twist on classic Star Trek, Season 3 takes characters both new and beloved to new heights, and dives into thrilling adventures of faith, duty, romance, comedy, and mystery, with varying genres never before seen on any other Star Trek. In addition to the returning main and recurring cast members, Cillian O'Sullivan joins the recurring cast as Dr. Roger Korby, a legacy character (originally played by Michael Strong). Korby was a renowned archaeologist in the field of medical archaeology and Nurse Chapel's long-missing fiancé. His reappearance in S3 is bound to cause problems for SNW's Nurse Chapel (Jess Bush), who is romantically involved with Spock (Ethan Peck). Rhys Darby and Patton Oswalt will also guest star.",
