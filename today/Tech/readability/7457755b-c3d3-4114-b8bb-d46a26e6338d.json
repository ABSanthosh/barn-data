Costume customization lets players change the color palette of their skin, creating a new in-game look that suits them best.The new palette swap customization isn't free and isn't available on every skin, though more skins will be available to customize as time goes on. Four reskins shipped with the feature's introduction.Unlocking costume customization will cost you the in-game currency equivalent of $6 per skin, but you can freely change the color to any variation released for a skin you bought customization on as they are released.The pricing of these reskins is actually generous compared with Rivals' largest competitor: Overwatch 2. Palette-swapped legendary reskins in Blizzard's first-person hero shooter have typically cost just as much as the original skin, and unlocking the black-and-gold customization for special Mythic skins costs the equivalent of $20.The $6 price tag for Marvel Rivals costume customization is a tame monetization practice in comparison. But the biggest problem with the new feature isn't the price tag -- it's the introduction of Unstable Molecules, which feels like an unnecessary additional currency introduced to lure players into spending more money. Ultron is invading Krakoa -- and Marvel Rivals is invading your wallet to extract cash for a new in-game currency. NetEase Games/Screenshot by CNETMarvel Rivals is developing a currency bloat problemThere were already three separate currencies to manage in the game, alongside the occasional addition of special tokens that let players interact with limited-time events like Galacta's Cosmic Adventure.Of the three existing currencies, most players will interact with Chrono Tokens, the purple currency, as it's available to free-to-play Marvel Rivals players. These tokens unlock rewards on the battle pass. Whereas most games have experience points that unlock battle pass tiers, Chrono Tokens are a currency that disappears at the end of a season.Units and Lattice are the current premium currencies in Marvel Rivals. Lattice is the gold coin that you directly pay -- most microtransactions convert your money into this currency to spend in-game, at a rate of $1 to 100 Lattice.Units, the blue currency, are what you need to buy most of the premium costume bundles in the game -- so you need to convert your Lattice to Units at a one-to-one exchange rate when you're buying costumes.That brings us to the new cosmetics system. As if that wasn't overly complicated enough, costume customization now requires a new currency: Unstable Molecules. Unstable Molecules aren't Units, but they might as well be. You exchange Lattice to Unstable Molecules at the same one-to-one rate.The only difference between these currencies is that you use Units to purchase costumes, emotes, sprays and account name changes, and you use Unstable Molecules to purchase the costume customization feature for skins you already own.The decision to add another currency for no reason needlessly complicates Marvel Rivals' microtransactions -- and the system was already pretty opaque as it stands. Maybe that's by design, as trading in multiple fictional currencies helps obscure the real dollar cost that players are sinking into their in-game cosmetics.The addition of Unstable Molecules feels like an anti-consumer move. The costume customization prices are fair when you compare them with the competition's asking prices for similar cosmetic tweaks, but the new feature should be bought and paid for with Units. There's no need to add another currency to Marvel Rivals, unless the entire point is to create another way to obfuscate and inflate player spending. The new Luna Snow costume customization is more than a little reminiscent of Hatsune Miku. NetEase Games/Screenshot by CNETHow to unlock costume customization in Marvel RivalsYou can rock palette-swapped versions of some of your favorite Marvel Rivals costumes right now. Costume customization is live in Marvel Rivals -- for a handful of skins. Here are the skins the new feature is compatible with right now:Magik Punkchild: Rosy Resilience skin variantPsylocke Vengeance: Phantom Purple skin variantLuna Snow Mirae 2099: Plasma Pulse skin variantWinter Soldier Blood Soldier: Winter's Wrath skin variantEach costume customization is available for purchase for 600 Unstable Molecules. The customizations are purchasable as part of the costume's listing under the store tab in the main menu. You need to own the base skin before you can purchase the costume customization color variants.Unstable Molecules are currently only available in a one-to-one exchange with the Lattice premium currency, but the costume customization announcement in the official Marvel Rivals Discord server mentioned that there will be new ways to earn Unstable Molecules in Season 3.",
