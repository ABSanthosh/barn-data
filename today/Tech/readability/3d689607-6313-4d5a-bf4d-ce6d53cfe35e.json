  "text": "Artisan CEO Jaspar Carmichael-Jack defended the campaign's messaging in an interview with SFGate. \"They are somewhat dystopian, but so is AI,\" he told the outlet in a text message. \"The way the world works is changing.\" In another message he wrote, \"We wanted something that would draw eyes—you don't draw eyes with boring messaging.\" So what does Artisan actually do? Its main product is an AI \"sales agent\" called Ava that supposedly automates the work of finding and messaging potential customers. The company claims it works with \"no human input\" and costs 96% less than hiring a human for the same role. Although, given the current state of AI technology, it's prudent to be skeptical of these claims. Artisan also has plans to expand its AI tools beyond sales into areas like marketing, recruitment, finance, and design. Its sales agent appears to be its only existing product so far. Meanwhile, the billboards remain visible throughout San Francisco, quietly fueling existential dread in a city that has already seen a great deal of tension since the pandemic. Some of the billboards feature additional messages, like \"Hire Artisans, not humans,\" and one that plays on angst over remote work: \"Artisan's Zoom cameras will never 'not be working' today.\"",
