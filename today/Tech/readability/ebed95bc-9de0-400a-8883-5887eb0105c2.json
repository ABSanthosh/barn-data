The deaths sparked a major criminal investigation and chaos for consumers. Netflix's Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders returns viewers to that time of panic. The show's three episodes are available now. Netflix Dept. Q (May 29) Dept. Q is a British crime drama adapted from the novels of the same name by Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen. The series, starring Matthew Goode, focuses on Carl Morck, an Edinburgh detective who's assigned to a new cold case while dealing with his own demons after a shooting incident left his former partner paralyzed. The new series came out on May 29. Max Max And Just Like That..., season 3 (May 29) Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, Seema and Lisa are back -- this is the new core group leading Max's third season of the sequel series to Sex and the City. The show returns to find Carrie and Aidan (John Corbett) still together, but very much apart now that he's living in Virginia to keep an eye on his kids. We'll still see Corbett on the show, but we're even more excited for confirmed guest stars Rosie O'Donnell and Patti LuPone. And Just Like That… premiered on May 29 and will air one episode weekly through Aug. 14. Max Mountainhead (May 31) With Succession over, that show's creator, Jesse Armstrong, has helmed a new project that once again takes aim at the rich and powerful: Mountainhead. The film stars Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Cory Michael Smith and Ramy Youssef as a group of friends -- who all happen to be billionaire tech bros -- as they get together for a ski weekend while the world is in the midst of financial and political crises. The dark satire premieres May 31 on Max. Prime Video Prime Video Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, season 2 (May 27) Prime Video's animated series Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy returned this week with a drop of eight new episodes, which star Keke Palmer and Stephanie Hsu as intergalactic surgeons. Dr. Sleech and Dr. Klak, who are also besties, specialize in treating alien ailments all over the universe, and this season finds them in a pickle when a journalist starts to look into Dr. Sleech's past. The show also features the voice talents of Kieran Culkin, Maya Rudolph, Lennon Parham and Natasha Lyonne. Prime Video The Better Sister (May 29) In Prime Video's The Better Sister, Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks star as sisters who couldn't be more opposite. Biel stars as Chloe, a media executive with a seemingly perfect life and family, while Banks plays her drug-addled, estranged sister Nicky. The sisters are reunited after Chloe's husband is murdered, and together they start to unravel the truth about his death. Hulu Huly Adults (May 29) Adults is a new comedy from Tonight Show writers Ben Kronengold and Rebecca Shaw about five friends, Samir (Malik Elassal), Billie (Lucy Freyer), Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), Issa (Amita Rao) and Anton (Owen Thiele) who are living together as they begin their journey in the real world, navigating work, romance and everything else. The show will also feature guest appearances from D'Arcy Carden, Julia Fox and Charlie Cox this season. The entire eight-episode season became available May 29 on Hulu.
