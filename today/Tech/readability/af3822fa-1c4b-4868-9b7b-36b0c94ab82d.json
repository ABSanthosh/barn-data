  "text": "The Beats Pill is still at its October Prime Day price. We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Illustration by Ian Moore and product image courtesy of Amazon. October Prime Day may be over, but Target's Cericle Week and Walmart's own competition sale are both going strong. Amazon also still has some lingering sales from their Prime Day sale, too, including one of my favorite deals: the new Beats Pill speaker. It is still $99.99 (originally $149.95), the lowest it has been since its recent release, according to price-checking tools. For less than a hundred dollars, this speaker is a steal. I've been trying out the Beats Pill speaker since it came out in June, and it has everything I would want in a portable speaker: a stereo sound when connected to at least another compatible speaker, multi-room to play the same music on multiple speakers, the Find My Device feature in case you misplace it, and a speakerphone so you use it as an extension of your phone. This Beats speaker is not just for Apple users, since Android users can also connect to the Bluetooth 5.3, but it only supports AAC and SBC codecs, so there is no Android-friendly codec options that will make the audio pop out. Apple users also get seamless iOS compatibility for a much smoother experience. In other words, the Pill will automatically show up as a pair option on iPhones while Androids will have to search for it. You can read about it in more detail on PCMag's \"excellent\" review.When it comes to battery life, you can expect around 24 hours per charge depending on your use, which is up there with other speakers of its size. The sound is the classic bright Beats sound signature (a balanced yet bass-heavy sound). It is rated IP67 for being dust-proof and waterproof, so it can be submerge for up to 30 minutes. The main con on this speaker is that there is no adjustable EQ on the app, but it already comes with a great sound signature.
