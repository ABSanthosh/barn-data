  "text": "Saturday Night Live continued its love affair with hyper-specific game show parodies this week, handing host Mikey Madison the mic in a new sketch called \"So Like…What Are We?\" Madison plays Molly Wilson, a woman trying to define her relationship on national television. Her contestant: Jeremy (Hinge) or just Jeremy, played by Michael Longfellow, who says he's fresh out of a long-term relationship and very much not looking for anything serious.\"Oh, that's the wrong answer,\" quips Madison. \"That'll be ten thousand dollars from your personal bank account.\"In addition to grilling her contestant on the state of their relationship, Madison dives into the real red flags — like a string of texts past midnight looking for \"link up\" and that \"daddy is hungry for butt.\"Maybe staying single isn’t the worst idea after all.
