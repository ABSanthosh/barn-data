The üíú of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!‚ÄúAs workers apply AI to a broader range of tasks, they discover innovative ways to enhance their work that they might not have initially considered. This leads them to find new applications for AI, creating a virtuous cycle of AI-powered productivity: the more you use it, the more you find new ways to use it, and the more productive you become.‚Äù Of course, these use cases differ across industries, with those working in technology most likely to use generative AI for technical writing, for example. Those working in financial services are more likely to use it for process automation and it won‚Äôt be a surprise to find that workers in the media and entertainment sectors gravitate towards tools for image generation. To date, only about 31% of companies have a formal AI strategy in place, which means that in many cases, workers‚Äô usage of genAI tools is unregulated and has led to the rise of the ‚ÄòBYOAI‚Äô trend, AKA bring your own AI to work. One way all workers can leverage the use of generative AI tools (regardless of their employers‚Äô stance), is in looking for a new role. Within recruitment, automation is taking over, and software is now doing much of what humans once managed, like sourcing, outreach, and application filtering. Some companies are even using AI to conduct job interviews, with mixed results. In the US, a case was filed last year concerning pharmacy chain CVS. As part of its application process, the company utilises video-interview technology which uses artificial intelligence for analysis. The plaintiff alleged that CVS broke Massachusetts law because it did not provide an opt-out. Amplifying your job search While there may be downsides, the use of generative AI when it comes to job seeking is a net positive. Consider the Reddit user, for example, who recently created an AI bot that was used to automatically apply to 1,000 jobs, with the result being 50 interviews in one month. That‚Äôs far more than what many job hunters can expect using traditional career search methods. The user, who subsequently deleted their Reddit account, said at the time that: ‚ÄúThe tailored CVs and cover letters, customized based on each job description, made a significant difference.‚Äù Speed and accuracy matter, and on the House of Talent Job Board, a new conversational AI job search agent can help you locate your next tech position quickly and accurately. Find the agent on the bottom right-hand side of your screen where it will allow you to search for best-matched jobs using your CV. Or, you can tell it a bit about yourself, your skills, your current location‚Äîor where you‚Äôd like to work. Once you‚Äôve isolated the best roles to apply for, generational AI can be tasked with optimising your application materials thanks to its time-saving capabilities. AI tools can help you to make fewer grammatical mistakes, align your experience effectively against the actual job description, and essentially speed up the whole process. Perplexity or ChatGPT can be used to quickly compare your CV against a job ad, outputting areas you need to finesse or skills you should highlight, helping you to optimize application materials for each role you apply for. If you‚Äôve ever considered sliding into a recruiter‚Äôs DMs on LinkedIn, for example, or sending an email to a hiring manager on spec, then this is another area in which genAI can help. Claude, for example, can help you compose succinct, effective messages or emails you can then edit to make sure they‚Äôre completely on point. Cover letters are another time-consuming element of a job hunt that many find daunting. Many job applicants simply don‚Äôt bother unless it‚Äôs a specific requirement. However, hiring managers like cover letters because they add additional context to your CV. You can showcase your motivation and desire for the role, along with more intangible talents such as your soft skills. The good news is that this process can also be simplified by prompting a Gen AI tool to create a cover letter based on your CV. This framework can then be padded out as you see fit ‚Äî add in additional experience or KPIs you succeeded with, along with an explanation of why you‚Äôd really love the job. And that‚Äôs not all. AI can help you research companies, positions, and terminology ahead of job interviews, helping you prepare. You can also use an AI tool as a sounding board for interview preparation, by asking it to generate sample questions for a software engineering role, for example. But no matter what tools or platforms you use, it‚Äôs incumbent on you to check the outputs. Generative AI tools are great assistants, but you‚Äôre in the driving seat.
