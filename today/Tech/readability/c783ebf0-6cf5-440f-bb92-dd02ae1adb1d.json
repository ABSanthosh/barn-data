Credit: Gaiatop, DJI, Newmowa / Mashable Photo Composite VidCon is an annual gathering for video creators, especially YouTube creators, and this year Mashable joined the fray. Our digital culture and shopping reporters are on the ground at the Anaheim Convention Center to check out the top panels and events — and to talk to as many creators as possible. So, what's trending among the trendsetters?We kept our eyes peeled for gadgets, tech accessories, cameras, and cute carry-alls as we roamed the VidCon 2025 convention room floor. Keep an eye on our new In My Bag series for more influencer-approved product recommendations.And in the meantime, here's a recap of all the tech products we spotted at VidCon 2025.The creator-approved selfie lightHave you heard of the Alix Earle selfie light, or have you been living off the grid? TikTok creator Alix Earle first recommended this simple clip-on camera light in a 2022 video, and it's been an Amazon bestseller ever since. TikTok creator Sa Nguyen told Mashable that she depends on this high-powered LED light to make content for her 4.3 million followers, but you don't need to be a TikTok \"it girlie\" to benefit from the spotlight.Plus, it's on sale. The vlogger's secret weapon: The DJI Osmo Pocket 3We first reviewed the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera when it was first released in 2023, and it's still the undefeated champion of gimbal cameras. Any time we attend an event with a lot of influencers, we know we'll see this pocket camera everywhere, and so it was at VidCon 2025. Mashable Shopping Reporter Sam Mangino said she's spotted this popular camera all over the Creator floor, where \"folks seem to be using it to vlog on the floor.\" This 4K camera is small enough to slip in your pocket, yet it can take professional-quality video in vertical and horizontal formats. A personal fanYou know what's cute? Ghost lashes. You know what's not? Sweat. And as the world gets warmer, sweat is a very serious problem for folks dedicated to streaming as much of their daily life as possible. As Mashable reporters walked the VidCon 2025 convention floor, one gadget was inescapable: handheld portable fans. Canon PowerShot V10The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is a godsend for creators who shoot outdoors and in crowded spaces, but it's also expensive. For creators at VidCon 2025 looking for something more economical, the Canon PowerShot V10 is the weapon of choice. This video camera can stand up by itself at any angle and is compact enough to take anywhere. A Sony vlogging cameraIt's a tough question for creators: Canon or Sony? Both companies make more-than-capable video cameras for content creators, but creators have told us they enjoy using the Sony ZV-1F Vlog Camera for Content Creators and Vloggers. It has a built-in microphone array with a wind shield, and the Ultra-wide 20mm lens is ideal for filming YouTube videos in particular. If you need a pro-quality vlogging camera for under $500, it's one of the best. The editing software of choice? Final Cut ProTikTokkers can keep CapCut. At VidCon 2025, it's all about Final Cut Pro. For Apple users who shoot and edit their own content, this Mac video editing software is indispensable. So far, it's the single most-recommended product we've encountered in conversations with creators. A subscription will set you back $299.99, but there is a free trial to test it out. A portable hard driveCreator Nicole Rafiee told us she relies on the SanDisk 1TB Portable SSD to store all her content, and she's not the only one. Not only is this an extremely popular hard drive (Amazon sells more than 8,000 monthly), but you'll also find it in the bags of Mashable's own reporters and editors. Mashable Deals A flexible yet durable tripodPhotographers and videographers love this Joby tripod, and it's been a very common sight on the convention floor at VidCon 2025. (See if you can spot it in our review of the GoPro Hero 13 Black camera.) You can pick it up at Amazon or your photography retailer of choice. A professional microphoneLook, we love an adorable little pocket mic as much as the next person. But if you're really trying to succeed as a YouTuber or TikTokker, sometimes you need to upgrade your hustle – and your equipment. Mashable Shopping Reporter Samantha Mangino says she's seen this microphone all over VidCon so far. Mashable will be live at Anaheim Convention Center this week covering VidCon 2025. Check back in the days ahead at Mashable.com, where we’ll be talking to your favorite creators, covering the latest trends, and sharing how creators are growing their followings, their influence, and making a living online.Mashable reporters Christianna Silva, Bethany Allard, and Samantha Mangino contributed to this article.
