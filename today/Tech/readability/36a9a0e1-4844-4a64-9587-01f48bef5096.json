File photo of a previous launch of the Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, on December 12, 2024. Credit: Department of Defense The US military launched a long-range hypersonic missile Friday morning from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on a test flight that, if successful, could pave the way for the weapon's operational deployment later this year. The Army's Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon fired out of a canister on a road-mobile trailer shortly after sunrise on Florida's Space Coast, then headed east over the Atlantic Ocean propelled by a solid-fueled rocket booster. Local residents shared images of the launch on social media. Designed for conventional munitions, the new missile is poised to become the first ground-based hypersonic weapon fielded by the US military. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat against Ukraine. China has \"the world's leading hypersonic missile arsenal,\" according to a recent Pentagon report on Chinese military power. After a successful test flight from Cape Canaveral last year, the long-range hypersonic weapon (LRHW)â€”officially named \"Dark Eagle\" by the Army earlier this weekâ€”will give the United States the ability to strike targets with little or no warning. The Dark Eagle missile rapidly gained speed and altitude after launch Friday morning, then soon disappeared from the view of onlookers at Cape Canaveral. Warning notices advising pilots and mariners to steer clear of the test area indicated the missile and its hypersonic glide vehicle were supposed to splash down in the mid-Atlantic Ocean hundreds of miles north and northeast of Puerto Rico. Success not guaranteed A US defense official did not answer questions from Ars about the outcome of the test flight Friday. \"A combined team of government, academic, and industry partners conducted a test on behalf of the Department of Defense from a test site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station,\" the official said. \"We are currently evaluating the results of the test.\" Liftoff of the LRHW Dark Eagle this morning ðŸš€ https://t.co/lCJhUXxT84 pic.twitter.com/YJXXuSxmJK â€” Jerry Pike (@JerryPikePhoto) April 25, 2025 This missile launch and a similar one in December are the first tests of land-based offensive weapons at Cape Canaveral since 1988, when the military last tested Pershing ballistic missiles there. The launch range in Florida continues to support offshore tests of submarine-launched Trident missiles, and now is a center for hypersonic missile testing. The Pentagon has a long-standing policy of not publicizing hypersonic missile tests before they happen, except for safety notices for civilian airplanes and ships downrange. But the Defense Department declared the previous Dark Eagle test flight a success within a few hours of the launch, and did not do so this time. Hypersonic missiles offer several advantages over conventional ballistic missiles. These new kinds of weapons are more maneuverable and dimmer than other missiles, so they are more difficult for an aerial defense system to detect, track, and destroy. They are designed to evade an adversary's missile warning sensors. These sensors were originally activated to detect larger, brighter incoming ballistic missiles, which have a predictable trajectory toward their targets after boosting themselves out of the atmosphere and into space. A hypersonic weapon is different. It can skim through the upper atmosphere at blistering speeds, producing a much dimmer heat signature that is difficult to see with an infrared sensor on a conventional missile warning satellite. At these altitudes, the glide vehicle can take advantage of aerodynamic forces for maneuvers. This is why the Pentagon's Space Development Agency is spending billions of dollars to deploy a network of missile tracking satellites in low-Earth orbit, putting hundreds of sophisticated sensors closer to the flight path of hypersonic weapons. Dark Eagle is designed to fly at speeds exceeding Mach 5, or 3,800 mph, with a reported range of 1,725 miles (2,775 kilometers), sufficient to reach Taiwan from Guam, or NATO's borders with Russia from Western Europe. The US military says it has no plans to outfit its hypersonic weapons with nuclear warheads. In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Defense said the weapon's official name pays tribute to the eagle, known for its speed, stealth, and agility. Dark Eagle offers a similar mix of attributes: velocity, accuracy, maneuverability, survivability, and versatility, the Pentagon said. \"The word 'dark' embodies the LRHW's ability to dis-integrate adversary capabilities,\" the statement said. \"Hypersonic weapons will complicate adversaries' decision calculus, strengthening deterrence,\" said Patrick Mason, senior official performing the duties of the assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics, and technology A US Army soldier lifts the hydraulic launching system on the new long-range hypersonic weapon (LRHW) during Operation Thunderbolt Strike at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, on March 3, 2023. Credit: Spc. Chandler Coats, US Army Dark Eagle is the land-based component of the Pentagon's effort to field hypersonic missiles for combat. The Navy will use the same system on its ships to provide a sea-launched version of the hypersonic weapon called Conventional Prompt Strike, which will be placed on destroyers and submarines. The Army and Navy programs will use an identical two-stage missile, which will jettison after depleting its rocket motors, freeing a hypersonic glide vehicle to steer toward its target. The entire rocket and glide vehicle are collectively called an \"All Up Round.\" \"The use of a common hypersonic missile and joint test opportunities allow the services to pursue a more aggressive timeline for delivery and to realize cost savings,\" the Defense Department said in a statement. A long road to get here The Congressional Budget Office reported in 2023 that purchasing 300 intermediate-range hypersonic missiles would cost $41 million per missile. Dynetics, a subsidiary of the defense contractor Leidos, is responsible for developing the Common Hypersonic Glide Body for the Army's Dark Eagle and the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor charged with integrating the entire weapon system. The militaryÂ canceled an air-launched hypersonic weapon program in 2023 after it ran into problems during testing. The Pentagon said Army commanders will use Dark Eagle to \"engage adversary high-payoff and time-sensitive targets.\" The hypersonic weapon could be used against an adversary's mobile missile forces if US officials determine they are preparing for launch, or it could strike well-defended targets out of reach of other weapons in the US arsenal. Once in the field, the missile's use will fall under the authority of US Strategic Command, with the direction of the president and the secretary of defense. Defense News, an industry trade publication, reported in February that the Army aimed to deliver the first Dark Eagle missiles to a combat unit before October 1, pending final decisions by the Pentagon's new leadership under the Trump administration. This illustration from the Government Accountability Office compares the trajectory of a ballistic missile with those of a hypersonic glide vehicle and a hypersonic cruise missile. Credit: GAO Dark Eagle suffered multiple test failures in 2021 and 2022, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. Military crews aborted several attempts to launch the missile from Cape Canaveral in 2023 due to a problem with the weapon's launcher. The program achieved two successes last year with test flights from Hawaii and Florida. The December launch from Cape Canaveral was an important milestone. \"This test builds on several flight tests in which the Common Hypersonic Glide Body achieved hypersonic speed at target distances and demonstrates that we can put this capability in the hands of the warfighter,\" said Christine Wormuth, then-secretary of the army, in a Pentagon statement announcing the result of the test flight. The Dark Eagle readiness tests build on more than a decade of experimental hypersonic flights by multiple US defense agencies. Hypersonic flight is an unforgiving environment, where the outer skin of glide vehicles must withstand temperatures of 3,000Â° Fahrenheit. It's impossible to re-create such an extreme environment through modeling or tests on the ground. While the Army and Navy hope to soon deploy the first US hypersonic missile for use in combat, the military continues pursuing more advanced hypersonic technology. In January, the Pentagon awarded a contract worth up to $1.45 billion to Kratos Defense \u0026 Security Solutions for theÂ Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) program. Kratos partners with other companies, like Leidos, Rocket Lab, Firefly Aerospace, and Stratolaunch, to test hypersonic technologies in their operating environment. The program aims for a rapid cadence of suborbital test flights, some of which have already launched with Rocket Lab's Electron rocket. With these experiments, engineers can see how individual components and technologies work in flight before using them on real weapons. The Biden administration requested $6.9 billion for the Pentagon's hypersonic research programs in fiscal year 2025, up from $4.7 billion in 2023. The Trump administration's budget request for fiscal year 2026 is scheduled for release next month.

The program achieved two successes last year with test flights from Hawaii and Florida.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe December launch from Cape Canaveral was an important milestone. \u0026#34;This test builds on several flight tests in which the Common Hypersonic Glide Body achieved hypersonic speed at target distances and demonstrates that we can put this capability in the hands of the warfighter,\u0026#34; said Christine Wormuth, then-secretary of the army, in a Pentagon statement announcing the result of the test flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Eagle readiness tests build on more than a decade of experimental hypersonic flights by multiple US defense agencies. Hypersonic flight is an unforgiving environment, where the outer skin of glide vehicles must withstand temperatures of 3,000Â° Fahrenheit. It\u0026#39;s impossible to re-create such an extreme environment through modeling or tests on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Army and Navy hope to soon deploy the first US hypersonic missile for use in combat, the military continues pursuing more advanced hypersonic technology. In January, the Pentagon awarded a contract worth up to $1.45 billion to Kratos Defense \u0026amp; Security Solutions for theÂ Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKratos partners with other companies, like Leidos, Rocket Lab, Firefly Aerospace, and Stratolaunch, to test hypersonic technologies in their operating environment. The program aims for a rapid cadence of suborbital test flights, some of which have already launched with Rocket Lab\u0026#39;s Electron rocket. With these experiments, engineers can see how individual components and technologies work in flight before using them on real weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Biden administration requested $6.9 billion for the Pentagon\u0026#39;s hypersonic research programs in fiscal year 2025, up from $4.7 billion in 2023.
