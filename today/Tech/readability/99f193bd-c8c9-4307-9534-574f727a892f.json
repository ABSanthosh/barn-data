Credit: Mashable photo composite / BrüMate / Harry's / Amazon / Therabody Whatever the occasion that has you looking for dad gifts (Father's Day, the winters holidays, for example), stay far away from clichés like whiskey stones and pocket knives and try to think outside the box. Unless your dad is an avid tie collector and seriously *lives* for ties, then avoid this played-out gift. Instead, get him something that says, “I see your hobbies and I respect them.\" Even if your dad says he doesn't need anything, he deserves something cool and special, like a new gadget, a subscription box, or something that will keep him looking ageless for years to come. That’s why we've rounded up plenty of ideas for all types of dads, whether he has a green thumb, an affinity for craft beer, a massive music collection, or a deep appreciation for learning new skills and hobbies. Tile Bluetooth trackers Best for the dad who always loses his keys Give Dad the gift of *not* frantically searching for keys before leaving for work. The Tile Pro attaches easily to a key ring, but he can stick it in or on almost anything he wishes to make find-able: wallets, luggage...pets? When something is lost, he can use the phone app to track it down. And if his phone is lost, the Tile Pro can make it ring even on silent. A new Kindle Paperwhite Best for bookworm dads Kindles are still the class-A e-reader of our times, and the latest Kindle Paperwhite is a big improvement. It's got a larger, glare-free display that reads like real paper; an adjustable warm light that's easy on the eyes; and an upgraded battery that'll last up to 10 weeks per charge. It also comes with four months of Kindle Unlimited for free. SPONSORED Wine Advent Calendar Best for dads who like wine The thing about trying new wine at home is that you really have to commit to a whole bottle without knowing whether or not you'll like it. Help your dad sample 24 different varietals from all across the globe and get into the spirit of the season at the same time with this 24-bottle Advent Calendar-style gift collection. A Brooklinen Super-Plush Robe Best for the homebody Every guy needs a good robe in their lives — which means it should be an investment that will last, not something cheap that will eventually fall apart in the wash. If your dad enjoys spending time at home more than he likes hitting the town for a night out, Brooklinen's Super-Plush Robe will ensure that his homebody self is feeling comfortable and luxurious at all times. SPONSORED TITAN Evo gaming chair from Secretlab Best for the dad with a bad back Whether your dad is an obsessive gamer, or just needs a comfier setup while working from home, then this makes a great option for optimizing his experience. The ergonomic chair is built using a medium-firm foam and comes complete with armrests and lumbar support designed to match the natural 20-45° curvature of the lower back. The Smooth Sailor skincare set Best for the skincare-obsessed dad Lucky Bastard Co. offers a unique line of premium, all-natural skincare products without all of the harmful chemicals found in traditional men's care products. This all-in-one kit gets Pops some lip balm, sunscreen, and a candle that smells like the woods. A portable projector Best for the cinephile dad If your dad is the backyard-party-throwing type, forego the grill equipment (predictable) and get him a projector to show movies on the side of his house while he uses the 16 pairs of grill tongs everyone else got him. The soda can-sized Anker Nebula Capsule, a top-rated pick on Amazon, can play up to four hours of video on a single charge and comes with its own built-in 360-degree speaker. A Peel case Best for the minimalist dad iPhones look great without a phone case, but keeping yours bare opens you up to a pretty disastrous risk — unless you have Peel. The ultra-thin phone case wraps snugly around your smartphone, protecting it from the outside world (all while maintaining the integrity and sleek look of your device). Throw in a screen protector to boot and stay worry-free. SPONSORED An account to 1Password Best for tech-savvy dads If your dad keeps a small notebook beside his computer with all his most precious passwords scrawled inside, then keep reading. 1Password is the same idea, but it moves everything online to a much safer, digital space. A subscription includes the power to autofill saved passwords and can be used across devices. For a limited time, he can even try an individual account for free for 14 days before the membership kicks in. A shiatsu foot massager Best for dads with sore feet If your dad regularly complains about how badly his feet hurt, this foot massager should do the trick. The device's deep-kneading shiatsu massage nodes will eliminate knots and muscle tension, letting Dad enjoy his days just a little bit more. It even has a heating function for the colder months. SPONSORED Wyze Battery Cam Pro Best for dads who keep tabs Help your dad keep watch over his kingdom no matter where he is (even if it's just the couch) with these battery-powered security cameras from Wyze. He'll especially love the two-way radio feature and rechargeable batteries. For a limited time, save 45% on a pack of two. An AncestryDNA kit Best for wannabe genealogist dads Every history buff dad has been on the verge of purchasing a dilapidated gristmill just because his ancestors once owned it, right? An AncestryDNA kit is the perfect gift for someone writing down that family history. He can see a pie chart of his genes, build that family tree, and maybe even connect with family members who also have an Ancestry account. A Fitbit Inspire Best for the couch-to-5k dad In the days of yore, there were only very bulky fitness trackers. But the lower-profile design of the sleek new Fitbit Luxe is perfect for the dad who goes from work to workout to play without much time for a full costume change. (This one still looks good with a suit!) SPONSORED Nest Cam 2 Pack Best for dads who keep an eye on things Did that gift get delivered? Are the kids doing their homework yet? Nest Cam is wire-free, so it can go inside or out, and it knows the difference between people, animals, and vehicles. Listen and speak through the camera right from the Google Home app and check in anytime with 24/7 live view. And if you miss a notification, you can always go back and see what happened with three hours of free event video history. A Bluetooth-enabled turntable Best for audiophile dads Bring his pile of dust-collecting records into the digital age with this fully automatic turntable from Audio-Technica. It comes with built-in Bluetooth so he can listen to the warm, analog sounds of his favorite LPs via speakers, headphones, and other wireless devices. A Headspace subscription Best for the dad who needs a breather If your dad has trouble sleeping or just needs a minute or two to himself, consider giving him the gift of meditation. Headspace's gentle audio guidance is perfect for folks who have never practiced before. A smart sprinkler controller Best for the dad who loves his garden Maintaining a pristine lawn requires time, attention to detail, and money. The Rachio 3 can help with all three. Once installed, Dad will be able to use his phone to control his sprinkler system — whether that's making schedules or starting an impromptu watering session while he's at work — with options for skipping or changing patterns when it's raining, windy, or super cold. Cheryl's Cookies Best for the dad with a sweet tooth No matter the occasion, cookies make a great gift. Your dad can rip into them immediately; plus, you might even be able to snag one for yourself. Cheryl's Cookies offers a variety of cookies and other treats, with gluten-free, sugar-free, and kosher options. A smart light kit Best for the energy-efficient dad Your dad has probably bitched at the rest of the household for leaving the lights on at some point. Give him complete control over the lights — and the aesthetic — in his home with this smart lighting kit from Philips. The bulbs screw into standard sockets and can be operated through a regular switch, a phone app, or smart assistant commands. A Yeti insulated tumbler Best for coffee on the go These tumblers by the trusted outdoor brand Yeti are made with double-wall vacuum insulation, which keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot until the last sip. Their stainless steel exterior is puncture- and rust-resistant, and they have a \"no-sweat\" design — meaning the outside won't be covered in condensation and leave a puddle behind. A massage gun Best for the dad who works out If you've had to listen to your dad complain about his muscles aching after a workout, a massage gun is a lovely gift idea. \"Theragun\" has become synonymous with \"massage gun\" for good reason. The super quiet Prime model comes with four different attachments, which are designed for different parts of the body. A carbonated growler Best for the craft beer dad Growlers are often the only way to transport releases from breweries that don’t get bottled or shipped. (We’ve definitely had limited-edition beer go flat on us before.) Enter the uKeg, a stainless steel growler with an adjustable carbonation cap that'll instantly turn your dad's fridge into a tap; two CO2 cartridges are included with every purchase. Nike Pegasus 40s Best for the runner Help your dad exercise in style with a pair of Nike Pegasus 40s. These ultra-breathable running shoes are lightweight but supportive and feature a wider fit at the toes for comfort. They come in regular and extra-wide sizes and in lots of different colors; you can also custom-design a pair specially for your pops. A Philips SmartSleep Best for dads who get up early Even if your dad is a morning person, nobody likes being woken up by a blaring alarm. Make his mornings easier with a Philips SmartSleep wake-up light. It simulates the sunrise by gradually brightening in the half-hour leading up to your dad's set alarm time, resulting in a gentler, more refreshed wake-up. The light also has a dimming setting to simulate sunset, which can help your dad unwind and relax before going to bed. A towel-warming rack Best for dads who need a spa day Your dad can enjoy a toasty towel as soon as he steps out of the shower with this wall-mounted towel-warming rack. (Big five-star hotel vibes.) It's suitable for drying bathing suits, underwear, and blankets, too — no need to stuff them in the dryer. A Moleskine notebook Best for jotting down his thoughts No journal collection is complete without a classic Moleskine notebook. This highly customizable option features a hard cover with rounded edges, a ribbon bookmark, an elastic closure, and an expandable inner pocket. It's available in 10 different colors and four sizes, and you can even choose its pages' layout. An Amazon Prime membership Best gift that keeps giving If your dad still doesn't have an Amazon Prime membership, bring him up to date by gifting him one. On top of free two-day shipping, he'll also get access to Prime Video and Music, free Kindle e-books, and more. Plus, he'll be able to participate in exclusive Prime Day deals every year. \"World Travel: An Irreverent Guide\" Best for the worldly dad For the off months between his beloved vacations, satisfy your dad's inner nomad with this collection of stories from Anthony Bourdain. This guide includes some of the late travel TV host’s favorite spots around the world and practical advice about what to do in each locale. The hardcover version would be a cool coffee table addition, but it's available on Kindle, too. Baseball park map glasses Best for the baseball fan Skip the generic hat or T-shirt and get your dad a unique drinking glass that features a map of his favorite baseball park. At the very least, it'll be an excellent conversation starter for when he has guests over — especially if they root for another team. A Harry's shaving set Best for the bearded dad Your dad deserves a razor that's not going to leave him with razor burn or a bunch of cuts on his face. The Truman Set from Harry's includes one Truman handle, three blade cartridges, a bottle of foaming shave gel, and a travel cover — all for just $15. (Sign him up for blade refills if you're feeling extra generous.) A useful online course Best for the lifelong learner Udemy offers more than 100,000 online courses across a variety of topics. Whether your dad wants to learn more about art, coding, or business planning, we're positive you'll be able to find a course for him. Bonus: Once you buy a class, he gets access to it for life. A plant mister Best for plant dads If you’ve ever caught him talking to his plants when he thought nobody was looking, he’ll love this gift, which is great for adding moisture to delicate leaves and blooms. Plus, the bottle will look lovely displayed on the windowsill. Apple AirPods Best for the podcast-listening pops Everyone could use a pair of Apple's fantastic AirPods — even dads who say they absolutely don't need expensive headphones. He can jam out while on a run or listen to his favorite podcast while cooking, and the wireless charging case is a lifesaver. A telescope Best for dads who dig stargazing Dads *need* to point out the Big Dipper every time they see it. Take your dad's stargazing hobby to the next level with the Celestron Travel Scope 70. This well-reviewed portable telescope comes with a custom backpack and several accessories; it's a bit more advanced than the ones made for kids, but it's still simple enough for beginners. A backyard game For the competitive dad Family gatherings are prime time for dads to bring up how they win at *everything.* If cornhole is getting old, give him a new game to bust out — Kan Jam, for instance. The Frisbee-throwing game requires nothing more than an open field and two players who want to have fun. He can even keep the game in the back of his car for impromptu matches. An insulated can cooler Best for the Miller Lite lover He might be on the beach, in the woods, or on the front porch — but he's got a beer that needs to stay cool. The bestselling BrüMate Hopsulator is a stainless steel insulated koozie that's said to keep 12-ounce cans chilled for 20 times longer than standard neoprene coolers. Plus, it comes in a whopping 29 different colors. A Petcube Bites 2 Lite Best for the pet dad If he treats his pet like his child (in a good way), gift him some extra peace of mind whenever he has to leave the house in the form of the Petcube Bites 2 Lite smart pet camera. He can use it to monitor his dog or cat, toss them treats, and even talk to them while he’s at the office or running errands. A portable Bluetooth speaker Best for the outdoorsman Ah, the faint sound of Dad belting his favorite hair metal jams while doing yard work. The newest version of JBL's carabiner Bluetooth speaker is dust-proof and IP67 waterproof, so he's good to take it almost anywhere. A new wallet, damn it Best for the dad who never shops for himself If he’s had his wallet since before you can remember, give him a gentle hint that it’s time to move on. This leather option from Fossil features that beloved bifold shape he's used to and has storage space for all the essentials. Because it’s such a classic style, he’ll be able to keep using it for years (and years and years) to come. A Herschel duffle bag Best for dads who pack light Whether he travels for work or likes to make spontaneous family visits, he'll need a reliable bag for the times a bulky suitcase isn't appropriate. Herschel's ultra-functional Novel Duffle is a weekender bag that comes in a variety of colors and features a dedicated compartment for his shoes. Kabob Grilling Baskets Best for the grilling dad With these grilling baskets, your dad can enjoy perfectly grilled veggies and meat without a skewer. Plus, the basket design allows for easy flipping — he'll feel like a pro even if he's not. Copper Rain Gauge Best for the novice meteorologist This copper rain gauge, or pluviometer, lets you measure the precipitation and see Archimedes’ Principle in action every time it rains. So if you have a dad who just loves talking about the weather (did you hear it’s supposed to rain four inches this Friday?), get this rain gauge so he can indulge his passion. Walabot DIY 2 Best for DIY dads If your dad has an Android or iOS smartphone, he can use this smart wall scanner to basically have X-ray vision on his drywall or concrete. He'll be able to see up to four inches into the wall and pinpoint pipes, studs, wires and, yes, even the horrifying movement of rodents. A sparkling beverage system Best for sparkling beverage fans Spärkel allows dad to infuse the delicious tastes of natural ingredients without a CO2 tank. There is no need to be tech-savvy; you or your dad can effortlessly infuse water, tea, juice, wine, fruits, and fresh herbs to create boozy cocktails and family-friendly mocktails. With the emphasis on 'easy-to-use', pour Carbonators into the Beverage System and watch the bubbles work their way up through your bottle to fizz up your drink. There are five levels to fit your taste — light fizz or serious bubbles? Get the perfect combination every time. A yodeling pickle Best for dads that like a good joke Dad is sure to get a laugh out of this goofy gift idea. A plastic, yodeling pickle! Batteries are included, so he can enjoy the sweet serenade right out of the box. With the push of a button he’ll feel like he’s been transported to the Swiss Alps. A high-speed photo scanning system Best for the family historian For the dad in charge of keeping the family memories digitized, a high-speed photo scanning system makes the task a cinch. This model is the world’s fastest personal photo scanner, with the ability to scan up to 30 photos as quickly as one photo per second. Add to that the fact that you can scan everything wirelessly, the memory keeper of the family will love the efficiency and accessibility of quickly digitizing thousands of photos. A soothing sound machine Best for the dad that has trouble sleeping Give dad the gift of a good night’s rest with a sound machine that uses state of the art technology to generate dynamic, realistic fan sounds, white noises, and ocean sounds to help block intrusive noises. Relax, concentrate, and fall asleep easier. Featuring ten fan sounds, ten white, pink and brown noise, and two variations of ocean noise, this sound machine helps block out disruptive noise and keep dad relaxed. There’s even a headphone connector and portable speaker to match his environment and sleep style. A tabletop fire pit Best for dads who enjoy cozy ambiance Get the instant ambiance of a real fire with a tabletop fire pit and leave the smoke and clean up behind. This eco-friendly fire pit is easy to light and extinguish. Just be sure to have proper ventilation. Made from temperature-resistant concrete for an enhanced, safe, smokeless, and odor-free experience. The modern, portable designs go with today’s decor and offer an easy way to stage an inviting atmosphere for quiet moments. A cooling hat Best for outdoorsy dads Whether he's out huntin', fishin', or just doing yardwork, your dad will love this innovative cooling hat. All he has to do is wet the hat, wring it out, and give it a little wave through the air to enjoy up to two hours of cooling at 30 degrees below body temperature. Plus, it has built-in UPF 50 protection to help keep his head, face, and neck from getting sunburned — perfect for dads rocking a bald head. A meditation headband Best for the dad who needs to relax Meditation can be an incredibly beneficial practice for managing stress, but it can be tough to know how to get started. Help Dad on his mindfulness journey with this smart wearable meditation band and its accompanying app that can train his mind and body to relax with immersive audio feedback. A side table/cooler combo Best for the dad who loves to chill Whether he's lounging by the pool or taking breaks between flipping burgers on the grill, he'll love the convenience of this sleek side table that can simultaneously stash up to 40 12-ounce cans inside its cooler base. The pop-up bar top reveals access to the goods for party mode, but it can also remain closed to act as a standard side table for his newspaper and morning coffee. A DIY hot sauce kit Best for the dad who spices things up If your dad loves to add heat to every recipe, he'll love getting this opportunity to make his very own hot sauces. This all-inclusive kit comes with three types of dried, whole hot peppers, a variety of spices, vinegar, bottles, fun labels, and more. It also includes recipes to create six types of hot sauce, like Curry Pineapple Hot Sauce, Sweet Chili Sauce, and Smoky Garden Sauce. Smart sunglasses Best for the social dad Maybe he's trying to launch his influencer side hustle, or maybe he just likes to share his life with his friends on \"the Facebook\" — either way, these genius Ray-Ban Stories sunglasses will keep him well connected. The newest edition of these smart glasses combine the classic style of Ray-Ban Wayfarers with Bluetooth connectivity and a hands-free camera. A smarter lawn care service Best for greener grass If your dad likes to spend time puttering around in the yard, then we promise he's going to love Sunday. This smart lawn care subscription uses advanced data and satellite imagery to triangulate exactly the right lawn care products for each customer's home. Then, they provide all the products dad needs to ensure the grass is always greener on his side of the fence. New noise-canceling headphones Best for music-loving dads Sometimes, to make sure a gift doesn't disappoint, you just have to spend a little bit of coin. And if dad doesn't have his own pair of noise-canceling headphones to listen to his favorite tunes, then he'll be delighted to discover what he's missing. His first soundbar Best home theater gift idea Modern TVs are incredible technological achievements with only two flaws: motion smoothing and weak internal speakers. We can't promise dad will ever stop using motion smoothing, but the uber-popular Vizio V-Series soundbar will deliver surround sound to his home theater. A new pair of sneakers Best dad shoes for dad New Balance has perfected the dad shoe, and these walking sneakers are the perfect blend of hip and, well, dad. We're partial to this handsome olive green colorway, but there are tons more options available depending on dad's style (or lack thereof). A pickleball starter set Best for dads who can play Pickleball is taking over the world, and the beauty of this sport is that anyone can play. Whether dad has a competitive streak or just wants an excuse to spend time with the grandkids, this starter set has what he needs to discover America's new favorite pastime. A new outdoor backpack Best for outdoorsman dads Did your dad teach you everything you know about hiking and outdoor safety? Us too. Osprey makes high-quality and adventure-ready backpacks that any outdoorsman would be proud to own, like the roomy Daylite Plus. Extra-comfy memory foam moccasins Best for walking around Is your dad the type of guy who loves his Crocs? Then give him some comfy around-the-house footwear that's more appropriate for cold weather. These cozy moccasins have a memory foam footbed and will work well even if dad has wide feet. A timeless Timex watch Best for punctual dads Some watches are truly timeless. Unfortunately, most of them cost upwards of $5,000. However, this Timex is the exception. No matter which color you choose, the Timex Expedition watch has a classic style that's perfect for everyday wear. A Yellowstone cast-iron skillet Best for Costner fans Does your dad love Kevin Costner the TV show \"Yellowstone\"? He's not the only one. This year, surprise him with this limited-edition Lodge skillet inspired by the hit TV show. It may be a limited-edition, but a Lodge skillet will last a lifetime.
