  "text": "A warming world will — and is already having — a profound impact on the things we all depend on: shelter, food, water, energy, medicine. Most nations have committed to drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to dial back the planet’s thermostat.  But true sustainability is not just about emissions. We will need to transform the way all industries operate — from agriculture to transport and health — to meet the SDGs. The great green transition necessitates innovation. It calls for new, clean technologies and the scaling of proven ones. It requires industry leaders, disruptive innovators, and ambitious startups to create the blueprints for a sustainable world. “Sustainable societies require systems, infrastructures, and propositions that facilitate and stimulate people to take better care of themselves and their surroundings, as private individuals and as professionals,” says Andy Lürling, founding partner at LUMOLabs. The sprouts of change are already visible. Climate action is accelerating faster now than ever before. But we need to keep going. This is why we’ve made Sustainable Societies one of the six refreshed themes of TNW Conference 2025, taking place on June 19 and 20 in Amsterdam. The theme is for climate warriors. It’s for startups, investors, innovators leading the charge in the climate, energy, health, and agrifood industries. It’s also for anyone — from big execs to young innovators — who want to deepen their understanding of the myriad ways technology can drive the sustainability shift.   “I foresee that the real value of emerging and disruptive technologies such as AI, blockchain, and AR/VR, lies in their convergence,” says Lürling, who’s an advisory board member for the TNW Conference. “Together they hold the key to structurally disrupting widespread degenerative habits and systems.” We understand that sustainability requires a holistic approach, across industries. That’s why we’ve divided the Sustainable Societies theme into four pillars.  Turning the Tide: The innovations tackling the water crisis Farm to Table: An insider’s look at the future of food Hacking the Human: Building a sustainable healthcare system, from engineered proteins to cell-based therapies Waste Not, Watt Not: Turning environmental issues into opportunities If you want to hear all about these ideas, you can grab a ticket for TNW Conference now.
