  "text": "Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann One of the things a Dutch oven does best is sear and cook \"low and slow.\" Sauces reduce, sugars caramelize, and meats brown with great success in these pots, but your food won’t be the only thing left with a brown crust. The creamy white interior of enameled Dutch ovens can get pretty gunky. Here are some ways to clean stubborn crud, and prevent more from building up. 1. Boiling is your best friend If you try to clean burnt sauce and stuck meat residue right off of the stove, you’ll likely ruin your sponge on the first pass. Don’t attempt to scratch it off with steel wool or your fingernails (you want to keep those). Your first line of attack is loosening any burnt-on crud with a good old fashioned boiling. To do this, fill your Dutch oven about three-quarters full or with enough warm water to submerge the burnt food. Throw your pot back on the burner and bring it to a boil. Putting the lid on will help the water boil faster and loosen anything that might be stuck to the inside of the lid too. Let the water simmer and soften the food residue for about 15 minutes. You’ll likely see the water lifting material already. Using a sturdy utensil, like a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape around the bottom and sides of the pot. Remove the pot from the heat and dump out the hot water. Scrape at any missed spots with the wooden spoon and then clean the pot again, but this time with warm, soapy water and a sponge. Dry it off thoroughly.2. Add baking soda to the mixAfter a couple weeks of serious usage, you may start to see some discoloration, or stubborn streaks and brown staining around the inside of the Dutch oven. If your regular boiling with water method isn’t cutting through, add a tablespoon of baking soda to the soaking water per every four cups of water. Let the alkaline solution simmer for about 15 minutes with the lid on (again, so the steam can soften any stains on the lid’s interior). I throw a sponge straight into the pot and scrub around the stained areas with a wooden spoon. This might take a bit of elbow grease but the baking soda will help lift those stains if you keep at it. You can see a faint line in the picture of where the boiling baking soda water ended and I didn’t scrub with the sponge. Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann Spot treat with more baking soda. If you have some stuck stains, you can make a paste with baking soda and a few drops of water. Rub the baking soda paste into these stubborn areas. The gentle abrasive nature of the paste is often enough to lift the stain.3. Bleach out remaining stainsI have not attempted to use a bleach solution yet, but America’s Test Kitchen recommends it for brightening up the interior of your enamel-finished Dutch oven. To do so, make a solution of one part bleach to three parts water and pour it into the pot. Let it sit overnight and the next day, after rinsing and washing it out thoroughly, you’ll reveal a perfectly spotless interior. As always when working with bleach, make sure the room is well-ventilated. What do you think so far? I’ve seen a great deal on Reddit about Barkeeper’s Friend—both good and bad. There are as many folks recommending it on enameled Dutch ovens as there are folks prohibiting it. My advice is, like trying new skincare or protecting suede boots—always test a new product on a small, out of sight area to see how it goes. Those who hate Barkeeper’s on enamel say it can dull the finish and wear down the enamel. So if you do try it, do so in a small area, wash it off and see how it looks on your cookware.Another recommendation from the good folks of the internet was trying out a melamine sponge (Magic Eraser). These can also be abrasive and dull finishes, like paint, but I tried it on a small stain with no dulling effect—but also no success with the stain, so i quickly ditched that idea.Prevent stainingThe best way to get rid of stains is to keep the tough ones from forming. Like most cookware, you shouldn't cook using more than medium-low to medium heat. I know our stoves can go up to a high flame, but most pot and pan manufacturers recommend against this. Instead, let the Dutch oven preheat thoroughly with some oil inside. The heavy duty cast iron will hold onto that heat and it’ll be plenty for searing meats and veggies. If you’ve been cooking on the stove top and plan to finish the food in the oven, always wipe down the outside of the Dutch oven before making the move. Sometimes little dribbles of fat will be chilling on the exterior and those fats can polymerize in the oven, appearing like blackened tears running down the face of your perfect Dutch oven. Carefully wipe down the outside with a paper towel or slightly soapy, damp sponge now, so the pot doesn’t cry later.  Allie Chanthorn Reinmann Food Editor Allie has been Lifehacker’s Food Writer since 2021.
