  "text": "With all the laptops available on the market, it is hard to find one that perfectly matches your need. The majority of them offer good performance or great appearances, but few offer the kind of raw power and capability that can support the needs of both power users and serious students. That is why this HP 17.3″ laptop with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD (and a Ryzen 5 processor) is such an amazing deal available on Amazon today. It’s a monster made for those that won’t settle for anything less when it comes to speed, storage, or multi-tasking capability. Right now, Amazon has slashed the price of this laptop to just $979 which is a staggering 63% off its typical price of $2,659. This is the lowest price we’ve ever seen for this configuration. And as a bonus, you’ll also get a wireless mouse and a 4-in-1 docking station included. See at Amazon All About Performance Running on an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor with 6 cores and 12 threads, it has a top-end turbo frequency of up to 4.3GHz. With integrated AMD Radeon Graphics, everything is smooth from business presentations to photo editing or watching streams. The gargantuan 64GB of DDR4 RAM is simply fantastic at this price, and allows you to have several CPU-hungry apps open simultaneously without even a hint of lag. The 2TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides lightning-fast boot times and file transfers along with enough space to store years’ worth of documents. You’ll never have to worry about running out of room even if you’re working with massive datasets or a sprawling media library. The laptop also comes with Windows 11 Pro and a lifetime license for Microsoft Office Pro, so you’re ready for productivity right out of the box. The 17.3-inch Full HD IPS display offers a spacious and immersive viewing experience: The 250-nit brightness and anti-glare coating are ideal for comfortable use in any lighting condition and the numeric keypad on the full-size keyboard is ideal for data entry. Connectivity doesn’t get better than Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, USB ports, and an integrated webcam for video conferencing and online courses. Despite its bulk and heft, the HP 17″ laptop is sleek and professional in natural silver, with a robust build that will survive the rigors of daily use. Battery life is decent, at up to 8 hours on one charge, which is remarkable for a laptop with such cutting-edge features. For students, remote employees, or if you’re looking for a high-powered computer, this HP model is hard to beat (especially at the current price on Amazon). See at Amazon",
