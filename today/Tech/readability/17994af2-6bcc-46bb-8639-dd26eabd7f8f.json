On Google's end, the search giant launched new Gemini-powered AI tools for users to learn foreign languages. Dubbed Little Language Lessons, the experimental feature offers three interactive lessons that \"personalize language learning.\" For instance, \"Tiny Lesson\" can help you learn phrases for specific situations (such as losing your passport), while \"Slang Hang\" helps users learn local slang for less-stuffy conversation. Finally, \"Word Cam\" lets Gemini look at objects in your photos and labels them in the language you're learning. Duolingo, on the other hand, is going full speed ahead with generative AI. The company announced this week that it would stop relying on human contractors for \"work that AI can handle,\" while also committing to using AI in hiring and performance reviews. On top of that, Duolingo announced on Wednesday that it used generative AI to come up with 148 new language learning courses, doubling its total course offerings.The large language models behind Google Gemini and other popular AI tools have proved particularly adept at translation. Duolingo certainly believes the technology has big potential for language learning.

Learning another language is an inherently social activity, something a person usually does if they want to interact with other humans on a deeper level. Practically speaking, language learning usually requires human-to-human engagement.For its part, Google says it's not trying to replace human instruction. A Google blog post reads, \"These experiments aren’t about replacing traditional study, but about complementing it: helping people build habits, stay engaged, and weave learning into their everyday lives.\"",
