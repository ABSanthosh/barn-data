Funding into newer tech firms remains complex, with Startup Genome reporting that while the Beijing, Los Angeles and Tokyo startup landscapes are seeing YoY growth, Paris is flat and the rest of the European ecosystem is in decline. Meanwhile, the technology landscape continues to evolve at an accelerating pace. As Deloitte’s 2025 Tech Trends report states: “technology optimisation and transformation have never been more important as innovation continues to fuel innovation.” This is creating a landscape where large enterprises are struggling to be on the front foot of technology adoption, while juggling the impacts of economic and geopolitical uncertainty and shifting regulations. Meanwhile, startups are hustling to develop solutions to enterprise problems in an ecosystem with lower than usual venture capital investment. All in all: the zeitgeist is fast-paced, complicated, and confusing… but it’s pretty exciting to be part of what is truly a historic moment for the world’s relationship with technology. As I shared with industry leaders at The Next Web’s ‘Innovating at Scale’ panel, this turbulence has forced a rethink of what it means to operate and innovate at scale. In this environment, resilience isn’t just about weathering storms; it’s about evolving in real time, making decisions with imperfect information and finding opportunity in volatility. The reality of volatility: our experience 2024 was brutal for many in the technology sector. The industry whiplashed from pandemic-fuelled overhiring to a sharp correction, all while economic fragility tested even the strongest partnerships. Delayed payments, vanished purchase orders and a rise in ‘ghosting’ became the norm for suppliers, as organisations were increasingly pressured to deliver more with fewer resources. Yet in 2025, amid the unpredictability, there is a palpable sense of renewal. We’re seeing a resurgence in growth-focused investment, which has materialized for us in the form of a spike in marketing and communications briefs, as businesses recalibrate for a world where resilience, agility and purpose are not optional extras but central to survival. This is good news for the technology sector, and great news for Clarity as a technology focussed digital marketing and communications agency. But we’re not out of the woods yet and, as we discussed in my panel at The Next Web Conference, we all need to be playing multiple moves ahead. Lessons from Innovation Under Pressure, the panel I hosted at The Next Web Conference 2025 At The Next Web, I was privileged to host a panel with leaders from organisations at the forefront of global innovation: Monika Tomczak-Górlikowska, Group Head of Privacy, Digital \u0026 Regulatory at Prosus Group (an ecosystem for lifestyle e-commerce entrepreneurs); Ernesto Lasalandra, Chief Research \u0026 Development Officer at Ferrari; Shez Partovi, Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Business Leader Healthcare Informatics, Philips; and Seth Dobrin, Co-Founding General Partner, 1Infinity Ventures (a global responsible AI fund). Their experiences underscored a universal truth that most in the business world have now accepted: innovation at scale is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. A few key themes emerged: 1. Regulation is now a core business competency: Technology firms’ success demands that legal, privacy and cybersecurity voices are not just consulted, but embedded in the innovation process. Regulatory change and policy discussions must not be ignored, they are signals to prioritise, adapt and build solutions that will endure across borders and business models. 2. Partnership is the engine of progress: Whether it’s Ferrari’s open innovation approach, where thousands of startups are scrutinised for their potential to drive (pardon the pun) next-generation solutions, or Philips’ customer-driven partnerships to solve real-world pain points, the message is clear: innovation thrives in ecosystems not silos. The most transformative ideas solve genuine problems and are developed in collaboration with partners, suppliers and, most importantly, customers. 3. Culture is critical: Across the panel there was consensus that innovation must be woven into the fabric of the business, not siloed in a standalone team. This means cultivating a culture where experimentation is encouraged, failure is reframed as learning and agility is prized over perfection. Members of the panel flagged that an obsession with perfection was potentially a key boulder holding the European tech ecosystem from competing more strongly with the U.S. and key APAC markets. As Shez Partovi of Philips put it, “…if you don’t change your mind a lot, you’re probably wrong a lot.” Now, Near, Next: Building resilience for whatever comes next So, how can businesses not only survive, but thrive in this change-centric environment? At Clarity, we guide our clients to adopt a “Now, Near, Next” mindset, one that aligns immediate action with longer-term vision, all powered by data and relentless agility and adaptation. The ‘Now’ is about managing risk and protecting reputation today. In an era of 24/7 scrutiny, every company is just one misstep away from a crisis. Clear, consistent communications and robust stakeholder engagement are the foundations of trust. ‘Near’ focuses on sustaining innovation and growth. This means investing in partnerships, nurturing talent through powerful employee communications and building the capacity to pivot when disruption strikes. Businesses must constantly be asking: what do we need to change in the next 12 months to stay relevant? Finally, ‘Next’ is about future-proofing: embedding purpose, ethics and sustainability into strategy. As AI, regulation and societal expectations evolve, the winners will be those who anticipate change and act with conviction. Influence the world, impact the future Taking the ‘Now, Near, Next’ approach is not just a communications and marketing strategy, it’s a business imperative. The world isn’t slowing down, and neither can we. By embracing regulatory complexity, forging purposeful partnerships and building a culture of constant learning, businesses can not only navigate uncertainty, but define the future on their own terms. Because in a world of relentless change, Clarity isn’t just what we offer our clients, it’s what every business needs to move forward with confidence.",
