Credit: Randy Litzinger/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images \"Seven hours of RedZone football starts here.\" That’s how Scott Hanson opened Sunday’s broadcast, with his usual upbeat energy — but this time, with a twinge of irony. Why? Because last week (and again this week), the NFL’s RedZone channel — long celebrated for its uninterrupted, ad-free blitz of touchdowns and drama — broke its sacred covenant: it ran commercials.Naturally, fans are losing it. Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted When the Dec. 15 broadcast featured ads, an NFL spokesperson told Awful Announcing it was just a “test.” Hanson even threw out an apology for claiming the broadcast would remain commercial-free, which, spoiler, it wasn’t. Fans hoped it was a one-off. A hiccup. A blip. Mashable Top Stories But then came Sunday. And yeah, those ads were back.For those unfamiliar, NFL RedZone offers a fast-paced, all-access look at every touchdown and pivotal moment across the league, stripping away the downtime and fluff typical of most game broadcasts. It has earned a devoted fanbase precisely because it prioritizes constant action.That’s what makes the sudden presence of commercials feel like such a betrayal to its audience. The shift, subtle as it may seem, represents a breach of what made RedZone unique. X (formerly known as Twitter) has been flooded with backlash, with fans accusing the NFL of putting profits over the integrity of the service. Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted While the NFL has yet to confirm whether this is a permanent change, fans shouldn't hold their breath for a return to commercial-free football.
