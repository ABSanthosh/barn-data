Liz Kocan has spent the last 20 years covering TV, entertainment and working behind the scenes in digital production. While at VH1.com, she won a Webby Award and was nominated for a Shorty Award as a producer. She has also contributed her writing to USA Today, Decider, Vulture, and many other publications, and has seen every episode of 30 Rock more times than her mind grapes can remember. Netflix has quite a few new titles in store for fans this month, including some action-packed originals and a new batch of riveting documentaries. Tyler Perry's latest original for the streamer, Straw, arrives this month and stars Taraji P. Henson as a woman so desperate she'll do anything to save her sick daughter. For a dose of real-life drama, check out Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy, an in-depth look at the 2021 event that left 10 concertgoers dead in Houston. A collection of Alfred Hitchcock films -- including classics like Vertigo and Rear Window -- is among some of the acquired titles arriving in the Netflix library this month, too. (The streamer is also debuting several Hitchcock-inspired films as a part of the collection, including the 2022 film Barbarian and Jordan Peele's Us.)If you're tired of the same old choices, check out which movies -- new and old -- are coming to Netflix this June.Read more: The Hottest Movies Coming in 2025 Paramount Pictures Rear Window and more (June 1) Among Netflix's newly acquired library movies this month, you'll find a large collection of some of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films. The new arrivals include The Birds, Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Frenzy and the James Stewart-Grace Kelly classic, Rear Window. (That other Hitchcock classic, Psycho, is already available on the platform.) The Hitchcock collection will also include the 2012 narrative feature about the filmmaker himself, called Hitchcock, directed by Sacha Gervasi. Screenshot by Meara Isenberg/CNET Barbarian (June 1) Writer-director Zach Cregger's 2022 film Barbarian is a delightfully twisty horror movie about the downsides of short-term rentals. Tess (Georgina Campbell) and Keith (Bill Skarsgard) are two strangers who meet when it turns out they've been double-booked on a housing rental site and decide to both stay in their rental house together. But Keith is not the one Tess needs to worry about; soon Tess discovers a labyrinthine basement and something (or someone) living there; that's when the horror begins. The film comes to Netflix on June 1. Claudette Barius/Universal Studios Us (2019) Jordan Peele's recent career path has veered pretty far from the sketch comedy world he started in, and his 2019 film Us is one of several great psychological thrillers he's written and directed that pay homage to classics like The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock. Us stars Lupita Nyong'o as Adelaide, a woman whose family is haunted by eerie doppelg√§ngers called the Tethered -- identical lookalikes who terrorize them in a chilling quest to steal their souls. The film arrives on Netflix June 1. Netflix K.O. (June 6) After a supporting role in Den of Thieves: Pantera, French MMA fighter and actor Cyril Gane is headlining K.O., a Netflix action film that makes use of his extensive martial arts skills. Gane stars as Bastien, a former MMA star who has lived a solitary life after accidentally killing a rival, Enzo, during a fight. When Enzo's teenage son goes missing, his widow tracks down Bastien to help find the boy whose life is in danger. Netflix Straw (June 6) In Tyler Perry's newest film, Straw, Taraji P. Henson plays a woman pushed to the brink. Henson stars as Janiyah, a single mother to a sick child who requires medication. When Janiyah is faced with an overwhelming obstacle at the bank while trying to get money for the medicine, she ends up taking everyone in the bank hostage. The turbulent, emotional drama co-stars Sherri Shepherd, Teyana Taylor, Glynn Turman and Sinbad, and premieres June 6. Netflix Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy (June 10) This month marks the return of Netflix's Trainwreck documentary franchise, which explores some of the most sensational or disastrous news stories of the recent past. Trainwreck: The Astroworld Tragedy (June 10) is the first film in the new batch, and will dig deep into the tragic Astroworld concert that left 10 fans dead after chaos ensued at Travis Scott's 2021 performance. Seven more installments of Trainwreck will drop over the summer, one each week through July 29. Netflix Our Times (June 11) Our Times is a Mexican sci-fi romantic comedy about a pair of married scientists, Hector and Nora (Benny Ibarra and Lucero), who discover a way to time travel from 1966 to the present day. Once they're in 2025, Nora thrives in a world more accepting of women in science and she wants to stay, while Hector struggles and wants to return to the past. But can they even find a way back? Netflix Titan: The OceanGate Disaster (June 11) Back in June 2023, the Titan submersible went missing while on a tourist trip to visit the wreckage of the Titanic. Days later, the vessel was found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after it imploded during its descent with all five of its passengers on board. Titan: The OceanGate Disaster examines OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush -- who was piloting the ill-fated underwater mission -- and the lengths he went to in the name of deep-sea exploration. Netflix KPop Demon Hunters (June 20) What if a world-famous KPop girl group were secretly supernatural demon hunters? That's the premise of KPop Demon Hunters, the new animated feature arriving on Netflix on June 20. The family film from Sony Pictures Animation features the voices of Arden Cho, Joel Kim Booster, Ken Jeong, Ahn Hyo-seop and May Hong. Warner Bros. The Intern (June 22) Somehow, up until now, there's only been one Nancy Meyers film available on Netflix. (The Holiday -- you know, the one that stars Jude Law as Mr. Napkin Head.) But that will change when the 2015 comedy The Intern arrives this month. Despite the great cast with Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo and Robert DeNiro, the film doesn't have the cultural cache of some of Meyers' other films, but it's still a super charming affair. DeNiro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retiree who can't sit still, so he gets a job as an intern at a fashion start-up run by Hathaway's character, Jules Ostin. Initially dismissive of old-guy Ben, the two form a sweet bond as Ben becomes something of a confidante to his boss. (And yes, Jules has a great kitchen in her Brooklyn brownstone -- What, you think she wouldn't?) The Intern premieres on Netflix June 22. Other Services \u0026 Software",

Days later, the vessel was found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after it imploded during its descent with all five of its passengers on board. Titan: The OceanGate Disaster examines OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush -- who was piloting the ill-fated underwater mission -- and the lengths he went to in the name of deep-sea exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"ee69ef14-aa7a-42bc-ac1a-2587213fd8fd\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-ee69ef14-aa7a-42bc-ac1a-2587213fd8fd\" data-location=\"LIST\" data-position=\"9\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e \u003cimg src=\"\" alt=\"\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNetflix\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eKPop Demon Hunters (June 20)\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat if a world-famous KPop girl group were secretly supernatural demon hunters?

(The Holiday -- you know, the one that stars Jude Law as \u003ca href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/jude-law-holiday-mr-napkinhead-christmas-new-years-traditions/\" target=\"_self\"\u003eMr. Napkin Head\u003c/a\u003e.) But that will change when the 2015 comedy The Intern arrives this month. Despite the great cast with Anne Hathaway, Rene Russo and Robert DeNiro, the film doesn\u0026#39;t have the cultural cache of some of Meyers\u0026#39; other films, but it\u0026#39;s still a super charming affair. DeNiro stars as Ben Whittaker, a retiree who can\u0026#39;t sit still, so he gets a job as an intern at a fashion start-up run by Hathaway\u0026#39;s character, Jules Ostin. Initially dismissive of old-guy Ben, the two form a sweet bond as Ben becomes something of a confidante to his boss. (And yes, Jules has a great kitchen in her Brooklyn brownstone -- What, you think she wouldn\u0026#39;t?) The Intern premieres on Netflix June 22.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cdiv data-cy=\"articleLinkBlock\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n      Other Services \u0026amp; Software\n    \u003c/span\u003e \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
