  "text": "Hope you weren't already sick of Godzilla fighting Marvel heroes, because he's already gearing up for some rematches. Back in March, Marvel launched a crossover comic featuring its heroes going up against Godzilla. That miniseries only has two issues out right now, but it’s certainly not a one-and-done, because there’s already a sequel book coming, and it sounds like the King of the Monsters is really playing for keeps this time. On Friday, Marvel announced the five-issue event series Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe from Gerry Duggan (X-Men) and Javier Garrón (Avengers) wherein the big lizard has woken up again for the first time in years. After losing their first fight against him, the heroes of the Marvel universe reach out to its biggest villains to see if they’ve got any good ideas for how to stop him. (The Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man, and Avengers are all accounted for, but the villains they’ll team with are currently under wraps.) All the while, Godzilla himself is stomping around Earth and other realms like the Dark Dimension. And if that weren’t enough, the press release teases he has some kind of connection to Vibranium over in Wakanda—between this and the Predator last year, the resource sure is drawing a lot of attention from outside players. Like its predecessor, Destroys is part of a larger celebration for Godzilla’s 70th anniversary. Toho International general manager Kristin Parcell called back to the character’s old crossovers with Marvel decades ago and called this new miniseries “the perfect way to celebrate 70 years of the King of Monsters. Our continued collaboration with Marvel, bringing Godzilla into the vast Marvel Universe, guarantees an unmatched, electrifying experience for fans of both legendary franchises.” If that sounds like your monster jam, Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe stomps into stores on July 16, two weeks after Godzilla vs. wraps up on July 2.
