  "description": "An anonymous reader shared this report from Kotaku: One of the most striking things about Bungie's Marathon is its presentation. The sci-fi extraction shooter combines bleak settings with bright colors in a way that makes it feel a bit like a sneaker promo meets Ghost in the Shell, or as designer Jeremy Skoog put it, \"Y2K Cyberpunk mixed with Acid Graphic Design Posters.\" But it now looks like at least a few of the visual design elements that appeared in the recent alpha test were lifted from eight-year old work by an outside artist. \"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,\" Bluesky user antire.alâ posted on Thursday. She shared two images showing elements of her work and where they appeared in Marathon's gameplay, including a rotated version of her own logo. A poster full of small repeating icon patterns also seems to be all but recreated in Marathon's press kit ARG and website... Bungie has responded and blamed the incident on a former employee. The studio says it's reaching out to the artist in question and conducting a full review of its in-game assets for Marathon [\"and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions.\"] \"We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game,\" the studio posted on X. \"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission...\" their X post emphasizes. \"We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
