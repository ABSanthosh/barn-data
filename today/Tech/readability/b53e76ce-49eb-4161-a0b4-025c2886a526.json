  "description": "Remember First Light Fusion? Founded in 2011, it was a pioneering British startup that in 2022 \"successfully combined atomic nuclei, which U.K. regulators called a milestone in the decades-long push for fusion energy. It's now \"pulled the plug on plans to build its first reactor,\" reports the Telegraph, abandoning its push for a prototype power plant based on its \"projectile fusion\" technology due to a lack of funding. The technology involves a 5p-sized projectile being fired at a fuel cell at extreme speeds using electromagnets to generate a powerful reaction and simulate collisions at extremely high speeds, such as those in space. Instead of building its own plant, First Light plans to supply other nuclear power companies with one of its inventions, called an \"amplifier\", which houses a nuclear fuel capsule and boosts the power of fusion reactions. The group has burned through tens of millions of pounds trying to bring its technology to fruition... The decision to ditch its original plan will allow First Light Fusion to be more \"capital light\", the nuclear group said in March, while licensing its inventions would generate more revenues. The company said it had recently secured the first tranche of a new funding round. Mark Thomas, First Light Fusion's chief executive, said: \"We have been very pleased with the response to our strategy pivot, moving to an enabler of inertial fusion while rapidly accelerating revenues... First Light Fusion's other investors include Chinese technology giant Tencent. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
