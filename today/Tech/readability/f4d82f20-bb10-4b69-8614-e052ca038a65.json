  "text": "May 29, 2025 [[read-time]] min read Today we’re sharing a report highlighting results from the more than 1 million graduates of the Google Career Certificates program, including more than 350,000 graduates in the U.S. Chris B., Google Certificate Graduate At Grow with Google, we set out to address a societal challenge: expanding access to great jobs and fostering economic security for more people. That’s why, seven years ago, we began offering practical pathways to new jobs through the Google Career Certificates program. This initiative now has a growing community of over one million graduates globally, including more than 350,000 in the U.S. 1 Today, we’re excited to share our Google Career Certificates Impact Report which highlights the power of collaboration, the effectiveness of skills-based training, and the ability to deliver impact at scale.We celebrate the success of our graduates — with over 70% of our U.S. graduates reporting a positive career outcome (new job, promotion, or raise) alongside a powerful network of partners. This includes hundreds of educational institutions around the country who have integrated our certificates into their programs and thousands of businesses who use our AI courses to invest in their teams’ growth. We also partner with 150+ companies in our Grow with Google Employer Consortium who hire Google Career Certificate graduates or upskill their existing employees with our training program, including Siemens, T-Mobile, Wells Fargo and of course, Google.With U.S. search interest for upskilling and reskilling hitting an all-time high this year 2 , and “how to change jobs” also hitting all-time highs, providing pathways to accessible, affordable and flexible skills training is more crucial than ever.Take Chris for example, a 20-year Marine Corps veteran. He's among the 1 in 10 graduates from our programs who are part of the military community — including service members, military spouses and veterans — who are finding new careers through our programs. His journey involved spending four years as a stay-at-home dad before deciding to pursue a career in cybersecurity — with no previous experience in the field. He enrolled in the Google Cybersecurity Certificate via Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF). We’re proud to partner with and support IVMF, an organization dedicated to helping service members and their families transition into new careers, with funding from Google.org.After completing the certificate, Chris used his new knowledge to impress hiring managers during a tough, tech-heavy interview, ultimately earning the position of Intrusion Analyst Apprentice at a cybersecurity company — a position he loves. “This is the job I want to keep doing forever,” he says. “I get up in the morning excited to work.”Looking ahead, we’ll continue to help Americans find their passions and access great jobs by ensuring Google Career Certificates prepare people like Chris for the jobs of today and tomorrow. In addition to field-specific AI training, every Google Career Certificate now includes an optional new course: Accelerate Your Job Search with AI. This course empowers learners to navigate their job search efficiently and confidently, by guiding them to use AI to create a job search plan, elevator pitch, resume and more.You can learn more about Google Career Certificates at grow.google/certificates",
