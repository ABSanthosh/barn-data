  "description": "New research has found that large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT consistently advise women to ask for lower salaries than men, even when both have identical qualifications. The study¬†was co-authored by Ivan Yamshchikov, a professor of AI and robotics at the Technical University of W√ºrzburg-Schweinfurt (THWS) in Germany. Yamshchikov, who is also the founder of Pleias, a French‚ÄìGerman startup building ethically trained language models for regulated industries, worked with his team to test five popular LLMs, including ChatGPT. They prompted each model with user profiles that differed only by gender but included the same education, experience, and job role.‚Ä¶This story continues at The Next Web",
