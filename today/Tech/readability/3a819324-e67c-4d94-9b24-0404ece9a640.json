It’s why we’ve developed world-class systems for detecting and preventing fraud, and block millions of attempted scams every day across our different products and services.It’s also why today we’re sharing more information about a new partnership to help fight scams, as well as announcing how Cross-Account Protection is actively protecting 3.2 billion users, since we first announced it earlier this year.Global Signal ExchangeToday we are announcing a new partnership with the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) and DNS Research Federation (DNSRF) to launch the Global Signal Exchange (GSE). The GSE is a new project with the ambition to be a global clearinghouse for online scams and fraud bad actor signals, with Google becoming its first Founding Member.This collaboration leverages the strengths of each partner: GASA's extensive network of stakeholders, the DNS Research Federation's robust data platform with already over 40 million signals, and Google's experience in combating scams and fraud. By joining forces and establishing a centralized platform, GSE aims to improve the exchange of abuse signals, enabling faster identification and disruption of fraudulent activities across various sectors, platforms and services. The goal is to create a user-friendly, efficient solution that operates at an internet-scale, and is accessible to qualifying organizations, with GASA and the DNS Research Federation managing access.The GSE seeks to address the complex issue of online fraud and scams signal sharing. We have had a long history of partnering with Priority Flaggers around the world to take in scam signals. In this initial pilot of the data platform, Google was for the first time able to share over 100,000 URLs of bad Shopping merchants and as part of the same test, ingest 1 million scam signals. We'll start by sharing URLs that we have actioned under our scams policies, and as we gain experience from the pilot, we will look to add data soon from other relevant Google product areas.The data engine powering the platform runs on Google Cloud Platform and will allow participants to both share and consume signals gathered by others while benefiting from Google Cloud Platform’s AI capabilities to find patterns and match signals smartly.As part of this announcement, Google is supporting the DNS Research Federation and GASA with new funding to launch the GSE. We have also developed a partnership enabling the sending and receiving of signals related to scam and fraud activities across relevant and in-scope products and services related to online scams and fraud.We know from experience that fighting scams and the criminal organizations behind them requires strong collaboration among industry, businesses, civil society and governments to combat bad actors and protect users. We’re committed to doing our part to protect users, including through our continued work developing tools, publishing research, and sharing expertise and information with others to protect people online.Cross-Account ProtectionIn May, we announced Cross-Account Protection, a tool which enables ongoing cooperation between platforms in the fight against abuse. Today we’re sharing that Cross-Account Protection is actively protecting 3.2 billion users across sites and apps where they sign in with their Google Account. This helps support our commitment to keeping you safe on Google platforms — and beyond. You can see which sites and apps support Cross-Account Protection in your Google Account settings. Cross-Account Protection is free and automatically available when sites and apps integrate Sign in with Google, allowing Google to share security notifications — in a privacy-preserving way — about suspicious events with the apps and services you’ve connected to your Google Account. Collaboration is critical to protect people across the internet, and that's why we're proud to be partnering with your favorite sites and apps on Cross-Account Protection, including Canva, Electronic Arts and Indeed. In turn, third-party apps and services can use Google’s suspicious event detection to help keep you safer online and prevent cybercriminals from gaining and maintaining a foothold across your many online accounts.",
