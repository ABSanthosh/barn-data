The LA-based band, known for their dreamy songs in both English and Spanish like “No One Noticed” and “Lejos de Ti,” have kicked off the second leg of The Submarine Tour (Extended) in North America.To celebrate, the band curated an exclusive Google Maps list highlighting “dream spots” that inspire creativity. It includes everything from art galleries and green spaces to vintage shops and drive-in movie theaters. Discover more than 100 of the band’s favorite places across their tour cities including Albuquerque, Los Angeles, Raleigh, Tucson and Vancouver. Want to create your own list like The Marías?
