General summary Google announced several new AI tools and initiatives in February. These include a career exploration tool, a free AI coding assistant, and a new AI system for scientists. Google also released Deep Research on the Gemini mobile app and expanded Flood Hub with advanced features to help communities prepare for and respond to floods. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Bullet points Google shared its latest AI news from February, highlighting advancements in various fields. Google's CEO believes AI is the most profound shift in our lifetimes and is already unlocking benefits for people and society. Google launched a new AI tool called Career Dreamer to help people explore career possibilities and craft professional materials. Google released a free AI coding assistant for developers, providing AI-assisted coding help and code review assistance. Google brought its video generation model, Veo 2, to YouTube Shorts, allowing creators to generate high-quality videos with AI backgrounds and clips. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Basic explainer Google announced a bunch of new AI tools in February! They're using AI to help people find new careers, write code, make videos, and even do research. They're also using AI to help scientists discover new medicines and to warn people about floods. Google wants to make sure everyone benefits from AI, so they're working with other groups to make sure it's used for good. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Shakespeare-ish In February, Google's AI did advance, With tools for all, a helping hand and chance. From coding help to dreams of careers new, To flood response and research, bright and true. Gemini's power, a force for good and bright, With Deep Research, shedding knowledge's light. For scientists, a co-scientist's aid, And for creators, videos to be made. So let us use this power, wise and bold, To shape a future, stories yet untold. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! For more than 20 years, we’ve invested in machine learning and AI research, tools and infrastructure to build products that make everyday life better for more people. Teams across Google are working on ways to unlock AI’s benefits in fields as wide-ranging as healthcare, crisis response and education. To keep you posted on our progress, we're doing a regular roundup of Google's most recent AI news across products, research and more.Here’s a look back at just some of our AI announcements from February. In Paris earlier this month, our CEO Sundar Pichai shared why he believes AI is the most profound shift in our lifetimes and how it is already unlocking benefits for people, businesses, scientific discovery and society at scale. That’s why we continue to invest in the underlying technologies driving the AI shift. And it’s why we recently made Gemini 2.0 available to everyone — opening up a broad range of use cases and applications for businesses and developers, as well as bringing it to the Gemini app.As we continue to advance our frontier models, the benefits of AI will reach more people, faster. But it’s only one part of our big picture approach to AI. Here are some of the other helpful AI tools we announced in February. We launched a new experiment to help people explore more career possibilities. Our new AI tool Career Dreamer can analyze your background, skills and interests to help you identify potential career opportunities. Career Dreamer will even help you use Gemini — your AI assistant from Google — to craft a professional story and cover letter, and then discover training resources like Google Career Certificates.We released a free AI coding assistant. Developers have been using Gemini 2.0 Flash to build helpful applications for people. Now, developers can get free AI-assisted coding help — with the highest usage limits available — as well as code review assistance. This is another way to support developers as they create helpful apps and high-quality code.We brought Veo 2 to YouTube Shorts, opening up new possibilities for creators. Veo 2 is our latest video generation model that helps you create high-quality videos in a wide range of subjects and styles. Now, you can try it out the next time you create a YouTube Short using Dream Screen, a YouTube feature that takes a text prompt and generates AI backgrounds and even standalone video clips for Shorts. We released Deep Research on the Gemini mobile app so you can get answers on the go. Deep Research, now available for advanced users on the Gemini mobile app on Android and iOS, can help you generate comprehensive, easy-to-read reports on just about any research topic. It’s a time saver and new approach to accessing and distilling complex information, quickly.We launched a new AI system for scientists. With the release of our AI co-scientist, a new AI system built on Gemini 2.0, scientists and researchers have shown how we can use AI to create novel biomedical hypotheses and research plans. The system’s hypotheses have already seen preliminary validation in drug discovery and antimicrobial resistance research. We rolled out new advanced features for flood experts in Flood Hub. Floods continue to devastate communities worldwide, and AI-driven flood forecasting and response can help. Our new advanced features in Flood Hub — including inundation history maps and basin view — will help aid organizations and governments support vulnerable communities. We’re also expanding partnerships with international aid organizations like Give Directly and the International Rescue Committee to support people affected by floods. At the AI Action Summit in Paris, Sundar described this moment as the potential beginning of a golden age of innovation. AI-enabled advances are delivering generational progress in areas like health, energy, transportation, road safety and disaster response — and quickening the pace of scientific discovery. But, as Sundar noted, the greatest benefits of AI aren’t guaranteed. He shared what it will take to make the most of this historic moment, and how public leaders, the private sector and civil society can bring forward this age of innovation. To that end, in February, we also shared our new Policy Framework for Building the Future of Science and announced a new initiative to use AI to advance the treatment of women's cancer. It’s part of our broad effort to ensure the most capable AI is used to benefit everyone, across society.
