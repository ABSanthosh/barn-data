Yeni has also started a new role as Head of Ecosystem Strategy and Partnerships.  The appointment brings extensive expertise to TNW’s leadership — and fresh ideas.  “TNW has a long-standing track record of catalysing innovation,” says Yeni. “We now want to focus on going from legacy to measurable impact.” Yeni’s work will shape TNW’s influence within the world of tech. Her strategies will support the company’s mission to elevate high-potential startups. To meet this objective, Yeni will foster industry communities, identify emerging trends, and engage key stakeholders. She will also integrate the TNW Conference 2025 themes — Growth \u0026 Venture, The Next in Tech, and Enterprise Innovation — into ecosystem initiatives.  Yeni wants her work to shift the sector’s priorities. “It’s no longer just about company growth,” she says. “It’s about driving innovation, sustainability, and inclusion across the ecosystem as a whole.” To amplify TNW’s contribution, Yeni will tighten alignment with the company’s events and media. She will also lead several major programs. Chief among them is the Assembly, an exclusive gathering of policymakers and business leaders at TNW Conference. Attendees of the event will discuss actionable solutions to key tech policy developments.  Themes for the Assembly’s 2025 edition include defence tech — a timely pick with the NATO Summit arriving in Amsterdam one week later. European competitiveness is also on the agenda. Another program underway is Tech5 — a ranking to showcase leading scaleups from across Europe. The awards will be announced during TNW Conference 2025. Previous winners include Hopin, Too Good To Go, and Wolt. Yenni brings a wealth of experience to her new position. She has spent a decade at the intersection of tech and government policy, enjoying success in both the public and private sectors. Her resume boasts eye-catching roles at numerous industry leaders. It includes spells at StartupAmsterdam, the NLdigital trade association, and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, where she led the Netherlands’ Taskforce for Diversity and Inclusion in the digital industry. In 2020, Yeni joined TNW. She was previously Head of Ecosystems and Public Policy and the Dutch Startup Visa Facilitator — a role she will continue alongside her new position.
