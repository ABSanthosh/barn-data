This week, one report estimated that female founders in Europe secured just 12% of last year’s total VC funding. Another calculated that overlooking women-led deep tech firms over the past decade cost the economy €198.8bn. Yet there are also reasons for optimism. One is that the investment landscape is showing signs of progress. According to the Female Innovation Index, last year saw a 7% increase in round size and a 15% rise in M\u0026A activity for tech firms founded by women. Another source of hope is the transformative technologies emerging from their companies. As IWD approaches, we spoke to four women propelling powerful innovations in TNW’s home country, the Netherlands, about their work — and why the tech sector must do more for gender equity. Anne Berends, co-founder and CTO at SunLED Life Science The 💜 of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! Anne Berends has a rare blend of academic expertise and business nous. As a materials scientist and program director at Dutch LED pioneer Seaborough, she substantiated a compelling hypothesis: near-infrared light can improve our health and well-being. Under her watch, the idea grew into a new spin-off company: SunLED Life Science. As the co-founder and CTO, Berends shapes the technological and strategic direction of the business. She makes a clear case for supporting women in tech. “Half of the population is female, and girls consistently outperform boys in school,” she says. “The reality is that while there are countless women with brilliant, entrepreneurial ideas, they remain underrepresented in the startup world. This isn’t just a diversity issue; it’s a missed opportunity. When female founders are rare, valuable innovation and economic potential are left untapped.” To unlock this talent, she continues, funding access must improve. “It’s time for VCs and [private equity] firms to recognise this and actively invest in the next generation of women-led venture — because the talent is there, waiting to be unlocked.” Kiki Lauwers, CEO at Thorizon Like Berends, Kiki Lauwers has a glittering resume of business and scientific credentials. She holds a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Delft University of Technology and an MBA from INSEAD. After working at McKinsey, online retailer bol.com, and audiovisual business Kinly, she joined deep tech scaleup Thorizon as CEO in 2023. The company is developing a nuclear reactor with an unusual power source: molten salt. The approach could realise the dream of sustainable, and green nuclear energy. Lauwers sees two sides to her position as a woman leader in tech. “Being ‘different’ has its advantages — people remember you, and with all-male panels fading out, I get more opportunities to speak. But I also have to fight bias. I’m not here because I’m a woman; I’m here despite it,” she says. “Every day, I push against biases that I’m less technical, smart, persistent, or experienced. In a recent interview I was quoted as the ‘Belgian woman, and my peer was quoted as the ‘engineer from Delft’. I am an engineer with an MBA degree, a former strategy consultant with a lot of management experience, but sometimes, I do wonder if securing funding would be easier if my name were Peter.” Beyond the ethical issues, Lauwers emphasises the business argument for greater equality. “Europe’s deep tech sector needs all the talent it can get, which means encouraging more women to pursue STEM and highlighting engineering role models,” she says. “I’m proud that Thorizon has over 30% female employees.” Esther Bisschop, co-founder of Th3rd Esther Bisschop is an entrepreneur with a flair for storytelling. She deployed these skills to turn her startup — Th3rd — into a global leader in 3D scanning software. Th3rd’s digital models were a hit with clothing brands. Social media giants also recognised the tech’s value. In 2022, Snap acquired the Amsterdam-based business as part of a drive to embed AR into e-commerce. Bisschop points to the societal benefits of diversity in tech. “The world’s most pressing challenges won’t be solved by a select few, they require all of us. To build a better future, we need founders of different genders, backgrounds, ages, and cultures to drive innovation,” she says. “Investing in women founders isn’t just about fairness, it’s about unlocking the full potential of entrepreneurship.” Lea Milovich, CEO and co-founder at FlowBeams Lea Milovich has over 15 years of experience as a senior business development manager, team leader, and startup coach. In 2021, she added “founder” to her extensive list of professional achievements. The company she built — FlowBeams — began with the idea of applying tattoos without needles. The concept evolved into a non-invasive injection system for cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments. Milovich highlights the benefits of being a woman leader. “Being a female founder means navigating uncharted waters with hidden and declared biases. However, for me it has brought a unique perspective where resilience drives innovation much stronger,” she says. “I truly believe that, to unlock the potential of the tech ecosystem, we must actively invest in brave and brilliant women that are willing to risk their time and reputation, not as a gesture, but as a strategic imperative.” This year’s TNW Conference features a Women in Tech ticket. The pass provides 50% off access to the event, which takes place on June 19-20 in Amsterdam. TNW is also hosting a Female Founders’ Brunch on March 15. You can register here to attend.",
