  "description": "Black Friday and the holidays are a time for rest, and there are few better ways to unwind and relax by binging a good show or a few movies. The Disney+ and Hulu bundle has a ton of good content, and right now it only costs $36 for a one-year subscription thanks to Black Friday streaming deals. In other words, it’s $3 a month, which is a far cry from its usual $11-per-month price tag. However, only new users or subscribers who canceled their plans at least a month ago are eligible to redeem this discount. If you have an existing Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ or Disney Bundle subscription, the discount won’t apply. This bundle with ads contains content from Disney+ and Hulu. The content is still the same as with ad-free plans, including movies and series like Deadpool \u0026 Wolverine, Frozen, Godmothered and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, the anticipated Star Wars series only on Disney+. If some of these newer shows aren’t to your liking, there are likely older classics worth your time in the library. The deal runs from November 27 through December 2. After 12 months, the subscription will renew at the regular price if automatic renewal is enabled. Disney+ is one of the best streaming services out there, focusing on providing family-friendly content but also with some more mature content. If you want even more adult-oriented shows and series, Hulu fits the bill. Both have original content as well. There are a number of other Black Friday streaming deals available now as well as part of Black Friday subscription deals. Key among them are discounts on one year of Peacock and six months of Max. Here are more details: Peacock annual subscription for $20 (75 percent off): This Peacock Black Friday deal brings the price of one year of access to the ad-supported tier down to only $20. Note that the subscription will automatically renew at the regular rate after the first year, and the deal is only available to new subscribers who are not currently paying for Peacock. Paramount+ with Showtime two-month subscription for $6 (76 percent off): New and former subscribers can get two months of access to either the ad-supported tier Essentials or the Showtime tier for only $6 in this Paramount+ Black Friday deal. Essential lets you watch on three devices at once, while the premium tier includes access to Showtime originals and ad-free viewing (with the exception of live TV). Max 6-month subscription for $18 (70 percent off): This Max Black Friday deal gives you access to the Ads tier for $3 per month for the first six months, coming out to a total of only $18 for the promo period. New and returning Max subscribers can take advantage of this.
