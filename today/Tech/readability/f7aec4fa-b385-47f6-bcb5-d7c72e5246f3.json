  "text": "It's time for Super Bowl 2025 now, and sprinkled in between every play, the Kendrick Lamar halftime show and the winner's celebration are big ad rollouts. Not only are there some AI-themed spots, but there's a variety of commercials for food, services, beer, tech and a PSA for the bathroom. From nostalgic throwbacks like the Muppets gang, to golden-age women going on joyrides, to fans-turned-ad-stars, the ad parade has begun (and a few celebrities show up wearing and doing goofy stuff, too). We've compiled a rundown of ads that have already released and will continue to post during the game -- so expect a few movie trailers to come out along with product brands.Read more: Fox Sports Will Stream the Super Bowl in 4K for Free on TubiInstacart: Brand icons on a sprintIn a Super Bowl first for the company, Instacart is airing its We're Here ad that marches out a cast of grocery brand celebrities like Chester Cheetah, Jolly Green Giant and Old Spice Guy. Mission Impossible 8Tom Cruise is back in action in a big game ad for the upcoming film, Mission Impossible -- The Final Reckoning.Apple TV Plus: Duhpocalypse movieThe streaming service is promoting a new project for a new project, but we won't spoil it for you. Kathryn Hahn, Johnny Knoxville and Seth Rogen all appear. Be warned: This one is gross. Disney Plus: No joy really sucksDisney's 60-second ad explores what it's like without joy using clever wordplay. The streamer asks what if Bart never did Sey-mour Butts? And what if murders didn't happen in that building? A shorter version of this ad will run on game day, but check out this cut.  WeatherTech: Born to be wildNo need to imagine what could happen when four flirty senior women hit the road in a '63 Lincoln convertible. There's breakdancing, catcalling, mugshots and bingo -- and WeatherTech gets through it all.Coors Light: Beat the Monday bluesCoors Light offers a relatable representation of that post-game sluggishness you may feel on Monday. Gather 'round for these slow-moving sloths and a case of beer.Uber Eats: It's Super Bowl L-I-C-K-SAccording to Matthew McConaughey, football was created to get us to buy food -- wings, Caesar salads, apple, steaks -- you name it. The conspiracy theory unfurls in this spot, which includes appearances from Sean Evans, Kevin Bacon, Charlie XCX, Martha Stewart and Greta Gerwig.Oikos: Protein piggybackJuno Temple does some heavy lifting in this ad for Oikos Greek yogurt. The protein packed in that compact serving of yogurt does the trick and gives the Ted Lasso star enough fuel to give Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett a piggyback ride across the airport to make it to his flight on time.  Google Pixel: Gemini's mock interview In this Pixel 9 ad, Google's Gemini AI feature helps a dad prepare to land his \"dream job,\" but the conversation tugs at the heartstrings and makes you wonder if he's already doing the job he loves most. Dunkin': Experience the DunKings movieBen Affleck is back in his DunKings tracksuit and wants to get the band back together. In a sequel to the 2024 Super Bowl ad, Affleck has brought his younger brother Casey along for the ride. Succession alum and notorious method actor Jeremy Strong is a newcomer to the group -- and by the looks of things, he's taking this job seriously. DoorDash: Girl mathThis DoorDash spot is tapping in for the viral girl math trend and shows Nate Bargatze calculating how much he saves with DashPass. He's using that extra cash for important stuff!Bosch: Putting muscle into home appliances Antonio Banderas and \"Macho Man\" team up for a Bosch home appliance spot that involves might, know-how… and dancing? And in case you were wondering: Yes, the company received consent from \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage's estate to create the ad. Stay tuned for the full spot in the coming days.Taco Bell: Fans get slightly famousIn this teaser for the fast food joint's big game ad, Doja Cat photobombs Taco Bell customers and gets scolded by an employee. The final version will apparently include people who took photos at one of the chain's \"drive-thru cams.\"Angel Soft: Take a bathroom breakThe going rate for Super Bowl ad spots has reportedly hit upward of $8 million, which makes this Angel Soft commercial super interesting. Instead of delving deep into a narrative piece, the toilet paper company is putting our needs above its own by using its ad time to give viewers an excuse to take a bathroom break. Well played.Dodge Ram: Goldilocks up to old tricksTwisters star Glenn Powell -- who drove a Dodge Ram in the movie -- yucking it up as Goldilocks in a zany Dodge Ram Super Bowl ads. Add a majestic blonde wig and Van Halen's Panama and you've got yourself a winning combination.Mountain Dew: Seal's lime kiss from a roseMountain Dew's original teaser ad showed a quartet of seals warming up their voices as singer Becky G and the \"Mountain Dude\" float on a boat nearby. Things get weird with the full ad, which stars Seal's head (the person) on the body of a seal (the animal). The slippery fella belts out a new version of his song Kiss From a Rose. Watch it now, and again when the mammalian monstrosity shows up in your nightmares.Squarespace: Barry Keoghan deliversFans of the 2022 film The Banshees of Inisherin will enjoy this Ireland-set ad, which stars Barry Keoghan and a donkey (it's not the mule from the movie, though). In the spot, Keoghan tosses laptops with pre-made Squarespace websites like newspapers before appearing to walk on air with his animal buddy.GoDaddy: Get into AIGoDaddy tapped Walton Goggins to help get the word out about its new suite of AI tools, GoDaddy Airo. The actor is also the owner of Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses -- which, well, is pretty self-explanatory. He showcases GoDaddy's tools to help small businesses get the word out about their products. While we're talking about these Goggle Glasses, I suddenly want a pair.Reese's: Fans risk it allReese's is going big for its Chocolate Lava Big Cups. In the new Super Bowl spot, the lava is indeed flowing... from a massive volcano. Fans of the peanut butter-chocolate treat are so mesmerized by the deliciousness of it all that, in a sheer collective act of madness, a mob is found running toward a flow of piping hot magma.Ray-Ban Meta glasses: It's Chris, Chris and KrisChris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt get into a little bit of expensive trouble using Ray-Ban's AI-powered Meta glasses. Doritos: Alien abductionDoritos let the fans get in on the delicious action by letting them submit and vote on self-made ads. Aliens want to know all about Doritos in this winning bit from Dylan Bradshaw and Nate Norell.NerdWallet: Genius belugaNerdWallet released an extended cut for its ad, and it features a talking beluga whale that sounds a lot like Emmy winner Kieran Culkin. He's helpful but not afraid to toss out a couple insults.Rocket: Wants to take you homeThe mortgage lender released a touching ad that includes children and parents with the idea of bringing \"Americans home.\"Booking.com: Muppets ruleThe Muppets are back on TV. Even in the form of a Booking.com commercial, this is a win. They deliver all the hits: Kermit plays the banjo, Animal goes nuts in the sand, Miss Piggy is fabulous as ever, Statler and Waldorf continue to hate everything and The Great Gonzo zooms in on a jetpack to put a nice button on the end.Bud Light: Beer cannons in the cul-de-sacPost Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning want to have a good time partying with their neighbors. They send express invitations by launching beer cans onto their doorsteps. STōK Cold Brew: Channing Tatum as coachChanning Tatum steps up (wink, wink) as a special coach to whip the Wrexham AFC team into shape with the right moves, but are they right for the field? Maybe it's all the STōK Cold Brew that has him breaking and popping out his Magic Mike dance choreo. Pringles: Mustaches on the moveWhat do Nick Offerman, James Harden and Andy Reid all have in common? They're mustachioed men who find their iconic facial hair taking flight after Adam Brody finds the snack table is all out of Pringles. To \"Stache Up,\" Brody blows (honks) into the can and sparks a whiskery call to arms. Hellmann's: When Harry Met SallyThree and a half decades after Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan changed the rom-com game with When Harry Met Sally, the duo have reunited to celebrate Hellmann's mayonnaise. This spot re-creates that one scene from the movie -- you know the one.Google Workspace: Spotlight small businessesGoogle's new 50 States, 50 Stories ad highlights small businesses around the country and how they're using its Gemini AI to grow their endeavors. Nerds: Candy with ShaboozeyA Bar Song (Tipsy) singer Shaboozey covers What a Wonderful World and runs into a load of candy characters in this commercial for Nerds Gummy Clusters.Homes.com: Not an adSchitt's Creek star Dan Levy pitches an ad for Homes.com with the help of Morgan Freeman.Little Caesars Pizza: Eyebrow-raising Eugene Levy is also in a Super Bowl ad for Little Caesars Crazy Puffs that sees his eyebrows fly off his face. Should we be worried? Michelob Ultra: Pickleball hustlersWillem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara are an intimidating pickleball duo looking to hustle free Michelob Ultra out of unsuspecting competitors. Watching them defeat one opponent after another nails home how formidable they are. NFL legend Randy Moss, Olympic gold medalist Ryan Crouser and WNBA superstar Sabrina Ionescu are no match for them.Stella Artois: Twinning formulaSoccer legend David Beckham discovers he has a twin brother, aptly named Other David, in this quirky Stella Artois ad. Matt Damon plays his long-lost sibling. The on-screen chemistry between the two is delightful. Ben Affleck should be nervous.Budweiser: Bring on the ClydesdalesThe Clydesdales are back! And with a little foal is the star of the show. It doesn't matter that this spot reminds me of the Chef Boyardee commercial where the ravioli can rolls home.Tubi: A new birthTubi is teasing a new arrival on Feb. 9, complete with an ultrasound image that signals a new character is on the way. If you're streaming the Super Bowl here for free, no doubt you'll be watching this ad. Häagen-Dazs: Not so fast or furiousFast and Furious stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Ludacris rev up their engines for the ice cream brand but switch things up for a \"slow life.\" Busch Light: Going in circlesIn the spirit of the great outdoors, Busch Light wants to make sure you're not going in circles if you're out in the woods. While Busch aims to guide, Nascar driver Ross Chastain has something to say about that. Spruce: It's okay to let the dogs outBunny the \"talking\" dog deejays a set for a pup party where it's fine to run on the grass. Why? Procter \u0026 Gamble says its Spruce weed killer is safe for doggies and humans. Let the dogs out!",
