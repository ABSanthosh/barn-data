  "description": "The federal government of Canada has ordered TikTok to shut down its operations in the country, citing national security concerns. However, Canadians will still be able to access the app and use it to create content. \"The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" said Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. \"We came to the conclusion that these activities that were conducted in Canada by TikTok and their offices would be injurious to national security. I'm not at liberty to go into much detail, but I know Canadians would understand when you're saying the government of Canada is taking measures to protect national security, that's serious.\" CBC News reports: Champagne urged Canadians to use TikTok \"with eyes wide open.\" Critics have claimed that TikTok users' data could be obtained by the Chinese government. \"Obviously, parents and anyone who wants to use social platform should be mindful of the risk,\" he said. The decision was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada's national security. Former CSIS director David Vigneault told CBC News it's \"very clear\" from the app's design that data gleaned from its users \"is available to the government of China\" and its large-scale data harvesting goals. \"Most people can say, 'Why is it a big deal for a teenager now to have their data [on TikTok]?' Well in five years, in 10 years, that teenager will be a young adult, will be engaged in different activities around the world,\" he said at the time. \"As an individual, I would say that I would absolutely not recommend someone have TikTok.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
