  "text": "Apple's Liquid Glass look is clearly a major visual vibe shift for iOS. It‚Äôs official, Apple‚Äôs big software redesign is here, and all of your devices are about to look a lot different. At WWDC 2025 Apple unveiled ‚ÄúLiquid Glass,‚Äù which is its own Apple way of saying, ‚ÄúYour iPhone is getting a lot more bubbly.‚Äù The big visual overhaul changes the look of the UI inside Apple devices across the board, including your iPhone, MacBook, Apple Watch, and even your Apple TV 4K streaming box. And while the full gamut of Apple products is affected by the visual vibe shift, it‚Äôs iOS that will probably catch the most attention‚Äîand for good reason. For one, lots and lots¬†of people use iPhones in America, and even the slightest tweak to the UI can affect people on a mass scale. Secondly, from what I can tell without seeing the redesign for myself, iOS seems to be the most heavily impacted by the new design. I mean, seriously, check this out: Today, we‚Äôre announcing our most beautiful software design change yet with Liquid Glass. And for the very first time, it‚Äôs coming to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26 at once! pic.twitter.com/p8pr8o1EmM ‚Äî Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) June 9, 2025 While Apple doesn‚Äôt state it explicitly, the redesign seems to be heavily influenced by what some designers might call ‚Äúglassmorphism,‚Äù which is a visual style in UI that incorporates lots of opaque menus and, unlike Apple‚Äôs current flat ‚Äúneumorphic‚Äù design, adds a bit of shape to icons that were previously kind of 2D. See (ironically) other operating systems from, *cough, cough* Microsoft, if you want another example of what glassmorphism might manifest as. Someone more knowledgeable than I could probably nerd out over the new look with a few thousand words, but a design maven I am not. When I look at Liquid Glass, I see things in a simpler light. I see mostly one thing: risk. On one hand, that risk is exciting. I think Apple‚Äôs UI is due for an update. By Apple‚Äôs own estimation, the last visual overhaul was way back in iOS 7, when iPhones still had a physical home button and ‚ÄúObamacare‚Äù was still a topic of political discussion. Not only that, but Apple, for good reason, has been accused a lot in recent years of not attempting to push the boundaries like it once did under the leadership of Steve Jobs and Jony Ive. A good way to show people you‚Äôre not afraid to try something new is to, well, try something new. That‚Äôs exactly what Apple did; it took a risk on a redesign that changes some pretty core elements of your iPhone‚Äôs UI‚Äîicons, menus, you name it. But just like any bold new endeavor, there are going to be some tradeoffs. One of those tradeoffs, in this case, may be accessibility. As many of you have already noted, there are some visual quirks to Apple‚Äôs glassmorphic era, and legibility may be at stake. Say fucking goodbye to accessibility #WWDC25 pic.twitter.com/CKCIwv2sns ‚Äî Ilya ¬∑ „Ç§„É™„Ç¢ (@ilyamiskov) June 9, 2025 As much as I actually like the look aesthetically of Apple‚Äôs new Liquid Glass overhaul, I think there are going to be some big haters, and I can‚Äôt exactly blame them. Having clear windows may look future-forward, but when that design encounters, say, I don‚Äôt know, text on a page, things can get a little messy. What you get, at times, is a visually muddled menu that conflicts with other elements on a page. I‚Äôm not jumping to any conclusions yet since I haven‚Äôt really seen the redesign for myself or how it interacts with web pages or apps, but objectively, it seems like there isn‚Äôt as much contrast as Apple‚Äôs previous look. One thing I‚Äôve definitely noticed so far is that subtle differences in where a menu lands in an app or web page can make a huge impact. For instance, check out this picture. apple just introduced \"Liquid Glass\" design in iOS. it's beautiful, futuristic‚Ä¶ and completely unreadable. what are we doing here? üòµ‚Äçüí´ pic.twitter.com/ybw8SIxtqh ‚Äî Kalash (@amikalash) June 9, 2025 I don‚Äôt know about you, but what I see is a blurry, visual disaster. But, if you check out the video this screenshot is pulled from, just a second makes all the difference. Here‚Äôs the same visual demonstration, but the menu is offset just slightly on the text underneath. ¬© Apple / Screenshot by Gizmodo I feel like there‚Äôs a pretty big difference in legibility here. It‚Äôs not perfect by any means, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt call it accessible, but it looks a lot better. This is all to say that I think there will be subtle differences that determine whether you‚Äôre seeing something clear, pleasing, and visually distinct or if you‚Äôre looking at a garbled glassmorphic mess. From what I can tell, there will also be different Liquid Glass styles to choose from, which may affect the accessibility of menus. There‚Äôs also the fact that this redesign doesn‚Äôt officially launch until the fall, so anything could change. How you feel about Liquid Glass is obviously up for debate, but one thing is clear (pun intended), and that‚Äôs that whatever Apple is doing with the iOS redesign and Liquid Glass writ large is definitely a bigger risk than past overhauls. To risk accessibility or legibility on a platform as big as iOS takes some real vision‚Äîwhether good or bad. Let‚Äôs just hope that the vision, for the sake of everyone out there with an iPhone, isn‚Äôt quite as blurry or illegible as some of these early looks might suggest.",
