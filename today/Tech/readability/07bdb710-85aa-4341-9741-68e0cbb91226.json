  "text": "Brand new interviews with the Half-Life 2 dev team! Our Half-Life 1 25th anniversary documentary went so well that we invited Secret Tape back to make another one—this time focusing on Half-Life 2. And it's about a lot more than just the making of a game. Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there! The 20th Anniversary Update for Half-Life 2 includes: Episode One and Two Expansions in the box Half-Life 2 now includes the complete Episode One and Episode Two expansions along with the base game. They’re accessible from the main menu, and you will automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one. Steam Workshop Support Browse, install, and play user-created content for Half-Life 2 without ever leaving the game. Look for it in the Extras menu! Steam Game Recording Preserve your precious memories of City 17 with the help of Steam! Take a look at the Game Recording timeline in your Steam Overlay for event markers that commemorate big and surprising moments in your playthrough. Updated Game Content Every map in Half-Life 2 has been looked over by Valve level designers to fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog: Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game. Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference. Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog! Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game! Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release. Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game! Updated Graphics Settings Choose either the original launch day blood and fire effects, or those created for the episodes, when playing the Half-Life 2 base game! Play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode! Get smoother lightmap shadows at Very High shader detail, thanks to new bicubic lightmap filtering! Gamepad, Input, and Steam Deck Updates Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update. Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out. The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode. Long-Lost Looks into Half-Life 2's development Watch old videos from the early days of Half-Life 2 We rescued these old demos from the hard drives of ancient computers scattered around the office, and are offering them up as high quality videos: E3 2003 The demo that revealed Half-Life 2 and the Source engine to the world. This was previously only available as shakycam recorded from our E3 booth, now available as direct capture. E3 2002 We built this demo to bring to E3 a year earlier, and then decided at the last minute we weren’t ready to show the game. 20 years later, we’re okay with you seeing this stuff. SIGGRAPH 2000 Also known as the “Free TVs” demo, this was shown at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference, hot on the heels of the release of the original Half-Life. This is the highest quality video we’ve still got from this era of Half-Life 2’s development. E3 2003 The demo that revealed Half-Life 2 and the Source engine to the world.

Re-Raising the Bar A new edition of Raising the Bar is coming back into print in 2025, expanded to include the Half-Life 2 Episodes Nearly two decades since it first went out of print, Raising the Bar is set to return with an expanded second edition—offering a comprehensive look into the creation of the Half-Life 2. Originally published in 2004, this book captured the story of Half-Life 2's development but missed the episodic content that followed.This new edition concludes the Half-Life 2 development story, with never-before-seen concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, along with ideas and experiments for the third episode that never came to be. Looking for something to read right now? The Final Hours of Half-Life 2 was written twenty years ago by Geoff Keighley after spending time in Valve's offices during... you guessed it.

Models 1024 -\u003e 2048, Brushes 8192 -\u003e 16384, TexInfo 12288 -\u003e 16384, TexData 2048 -\u003e 8096, DispInfo 2048 -\u003e 8096.

The previous version of the game has been archived to a publicly visible Beta branch named \"steam_legacy\", with the description \"Pre-20th Anniversary Build.\" If a mod or feature is behaving in an unexpected way, you may need to run this archived build until the issue is resolved in the default build. With the Episodes and Lost Coast now contained within Half-Life 2 itself, we'll be reducing the visibility of the standalone versions on the Steam Store. The old standalone applications will remain available to ensure community projects that rely on them still function properly but they will now appear within the Tools menu on your Steam Library.
