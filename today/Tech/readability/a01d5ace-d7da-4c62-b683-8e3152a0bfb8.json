  "description": "Thousands of Norwegians briefly believed they had won massive Eurojackpot prizes after a manual coding error by Norsk Tipping mistakenly multiplied winnings by 100 instead of dividing. The Register reports: Eurojackpot, a pan-European lottery launched in 2012, holds two draws per week, and its jackpots start at about $12 million with a rollover cap of $141 million. Norsk Tipping, Norway's Eurojackpot administrator, admitted on Friday that a \"manual error\" it its conversion process from Eurocents to Norwegian kroner multiplied amounts by 100 instead of dividing them. As a result, \"thousands\" of players were briefly shown jackpots far higher than their actual winnings before the mistake was caught, but no incorrect payouts were made. Norsk Tipping didn't disclose how large the false jackpots were, but math suggests the improper amounts were 10,000x times higher. Regardless, it seems like a lot of people thought they were big winners, based on what the company's now-former CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, said on Saturday. \"I have received many messages from people who had managed to make plans for holidays, buying an apartment or renovating before they realized that the amount was wrong,\" Sagstuen said in a statement. \"To them I can only say: Sorry!\" The incorrect prize amounts were visible on the Norsk Tipping website only briefly on Friday, but the CEO still resigned over the weekend following the incident. While one of the Norsk Tipping press releases regarding the incident described it as \"not a technical error,\" it still appears someone fat-fingered a bit of data entry. The company said it will nonetheless be investigating how such a mistake could have happened \"to prevent something similar from happening again.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
