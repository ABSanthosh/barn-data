Read Full Bio  on June 23, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Credit: Image by Marie LaFauci / Getty Images On Sunday, Alexis Ohanian posted a picture and short video on X, and less than 36 hours later, the post amassed 20.4 million views.The picture was wholesome — one of Ohanian's favorite pictures of his late mother. In the photo, his mom embraces a young Ohanian in a warm hug as they sit in a sunny mountain meadow. That smiling boy would grow up to be one of the co-founders of Reddit, the husband to Serena Williams, and a parent himself. The picture is innocent enough on its own. However, it's the video that caught the internet's attention. Using the new Midjourney AI video generator, Ohanian created a short video clip that animates the photo, bringing his mother to life in a new way. The pair beams as the woman hugs the young Ohanian and rocks him back and forth. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. Many of the responses were positive, with users sharing how touched they were by the video and Ohanian's message. In his post, the tech entrepreneur wrote, \"Damn, I wasn't ready for how this would feel. We didn't have a camcorder, so there's no video of me with my mom... This is how she hugged me. I've rewatched it 50 times.\" Mashable Light Speed And in a follow-up post, he clarified, \"I lost my mom almost 20 years ago. Trolls can rest assured I’ve grieved sufficiently. My family couldn’t afford a camcorder and using tech to generate few seconds of animation from a still is the equivalent of using AI to stabilize a poorly recorded video — or fill in the gaps of a deteriorated video — of her (if we’d had it). It’s not a replacement for a loved one nor should it be.\"While many people found the video to be a beautiful expression of a son's love for his mother, others couldn't see past the AI. Some users reacted with revulsion and horror, likening AI videos like this to \"black tar heroin\" and a \"false memory.\" Personally, I feel quite ambivalent about this application of AI. I can see how it would be immensely comforting, therapeutic, even. And I'm wary of injecting negativity where it's not needed. If Ohanian found the video moving on a spiritual or emotional level, then what right do I have to criticize or question him? (I reached out to Ohanian to ask if he has anything further to share, and I'll update this story if I receive a response.) Unlike controversies like the Studio Ghibli images from ChatGPT, I don't see how this post harms anyone.Even so, something about this gives me pause. It's the same feeling I get when standing on the edge of a cliff.Generative artificial intelligence can now quickly make lifelike images, video, and speech, and I don't think the world is ready for the consequences. I don't think we even know what the consequences will be. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. This Tweet is currently unavailable.
