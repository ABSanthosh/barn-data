  "text": "Trucks and Gatorade Federal officials, meanwhile, are working with Baxter to help support increasing supplies, setting up temporary imports, and expediting consideration of any shelf-life extension requests. In a letter earlier this week, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told health care leaders that the department is \"working tirelessly to mitigate the sterile solutions supply chain disruptions\" and, beyond the current crisis, is also working to diversify the supply chain so it is less reliant on a single plant. For now, though, \"HHS is encouraging all providers and health systems, regardless of whether they have experienced a disruption in their supply, to take measures to conserve these critical products,\" the letter read. Some hospitals have already reported giving patients Gatorade and Pedialyte to conserve IV fluid supplies. In one bright spot in the current disruptions, fears that Hurricane Milton would disrupt another IV fluid manufacturing plant in Florida were not realized this week. B. Braun Medical’s manufacturing site in Daytona Beach was not seriously impacted by the storm, the company announced, and production resumed normally Friday. Prior to the storm, with the help of the federal government, B. Braun reportedly moved more than 60 truckloads of IV fluid inventory north of Florida for safekeeping. That inventory will be returned to the Daytona facility, according to reporting by the Associated Press.",
