You can get exclusive NordVPN’s 2-year discounts, save up to 72%, and get as much as an entire year of its VPN for free. To translate, you pay for 2 years and get 3 years instead. Oh, no, it’s not a fairytale. NordVPN’s birthday celebration is at large but birthdays don’t last for months. Hurry up and act to get this sweet gift. See at NordVPN NordVPN Birthday Deals: Get Up to 1 Year Free As part of its birthday celebration, the VPN company allows new users to reap some fresh discounts. The cheapest one is Basic at $3.39/mo and 70% off. This deal includes only the VPN but with no free months. However, the situation becomes different with the Plus plan. The Plus plan is also 70% off but includes Threat Protection Pro for ad-blocking and NordPass at $4.39/mo. NordVPN offers a coupon for 6 free months. This means you’ll pay only $105.36 for 30 months. © NordVPN Complete and Prime plans at $5.39/mo and $8.39/mo (72% off) are virtually NordVPN’s flagship deals. The former adds NordLocker on top, while the latter also includes NordProtect for added privacy. The Complete plan also has a 6-month coupon but the Prime bumps it up to a year. As Prime costs $201.36 for 2 years, once you add a year on top, the price dwindles to just about $5.6/mo. All plans are accessible directly through our buttons and links. Click any of them, select the plan, and follow the steps to subscribe. Now, set up NordVPN on your device, connect, and enjoy security, privacy, streaming, and much more. More About the VPN Service We failed to mention the provider’s 30-day money-back guarantee. This sounds like an overstretch considering its generosity thus far. But hey, it’s NordVPN’s birthday, so we can see why it’s so willing to give, and not just take money from its users. Apart from being able to get a refund at any moment, you’ll enjoy the flagship VPN experience from top to bottom, with features like: Bank-grade 256-bit encryption Audited no-logging policy Servers in 118+ countries Built-in torrenting servers (NordVPN is THE best VPN for torrenting) NordWhisper for avoiding network filtering Streaming optimization Double VPN connections Apps for all devices and systems 10 simultaneous connections, and more. NordVPN doubles down on its qualities with these heart-melting discounts. Whichever plan you get, you’ll sing the song of satisfaction all day long. Think of it as a tribute to NordVPN’s 13 years on the market. Happy Birthday! See at NordVPN",
