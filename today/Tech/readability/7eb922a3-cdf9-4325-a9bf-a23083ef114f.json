Credit: Zain bin Awais Despite the fact that there are more than 15 million active criminal cases every year, most Americans are only familiar with criminal investigations by the police through television shows. Police dramas are fun, but they make the investigation process seem pretty straightforward and obvious—those under investigation know about it immediately, and the case is usually wrapped up pretty quickly.The reality is very different: Criminal investigations can take a very long time, and people can be swept up in one without their knowledge. The police are under no obligation to inform you when they investigate you. Whether you’re suspected of crimes directly or you’re associated with someone else being investigated, there are signs you can spot that indicate the cops are looking at you. Even if you’re innocent of any crime, knowing that you’re under investigation means you can take steps to protect yourself, like consulting a lawyer and being cognizant of your rights against improper searches of your property. Here are the clues that you might be under investigation by the cops.Subtle signs you're being investigated Some of the signs that the police are investigating you are easy to overlook, and difficult to pin down. If you notice the following things happening around you, you might be under investigation:Unknown vehicles. Are there unfamiliar vehicles parked near your home or work? Seeing the same strange cars or other vehicles repeatedly parked nearby could be a sign of surveillance—either by cops or thieves.Other signs of surveillance. If you notice cameras—either carried by people who mysteriously show up wherever you are or suddenly installed on your street—the police may be recording your movements and behavior as part of an investigation.Trackers. A GPS tracker on your car might have been placed by the police.Odd social media contacts. If you notice a clump of new followers or connection requests from people you don’t know, or notice a spike in traffic or followers with no easy explanation, it might be investigators monitoring your online activities.Associates arrested or investigated. If people you have a connection to are charged with crimes or are being openly investigated, it’s very possible your name will at least come up as part of that investigation. If people around you are being targeted by the cops one by one, you might be caught up in it all.Bank complications. If you start to have a lot of trouble making normal, everyday financial transactions and your bank or other financial institutions can’t explain or resolve the problem, it might be a sign that your finances are being monitored.Hesitation to associate. Are friends and business associates suddenly unavailable and/or reluctant to talk to you? It might indicate that the police have questioned them about you, prompting them to distance themselves.These signs are tough to spot, and difficult to interpret, but seeing more than one in your life should prompt at least the suspicion that you’re being investigated. There are other, more obvious signs, too.Overt signs you're being investigated While the police often investigate in the background without alerting the subjects, there are some very obvious signs that you’re under investigation:Direct contact. The police may not tell you directly that you’re under investigation even if they bring you to the police station or their offices for questioning, or contact you directly in other ways. But they don’t have to tell you why they want to talk to you, so it’s best to assume that if they’re asking you questions it’s because you’re the subject of an investigation.Associates interviewed. Similarly, if the police are questioning your acquaintances or business associates, it’s a clear sign that you might be under investigation—especially if you’re the common denominator between disparate people.ISP subpoena letter. If your internet service provider (ISP) receives a subpoena to provide information about your online activity, they are required to send you a letter notifying you of the request and their compliance. If you get a letter like that, it could be linked to a lawsuit, but it could also be the police investigating you.Frozen accounts. If your finances go from wonky to literally frozen so you can’t access any of your money, it’s often due to a criminal investigation that leads in some way to your finances. If your credit cards and bank account are suddenly inaccessible, you’ve probably been under investigation for some time.What to do if you think you're being investigated If you think you’re seeing signs that the cops are investigating you, there are a few fundamental steps to take:Lawyer up. Whether you’re innocent or guilty—and even if you have no idea why you might be the target of a police investigation—you should immediately consult an attorney regarding your suspicions.Shut up. You have a right not to incriminate yourself, and you are never under any obligation to speak with police without an attorney present. Don’t contact the police to ask if you’re being investigated—they don’t have to tell you, and anything you say could be used against you. If you’re contacted by law enforcement, say nothing and direct them to your lawyers. Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.
