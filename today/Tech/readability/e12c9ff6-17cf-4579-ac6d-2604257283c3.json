  "description": "Existential thoughts about Apple services revenue. Intel announces two extra years of warranty amid chip crashing and instability issues — longer warranty applies to 13th- and 14th-Gen Core processors. Intel plans to lay off 15% of workforce -- at least 15,000 people. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in Apple by nearly 50%. Amazon paid almost $1 billion for Twitch in 2014. It's still losing money. Google Chrome warns uBlock Origin may soon be disabled. Artist and musician sue SEC over its NFT regulatory jurisdiction. Senate passes the Kids Online Safety Act. Ding dong KOSA's dead (for now). A senate bill would radically improve voting machine security. Jailed cybercriminals returned to Russia in historic prisoner swap. US border agents must get warrant before cell phone searches, federal court rules. Posing as 'Alicia,' this man scammed hundreds online. He was also a victim. Broadcasters fly in TikTokers and YouTubers to generate Olympic buzz. Disney, Fox and Warner Sports streamer Venu to launch at $42.99/ Month. Don Lemon sues Elon Musk over canceled X deal. Meta talks With Judi Dench, Awkwafina, Keegan-Michael Key for AI voice projects. Google pulls Olympics AI ad 'Dear Sydney.'
