  "text": "While Disney fans await the arrival of Walt Disney’s high-tech robot this summer for Disneyland’s 70th anniversary, an interactive Mickey Mouse that can blink and talk while you eat popcorn out of its head is now available for purchase. io9 was on hand to demo the latest in the popcorn bucket arms race, which started at Disney theme parks before becoming the hottest movie theater souvenir. While AMC Theaters’ Dune sandworm popcorn bucket seemed like the peak of out-there and bonkers snack vehicles, Disney is back with a robo-upgrade. Check out the moving and blinking bucket you can dig into while engaging in fun conversation starters with a simple “Hey Mickey?” Sure, it’s pre-programmed with a handful of phrases but the real treat is the moving head and blinking eyes. It’s astounding and a little creepy but in a cute way, at least. What’s unhinged is that the interactive setting responds to your voice when you ask it the magic question—and it’s definitely got some kinks to work out. I literally screamed at it and it ignored me, but could somehow hear its cast member friend. Maybe I needed to take my voice down an octave or two in my best Gaston impersonation to be perceived by robot Mickey Mouse. While we don’t see movie theaters adding voice activations to their buckets, unless maybe they do it for M3GAN, this is a delightfully wacky addition to the popcorn bucket hall of fame. We can only imagine what popcorn buckets will do by the time Disneyland turns 80. Find your talking and moving Mickey Mouse popcorn bucket this summer at the Disneyland Resort. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
