  "text": "Ford started offering free adapters for Tesla’s Supercharger network to owners of its EVs in February, and now it’s telling some of its customers to stop using them, reports InsideEVs. The company found a “potential issue” that could cause “reduced charging speeds over time” or even damage to the charge port itself, according to a service bulletin it’s sending to those affected.Ford EV owners should follow the link on Ford’s notice to make sure it has the right address on file. If it is, they won’t need to do anything else to get their replacement, but if not, the company says customers need to update their address by October 24th. Ford will supply a replacement adapter in the coming weeks and provide return instructions to send back your existing adapter – both at no cost. It is imperative that we receive all adapters affected to reduce the risk of potential vehicle damage.Ford will reportedly start shipping replacement adapters to customers during the week of October 28th. Only “a certain recent batch” of Ford’s North American Charging Standard adapters are impacted, according to InsideEV. Both Rivian and General Motors told the outlet that they have not identified any similar issues with their own adapters.
