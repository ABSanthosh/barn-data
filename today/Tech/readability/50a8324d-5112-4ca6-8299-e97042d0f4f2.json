  "text": "We believe that AI presents a significant opportunity to help meet Europe’s ambitious climate targets while boosting economic growth — but meeting this opportunity requires modernising European energy systems, enhancing grid security and reliability, and empowering industrial transformation. Innovative startups in the region are utilising AI to accelerate the energy transition and address energy security, decarbonisation,, and industrial competitiveness — and we want to help.Following the launch of our North America cohort earlier this year, we’re excited to announce that the Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Energy in Europe \u0026 Israel is now open for applications. This 12-week equity-free program is designed to support startups using AI to accelerate the energy transition scale quickly in collaboration with key players across the ecosystem.Apply now — applications close June 30, 2025The program will begin in September and run through November, combining virtual sessions with in-person opportunities to connect with fellow founders, Googlers, and energy sector experts.Startups selected will receive intensive mentorship, technical project support, access to cutting-edge AI tools, Google Cloud infrastructure and talent from across Google. The curriculum includes deep dives into AI/ML infrastructure, product design and UX, go-to-market strategies, and leadership development — all tailored to energy-focused startups.We’re looking to support startups tackling some of the biggest challenges in Europe’s energy landscape:Software solutions for utilities, grid operators and energy developers: Supporting the modernisation, decarbonisation of Europe's energy infrastructure and development of a resilient grid.Load flexibility and optimisation: Enabling a more dynamic, efficient, and resilient energy system that integrates variable carbon-free energy and smart grid applications that contribute to system stability and affordability.Solutions for industrial customers including energy efficiency: Assisting European industries in their transition towards climate neutrality and enhanced competitiveness via industrial energy efficiency solutions, carbon-aware infrastructure and electricity rate modeling.Selected startups will work alongside experts from the Google Energy and Sustainability teams as well from Google Cloud to access the best of Google insights and best practices. Additionally, the cohort will connect with an impressive group of program partners, offering crucial knowledge sharing and connections to support energy startups. The complete list of partners can be found on the program site.If your startup is building AI-driven solutions in the energy space, we encourage you to learn more and apply by June 30th.Learn more about some of the incredible founders in the Google for Startups Accelerator alumni network innovating the energy sector with AI below.
