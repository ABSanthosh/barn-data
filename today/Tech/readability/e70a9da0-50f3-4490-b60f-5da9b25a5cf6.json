  "text": "Everybody loves Pokémon, whether that’s playing with (and as) them, watching them, and collecting ’em all. Nintendo’s never not ready to trot them out, and for those in the U.S., you’ll be able to visit them at a museum next year. On May 22, 2026, Nintendo will bring its Pokémon Fossil Museum to the Chicago’s Field Museum. The exhibit will feature fabricated “fossils” of the monsters compared with “ancient lifeforms found in real-world fossils. […] Trainers of all ages are invited to visit and discover the incredible world of fossils both in the Pokémon world and in our own real world,” reads the announcement. Two noted highlights are scientific casts of Field Museum dinos Sue the T.rex and the Chicago Archaeopteryx next to Tyrantrum and Archeops, respectively. The Pokémon Fossil exhibit started in Japan this past March and will wrap up its current run in Fukui before traveling to the Benex Dinosaur Museum in Nagasaki (June 7-September 11) and Tokushima’s Prefectural Museum (October 4-December 28). Chicago will be its first venue in the U.S., and at time of writing, future cities and countries to follow haven’t been revealed. The Field Museum also isn’t selling tickets right now, but you can sign up to be alerted for when they do here. Meanwhile, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the next big entry in the series, is due for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 in late 2025. Want more io9 news?
