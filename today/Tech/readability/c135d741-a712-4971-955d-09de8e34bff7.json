The only problem is, I have a dog that sheds, drools, and makes every other kind of dog-related mess you can think of. That basically means that any time I get a new rug, it's ruined in a short amount of time. Huge bummer.So, when I came across Tumble's rugs on both my TikTok and Instagram feeds, I knew I had to try one out for myself. Why? They promise that their rugs are machine washable (when it's not possible to spot clean), spill-resistant, comfortable, and a good fit for homes with pets. Music to my ears. But are Tumble's claims too good to be true? I set out to find the answer, and after about a month of use, I walked away from my experience with Tumble very impressed. My Tumble rug is one of my favorite additions to my apartment in recent memory. What I loved about my Tumble rugMy time with Tumble started strong. Right out of the box, I was really happy with how the rug looked — I already knew what design I'd be getting ahead of time, but it looked even better in person. I went for the Wren rug in Olive and Sand, which is a cool take on the trendy checkerboard design that fits perfectly into my home's aesthetic. The colors are vibrant, and the materials feel high-quality.The rug and included rug pad came neatly rolled up in the shipping box, along with a small envelope containing setup and care instructions, as well as some adhesive pads. I placed the quarter-inch-thick rug pad down first, right where my kitchen table lives. Now, I expected to throw the rug on top and call it a day, but Tumble goes the extra mile here. Using a corner-pocket design on the bottom part of the rug, you can slide the rug pad into each pocket, ensuring that the pad won't slide out of position. After that, I slapped the adhesive pads to the bottom to lock everything in place. I tried my best to move it, but the rug wouldn't budge, and it's stayed that way for an entire month. As an aside, I also thought the rug was quite comfortable to walk on — the fabric isn't a plush material, but it's still soft to the touch, and the rug pad below it gives it a nice bounce. So, if you need a runner or office rug, I can definitely recommend Tumble. The rug's surface is still looking great even after a month of heavy traffic. Credit: Dylan Haas / Mashable Tumble rugs pass the stain testThe whole point of a washable rug is to, you know, wash it. And I definitely got to stress-test Tumble's stain resistance.Fortunately for you, my dog decided to throw up her dinner on the rug just one week into my test. Usually, I wouldn't enjoy cleaning up dog puke, but this time was different — it was an opportunity to put Tumble's machine-washable claims to the test. I wiped up the excess and carefully lifted the rug away from the rug pad. Then, I chucked the rug into my washing machine and started a cold cycle. Once that was done, I did a quick inspection of the rug and my machine to make sure there wasn't any damage, but it still looked great, and the stains my pet added to it were totally gone. After a quick tumble dry, I placed the rug back in its spot. I was very happy with the results; it looked as good as new. For smaller messes, clean-up is even easier. The rug is made using spill-resistant materials, so whenever a liquid hits the fabric, it'll start to pill up instead of working its way into the fibers. Anytime something got on the rug, I was able to quickly wipe it up with a damp paper towel and move on with my day. I even spilled part of a matcha latte on it at one point, and it didn't stain, which felt like a small miracle. What I didn't love about my Tumble rugMy Tumble rug experience was not without its flaws, though they've been pretty easy to overlook. For one, I didn't love that I could see the rug pad under the rug. It wasn't sticking out the sides thanks to the rug's underside pockets, but there was a noticeably raised area where the pad sits, and I couldn't mask it no matter what I tried. Not a huge deal in my opinion, but you've been warned. Finally, my rug did start showing very small signs of wear and tear on the sides, but this will happen to any rug you put down in high-traffic areas like a kitchen, playroom, or hallway. A very small amount of fraying has started on the sides of the rug. Credit: Dylan Haas / Mashable The rug pad shows through the actual rug just a bit. Can you see it? Credit: Dylan Haas / Mashable Are Tumble rugs worth the price?Tumble's rugs aren't cheap. The brand's smallest size is priced at $119 (the one that I tested), and their largest sizes run well over the $400 mark. But if you're more concerned about durability and convenience over luxuriousness, I think Tumble is well worth the investment. And that's especially if you have pets or children running around. One day, when you're wiping up yet another pee puddle or rogue glass of orange juice with ease, you'll be thankful you shelled out for a Tumble rug. To put Tumble's rugs to the test, I put one of their low-pile, 3-foot x 5-foot rugs in my kitchen and used it normally over the course of a month. Not only is my kitchen a high-traffic area (you have to walk through it to enter my apartment), but it's also prone to spills, messes, and the occasional cooking-related incident. My wife and I also own a large dog who enjoys napping on rugs in her spare time, so we were interested to see how Tumble would fare against the elements in our household. We washed the rug once in our washing machine during the review period, but mostly spot cleaned, as that was all that was required more often than not. At the end of the testing period, our Tumble rug still looked great and had pretty negligible signs of natural wear and tear.Factors I took into account while reviewing the Tumble rug include:Aesthetic and variety of choice: How the rug looks in general, as well as the brand's other offerings. Is there a design for everyone?Durability: How well the rug held up after experiencing heavy foot and pet traffic over a month. Comfortability: How the rug felt to walk on — is it plush and comfortable, or does it just feel like walking on the floor underneath it?User-friendliness: How easy it was to keep the rug clean, including machine washing and spot cleaning, as well as the initial setup.Overall value: While the rug I tested wasn't all that expensive ($119, one of the brand's cheapest options), Tumble's larger options break $400. In exchange for convenience, is the investment worthwhile?

The brand\u0026#39;s smallest size is priced at $119 (the one that I tested), and their largest sizes run well over the $400 mark. But if you\u0026#39;re more concerned about durability and convenience over luxuriousness, I think Tumble is well worth the investment. And that\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eespecially\u003c/em\u003e if you have pets or children running around. One day, when you\u0026#39;re wiping up yet another pee puddle or rogue glass of orange juice with ease, you\u0026#39;ll be thankful you shelled out for a Tumble rug. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n                    \u003c/article\u003e\n    \n    \u003cdiv id=\"how-we-tested\"\u003e\n            \n            \u003cp\u003eTo put Tumble\u0026#39;s rugs to the test, I put one of their low-pile, 3-foot x 5-foot rugs in my kitchen and used it normally over the course of a month. Not only is my kitchen a high-traffic area (you have to walk through it to enter my apartment), but it\u0026#39;s also prone to spills, messes, and the occasional cooking-related incident. My wife and I also own a large dog who enjoys napping on rugs in her spare time, so we were interested to see how Tumble would fare against the elements in our household. We washed the rug once in our washing machine during the review period, but mostly spot cleaned, as that was all that was required more often than not. At the end of the testing period, our Tumble rug still looked great and had pretty negligible signs of natural wear and tear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFactors I took into account while reviewing the Tumble rug include:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAesthetic and variety of choice: \u003c/strong\u003eHow the rug looks in general, as well as the brand\u0026#39;s other offerings.
