At a follow-up appointment, the wounds appeared to be healing without complications. While the man recovered from the injury, the author of the case study—Jeremy Hess, an expert in emergency medicine and global environmental health at the University of Washington—warned that the risk of such injuries will only grow as climate change continues. \"Extreme heat events increase the risk of contact burns from hot surfaces in the environment,\" he wrote. \"Young children, older adults, unhoused persons, and persons with substance use disorder are at elevated risk for these types of burns.\" Last year, The New York Times reported that burn centers in the southwest have already begun seeing larger numbers of burns from contact with sidewalks and asphalt during heat waves. In some cases, the burns can turn fatal if people lose consciousness on hot surfaces—for instance, from overdoses, heat stroke, intoxication, or other health conditions. \"Your body just literally sits there and cooks,\" Clifford Sheckter, surgeon and a burn prevention researcher at Stanford University, told the Times last year. \"When somebody finally finds you, you’re already in multisystem organ failure.\"",
