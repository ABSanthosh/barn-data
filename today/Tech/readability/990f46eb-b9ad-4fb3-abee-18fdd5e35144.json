  "text": "'My Hero Academia' studio Bones sticks with shonen with its upcoming dark fantasy summer series, 'Gachiakuta.' Summer is here, and that means there’s new anime for the season. For the shonen heads, there’s returning fan favorites like Dan Da Dan and Kaiju No. 8, plus a new show by the name of Gachiakuta dropping next month. Based on Kei Urana’s ongoing manga, the series stars Rudo Surebec, a teenager living in the slums of the Sphere who comes home to find his foster dad dead. Charged and found guilty of murder, he’s condemned to The Pit, a massive dump site below town that’s home to criminals and anything else considered trash by the Sphere’s wealthy class. A man named Enjin rescues Rudo and invites him to join the Cleaners, a group of people who create weapons out of objects they imbue with their power and use them to hunt monsters made of literal trash. Rudo joins up with the Cleaners, mainly because he has dreams of making it back topside to get revenge on the Sphereites who dumped him to the surface. Gachiakuta is developed by Studio Bones, which helmed My Hero Academia and its current Vigilantes spinoff, and the contrast between the two shonen is so sharp. Rudo is so much more angrier than Deku, the pivot (and equally furious social commentary) may be enough to entice viewers to see what Bones does with darker material. Gachiakuta premieres Sunday, July 6 on Crunchyroll, with respective opening and ending themes by Paledusk (“HUGs”) and Dustcell (“Tomoshibi”). Global premiere events with advance screenings will be held before then on July 4 and 5 in several locations, including the US, Japan, and Brazil. You can find the locations here. Want more io9 news?
