  "text": "Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Christoph Waltz, and Mia Goth star in the Netflix film, out in November. The world’s next hot monster is here. At its big Tudum event, Netflix released the first teaser trailer for Guillermo del Toro’s latest film, Frankenstein. In it, audiences finally catch a glimpse of Jacob Elordi as Frankenstein’s monster. A monster that is scary, but in a way that makes death seem okay. Thankfully, that’s juxtaposed with the type of gore and scope one expects from Del Toro. The Oscar-winning director of The Shape of Water, Pan’s Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, Hellboy and others has been wanting to make his version of the classic Mary Shelley story for years now, and with the help of Oscar Isaac, Christoph Waltz, and Mia Goth, he’s done just that. Here’s the first trailer for Frankenstein. Though Frankenstein was produced and will live on Netflix, we certainly hope audiences have a chance to see it on a big screen. Guillermo del Toro is one of those filmmakers whose work begs to be seen in a theater, and Frankenstein looks to fit the bill once again. It’s all there in the trailer—incredible sets, beautiful visual effects, stunning costumes, gruesome makeup, you name it. We’re also very curious about where Frankenstein is going to fit into the awards cycle at the end of this year. With a cast and crew like this, you’d imagine Netflix is expecting Frankenstein to be a contender for all the major awards. And, frankly, fans like you and I expect the movie to be good enough to do so. However, a project like this, one that seems so incredible on paper, often doesn’t meet those expectations. How could it? This is the ultimate monster story from the ultimate monster filmmaker! After seeing this trailer, though, we think maybe this will live up to its potential Frankenstein, directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz, comes to Netflix in November.
