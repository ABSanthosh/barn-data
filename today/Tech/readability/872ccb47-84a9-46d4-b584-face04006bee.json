The startup has developed a patented process for coating fibres with metals and plastics during the spinning stage. This creates fibres that are lightweight and conductive, yet strong and durable ‚Äî at a fraction of conventional costs. These can then be spun together to form reinforced composites.¬† So far, FibreCoat has focused on securing clients in the automotive, construction, and defence industries, where the materials are particularly useful for radiation shielding and weight reduction applications. Now the company is setting its sights on upward. Spacecraft require materials that can withstand extreme temperatures, radiation, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) without adding unnecessary weight. ‚ÄúSpace is a rapidly growing sector, and launchers and satellites increasingly need coated fibres to endure harsh conditions,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Brull, CEO of FibreCoat.¬† The üíú of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.
