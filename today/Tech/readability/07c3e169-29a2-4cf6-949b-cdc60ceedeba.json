You can enjoy NordVPN’s 2-year Basic plan at 70% off and $3.39/mo. But that’s far from everything. The provider has a total of 8 discounted plans; both 2-year and 1-year. Today’s guide will explore them and give you plenty of ways to save on NordVPN and not break the bank. See at NordVPN Savings Frenzy: NordVPN’s 2-Year Offers Are Live Flagship doesn’t always mean decimating your bank account. NordVPN’s 2-year deals prove us right, offering ample amazing features for a few dollars a month. At the moment, the company’s promotions include: Basic plan – $3.39/mo, 70% off Plus – $4.39/mo, 70% off Complete – $5.39/mo, 70% off Prime – $9.39/mo, 69% off These four plans are way different but each has tremendous value. We suggest the Basic one if you need the VPN and associated features, such as a Double VPN, a kill switch, P2P servers, 256-bit encryption, 10 simultaneous connections, etc. However, the Plus plan is easily the best option if you need just a bit more. For instance, the plan includes Threat Protection Pro, turning the VPN into an ad-blocking machine. The feature also blocks malware and trackers, endorsing a higher level of online safety. Let’s not forget NordPass whose password-managing tools never cease to amaze. The Complete plan adds NordLocker to that, while Prime steps up with NordProtect. The latter protects you against cyber extortion and account breaches, thereby, keeping snoopers and data brokers out of harm’s way. Annual Offers: Up to 67% Off NordVPN won’t force you to commit to 2 years if that’s an overstretch. In fact, its annual plans can be a better option for many, despite their higher monthly prices. We’re discussing the same plans and their features with different prices outlined below: Basic – $4.99/mo, 56% off Plus – $5.99/mo, 60% off Complete – $6.99/mo, 61% off Prime – $10.99/mo, 64% off All of them are replete with features and are exponentially more discounted the higher you go. Opting for NordVPN is actually risk-free and has always been! The VPN’s 30-day money-back guarantee leaves no room for losing money if you don’t like it. Just contact the VPN in 30 days, ask for a refund, and get it right away. Before you grab some of these discounts, we suggest informing yourself about the VPN in our updated NordVPN review. In short, our experts titled it the #1 VPN according to many tests. Ready to secure your online presence for a year or preferably two? Get started with NordVPN at a measly $3.39/mo. Now is the perfect chance! See at NordVPN",
