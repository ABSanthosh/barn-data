  "text": "You'll have the gym to yourself all December. Credit: TORWAISTUDIO/Shutterstock If you have even the tiniest inkling that you might want to get in shape in the new year—or anytime really—don’t wait until January. This isn't even a \"winter arc\" self-improvement pitch; it's just facts. The best time to start a gym habit is right now, when you’ll have the place to yourself. Technically “right now” is always the best time to start, but the holiday season is special. If you wait until January, gyms will be packed. The first two weeks of the year, everybody thinks they’re at the start of an amazing new fitness habit ... and then by February, most of them have forgotten all about it. Don’t make life harder for yourself by starting during the big rush. Classes will fill up, you’ll have to fight people for the squat rack, and it will be hard to have any real fun. So start now. In November, gyms and classes are at more or less their normal capacities. This is a good time to feel out the vibe of a new place. But it gets better: By December, fair-weather gymgoers will be off shopping for gifts after work and attending holiday parties on the weekends. They won’t feel like getting out of their warm beds in the morning, either. When you arrive, the squat rack will be free. You’ll have your choice of treadmills. The gym will be your oyster. You have a little over six weeks before the rush. And that is a perfect little time frame to set a small goal and keep it. Vow to hit the gym three times a week, and you’ll be able to get 18 workouts in before the new year, even if you take a few days off for festivities. You can get a lot stronger in 18 workouts. Or run, if that's the fitness journey you're most excited about. If you start a couch-to-5k running plan now, you’ll be nearly done by January. Yes, December can be busy and stressful, but remember that working out tends to help our brains manage stress. Mark workouts on your calendar, and keep those appointments with yourself. Don’t worry about missing out on deals: Any gym or studio that offers a January special will most likely have a Black Friday deal, too. And ultimately, if you get into the habit of actually using the gym, you're getting a lot more value for your money than somebody who joins in January and quickly stops showing up.
