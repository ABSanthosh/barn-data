  "text": "Software updates are great when they make features better, but that doesn't always happen. Case in point: a recent Google Pixel update that's brought in a flurry of complaints. One of the least popular changes altered how Pixels handle the Do Not Disturb feature. Previously, you could swipe down from the top of your Pixel's screen and press the Do Not Disturb button in quick settings to toggle it on or off. The March 2025 update changed that, forcing you to make multiple taps to activate or deactivate Do Not Disturb on your Google Pixel smartphone.Plenty of Google Pixel users took to Reddit to complain about this change. Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix this behavior.Restore one-tap Do Not Disturb to your Google Pixel smartphoneThe easiest way to bring back the old Do No Disturb button is by downloading an app. Simple DND lets you do exactly what the old button used to. Once you install the app and give it the required permissions, simply tap the Add Tile button to send a quick Do Not Disturb toggle back to your Pixel's quick settings pane. Once the tile is there, you can rearrange it as you see fit. Just swipe down from the top of your Pixel's screen and select the pencil icon to edit and reorder your quick settings tiles. You can use this to move the new Do Not Disturb button to your preferred location. This app was developed by someone who faced the exact same problem after the update, and doesn't do anything other than restoring the old Do Not Disturb button.  What do you think so far? The other alternative is to add a Do Not Disturb button to the lock screen and access it from there. This will require you to give up one of the two shortcuts on your lock screen and replace it with Do Not Disturb. You can change this by going to your Pixel phone's Settings app and navigating to Display \u003e Lock screen \u003e Shortcuts. Now select one of the shortcuts and pick Do Not Disturb to add it there. In the meantime, if you want Google to bring back the old, one-tap button, you can send your feedback to the company. On your Pixel, go to Settings \u003e Tips \u0026 support \u003e Send feedback. Be sure to describe the problem in detail so that the person reading it can understand the issue and pass it on to the relevant team accordingly.",
