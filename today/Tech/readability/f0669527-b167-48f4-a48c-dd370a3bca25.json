  "text": "Color E Ink in its current state requires a whole lot of compromises, as we've found when reviewing devices like reMarkable's Paper Pro or Amazon's Kindle Colorsoft, including washed-out color, low refresh rates, and a grainy look that you don't get with regular black-and-white E Ink. But that isn't stopping device manufacturers from exploring the technology, and today, Onyx International has announced that it has a $1,900 color E Ink monitor that you can connect to your PC or Mac. The Boox Mira Pro is a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and it builds on the company's previous black-and-white Mira Pro monitors. The Verge reports that the screen uses E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, which can display up to 4,096 colors. Both image quality and refresh rate will vary based on which of the monitor's four presets you use (the site isn't specific about the exact refresh rate, but does note that \"E Ink monitors' refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors', and increased speed will result in more ghosting.\") The monitor's ports include one full-size HDMI port, a mini HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. Its default stand is more than a little reminiscent of Apple's Studio Display, but it also supports VESA mounting. Onyx International's lineup of Boox devices usually focuses on Android-powered E Ink tablets, which the company has been building for over a decade. These are notable mostly because they combine the benefits of E Ink—text that's easy on the eyes and long battery life—and access to multiple bookstores and other content sources via Google Play, rather than tying you to one manufacturer's ecosystem as Amazon's Kindles or other dedicated e-readers do.",
