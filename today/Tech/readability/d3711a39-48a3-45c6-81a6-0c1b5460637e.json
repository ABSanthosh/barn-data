  "text": "The buzz around this summer’s How to Train Your Dragon has given Universal Pictures the confidence to confirm a sequel will soon follow. Director Dean DeBlois is moving full Viking dragon ride ahead with the franchise as How to Train Your Dragon 2 has just officially been given the green light. The cinematic sequel will be released June 11, 2027. The announcement comes from Universal Pictures at CinemaCon 2025, just hours after positive reactions flooded social media following CinemaCon’s early screening of How to Train Your Dragon. Taken with the built-in goodwill the franchise already has thanks to its much-loved trio of animated films—not to mention multiple television series and upcoming presence at Universal Studios Florida’s new Epic Universe theme park—it’s not really a surprise this is happening, but it’s still exciting. #HowToTrainYourDragon 2 – In Theaters June 11, 2027 pic.twitter.com/ki2boaZf3u — #HowToTrainYourDragon (@HTTYDragon) April 2, 2025 How To Train Your Dragon 2 continues Hiccup’s story as a dragon rider as the pact between Vikings and dragonkind continues for each species’ survival. We’re excited to find out who’ll be joining the cast because much like Gerard Butler’s role in the animated films as Hiccup’s dad Stoick, there’s a huge role in the sequel we hope is played by their voice counterpart. How to Train Your Dragon opens June 13; as mentioned above, the sequel will follow June 11, 2027. Additional reporting by Germain Lussier. Want more io9 news?
