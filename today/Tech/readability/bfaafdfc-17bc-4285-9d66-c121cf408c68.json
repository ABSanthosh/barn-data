As a Video Producer at CNET, Sean has worked on more videos than he can count. He covers video games and video game hardware along with the occasional electric bike. He covers games both on and off camera, through livestreams, press events, and podcasts. Expertise Video Games | E-Bikes Microsoft revealed its long-rumored Xbox handheld console running Windows 11 during the Xbox Games Showcase -- two models called the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X -- and I spent a short time playing around with one soon after. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to take any pictures or videos of the demo since the hardware we got to test wasn't final. That became evident when our designated guide had HDMI connection issues with the unit. I was able to play around with the Xbox full-screen experience and the various settings menus and play the beginning minutes of Gears of War Reloaded, which comes out this summer.   Watch this: Everything Announced at the Xbox Games Showcase in 16 Minutes 16:18The device is quite comfortable to hold, with slightly textured grips. The face buttons, triggers and analog sticks all felt familiar, very similar to what I'm used to on an Xbox controller. What's really exciting is that you can download your games, remote play from your Xbox or stream from the cloud, making this more useful than PlayStation's Portal, which can only stream and play remotely. That's one of the major benefits of being inside Xbox's ecosystem: You can play a game on any of its devices, regardless of where you bought it, whether that be Xbox consoles, PC, cloud or this new handheld. This more open-platform approach makes the Xbox Ally closer in spirit to a Steam Deck compared with a Nintendo Switch, which can only run Nintendo games.  When it ships -- expected in time for the winter holidays -- you'll be able to navigate via a full-screen Xbox app, which combines your Xbox game library with installed games from several other marketplaces into a single Xbox experience. The company specifically mentioned Xbox, Game Pass, battle.net (owned by Microsoft) and \"other leading PC storefronts,\" which I'm hoping includes Steam. Much like on an Xbox, each game has icons depicting which platform they're from. In my demo, the only example of a different storefront was Hearthstone, which had a battle.net icon.  Microsoft/Screenshot by CNETThe Xbox Ally consoles use the Game Bar, and if you've used the Xbox app on PC, then you'll find it familiar. In fact, pressing the new Xbox button opens an almost identical version of the guide when playing Xbox games on PC. However, there's also a new Command Center tab on the far left to adjust settings for power consumption and performance, similar to what we've seen on Steam Deck. In Game Bar, you can quickly jump to the home screen, your library, launch games, open apps, chat with friends, adjust settings and more. And this Game Bar works alongside Asus's Armoury Crate overlay. This is a little worrisome, as Armoury Crate has usually felt more like unnecessary bloatware, but when we get to test the device later this year we'll see if Asus has stripped it down to the relevant functions rather than just added more on top.Since it's a Windows 11 device, you'll also be able to launch and use apps like Discord and Twitch and access game mods. The Xbox Ally boots directly into the \"Xbox full screen experience\" similar to how a Steam Deck launches into Big Picture mode. The full-screen experience is optimized specifically for handheld gaming, and Xbox told me the device minimizes background activity and allocates more system resources to gameplay like Game Mode does on Windows. This means more memory and potentially higher framerates for your games. XboxThe ROG Ally and Ally X have been out for a bit now, but the Xbox models have some unique features. In addition to the Xbox button, the ROG Xbox Ally also has larger, contoured grips. The previous ROG Ally is more rectangular; the Xbox Ally is closer to the design of the PlayStation Portal, with dedicated, slightly separated hand grips that mimic the look and feel of a standard game controller. They also have upgraded components over the Asus versions.The handheld comes in two options, a white Xbox Ally and the more powerful Xbox Ally X that comes in black. The lower-end Ally is powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor, comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage, weighs 23.6 ounces (670 grams) and has a 60Wh battery. The Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, weighs a bit more at 25.2 ounces (715 grams) and has an 80Wh battery. Both models are equipped with a 7-inch,120Hz 1080p screen, the same as on the original Asus versions of the devices. They also have RGB lights surrounding the analog sticks, something I hope I'll be able to turn off when I spend some real time playing on the device. The Ally X did feel on the heavier side, but then again, the recently released Switch 2 and my Steam Deck OLED are also pretty heavy, so I think that's just what handhelds weigh these days.Xbox hasn't yet revealed  the pricing or release date, aside from \"this holiday.\"",
