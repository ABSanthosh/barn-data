  "text": "If you’re constantly on the move (or needs to keep multiple devices charged at the same time), you know the frustration of carrying a separate charger for each. Between smartphones, laptops, tablets and wireless earbuds, it’s easy to end up with a tangled mess of cords and bulky adapters. The fantastic Anker 737 power bank is currently on sale at Amazon for $87, which is a massive 41% off its usual $149 list price, and it offers a high-performance solution to this universal gripe. With three charging ports and a massive 24,000mAh capacity, this portable charger makes it possible to power all your devices from a single and compact unit. See at Amazon Best in Class Laptop Charger This Anker charger includes two USB-C ports and one USB-A port which means that you can charge a laptop, a phone and one other device all at the same time. The two USB-C ports both offer up to 140W output which is enough to fast-charge even the latest MacBook or other power-hungry laptops. The USB-A port is perfect for accessories or older devices and offers compatibility with just about anything you might need to charge on the go. The real star is the 24,000mAh battery which provides enough juice to fully charge an iPhone 16 Pro more than four times or the latest iPad Pro more than once. For the average person, that means you can leave your wall chargers at home and rely on the Anker 737 to keep you connected for days. The power bank is also safe for flights as it’s under the 100Wh limit, so you can carry it in your hand luggage with no worry. The smart digital display is also very useful: Unlike some other power banks that have you play guessing games about how much charge is left, the Anker 737’s screen provides real-time information on input and output power, battery health and estimated recharge time. Having so much information at hand makes you more in charge of your charging, so you’re never left with a dead battery. Anker has also equipped the 737 with the latest safety and efficiency technologies: Power Delivery 3.1 and bi-directional charging enable you to fast charge your devices and also fast top up the power bank itself. Rather than juggling a set of chargers, you can consolidate your setup and keep everything charged from a single dependable source like this Anker model. Thanks to Amazon’s huge discount, it’s a great time to pick up this charger. Anker is probably the most popular charger brand in the U.S., don’t miss this opportunity. See at Amazon",
