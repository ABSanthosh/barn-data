  "text": "The holiday shopping season is fun, but it can also cause you to incur additional costs, especially if you host gatherings and have a lot of people on your shopping list. If you need to save up, one of the best ways to stretch your monthly budget is to buy home essentials in bulk. Big Box stores like Costco are your best bet, but they require a membership, and right now you can not only save on membership, you can also score a gift card with your purchase.With this deal, you can get a yearlong Costco Gold Star membership for just $65, and you'll get $45 back in the form of a Costco gift card. That credit is ideal given how much money we tend to spend at this time of year and means you're essentially paying just $20 for the one-year membership. Alternatively, you can go for the Executive Gold Star membership instead for $130, and you'll also get a $45 Costco gift card. You can also gift a membership to a family member or friend who wants to join Costco, too (limited to two memberships; one for you, one for a gift). To take advantage of these savings, you'll have to sign up before Dec. 22, and you'll have to redeem your membership before Jan. 31, 2025. Keep in mind that it's available only to new customers or those whose memberships have been expired for more than 18 months. If you've been thinking of picking up a Costco membership, this deal puts more cash back in your pocket. With a Costco Gold Star subscription, you'll get one membership card for your household. It allows you to shop at any Costco warehouse worldwide, as well as online at Costco.com. Costco is a great place to save on groceries and other everyday essentials. We did the math and shopping at Costco can save you as much as $1,000 over a year compared to shopping at the grocery store. A Gold Star membership also means you can use Costco's gas stations and pharmacies, as well as Costco's optical and hearing aid centers. Costco frequently has seasonal plants, decor, furniture, electronics and other products as well.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.The Executive Gold Star membership adds a 2% annual reward of up to $1,250 and additional benefits and discounts on select Costco services. If you're going to shop at Costco frequently or make use of its extra services, it might make sense to go for the premium membership. After you sign up, you'll receive your bonus shop card via email within two weeks. The card can be used both in-store and online, so you can use it right away. Just remember that after you pay through StackSocial, you'll have until Jan. 31, 2025, to redeem the membership at Costco or you may not be able to take advantage of the deal. StackSocial recommends that you redeem this deal sooner if you decide to go for this deal.Now that groceries are going to cost you a little less, check out our gift guide on the best toys for kids, because it's always nice to treat them.
