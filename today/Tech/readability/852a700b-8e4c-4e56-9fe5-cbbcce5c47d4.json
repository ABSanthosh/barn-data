  "text": "Applications range from administration to combat. The Department of Defense's is \"accelerating and scaling\" its AI tech. Credit: SOPA Images / Contributor / LightRocket via Getty Images Still aiming to become a global leader in AI, the United States announced it will be moving forward on initiatives to incorporate generative AI into the inner workings of the Department of Defense (DoD)— just as AI's creators pitch their offerings to major defense contractors. Announced today, the office will be moving ahead with a new $100 million AI Rapid Capabilities Cell \"focused on accelerating DoD adoption of next-generation artificial intelligence,\" including generative AI. It will be led by the department's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) and Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). The announcement comes as a result of Task Force Lima, a Department of Defense generative AI task force established in 2023 to \"assess, synchronize, and employ generative AI capabilities\" in the DoD. \"DIU's role is bringing the very best commercial tech to bear to meet critical warfighter problems with the focus, speed, and scale required to meet the strategic imperative,\" said DIU Director Doug Beck. \"The result will help us scale the tech faster and more reliably, and will also help change the way the Department thinks about software development and delivery tempo for the future.\" The department's AI applications will include \"decision support, operational planning, logistics, weapons development and testing, uncrewed and autonomous systems, intelligence activities, information operations, and cyber operations,\" as well as administrative purposes.   Mashable Light Speed Under the Biden Administration, the U.S. endorsed the international Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, a best practices initiative to explore the development of AI's military capabilities — despite already using the technology in warfare applications. In a Nov. 2023 statement, the Department of Defense announced its intention to explore \"the responsible military use of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems.\" AI watchdogs have warned of the accelerated use of AI in warfare and its global repercussions. One month prior, the White House announced an extensive regulatory executive order outlining risk and safety standards for AI, cybersecurity provisions, and various guidelines that spanned the Department of Commerce, Homeland Security, and Energy. The administration announced even more AI initiatives soon after, including the creation of a United States AI Safety Institute (US AISI). This was later followed by a warning to Big Tech to curb the spread of synthetic, AI-generated content. While it's uncertain whether President-elect Donald Trump will uphold the Biden administration's national and international AI commitments, the soon-to-be sworn in leader has already announced his pick for a position he's calling the \"White House AI Czar.\" As for his picks for the country's defense leaders, Trump is rumored to be eyeing Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Shankir for a top spot in the Pentagon — Shankir is a proponent of the Department of Defense's rapid adoption of commercial tech, including AI. \"The DoD has an imperative to responsibly pursue the adoption of generative AI models while identifying proper protective measures and mitigating national security risks that may result from issues such as poorly managed training data,\" said DoD Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer Dr. Radha Plumb. \"We must also consider the extent to which our adversaries will employ this technology and seek to disrupt our own use of AI-based solutions.\" Chase joined Mashable's Social Good team in 2020, covering online stories about digital activism, climate justice, accessibility, and media representation.
