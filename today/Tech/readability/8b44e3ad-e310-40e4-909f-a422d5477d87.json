  "text": "We're making new Pebble watches I've tried pretty much every other smartwatch on Earth, yet I still wear my Pebble every day—nothing else matches its features and long battery life. I really, really, really hoped someone else would create a proper replacement, but no one has stepped up, and my stash of old Pebbles is dwindling! It's time to take matters into my own hands. A small team and I are working on a new Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS, has the same beloved features (plus some fun new stuff), and stays true to the core Pebble vision. If enough people are interested, we'll build it. Sign up to get one! Read the full blog post Why We're Bringing Pebble Back PebbleOS is now open source Google (which purchased Fitbit, which had bought Pebble) still owns PebbleOS. Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on open sourcing the OS! The source code for PebbleOS is now available at github.com/google/pebble. Read more on their blog. Thank you so much, Google! I can't stress how thankful I am to the individuals who did the heavy lifting. This was also made possible by the Rebble team and community, who have supported Pebble since it shut down. Check out the vibrant r/Pebble and Discord. What happens now? The source code that powers each Pebble smartwatch is now freely available to download, modify and improve on Github. Want a reminder of how awesome Pebble OS is? Dive back into the beautiful, retro, pixelated world of Pebble. Anyone can use PebbleOS in any way they want. You can get it working on existing Pebble watches, emulate it, run it on other embedded devices, or create new hardware specifically for it. We're setting out to bring Pebble back, we'd love for you to join the fun! Do you want a new Pebble? Eric MigicovskyFounder of Pebble Wait, what is Pebble again? Pebble is an e-paper smartwatch with simple functionality, long battery life, and fun, quirky design. It first launched on Kickstarter in 2012 and sold over 2 million watches before the company's IP was sold to Fitbit in 2016. © Copyright ---- Core Devices LLC.
