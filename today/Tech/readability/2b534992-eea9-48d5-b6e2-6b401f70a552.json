You can see a full rundown of specs and features in Motorola's company blog post, but suffice it to say, the Ultra with the wood finish is probably the star of the show here.Motorola claims that thanks to its Snapdragon processor, the new Motorola Razr Ultra will be the world's most powerful flip phone, as well as the fastest-charging flip phone. The new Motorola Razr comes in a sick wood finish. Credit: Motorola The Motorola Razr Ultra: Flagship specs and a Snapdragon processorIt's the most expensive phone of the bunch at $1,300, but you get what you pay for, specs-wise. The Razr Ultra has a 4-inch cover display on the exterior and a 7-inch display on the interior, with a beefy 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. You'll also get a big 4,700mAh battery on top of a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, plus a trio of 50MP camera lenses to play with. It also comes in a swaggy new faux-wood finish as an option, which is definitely one of the coolest-looking phones I've seen in a minute.Here are the key specs:Displays: 4-inch external screen, 7-inch internal screenProcessor: Snapdragon 8 Elite processorRAM: 16GBStorage options: 512GB, 1TBBattery: 4,700mAhCameras: 50MP wide, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP selfieColorways: Pantone Cabaret, Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail (wood finish)The Motorola Razr Ultra also has a dedicated AI button, though the features you can access with it as a shortcut are also available on the other new Razr devices. The Motorola Razr 2025 lineup comes with Moto AI\"Moto AI,\" as it's called, can do interesting things like keep a pin in items you specifically ask it to remember for you to bring up later. There's also a \"Group Shot\" photo feature similar to what's been on recent Google Pixel phones, which lets you put multiple group photos together into one, giving you a \"perfect\" shot where no one is making a funny face. Mashable Light Speed AI features like this are becoming standard now in the smartphone market, with each successive launch bringing new AI features to the market. Moto AI gets a boost from Google Gemini, including Google Gemini Live mode. Credit: Motorola The new Motorola Razr and Razr Plus The other two new Razr phones aren't quite as fancy as the Ultra, but as a consolation, they're also considerably cheaper. The base model starts at $699 and comes with a smaller 3.6-inch cover screen and a slightly smaller 6.9-inch interior display. You only get an older MediaTek Dimensity 7400X processor to go along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and the camera array isn't as impressive, but if you want an affordable foldable, this is an affordable foldable.Here are the base model's specs:Displays: 3.6-inch external screen, 6.9-inch internal screenProcessor: MediaTek Dimensity 7400XRAM: 8GBStorage: 256GB of storageBattery: 4,500mAh batteryCameras: 50MP wide, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfieThe $999 Razr Plus is an interesting middle-ground. It retains the 4-inch cover screen from the Ultra and the 6.9-inch display from the base model. It uses a slightly newer Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 processor than what's in the base model, but it still probably won't be as performant as the Ultra. You get 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage here, as well as a 50MP wide lens and 50MP telephoto lens to play with on the back. And here are the key specs for the Razr Plus, with our colleagues at CNET filling in some details on the processor and battery:Displays: 4-inch external screen, 6.9-inch internal screenProcessor: Snapdragon 8S Gen 3RAM: 12GBStorage: 256GB of storageBattery: 4,500mAh batteryCameras: 50MP wide, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfieOne thing is clear: Motorola has come a long way since the first, very disappointing attempt at bringing back the Razr as a foldable five years ago. The 2025 editions of the Motorola Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra will be available for pre-order for U.S. customers starting May 7 at Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon. For now, you can register for updates at the Motorola website.We'll update this post with additional purchase details when we have them, and we're hoping to have a full hands-on review of the new phones soon.",
