  "text": "Android is getting a spotlight ahead of the conference. Android at Google I/O 2024. Credit: Google/YouTube Google I/O, the company's annual developer conference, is nearly here. The show kicks off May 20, and will likely center around Google's plans for its services and products for the coming year.Android, of course, is a huge Google service that is usually highlighted at each I/O. This year, however, it appears the company is taking a different approach; rather than feature Android as part of the general I/O presentation, Google is giving Android its own event, called, appropriately, \"The Android Show: I/O Edition.\"\"The Android Show\" itself isn't something new for this year's I/O. It's actually an existing Google podcast that covers new features and changes surrounding the mobile OS. However, for I/O, Google is rolling out a special edition of its podcast that acts like the Android portion of any given I/O presentation—it's just a week early. The Android Show: I/O Edition will air on May 13, and although we don't know exactly what Google will discuss, we do know the official reason Android is getting its own day of announcements outside of I/O. According to Google, there are just “so many new things to share” regarding Android that there just isn't enough time to include the OS alongside other I/O news. That might be true: Android 16 will likely be the focus of this special edition podcast, which is currently in beta testing. So far, the software has added new features like media and camera updates, power button shortcuts, upgrades to user switching, among others. It's possible the company has a number of new announcements in store for Android 16 and Android devices as a whole, and wants to make sure the platform gets its time in the spotlight. What do you think so far? However, it's also possible that there is a standard amount of Android news to share, and the real cause for the split is AI. Google, like other big tech companies, is all in on AI, issuing new updates to Gemini seemingly daily. I/O will likely be focused on these AI developments, highlighting the company's voice mode Gemini Live, its video generator Veo 2, as well as the latest updates to the Gemini AI model.Hopefully for Android's sake, the company has plenty of announcements to go around. But don't be surprised if I/O in general is more focused on artificial intelligence than anything else. Jake Peterson Senior Technology Editor Jake Peterson is Lifehacker’s Senior Technology Editor.
