Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! Moving Archives, a new program from Google Arts \u0026 Culture Lab, explores how Google AI can bring visual archives to life. For the first edition we’ve collaborated with the Harley-Davidson Museum, whose rich collection is a treasure trove for anyone interested in motorcycling, the history of this iconic American brand and even broader American culture and industry. With the help of Veo, we animated the Harley-Davidson Museum’s still archival imagery with subtle motion. You can switch easily between the original archival image and the AI video. See a glimpse of an old factory floor, board track racers or young people learning to ride. Gemini also generates insightful text and audio commentary for each animated photograph.“The Harley-Davidson Museum was immediately curious when the possibility of transforming our static collection photos into moving images came about,” says Bill Jackson, Manager of Archives and Heritage Services at the Harley-Davidson Museum. “Archival photos convey so much about people, their attitudes, determination and energy. When we see the people in motion, it adds more emotion and connection. We can never know some of these people in person, but these moving images help us feel one step closer.”Moving Archives is part of Google Arts \u0026 Culture’s commitment to exploring how advanced technologies can help anyone anywhere connect with art, history and culture in new ways. With our Artists in Residence program started in 2014, we’re supporting cultural institutions, creative coders and artists in experimenting with Google’s technologies and latest AI models, like using NotebookLM to make it easier to explore the \"American Lawn Tennis” magazine, or using Gemini to help co-compose a new piece of classical music.Explore Moving Archives and many more experiments from the Lab — spanning food, music, art, nature, travel, science and more — on Google Arts \u0026 Culture.
