  "text": "Just last week, io9 ran a post titled “The Voltron Movie Is Actually Happening and Casting Has Begun.” Little did we know that casting for the Amazon MGM film would involve former Superman, former Witcher, and forever Warhammer fan Henry Cavill in any sort of bold-faced context. But today, that’s the news: Cavill is gonna star in Voltron. The Hollywood Reporter got the scoop, noting Cavill “has come aboard to topline in the live-action feature based on the mecha anime that Rawson Marshall Thurber is directing.” Thurber’s most recent film was 2021’s Red Notice. That previous io9 post about Voltron movie casting was on the occasion of newcomer Daniel Quinn-Toye nabbing a starring role—opposite Cavill, we now know, though so far there’s been no word on the rest of the cast. Also a mystery: what Thurber’s take on Voltron will be like, beyond it taking place in live action. As THR reminds us, “Voltron is based on the Japanese sci-fi series Beast King GoLion and Kikou Kantai Dairugger XV. World Events edited and dubbed the series as a syndicated show, naming it Voltron: Defender of the Universe, which ran in the mid-1980s. The premise centered on five young pilots in a battalion named the Robot Lions, which are vehicles that join together to form a mega-robot known as Voltron.” Presumably Quinn-Toye will be portraying one of those young pilots. Any guesses on who Cavill might be playing, please share in the comments. Want more io9 news?
