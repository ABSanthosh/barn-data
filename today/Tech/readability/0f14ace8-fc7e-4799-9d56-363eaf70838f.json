  "text": "Oct 09, 2024 [[read-time]] min read There's been a remarkable global surge in interest for Google Cloud's generative AI, particularly here in the UK. However, we recognize that certain industries, clients, and specific use cases necessitate stricter data residency within their own regions to fully harness the potential of these tools.In response to this demand, we're thrilled to announce at the Google Cloud Next London Summit, that starting next month we will expand our data residency commitment: Customers will be able to conduct machine learning processing for Gemini 1.5 Flash within the UK.New data residency offeringsLast year, we announced that organizations in the UK using Google Cloud’s generative AI capabilities can choose to store their data at-rest in the UK. This includes Generative AI on Vertex AI - Codey and Imagen models, as well as Text Embeddings and Multimodal Embeddings APIs.We're pleased to announce that UK organizations spanning all sectors, including the public sector, will have the option to both store their data at-rest and conduct machine learning processing for our cutting-edge large language model, Gemini 1.5 Flash, entirely within the UK.Our pledges on data residency:Your data stays put: We guarantee your data will only reside in the exact locations you designate, as clearly outlined in our Cloud Locations Page and Service Specific Terms.Machine learning processing happens locally: All machine learning processing of your data, including Gemini inference and deployment of any other ML models leading up to output generation, will occur within the same specific region or multi-region where your data is stored.To delve deeperExplore Google Cloud's data residency offerings here.Gain insights into our AI development process through our white paper on our Approach to AI Governance here.Discover more about our AI platform here.",
