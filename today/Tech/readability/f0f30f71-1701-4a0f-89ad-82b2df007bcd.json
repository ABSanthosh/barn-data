  "description": "The bumper 2025 edition of Amazon's Prime Day is fast approaching and the deals are starting to emerge. While we've seen this offer pop up several times in the past, it's one that's always worth highlighting. New Audible subscribers can get three months of access to the Premium Plus plan for $3. That's a total of $42 off. This is one of the best streaming deals around right now. It will be available until July 31, which is a few weeks after the Prime Day event ends (it could probably be called Prime Week this year since it's running for four days). If you don't cancel your Audible membership before the promotional period ends, it will automatically renew for $15 per month. Through the Audible Premium Plus plan, you'll receive one credit each month. You can use this to claim any audiobook you like on the platform, whether it's a bestseller, new release or something else you've been meaning to get to. You'll retain access to audiobooks you claim with credits even after your subscription expires. So, you're effectively getting three audiobooks for your permanent collection for three bucks. Audible members will be able to take advantage of exclusive discounts and sales too. They also get access to thousands of audiobooks, Audible Originals and podcasts as long as their subscription remains active.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/three-months-of-audible-is-only-3-in-this-prime-day-deal-143734246.html?src=rss",
