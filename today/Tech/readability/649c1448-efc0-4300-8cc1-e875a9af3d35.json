  "text": "Superman has barely taken off in theaters, but two of its supporting characters already could be moving ahead. A new report from the Wall Street Journal says that DC Studios president and Superman writer-director James Gunn is considering spinoffs centering on Mister Terrific, played by Edi Gathegi, as well as Jimmy Olsen, played by Skyler Gisondo. io9 has reached out to Warner Bros. for comment or clarification and will update this story if or when we hear back. The move makes sense, though, since both characters are clear breakouts in the film. Gisondo’s Olsen has one of the most surprising and hilarious arcs in the film. It teases a backstory that we won’t spoil here but is begging to be explored. Not to mention he works at the Daily Planet and that would open the door for many other characters to appear. Mister Terrific is the Justice Gang member most prominently featured in the film, as well as the only one not already set to appear in any HBO Max shows. The leader, Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), is already set to appear in both Lanterns and Peacemaker, while Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) will join him on Peacemaker. That leaves Mister Terrific, and after seeing Superman, you too will wonder where he got all those wonderful toys. Of course, though, according to the story, Gunn is merely considering this at the moment. The film’s opening weekend and fan response will almost certainly play a crucial role in if either idea moves ahead. Plus, of course, both could potentially pop up in future Superman or Justice League movies. Basically, this news is just the next level of Gunn and Peter Safran’s plan at DC Studios, and it sounds very good indeed. Do you think these are the characters best suited for Superman spinoffs? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?
