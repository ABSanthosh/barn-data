  "description": "The U.S. Army told the government it had a lot of success using AI to \"process targets\" during a recent deployment. It said that it had used AI systems to identify targets at a rate of 55 per day but could get that number up to 5,000 a day with \"advanced artificial intelligence tools in the future.\" 404 Media: The line comes from a new report from the Government Accountability Office -- a nonpartisan watchdog group that investigates the federal government. The report is titled \"Defense Command and Control\" and is, in part, about the Pentagon's recent push to integrate AI systems into its workflow. Across the government, and especially in the military, there has been a push to add or incorporate AI into various systems. The pitch here is that AI systems would help the Pentagon ID targets on the battlefield and allow those systems to help determine who lives and who dies. The Ukrainian and Israeli military are already using similar systems but the practice is fraught and controversial. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
