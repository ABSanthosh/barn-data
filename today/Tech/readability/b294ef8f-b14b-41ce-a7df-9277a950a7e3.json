  "text": "A California man has pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image generation tool. Ryan Mitchell Kramer, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, the US Attorney for the Central District of California said Monday. In a plea agreement, Kramer said he published an app on GitHub for creating AI-generated art. The program contained malicious code that gave access to computers that installed it. Kramer operated using the moniker NullBulge. Not the ComfyUI you’re looking for According to researchers at VPNMentor, the program Kramer used was ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which purported to be an extension for the legitimate ComfyUI image generator and had functions added to it for copying passwords, payment card data, and other sensitive information from machines that installed it. The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic. Two files automatically downloaded by ComfyUI_LLMVISION, as displayed by a user's Python package manager. Credit: VPNMentor The Disney employee downloaded ComfyUI_LLMVISION in April 2024. After gaining unauthorized access to the victim’s computer and online accounts, Kramer accessed private Disney Slack channels. In May, he downloaded roughly 1.1 terabytes of confidential data from thousands of the channels. In early July, Kramer contacted the employee and pretended to be a member of a hacktivist group. Later that month, after receiving no reply from the employee, Kramer publicly released the stolen information, which, besides private Disney material, also included the employee’s bank, medical, and personal information. In the plea agreement, Kramer admitted that two other victims had installed ComfyUI_LLMVISION, and he gained unauthorized access to their computers and accounts as well. The FBI is investigating. Kramer is expected to make his first court appearance in the coming weeks.",
