Well, not with PIA. This renowned provider has significantly reduced its prices, making it the most affordable VPN currently available. You won’t believe the discount the provider has come up with. It’s an 82% discount with two free months for the biennial plans. When you do the math, you save $255 compared to the monthly plan. Sounds unreal, but it’s true. Save $255 on PIA VPN Today PIA VPN $255 Discount Explained Private Internet Access was never too pricey to begin with. However, its monthly plan at $11.99 per month isn’t remarkably affordable. Now, imagine spending this amount of money for 26 months straight: sounds ludicrous! That’s why PIA has introduced a discount that slashes the price by 82% and includes two free months. As a result, you’ll spend only $56.94 for the first 26 months. Even after the initial offer, PIA will charge you this much annually! This still results in ample savings compared to the standard monthly price. Private Internet Access hasn’t forgotten to include a 30-day money-back guarantee, either. This enables a prompt refund if you’re unsatisfied. Antivirus + Dedicated IP Discounts As part of its flash sale, the VPN has discounted its antivirus and dedicated IP addresses. Its competitive antivirus now costs $34.80 for two years, while a dedicated IP costs $60 for two years. It’s worth noting that PIA Antivirus is primarily designed for use on PCs. However, its dedicated IP addresses can be used on a plethora of devices. PIA offers them in 25 locations, so there’s plenty to choose from if you decide. As a gift, Private Internet Access includes 500 GB of pCloud for free for a year. We reviewed pCloud and were thoroughly impressed. At under $57 for 24 months, PIA offers one of the top VPN packages you can find. Features Rundown There’s not much you can buy at $2 per month, except if you shop on Temu. PIA doesn’t skimp on necessary VPN features, despite its nearly free price. You’ll get unlimited device protection and a no-log policy, for example. PIA also introduced MultiHop, which doubles your encryption. People love using the VPN for streaming and torrenting. Meanwhile, it’s phenomenal for those on the dark web who seek full onion over VPN support. Private Internet Access is compatible with nearly all devices, and each app version offers robust security. From 256-bit GCM encryption to IP and DNS leak protection, you can expect everything in this neat package. Bear in mind that Private Internet Access periodically alters its price. This is a unique opportunity to enjoy a world-class VPN and spend peanuts. See the offer at Private Internet Access",
