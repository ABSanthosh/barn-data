Oliver Haslam has been writing about phones, computers, games, and anything else that takes a battery or plugs in for more than he'd like to admit. With a focus on mobile and laptops, Oliver is never too far away from whatever social network is trending today and is never short of an opinion to share. Expertise Apple, phones, laptops, smartwatches, mobile accessories, gaming, apps Jason Coles Writer Jason is a freelance writer and editor across a plethora of fields and websites, and when not finding and writing up deals, can often be found trying to tire out his children so they'll actually sleep. No matter how we might feel about it, fewer and fewer phones, tablets and other devices come with a USB-C charger in the box. That means you're going to need to buy your own and this deal on two chargers including cables is too good to ignore. Most of the Amazon Prime Day deals might be over, but the retailer is still selling a pair of USB-C chargers with cables included for just $13. The catch? You'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to benefit from this deal.Getting just a single charger and cable at this price would be a decent deal, so getting two is impressive. Each charger has a 20-watt USB-C port, which is enough for fast-charging the latest iPhones or Android devices. A legacy USB-A port is also included for folks who need it, meaning you can charge more than one device at a time. The two included USB-C cables are 5 feet long.
