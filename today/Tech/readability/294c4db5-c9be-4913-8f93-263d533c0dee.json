  "text": "Whatever Patti LuPone wants, she doesn’t always get, or at least that’s the case when it came to a second season of Agatha All Along. At this point if you haven’t seen the Marvel show, which followed up the events of WandaVision and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it’s on you—but not only did the show’s main character Agatha (Kathryn Hahn) die, so did several other key characters. The Wrap reported that in an interview with Andy Cohen on his Sirius XM podcast Andy Cohen Live, Broadway legend Patti LuPone discussed how she was hoping for more with her character Lilia Calderu, the fan-fave member of the Witches’ Road coven. LuPone was quickly told, “There won’t be one,” by the series’ showrunner. “Jac Schaeffer, the creator, came into my trailer and she said, ‘Patti, I’m just here to tell you that Lilia’s going to die,’ and I went, ‘But I wanted a second season.’” Of course, fans know that death doesn’t always mean the end in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I mean, Agatha is going to continue on as a ghost mentor—why can’t Lilia? LuPone continued, “[Schaffer] said, ‘I don’t do second seasons.’ She said, ‘They wanted me to do a second season of WandaVision and I didn’t.’ She said, ‘There’s too much to write,’ so she does one-offs and I’m really hoping and praying that someday I get to work with her again because she’s magic.” And so is Lilia—what an incredible addition to Marvel’s witches. Come on, give us a ghost coven guiding Billy Maximoff and Jennifer Kale. Or have her commune with Kale from beyond here and there like Agatha’s Marvel Force ghost. Agatha All Along is now streaming on Disney+. Want more io9 news?
