Plus, a Google.org grant of £865,000 will fund AI literacy programmes across the country. AI has the power to change the way we fundamentally live, work, and learn, through its capacity to assist and empower people in almost every field of human endeavour. That’s why it’s important that we support the next generation in being equipped with the right digital skills to thrive.Today, Google launched the AI Campus, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer attending to show his support for our groundbreaking initiative to improve digital skills in the UK in our London home and his constituency. The Campus, situated in Somers Town, Camden, has been developed in partnership with Camden Council and Camden Learning and is home to a two-year education pilot aimed to help inspire, inform, and educate local sixth form students in the field of AI.The pilot will offer students access to cutting-edge resources on AI and machine learning, as well as offering mentoring and industry expertise from Google, Google DeepMind, and others. Students are also provided with real-world projects which connect AI to diverse fields — including health, social sciences, and the arts — to allow them to explore the range of local and global challenges that AI can be used to address.The initial cohort is already underway, with the 32 students reflecting the diversity of Camden’s post-16 student body. Preference was given to applicants from underrepresented groups, including those eligible for Free School Meals.From mid-2025, a wider range of students will also be able to benefit, as the Campus will provide out-of-school learning and support to the broader Camden student body to enhance their access to technology, digital and foundational AI learning, and AI-focused masterclasses for all.Beyond Camden, the message of AI Campus goes to the core of what Google stands for — making the world’s information accessible and useful for everyone. Google’s mission came to life in a garage over 25 years ago, but it’s still relevant today as we enter this era of AI innovation.With new funding of over £865,000 from Google.org, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is building on the early success of Experience AI, a free educational programme co-created by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind. This funding will support the Raspberry Pi Foundation to work with ParentZone to scale the programme and deliver valuable teacher training across the UK, with an aim of reaching an additional 250,000 students by the end of 2026.Google’s commitment to uplifting the UK’s skills is an enduring one, and is part of our ambition to use AI to improve people’s lives across the country, ensuring that everyone is able to seize the benefits of AI, regardless of their background.We have already trained more than one million people and businesses across the UK in digital and AI skills, partnering with governments, trade unions, NGOs and local communities — and recently launched the AI works program to uncover the most effective ways to accelerate the uptake of AI skills and boost productivity across the UK.And by getting a first-class AI education, the next generation can pioneer the transformative use of AI. This is a mission that will turbocharge the UK’s global competitiveness, but also the scientific breakthroughs that can change and save lives. This is the opportunity before us and Google is ready to play its part.",
