The streamer just released a new clip of Squid Game’s third season, and while it doesn’t show much, it manages to evoke the series’ distinct brand of tension, this time with a gumball machine as the centerpiece.Here’s the set-up, according to Netflix:Picking up from season 2’s devastating cliffhanger, season 3 thrusts Gi-hun (Player 456) back into the brutal heart of the games, determined to dismantle them once and for all. Still haunted by the betrayal and loss of his closest ally, Jung-bae (Player 390), Gi-hun faces new perils — including the Front Man, who shockingly infiltrated their rebellion disguised as Player 001.While season 1 of Squid Game debuted in 2021, its sequel didn’t start streaming until several years later. There isn’t quite such a big gap for seasons 2 and 3 though; the second season streamed last December, and the third will premiere on June 27th. While the show itself is ending, Netflix seems intent on keeping the larger Squid Game universe alive in various forms. The mobile title Squid Game: Unleashed launched last year, and there are reports of a David Fincher-helmed spinoff as well.InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.",
