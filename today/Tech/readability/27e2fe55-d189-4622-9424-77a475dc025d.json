  "text": "Let’s take a quick international trip to see the latest at Tokyo Disneyland, which gets an adorable Marvel overlay at its It’s a Small World attraction. Stateside, it’s festival season at Walt Disney World with the opening of pop culture fan favorite Festival of the Arts at Epcot;  over at Magic Kingdom, Space Mountain celebrates 50 years. At Universal Studios Orlando, the Wicked craze continues with a new look at its official shop, and the Stella Nova hotel prepares to host its first guests as the countdown to Epic Universe begins in earnest. On the West Coast, things are quieter as Southern California rises to overcome the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires. Due to its location, Disneyland was able to remain open as people evacuated to Anaheim. Universal Studios Hollywood closed briefly but opened its doors once the fires moved away from the Studio City area, although caution should still be taken if you’re planning a visit (definitely keep an eye on various air quality index readings). To help Los Angeles heal, the movie town is inviting Angelenos to the theater for a series of free screenings in support of evacuees. Disney Studios, Paramount, the Academy Museum, and revival theaters are providing cinematic escapes at no charge for family films, and some theaters are donating a percentage of proceeds from other film screenings held in addition to ongoing donation drives. For a full list on how to help out those in Los Angeles check out this post from the Blacklist.
