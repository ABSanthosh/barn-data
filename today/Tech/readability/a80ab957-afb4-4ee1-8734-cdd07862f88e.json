The round follows a raise of $100M in credit financing in September and a $110mn equity round in March 2024 — when the startup became a unicorn. In total, Mews has bagged over $500mn to date, making it one of the Netherlands’ most cash-flooded scaleups. Mews was founded in 2012 by Richard Valtr, an ex-hotelier on a mission to transform the way hotels do business. “Digital transformation is challenging for many hospitality brands because too many run their systems with legacy, on-premise technology,” Valtr previously told TNW. Mews has built a cloud-based system that helps hotels and other hospitality businesses handle tasks like booking rooms, checking guests in and out, processing payments, and managing housekeeping. It also provides tools for reporting and analytics. The company is riding sustained growth in global travel to fuel its expansion. Mews reported 50% year-on-year growth in 2024, processing more than $10bn in payments volume and surpassing $200mn in revenue. It has also acquired 12 companies in total at it looks to swallow up market share. The most recent acquisitions include Sweden’s Atomize, a cloud-based revenue management system for hotels, and Germany’s HS/3 Hotelsoftware. Mews plans to continue its shopping spree, aiming for up to four acquisitions in 2025. Fuelled by fresh funding, it’s also looking to expand its presence in the US. It’s no surprise then that the main investor in this latest capital raise was American investment firm Tiger Global. “Tiger Global is a compelling partner for the next chapter of our journey,” said Valtr. “Their experience with high-growth technology companies and category winners in the US, including Toast, Procore and ServiceTitan, is invaluable as we continue to expand our footprint, accelerate innovation, and pursue strategic acquisitions.” Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.
