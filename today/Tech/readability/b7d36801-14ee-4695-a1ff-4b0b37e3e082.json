  "text": "Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) acts as its annual showcase for everything new the company plans to include in its software for the next year, providing developers lead time (and incentive) to integrate imminent features and capabilities for iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, Apple Vision Pro, Apple Watch and Apple TV in their upcoming releases.Today's event brought us a Liquid Glass redesign across operating systems, unified version numbers for the OSes (all ending in 26, e.g., iOS 26), except MacOS Tahoe 26, which still incorporates a tourist destination. Plus, the new Gaming app -- which is mostly a hub but with some group features -- which we've been waiting for.  Apple prepped buzz for the event by releasing new retro merchandise for the nostalgic among us. Watch this: WWDC 2025: Everything Revealed in 10 Minutes 09:37The event began with a buzz video of Craig Federighi, senior VP of software engineering, racing in an F1 car to promote the F1 movie produced by Apple for its Apple TV Plus streaming service.  If you're more the \"moment-by-moment\" type, you can check out our archived live blog. Or just skip to the memes inspired by the closing song. Or just go straight to the part where you complain it bored you.Public betas of the new operating systems will be available in July, and the first developer beta for iOS 26 is available right now.  Watch this: Apple Unveils Liquid Glass, a New Design Language 05:53 Liquid Glass redesign stole the show Apple's \"gorgeous new design,\" for all its platforms the first overhaul since iOS 7, made possible by better displays and more powerful components. Apple's vision for its next operating systems' interfaces is almost literally that: It's inspired by VisionOS. The new design system is called Liquid Glass, and brings a return to more pervasive translucency for the OS elements -- the same aesthetic that informs the software for its Vision Pro VR/AR headset. That means more lens-like appearance, with specular highlights and dynamic movement as you change viewing angle. Navigation behavior changes as well. Apple/Screenshot by CNETiOS 26: The new operating system (and naming) is officialLiquid Glass will probably make the most impact on Apple's most popular device. But in addition, there's a new unified layout for communications, integrating Phone and FaceTime. Call Screening will wait until someone begins to talk and tell you who it is before ringing through, while Hold Assist will keep the call connected in the background and ring you when someone answers. Across the apps, there are lots of interface elements floating and more features just a tap away.   The long-rumored \"new destination\" for gaming, Apple introduced the Games app. There's a hug for Arcade, and it shows events and your entire game library in a single place. There's Play Together for managing co-op and group challenges. Developers can use that for turning single-player games into group challenges.And it works with a controller. Heck yeah. Watch this: Introducing iOS 26 at WWDC25 04:37Messages gets a customizable background that's shared across a chat, group chats can host polls, and you can request or receive Apple Cash in group chats. You'll be able to filter messages out from recent and unknown senders out of notifications. Emoji generation gets smarter by letting you combine and modify Genmoji to more accurately reflect what you want to convey. New ChatGPT styles include things like oil painting, or the ability to ask for a specific style that's not a preset.  Live Translation is now live in the communications apps with this version of the OS, and will work when you call someone who's not on an iPhone.   In addition to the new look, which includes things like dynamic scaling of widgets based on the photo on the lock screen, can automatically make the photo 2.5D and animated artwork for what's playing. There's lyrics, live lyric transliteration, mixing via the new AutoMix feature and music pins in your library.  iOS 26 features a new Games app and live translation. Apple/Screenshot by CNETThe camera makes it more streamlined to access the basic photo and video modes, plus all the options have been made a quick gesture away. Library and Collections tabs are back in Photos. Apple opens Visual Intelligence to not only screenshot search, but can use it across apps or call up ChatGPT. Maps can learn your preferred routes and take them into account, gives you travel time estimates and remembers where you've been for a visited-location history. Apple Wallet will offer passport info for digital IDs (for everything but flying). Pay will offer in-person redemption of Rewards and use of Installments. Apple/Screenshot by CNETiPadOS 26 gets more Mac-like every yearThough probably not the most popular updates people care about, iPadOS 26 did get a lot more architectural changes aside from more Liquid Glass prettiness and the Live Translation, communication and AI features from other devices.The substantive changes include a new windowing system to improve multitasking. There's a grab handle to resize full-screen apps to windows, using the flick gesture to tile -- it works with a trackpad as well as touch. It looks very similar to MacOS.  The big change to iPad OS is a new system for managing your windows. Apple/Screenshot by CNETExpose brings up thumbnails of open windows so you can select the one you want. There's also a persistent menu bar at the top of the screen, like a desktop OS. Heck yeah. And it doesn't require a specific high-performing iPad; it works with Stage Manager and on multiple displays. Of course, some people are wondering (dreading?) what it will be like to use on an iPad Mini.Files finally grows up, like a detailed list view with the ability to resize columns, the ability to drag a folder to the Dock and more. Preview comes to the iPad, and the OS adds support for selecting a mic and providing a noise-isolation option across apps. There are also more tools for creators, such as local capture via video conferencing apps, with mic options for better sound. Background tasks -- yes! -- will show up as live activities, so you don't have to put it down and walk away for a render.MacOS Tahoe... 26This year's location name is Tahoe, and the update includes the same communications appearance updates as iOS 26. MacOS Tahoe incorporates the Liquid Glass design, too. You can add a new set of controls to the control center, change colors or add emoji to folders.Continuity gets Live Activities, like on the iPhone, and the Phone app comes to the Mac with shared history and the other new AI features. MacOS is the only Apple operating system that will keep its old naming practice. Apple/Screenshot by CNETShortcuts now have intelligent actions, like summarizing text or comparing things. Spotlight adds some of the annoying features of Windows search, like mixing results across types you don't want. Quick Keys are two-letter shortcuts for apps and actions, along with suggestions. It keeps a clipboard history, which should make a lot of folks happy.The Games app on Tahoe has the same features as the app on iPhone, plus an in-game overlay. Updates to Apple's Metal graphics framework, Metal 4, adds frame interpolation, denoising and more for potentially better game performance and quality. Upcoming games include Crimson Desert and Inzoi.  Watch this: Apple's WatchOS 26 Gets a New Look and More Features at WWDC25 07:03Workout Buddy makes its debut in WatchOS The Apple Watch OS incorporates AI in a new Workout Buddy, which keeps your fitness history and offers vocal coaching (ugh, pep talks) with a summary of your workout stats at the end. Workout has a new layout and custom workouts. Smart Stack uses more data to prioritize and predict which features you'll want soon. It's smarter about notifications, basing the volume on the ambient noise in your environment, and adds a Wrist Flick gesture for things like dismissing notifications.    WatchOS 26 will also feature smarter smartstacks. Apple/Screenshot by CNETThe new design permeates Apple TV Plus and TVOS, too. Apple also announced some new upcoming originals and new seasons of existing shows like Slow Horses and Foundation.TVOS will will let you jump back into shows more quickly and gets into karaoke with your iPhone as the mic.  Along with integrated karaoke, the new TvOS includes a redesigned FaceTime app. Apple/Screenshot by CNETVisionOS 26 adds more for businessThis operating system already had the look, but Apple's taken VisionOS 26 deeper and more into-the-real-world. Widgets can be personalized and persistently overlaid. The OS will remember window placement. Photos can also create spatial views of photos and automatically convert images in articles, for instance. Personas will potentially look more accurate.  Apple's VisionOS 26 will add Spatial Scenes, a new method of creating 3D images in your photos. Apple/Screenshot by CNETCollaborative Pro usage got a co-op game callout, but it's for business. If you're using a shared team device, you can save your settings on your iPhone. There's also a new Eyes Only mode for privacy. Logitech Muse 3D stylus and PSVR hand controllers are two of the interesting new accessories for it.You'll be able to edit Premiere Pro video and playback native 360 degree playback for popular action cams.",
