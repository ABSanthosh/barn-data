  "description": "BrianFagioli shares a report from BetaNews: The Wine team has officially released Wine 10.0, marking a full year of extensive development with over 6,000 changes. This stable release introduces major updates designed to enhance performance, compatibility, and visual experience when running Windows applications on Linux and other non-Windows platforms. Here's a list of the new changes and features: - Full ARM64EC Support: Now on par with ARM64, allowing the creation of hybrid ARM64X modules blending ARM64EC and ARM64 code in a single binary. - 64-bit x86 Emulation: Leverages ARM64EC to run internal processes natively, reducing the need for resource-intensive emulation. - High-DPI Scaling Overhaul: Automatic adjustments for non-DPI-aware applications on high-resolution displays with customizable compatibility flags. - Vulkan Improvements: Support for Vulkan child window rendering under X11 and compatibility with Vulkan 1.4.303. - Direct3D Updates: Fixed-function pipeline for legacy Direct3D versions and introduced Dynamic Vulkan extensions to reduce stuttering. - Experimental FFmpeg Backend: Better multimedia playback for applications with complex media pipelines. - New Display Configuration Tool: Allows inspection and modification of settings, including virtual desktop resolutions. - Wayland Graphics Driver: Enabled by default on Linux, with support for OpenGL and improved popup window placement (X11 takes precedence unless disabled). - Input Device Improvements: Enhanced touchscreen support for X11 and expanded Bluetooth functionality. - Internationalization Enhancements: Updated Unicode character tables and timezone data for better global compatibility. - Upgraded Libraries: Includes FluidSynth, LibPng, and Vkd3d, alongside new developer tools like the Clang Static Analyzer and improved ARM64 support for C++ exceptions. You can download Wine 10.0 and learn more about the release here. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
