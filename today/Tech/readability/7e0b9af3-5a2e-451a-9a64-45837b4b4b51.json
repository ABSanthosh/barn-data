Homeowners hope not to hear any of those, but now new AI features in the Arlo home security subscription service can notify customers of such sounds via email and push notifications. On Thursday, the company announced Arlo Secure 6, the next generation of its security software, which includes alerts for those sounds and others.Arlo Secure 6 also provides a set of other features, including AI-generated captions to describe events, the ability to search through videos by using keywords or descriptions, and flame detection.Read more: Best Home Security Systems in 2025The Secure 6 camera alerts subscribers when it detects someone screaming, a dog barking, an intruder smashing glass, or someone shooting a gun. The new enhancements build off previously introduced features, including person and vehicle recognition and custom detection. \"When your dog barks, you'll be notified so you can view live video to see if your dog is barking at a stranger or just a cat,\" Arlo said in the release. It's a novel concept, said a CNET staffer.\"I've tested advanced Arlo AI in the past, like the ability to train its visual AI on certain objects,\" said Tyler Lacoma, CNET home security editor. \"But this is one of the only services I've seen that can recognize flames or send customized alerts about gunshots and screaming. As home security AI grows more advanced, these features are becoming more common, and Arlo is early to the game.\"A growing industryArlo's features increase its competitiveness in the market for home security systems, which is set to keep growing for at least the next few years, according to a recent report from Grand View Research. The report anticipates an annual global growth rate of a little more than 15 percent from the market size of $33.94 billion in 2024.Read more: I Thought I'd Hate AI in Home Security. It's Just the OppositeGrand View says a variety of factors, both societal and technological, are driving the growth: growing concerns about safety and security, the user convenience of remote monitoring and control, and the continued and seemingly limitless advances in AI technology.The market for AI cameras is also booming, thanks in part to the increasing demand for next-gen home security systems. According to a recent report by Transparency Market Research, the market will grow to an estimated $35.5 billion by the end of 2034, on an annual growth rate of 14 percent.Thanks to rapid and constant improvements in image recognition, facial recognition, object detection and behavioral analysis, AI cameras are also becoming vital in the security and surveillance, automotive, retail, health care and smart homes industries.",
