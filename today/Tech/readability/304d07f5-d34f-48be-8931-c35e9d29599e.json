  "text": "It‚Äôs time to give Roborock a hand, because they‚Äôre giving us an arm. The Roborock Saros Z70 is the world‚Äôs first mass-produced robotic vacuum with a foldable mechanical arm that can intelligently identify and remove obstacles from its path, and even put them away for you. It‚Äôs the most groundbreaking advance in home cleaning technology in recent memory, and it‚Äôs sure to usher in an entirely new era in home robotic appliances and assistants. The world got a sneak preview of the Saros Z70 at CES 2025 in January, and the first demonstration of the mind-boggling AI-powered capabilities of the OmniGrip foldable robotic arm made this one of the most anticipated new product releases in years. The Saros Z70 is able to accurately see, measure, and recognize its surroundings, and it uses AI to detect new obstacles or if the furniture‚Äôs been rearranged, and instantly rewrite its internal maps in real time. And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface of the unprecedented feats this ultra-intelligent robotic vacuum/mop combo can perform. ¬© Roborock Industrial robotic arms have been around for decades, and AI has been a presence in our homes in ways that seem to grow every day. And we‚Äôre all very well acquainted with robotic vacuums and mops and other enormously helpful smart home devices. But combining all of those into one enormously intelligent and multi-functional smart cleaning device has been, until now, just a very cool concept. And while the competition is still busy at the drawing board, Roborock is now the first company to take that concept into mass production and make it available to consumers in the form of the Saros Z70. It‚Äôs an enormous leap forward in robotic intelligence and capabilities, offering a smart device that‚Äôs more autonomous than any of its predecessors, and with the groundbreaking OmniGrip arm, able to perform specific chores and tasks for you. That‚Äôs what makes the release of the Saros Z70 such a seismic event. üéâ Roborock Wins Big at the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025! üèÜ We‚Äôre excited to announce that Roborock has won several prestigious awards for innovative designs like the Saros Z70, Saros 10R, and more. Join us in celebrating this incredible milestone! ü•≥#Roborock #iFDesignAward pic.twitter.com/jFQW66P107 ‚Äî Roborock (@roborockglobal) April 2, 2025 Next-Level Intelligence The OmniGrip arm would be an amazing innovation in any circumstance, but Roborock has combined it with AI so advanced that it will redefine the definition of what a household robot can do. The OmniGrip arm of the Saros Z70 does far more than simply grab objects ‚Äî it can see and think thanks to its precision sensors, dual cameras, and LED light, all of which feed information into the Saros Z70‚Äôs AI processor. The OmniGrip arm can identify what‚Äôs in its path, whether or not it‚Äôs too heavy to pick up, and what to do with it. See Saros Z70 at Roborock.com For example, the Saros Z70 can identify a stray sock in its path, determine that it‚Äôs light enough to be picked up (anything roughly 0.6 pounds or less), and know to bring it toward the closet. A crumpled piece of paper or tissue can be brought to the trash can. Other objects without obvious homes can simply be moved out of the way, and the Saros Z70 knows to double back to that spot for a second round of cleaning. ¬© Roborock The intelligence level of the Saros Z70 is so great that it can identify and remember up to 108 household objects, 50 of which you can customize with labels in the Roborock app, and what to do with them. Even if it can‚Äôt pick up or move an object, it is able to identify it, and theoretically help you locate something that‚Äôs gone missing under a bed or other hidden area. That‚Äôs a massive leap forward for cleaning, and it‚Äôs even entertaining to teach the Saros Z70 how to interact with random objects and watching it work its magic. Gets Down to Business We could talk all day about the first-of-its-kind OmniGrip arm and otherwordly intelligence of the Saros Z70, but skipping its ability to actually clean your home would be doing it a huge disservice. The Saros Z70 is a top-notch robot vacuum and mop that would earn its way onto the best-of lists for robotic cleaners even without the OmniGrip arm and advanced AI. The upgraded dock can recharge the Saros Z70 in just 2.5 hours, heat and refill the mop water and then air-dry the mop pads, dispense detergent into the mop water, and even intelligently detect dirt to decide if it needs to re-wash and re-mop. ¬© Roborock The robot itself is barely 3 inches tall ‚Äî the thinnest Roborock ever ‚Äî and that exceptionally low profile enables it to get into areas most competing robot vacuums would simply get stuck in. It has advanced anti-tangle features for hair, and a powerful 22,000Pa of suction to give both hard and carpeted surfaces a truly deep cleaning. The Saros Z70‚Äôs FlexiArm Riser Side Brush extends to get into corners and along baseboards, and it‚Äôs able to lift itself over small thresholds like doorways or transitions between hard and carpeted surfaces. It can also lift its mop pads nearly a full inch off the floor to keep them off carpets, or remove the mop pads autonomously for vacuum-only tasks, and then replace them for mopping duties. All of these cleaning features, including the self-heating mop water, are backed by AI so the Saros Z70 can learn your cleaning preferences and modify them on the go. The Roborock app allows you to program and personalize all the settings so you can fully entrust the Saros Z70 to give your entire home a thorough cleaning without supervision. In the ever-escalating arms race among robotic home cleaning appliances, the debut of the Saros Z70 is truly the Sputnik moment ‚Äî first of its kind, bringing abilities and technology out of the development stage and directly into the mass market, and into your home.",
