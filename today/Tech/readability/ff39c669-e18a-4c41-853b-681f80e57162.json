Expertise Smart home | Smart security | Home tech | Energy savings | A/V Many Americans already track health statistics like heart rate and breathing patterns on tech-savvy accessories. But now, the federal government is getting involved. On June 24, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced \"one of the largest HHS campaigns in history\" to encourage the use of wearables to track health conditions, a trend CNET has recently covered.Kennedy is referring to the many different bands, watches, rings and even clothes that use technology to track human vital signs. The latest version of the Apple Watch, for example, has sensors designed to detect heart rate, heart rhythm issues, falls, sleep health, sleep apnea, temperature, breathing rate and more. The newest Oura Ring can track sleep patterns, menstrual cycles, temperature, heart rate and other health details.\"We think that wearables are a key to the MAHA agenda, Making America Healthy Again ,\" Kennedy told the Subcommittee on Health during its budget meeting. \"My vision is that every American is wearing a wearable within four years ... they can see what food is doing to their glucose levels, their heart rates and a number of other metrics as they eat it.\"  The Samsung Health app showing data from the Galaxy Watch Ultra. John Kim/CNETKennedy also tweeted that \"wearables put the power of health back in the hands of the American people.\" \"Wearables,\" however, is a broad term encompassing everything from fitness devices that count steps to sleep trackers you wear at night. And consumer devices can't easily replace monitoring solutions offered by medical professionals. For example, CNET has covered research indicating that even the best-in-class Apple Watch struggles with accuracy from metrics like steps to heart rate. Another study from California State Polytechnic University has shown that fitness-related Fitbit trackers show high inaccuracies as well. In fact, that research was used in a related Fitbit lawsuit.Speaking of glucose monitors, Kennedy isn't the only White House official with an interest in such health sensors. The administration's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Casey Means, co-founded glucose-monitoring company Levels and sells a monitoring app as well as other wellness products.The US Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
