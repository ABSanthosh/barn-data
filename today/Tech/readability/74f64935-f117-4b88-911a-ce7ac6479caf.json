  "text": "The Disney Experiences video library, which already includes POV ride-alongs for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance and a Galaxy’s Edge ambiance stroll, will soon add more attractions from across the Disneyland Resort. It’s perfect for the fans who transform their living rooms, classrooms, and office cubicles into their ride vehicles and you’ll be able to make a whole virtual grand circle tour of the park when the new videos hit the streamer July 17—which is Disneyland’s 70th birthday. Here’s the list of walkthrough POVs hitting Disney+ if you’re chasing a particular type of Disney dopamine hit: • Pirates of the Caribbean | Disneyland Resort • Indiana Jones Adventure | Disneyland Resort • Radiator Springs Racers | Disneyland Resort • Incredicoaster | Disneyland Resort • Haunted Mansion | Disneyland Resort • Tiana’s Bayou Adventure | Disneyland Resort • Cars Land | Disneyland Resort • Pixar Pal-A-Round | Disneyland Resort • Big Thunder Mountain Railroad | Disneyland Resort • Jungle Cruise | Disneyland Resort • Soarin’ Around the World | Disneyland Resort • Avengers Campus | Disneyland Resort • Hollywood Land | Disneyland Resort • Main Street, U.S.A. | Disneyland Resort • Mickey’s ToonTown | Disneyland Resort • 70th Celebration Nighttime Spectaculars | Disneyland Resort It’s so fun to see this be an option to make the parks more accessible or even discoverable for folks who don’t usually get much exposure to theme park culture. The standout is definitely Radiator Springs Racers, which showcases the incredible work Imagineering did to bring the world of Pixar’s Cars to life. I don’t even like the franchise but my fave Cars movie is the Cars land. There’s also Indiana Jones Adventure, which got a facelift in the last couple of years after looking rough without any special effects; it’s now up to state of the art standards. And my personal comfort ride Haunted Mansion is for sure going to get so many views from my household. Fingers crossed we get some Orlando Disney World drops because I need to “live with the land” in Epcot from the West Coast. The effort to entice visitors through this digital media experience does serve as a clever sample to lure you to the real thing as the parks have recently pivoted from rising prices. We’ve recently been seeing a lot of sales on Disney vacations including specials for Disney+ members and other retailer promotions. Who would have thought pricing people out wouldn’t work? So sprinkling in some Disney Parks magic to the streamer sure seems like a way to get more Disney vacays booked. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
