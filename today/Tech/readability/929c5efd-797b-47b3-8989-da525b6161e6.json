  "text": "A few weeks ago, Microsoft exec Sarah Bond said that in November, “players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.” It’s almost December and the feature still isn’t live, but Bond says it’s not Microsoft’s fault. The problem, as she puts it, is that Microsoft would only be able to do it once a court order takes effect that forces sweeping changes for Google’s Play Store on Android, like opening it up to competition and ending the requirement for apps to use Google Play Billing. On October 18th, Judge James Donato granted Google’s request for a stay while it appeals his ruling that the Android app store is an illegal monopoly, which could leave things hanging in the balance for quite a while. Bond referenced that in a thread on Bluesky today, writing, “Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision.”Microsoft has been planning its mobile app store strategy for years. However, as frustrating as it is for gamers, the company still hasn’t explicitly said what about the situation prevents it from offering Xbox game purchases like Steam and PlayStation already do, to go with its integrated Xbox Cloud Gaming features. We also don’t have an update on the status of its browser-based mobile store, which still shows a “coming soon” sign, just like it did in August.",
