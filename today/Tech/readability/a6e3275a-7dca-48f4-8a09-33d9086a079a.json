For Almer, the deal bolsters the budding company’s ambitions to scale at pace and expand beyond Europe.  “We are thrilled that the Almer team is joining forces with the American leader in the augmented reality space for frontline workers,” said Olivier Laplace, managing partner at Swiss VC Vi Partners. The firm was an early back of Almer.  “This strategic move validates our early conviction that Almer is a technical front-runner,” said Laplace, who will now join the board of directors of Realwear. The acquisition comes as the market for AR, and extended reality (XR) more broadly, consolidates.  The initial hype around XR sparked a wave of startups and experimental applications, driven by excitement over immersive digital experiences. Now, as the market matures, we’re beginning to see where the technology adds real value.  XR tech can now be found in any industry that benefits from immersive interactions. Healthtech has been one of the greatest use cases. AR is used to provide train medical professionals, enhance patient diagnostics, and even facilitate remote surgeries. Startups in transportation, manufacturing, professional training and construction are also harnessing the technology. And of course, gaming and entertainment — the early targets of the XR market — still make up a sizeable portion of the market. Almer’s buyout was financially backed by TeamViewer, a major player in enterprise AR software that owns a minority stake in both Almer and Realwear. Almer will continue to operate from its headquarters in Switzerland. The deal amount was not disclosed.",
