That’s why Gmail is rolling out a smarter search feature powered by AI to show you the most relevant results, faster.Instead of just showing emails in chronological order based on keywords, Gmail search results now factor in elements like recency, most-clicked emails and frequent contacts. With this update, the emails you’re looking for are far more likely to be at the top of your search results — saving you valuable time and helping you find important information more easily.“Most relevant” search results are rolling out globally for users with personal Google accounts, and can be accessed on the web and in the official Gmail app for Android and iOS. Once available in your account, you can toggle between “most relevant” and “most recent” results. We’ll expand this to business users in the future.",
