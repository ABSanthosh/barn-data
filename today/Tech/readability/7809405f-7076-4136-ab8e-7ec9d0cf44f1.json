  "text": "So many things about Jar Jar Binks make him unique. That voice. His tongue. His ability to start a war with his stupidity. But more than any of it, it’s those eyes that really jump into your soul and scream “Mesa back!” Luckily for us, Star Wars eyes are a specialty of artist Jason Edmiston who, this week, is continuing his Eyes Without a Face series with two popular prequel characters: Jar Jar Binks as well as Ahsoka Tano. The pieces, which you can see below, both measure 9 x 5 inches (with the border), are in editions of 300, and cost $35 each. They’ll be available starting at noon ET on Friday, March 14 at Bottleneck Gallery. Check them out. The Gungan Guide by Jason Edmiston The Togruta Apprentice by Jason Edmiston If these look a little familiar to you, good eye! (Ahem.) These are the latest in Edmiston’s ongoing Eyes Without a Face series, which began way back in 2015 and has captured hundreds of characters across popular culture ever since. You can see most of them in this book that came out recently. However, when he started, Edmiston wanted to do something special for Star Wars, so he avoided the franchise for years. That changed in 2022. He began with Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, continued with Princess Leia and a Stormtrooper from the original trilogy, and Darth Maul from the prequels. Now, he’s done both a movie and animated character. When the Star Wars series started, Edmiston teased that he wanted to go into every single pocket of the Star Wars universe and with this pair, he’s certainly doing that. Plus, we have to admit—much love to Rosario Dawson, but that he did animated Ahsoka as opposed to live-action just feels right. Then, of course, there’s Jar Jar. Love him or hate him, you know those eyes will look great on your wall. Again, Ahsoka and Jar Jar go on sale at noon ET on Friday, March 14 at Bottleneck Gallery. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
