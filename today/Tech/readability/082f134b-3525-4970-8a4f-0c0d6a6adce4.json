Expertise Home | Home Tech | Home Energy | Energy | Climate Change | AI | Appliances If you thought refrigerating your food based on food safety rules or the package instructions was enough to keep it fresh, there are gadgets and gizmos that exist to prove you wrong. Enter, the Shelfy smart refrigerator device which the Vitesy brand says extends food freshness up to 12 days while also removing bad food odors. During early Black Friday deals, it's up to 35% off, making it just $117, and we got to test it out for ourselves. While testing out the device, I was happily surprised with its performance, but one thing specifically stuck out to me: The Vitesy app that pairs with Shelfy.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. The Vitesy Hub app helps the Shelfy shineWhen using Shelfy, it sits in your fridge, measuring a relatively compact 6.51 inches tall, 4.5 inches in width and 2.38 inches in diameter, and it works to prolong freshness through a washable photocatalytic filter. However, in order for the device to do its job it needs to be near your fresh produce. So, if you store your fruits and veggies in a drawer in your fridge, your Shelfy should be in that drawer, too, in order to work as it's intended. Or if you typically leave your kale and spinach in the bag or plastic container you bought it in, you should remove it from the container and store it as is in your fridge and near the Shelfy.Read more: Best Kitchen Tools to Fight Food WasteWhen I tested the Shelfy out, it was slightly heavier than I imagined, and because I have a smaller fridge, it takes up a bit of the precious space, but I have found that I prefer using it in my produce drawer anyways since that is where my carrots, apples, lemons and greens typically are. Shelfy operates in three modes: Eco, Crisper and Performance, and can last up to three weeks in Eco Mode. I use it in Crisper Mode since that's what is recommended when it is stored in a drawer. The device is rechargeable with an included USB cord. While doing its work, it generates noise at 30 decibels, which, to me, sounds like the world's smallest fan. When opening my fridge, I don't typically hear it in the drawer. While I can't fully say for sure if it extends the freshness of my produce since I tend to use it pretty quickly, I know for sure it hasn't lessened its shelf life in any way. And the Shelfy does seem to eliminate smells in the fridge, which is a huge plus when you are storing produce without any packaging or Tupperware. But my personal favorite part is that the device connects to a Vitesy Hub app that gives you more information about your fridge, such as how many times your fridge has been opened and for how long, the temperature of your fridge, and how many days until the Shelfy's filter needs to be washed. There is also a food storage expert section that tells you the best way to store the food in your fridge for optimal freshness. For example, if you type \"cilantro\" in the search bar, it will tell you its seasonality and storage tips. \"Treat cilantro like a bouquet of flowers! Trim the stems, place them in a glass of water, cover the leaves with a loose plastic bag and refrigerate,\" the storage tip reads. \"This method keeps cilantro vibrant and fresh for a longer duration.\"Read more: 31 Great Tech Gifts Under $100 Sure, you could find this information elsewhere online, but I personally love having it all in one spot and using this app almost makes it feel like I have a smart fridge now. In addition, there is a section on cleaning the fridge where you can set up alerts to remind you when it's time to clean your fridge (mine is currently set to remind me every 120 days.) Plus, it even provides you with a seven-step section on how to properly keep your fridge tidy. The Shelfy is my favorite device and app combo that helps me care for my fridge and everything inside of it. Why the Shelfy makes a great giftShelfy is great for anyone who wants to help fight food waste, freshen up the air in their fridge or learn more about it and storing your food properly. While Shelfy is normally listed at $180, it's down to $117 during early Black Friday deals, a savings of $63. Will the Shelfy be on sale on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?This device is on sale right now and we expect it to stay on sale through the holiday.
