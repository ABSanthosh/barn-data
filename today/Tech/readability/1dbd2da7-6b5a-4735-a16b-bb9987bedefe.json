  "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn.—Today, the reborn Scout Motors showed off a pair of new electric vehicles that revives the long-dormant maker of trucks and SUVs. Originally owned by International Harvester, Scout now belongs to Volkswagen Group, which decided to use it to create a new American-made brand for off-road-capable vehicles. The Terra is a much less aggressive-looking pickup than you might find at one of the Big Three domestic automakers... or Tesla for that matter. Credit: Scout Motors The first of these will be the Traveler SUV and Terra pickup truck, due to go into production in 2027. Despite VW's recent investment in Rivian, these are all-new, clean-sheet designs with a platform unique to Scout designed in Michigan, a platform that uses a body-on-frame construction with either purely electric or range-extended powertrains. Scout says that pricing for the Terra and Traveler should start at \"under $60,000,\" or \"as low as $50,000 with available incentives\" for the entry-level models, which are due to go into production at a new factory north of Columbia, South Carolina, in 2027. \"The original core idea—rugged, versatile vehicles capable of off-road adventure and family duty—is more relevant than ever,\" said Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Scout Motors. \"We couldn’t be prouder to revitalize this iconic American brand, create thousands of American jobs, and put American ingenuity back to work.\" The tech specs—at least those Scout has shared with Ars—are encouraging. The electric powertrain operates at 800 V and can fast charge at rates up to 350 kW, using the NACS plug. The Terra and Traveler will be capable of bidirectional charging, and the Terra pickup offers two 120 V and one 240 V AC outlets in its 5.5-foot truck bed.",
