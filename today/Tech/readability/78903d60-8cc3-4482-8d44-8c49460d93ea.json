  "text": "Amazon's October Prime Day event may be over, but if you're shopping for the holidays, there are still plenty of deals available. To sweeten the deal, you can save some money on your next Amazon haul with the Prime Visa credit card. For a limited time, you can score an instant $150 Amazon gift card when you're approved for the card.The Prime Visa card is CNET's top credit card pick for shopping on Amazon, and its welcome bonus is a big reason why. While most welcome bonuses require you to reach a spending threshold to earn a welcome bonus, all you have to do is get approved for the credit card to snag this gift card. The Prime Visa card also offers 5% cash back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods, as well as 5% back on Chase Travel purchases.There is one catch -- you'll need a Prime subscription to apply for this card, which costs $139 per year. If you don't use Amazon frequently enough to warrant adding an annual Prime subscription to your wallet, there's another option: the Amazon Visa*. The Amazon Visa comes with a $50 gift card upon approval, earns 3% back at Amazon and Whole Foods and doesn't require a Prime membership.Check out our Prime Visa review to learn more and apply.More holiday shopping advice:CNET Survey: 72% of Shoppers Are Making Sacrifices to Afford Holiday ShoppingHow I Use the Amazon Prime Visa to Win ChristmasSave on Last-Minute Holiday Shopping With These Credit Card Tips*All information about the Amazon Visa has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuer.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.
