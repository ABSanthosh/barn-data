The platform transforms simple inputs like sketches, 2D drawings, or text descriptions into hypereal building designs.  It works a bit like Midjourney or DALL-E, except it’s built by architects for architects.

  "text": "London-based startup Gendo has secured €5.1mn amid booming demand for its generative AI software built for architects.  British architectural designer George Proud and software engineer Will Jones founded Gendo in 2022. The platform transforms simple inputs like sketches, 2D drawings, or text descriptions into hypereal building designs.  It works a bit like Midjourney or DALL-E, except it’s built by architects for architects. The tool allows you to precisely edit specific details of your design, such as colours, lighting, structural elements, or furniture. The model produces more life-like results than more general AI algorithms.    What’s more, Gendo claims it can generate detailed visualisations 100 times faster than conventional software. The tool also comes at a reasonable price point — £15 per month for the mid-range package. “We are huge believers in bespoke generative AI tools that are designed for specific use cases – the reception to Gendo has been a huge validator of that belief,” said Proud, who serves as the startup’s CEO.  Gendo launched its platform just four months ago, after securing €1mn in pre-seed funding. Early adopters include big names such as Zaha Hadid Architects, KPF, David Chipperfield Architects, and Benoy.   Gendo stands out because it makes it easy and affordable to generate professional designs, filling the gap between basic visualisation tools and time-consuming rendering software like Autodesk’s Forma or Spacemaker.  Patrik Schumacher, principal at Zaha Hadid Architects, called Gendo’s platform a “step-change for our discipline.” Schumacher was recently appointed to Gendo’s board, as the startup embarks on its next phase of growth.   Gendo said it will use the fresh capital to expand its AI capabilities and the development of customised workflows and licensing models aimed at big design firms. German early-stage funds PT1 and LEA Partners co-led the funding round. The UK’s largest pre-seed fund Concept Ventures also chipped in, as did London-based Koro Captial.
