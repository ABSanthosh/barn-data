  "excerpt": "The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada has approved our first-of-its-kind partnership with NV Energy to bring new, clean capacity to Nevada under the Clean Transition Tariff (CTT).This new type of utility rate creates a scalable pathway for utilities and large energy users to invest in clean, reliable electricity and accelerate advanced technologies. The CTT can be replicated in many U.S. electricity markets, and we are already seeing conversations emerge in several other states.Announced last year and approved today, our energy supply agreement will add 115 MW of new “around-the-clock” enhanced geothermal power to Nevada's grid. Developed by Fervo Energy and delivered by NV Energy, this clean power will support Google’s data centers and cloud region in Nevada — while bringing us closer to our 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) goal.",
