  "text": "Google Play announces the 10 indie games studios receiving a share of $2 million and hands-on support as a part of the Indie Games Fund 2024. Ten studios from across Latin America have been selected to receive a share of $2 million in equity-free funding and hands-on guidance from the Google Play team as part of our Indie Games Fund for 2024. This will help the selected founders and their teams grow their businesses by building development capabilities, hire more people and reach a wider global audience through Google Play.Take a look at the 2024 roster of studios and their games — ranging from party games to RPG platformers. Minimol Games, Chessarama (Brazil)Sunna Entertainment, Planet Cube: Edge (Costa Rica)1 Simple Game, The Lullaby of Life (Mexico)Leap Game Studios, Dicefolk (Peru)Plot Kids, Play Together TV (Brazil)Little Leo Games, Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles (Brazil)VISH GAME STUDIO, Just King (Brazil)Seashell Studio, Running Fable (Mexico)Mad Mimic, Dandy Ace (Brazil)Navegante, Greak: Memories of Azur (Mexico) Minimol Games, Brazil“Securing this funding [is] a transformative opportunity for our studio, enabling us to finally bring 'Chessarama’ to the mobile platform — a crucial step in our long-term growth strategy. We recognize the immense potential of the mobile market, particularly on Google Play, and with this support, we can expand our reach, connecting with new audiences and delivering an accessible, high-quality experience for chess and puzzle fans worldwide.”Raphael Dias da Silva and Helena Magarinos Souto (co-founders) Sunna Entertainment, Costa Rica“When we learned about the Google Play Indie Games Fund, we immediately recognized it as an ideal fit for ‘Planet Cube: Edge.’ Our game showcases the high-quality work we’re capable of producing in our region, and the Indie Games Fund provides an invaluable opportunity to bring that work to a broader audience. Beyond visibility, we saw [it] as a chance to access the resources needed to create an experience uniquely tailored for mobile devices — far beyond a simple port.”Virgilio Solis Rojas and Emilio Monge Vasquez (co-founders) 1 Simple Game, Mexico“Our game, ‘The Lullaby of Life,’ is already available on platforms like consoles; however, we believe it has the potential to reach even further. This is why we applied for this funding to bring the game to mobile, offering players a great experience suitable for this platform. We know that Google Play Pass is an excellent platform to expand this experience to many more people, so part of this funding will also be used for advertising.”Francisco Lara Sikorski and Pablo Ovidio Escobedo Ramírez (co-founders) Leap Game Studios, Peru“We applied for the fund to bring ‘Dicefolk’ to a new audience, as the game is perfect for mobile. We’ve also participated in other Google Play’s initiatives for studios in Latin America, and we wanted to continue being part of that effort.”Michael Barclay, Phillip Chu Joy and Luis Wong (co-founders) Plot Kids, Brazil“Throughout our journey, Google Play has been a crucial partner, providing the platform and resources that align with our mission. Applying to the Indie Games Fund for ‘Play Together TV’ was about strengthening this partnership to bring our vision to life. For us, it’s about creating a game that is fun and fosters connections among friends and family, building moments of shared joy that become lasting memories.”Leonardo Guedes Bilck and Luiza Guerreiro (co-founders) Little Leo Games, Brazil\"As a small game studio, we're always worried about the next steps. It's common to move on to the next title shortly after a game's release. With Google Play’s Indie Games Fund, we will be able to work more on [our game] ‘Astrea’ and expand its content, giving us more time to plan our next steps. We thought that being part of this program would give us the possibility to port the game for Android, reaching a new audience. In addition, participating in Play Pass is a huge opportunity for ‘Astrea’ to reach an even larger audience, with more players getting to know it and playing it.\"Leonardo Castanho Barbosa and Juliana Oliveira Hamdeh (co-founders) VISH GAME STUDIO, Brazil“We were in the perfect moment to expand our studio and further develop ‘Just King’ when we found out about Google Play’s Indie Games Fund. It is the perfect opportunity for emerging LATAM studios moving to the next step: It provides stability to grow and reach a new audience without sacrificing our indie vision.”Enrique Wicks Rivas and Igor Ferreira da Silva (co-founders) Seashell Studio, Mexico“We applied for this fund to help ‘Running Fable’ reach its full potential on Google Play. The funding will allow us to amplify our marketing efforts, making the game accessible to a larger audience, integrate with Google Play Pass to provide premium experiences, and enhance user acquisition and retention strategies. This support will enable us to create a stronger, more engaging experience, ensuring players around the world can enjoy and connect with ‘Running Fable’.”Rodrigo Cuadriello Garza and Miguel Silva Jiménez (co-founders) Mad Mimic, Brazil“I applied for the Google Play Indie Games Fund to help bring ‘Dandy Ace’ to new markets. This support will enable us to enhance our game and reach a wider audience, ensuring more players can experience our game.”Luis Tashiro (founder) Navegante, Mexico“We applied to the Google Play Indie Games Fund because it offers an incredible opportunity to bring our current and future games to Android players. This support will be invaluable in helping us grow as a studio and continue delivering unforgettable experiences for our players.”Gustavo Alcalá Perea, Anahit Fernández Díaz and Rodrigo Fernández Díaz (co-founders) Check out more from Google Play’s Indie Games programs helping indie games studios around the world reach their full potential.",
