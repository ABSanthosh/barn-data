  "text": "Ever felt the sudden urge to leap into a TARDIS and flee your current timeline or location (or both)? You can live out your Time Lord fantasies if your pockets are deep enough when a screen-matched TARDIS goes up for auction, part of a trove of Doctor Who items being sold to aid BBC-backed charity Children in Need. The sale also features an array of costumes (picture it: your most authentic cosplay ever!), props, and other memorabilia from the long-running sci-fi series, which will return to Disney+ and the BBC later this year for a second season featuring Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor. Here are just some of the highlights from Propstore’s fundraising auction. TARDIS © Propstore As you can see from the image atop this post, the door actually opens on this “screen-matched” (meaning it was actually used on-screen) TARDIS; alas, the interior does not appear to be any bigger than what you’d expect from the outside. This version of the Doctor’s signature mode of transportation was used in An Adventure in Space and Time, a docudrama created for the show’s 50th anniversary that aired in 2013. Traitor Dalek © Propstore Add this full-sized and screen-matched little buddy to your decor, and give guests a jump scare when they first encounter it. The “Traitor Dalek,” voiced by Nicholas Briggs, had its moment in 2022’s “The Power of the Doctor,” a special that aired as part of the BBC’s centenary celebrations, where it—befitting its name—actually tried to help Jodie Whittaker’s Thirteenth Doctor defeat the Master (Sacha Dhawan). You can still yell “Exterminate!” at it, though. Weeping Angel statue © Propstore Talk about a jump scare! Definitely do not blink when you’re in the room with this notorious Doctor Who villain. Yes, one of its hands is missing, but that somehow adds to the menace, doesn’t it? Tenth Doctor costume © Propstore Formalwear, in a manner preferred by David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor. This lot includes more than you see here; you get “three white dress shirts, a pair of black trousers, a matching black suit jacket, and a black silk bow tie, as well as a pair of black Converse trainers. Two of the shirts are size 15, and one is size 16, and the trainers are size seven,” according to the Propstore listing. Eleventh Doctor costume © Propstore Matt Smith’s time as the Doctor yielded one of the character’s most important fashion moments: that jaunty bow tie. The costume here appeared in “Closing Time” and “Let’s Kill Hitler,” among other adventure-filled episodes. Thirteenth Doctor costume © Propstore Jodie Whittaker was the first woman to portray the iconic Doctor, so perhaps, as Indiana Jones might say, this outfit should be in a museum somewhere. But in the name of charity, you can stash her coat, scarf, cropped pants, and distinctive rainbow-motif t-shirt in your own closet. Donna’s wedding dress © Propstore You also get the shoes to go with this ensemble worn by one of the most beloved non-Doctor Doctor Who characters—Catherine Tate’s Donna Noble—in 2006 Christmas special “The Runaway Bride.” See something you need, or want to peruse all the items up for auction? The sale benefitting BBC Children in Need runs February 11-25 and you can find all the details, including how to bid, here. Want more io9 news?
