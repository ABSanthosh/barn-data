  "text": "The Beats Pill Bluetooth speaker drops to Prime Day prices. We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Product image courtesy of Amazon. Christmas is a week away, and that present-ordering deadline is nearly upon us. If you're looking for a last-minute gift idea for something that will arrive in time to be wrapped, consider the new Beats Pill speaker. It is down to $99.99 (originally $149.95), the lowest price it has been since its recent release, according to price-tracking tools. For less than a hundred dollars, this speaker is a steal. I've been trying out the Beats Pill speaker since it came out in June, and it has everything I would want in a portable speaker: a stereo sound when connected to another compatible speaker, multi-room mode to play the same music on multiple speakers, the Find My Device feature in case you misplace it, and a speakerphone to use it as an extension of your phone. This Beats speaker is not just for Apple users, since Android users can also connect to the Bluetooth 5.3, but it only supports AAC and SBC codecs, so there is no Android-friendly codec options that will make the audio pop out. Apple users will get the most out of the Pill, with seamless iOS compatibility for a much smoother experience. In other words, the speaker will automatically show up as a pair option on iPhones while Androids will have to search for it. You can read about it in more detail on PCMag's \"excellent\" review.When it comes to battery life, you can expect around 24 hours per charge depending on your use, which is up there with other speakers of its size. The sound is the classic bright Beats sound signature, offering a balanced yet bass-heavy sound. It is rated IP67 for being dust-proof and waterproof, so it can be submerged for up to 30 minutes. The main con on this speaker is that there is no adjustable EQ on the app, but it already comes with a great sound signature. Daniel Oropeza Staff Writer Daniel is a Staff Writer for Lifehacker.
