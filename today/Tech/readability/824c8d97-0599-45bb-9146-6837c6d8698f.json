  "text": "Don’t you dare give me hope The newly discovered engine updates are a particularly good sign for the HLX project after credible reports that the game had gone into a friends and family playtesting phase at Valve near the end of 2024. While many Valve projects have seen major changes after that kind of testing, McVicker says that these new engine updates are \"confirmation indeed that HLX survived the holiday break, does not seem to be going through any form of reboot, and [that] an announcement seems to be inching ever closer.\" A December video from \"Gabe Follower\" suggesting that Half-Life 3 had entered a friend and family testing phase. While McVicker doesn't go into detail on every single engine variable hinted at in the latest Valve game updates, he provides a summary version with informed speculation on what all those variables could mean for HLX. That includes signs of a \"heavily evolved\" physics engine from Half-Life 2 that can seemingly track object traits such as buoyancy, flammability, deformation, as well as fluid simulation and dynamic sound properties based on an object's status. Most intriguingly, McVicker talks up signs that HLX may include a new NPC \"mood system,\" letting these AI-controlled characters react \"verbally and non-verbally\" to what they can see, hear, or even smell in the immediate area. The code also hints at \"dynamically adjustable nav meshes\" that will let NPCs navigate easily around destructible environmental hazards, and at a system for in-game objects to be placed semi-randomly during multiple playthroughs, a la Left 4 Dead's director system. We know it's easy to be skeptical after so many years of fruitless speculation regarding Half-Life 3. But when McVicker says that signs suggest that an actual Half-Life 3 announcement could come this year, let's just say we want to believe.",
