  "text": "During our sit-down interview with Looney Tunes voice actor Eric Bauza, who plays Daffy and Porky in The Day the Earth Blew Up, —hitting theaters this week thanks to Ketchup Entertainment—Bauza talked about how this latest cinematic adventure for those darn Tunes could impact another movie Warner Bros. placed on the shelf: Dave Green’s Coyote vs. Acme, starring John Cena and Will Forte alongside Bauza and other seasoned voice vets behind the animation titans. Bauza, who voiced Bugs Bunny in the Warner Bros. Discovery live-action hybrid animation casualty, shared with io9, “I got to see [Coyote vs. Acme] in its entirety from start to finish. I went to almost every test screening for that movie here in LA, and it always came back in the mid to high ’90s,” referring to its high marks from audiences. “[It’s] pretty remarkable. And [it’s] another movie just like The Day the Earth Blew Up that gives you more than just laughs. It gives you some pretty emotional scenes. You really do feel bad for the coyote in that film.” Last year, Coyote vs. Acme co-lead Will Forte posted about the film on X: “When I first heard that our movie was getting ‘deleted,’ I hadn’t seen it yet. So I was thinking what everyone else must have been thinking: this thing must be a hunk of junk. But then I saw it. And it’s incredible … Even when a movie tests very well (like ours), there’s no guarantee that it’s gonna be a hit. And at the end of the day, the people who paid for this movie can obviously do whatever they want with it.” Bauza remains optimistic about Coyote vs. Acme’s future, however, “Who’s to say it’s completely over and done with? The Day the Earth Blew Up might come and do extremely well, and it might make them question their decision. And who knows? Even if we don’t get to see it I know we’re going to get to see more brand new stuff with these these characters. They’re just too funny to sit on a shelf somewhere.” The Day the Earth Blew Up opens this Friday. Want more io9 news?
