Credit: Timothy Beck Werth / Mashable Photo Composite Back in 2022, Panasonic released a men’s grooming tool called the MultiShape. It had a simple value proposition: Built with swappable heads, this multi-groomer lets you combine a beard trimmer, body groomer, electric razor, nose hair trimmer, and electric toothbrush into one gadget.Three years later, I’m still using that same MultiShape on a near-daily basis. In that time, Panasonic has also introduced new accessories for this multi-groomer, including hair clipping tools, a facial brush, and an electric foot scrubber. Is it weird to brush your teeth and scrub your feet with the same device? Yup, and that's why I recommend choosing your accessories wisely.We saw this men's multigroomer hit a new record-low price of $147 recently, and at the time of writing, you can get it for $170. Obviously, it's not as steep a price cut, but it's still $40 off full price. What makes this grooming gadget unique?After the MultiShape came out, I expected Philips-Norelco, Braun, and other big brands to launch similar multitools. However, it's still the only gadget that can go from electric toothbrush to beard trimmer to electric shaver. The MultiShape is also waterproof, so you can clean it pretty easily. I use the MultiShape for daily shaving. Credit: Timothy Beck Werth / Mashable It's also one of the only beard trimmers that can trim long hair. Credit: Timothy Beck Werth / Mashable When this product first came out, GQ called it a “god-tier” grooming tool. Whenever I write about the MultiShape, I reference that line because it pretty much sums up my experience. I’ve tested hundreds of grooming products. So. Many. Grooming. Products. I’m probably one of the few men in the world who has more beauty products than his female partner. A lot more. As I write this, I have a locker next to my desk filled to the brim with beard trimmers, beard oils, face moisturizers, retinol serums, face masks — you name it. The vast majority of these products I never recommend; I'm only looking for the rare exceptions. Mashable Deals I’ve written about the MultiShape a few times over the years, and it’s the grooming product I use more than any other. As someone with a longer beard, it’s one of the few beard trimmers that can handle longer hair. Popular trimmers from Philips-Norelco just don’t work for long facial hair, unfortunately. It’s also my everyday shaving tool. When I travel, I bring the electric toothbrush head. The other tools I use on more sensitive areas — like my ears — so I'll leave it at that.Right now, you can grab a MultiShape all-in-one kit from Panasonic on sale for $170. You can also buy the MultiShape with a handful of pre-selected accessories at Amazon or build your own kit at Panasonic.
