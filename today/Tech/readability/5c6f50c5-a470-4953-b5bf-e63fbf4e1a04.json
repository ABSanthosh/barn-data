It's fascinating to reflect on some of our favorite films about the future and see the worlds they imagined. Watching “Star Trek” episodes as a kid, I remember being completely captivated by their communicators – the idea that a small handheld device could instantly connect you with someone miles away. Now, holding my mobile phone, what once seemed futuristic is ubiquitous and has forever altered social norms.Movies have similarly shaped the popular imagination and technological development of AI. As AI moves out of the realm of science fiction and into our everyday lives, narrative films present an opportunity to explore and showcase the ways we want to coexist with this technology. To help spark this new wave of cinematic exploration, we’re teaming up with Range Media Partners to announce AI on Screen, a new short film program.Over the next 18 months, in collaboration with Range we’ll commission original narratives by visionary filmmakers that explore the complex relationship between humanity and AI. We're looking for stories that will deeply resonate on a human level, exploring the emotional and ethical dilemmas that arise when we intertwine our lives with intelligent machines. Building a filmmaking ecosystem for the futureThis collaboration goes beyond simply funding projects. We’ve joined forces to help filmmakers at a pivotal moment where AI's role requires extensive discussion and diverse viewpoints. Working with Range Studios, Range’s production division, to bring best-in-class development and production expertise to the table, we aspire to greenlight some of these short films into features. Introducing “SWEETWATER” and “LUCID”The first two films, “SWEETWATER” written by Sean Douglas and “LUCID” by Sammi Cohen, are on track for release later this year. Once production wraps, these films will be submitted to key festivals for consideration. Read more about both films below. When the son of a late celebrity visits his childhood home, a piece of fan mail reveals a startling AI, forcing him to reconcile his mother's legacy.Written by Sean Douglas, “SWEETWATER” is produced by Nick Gordon (“The Brutalist”) and Range’s Rachel Douglas. Executive producer, Penny Lin (Range Media). Sean Douglas is represented by Range. Desperate to escape their suffocating reality, a couple risks everything on a revolutionary dream-sharing device.Written and directed by Sammi Cohen, “LUCID” is produced by Rachel Douglas on behalf of Range. Executive producer, Penny Lin (Range Media). Sammi Cohen is represented by UTA and Range. Exploring the future of AI storytellersAI on Screen builds upon last year’s initiative to reimagine visual representations of AI through speculative photography. Our partnership with Range represents a significant step forward in our ongoing commitment to responsibly support creative expression and explore the possibilities of technology through storytelling.We're now calling for ideas and submissions for emotionally-driven short films across genres, from science fiction and drama to thrillers and beyond. We’re particularly interested in original storytelling angles that align with this vision of exploring the future of AI. Interested filmmakers can connect directly with Range to submit relevant project ideas.At the heart of this program is a commitment to working with a diverse spectrum of voices and creatives, reaching discerning next-generation audiences. We believe that the most compelling stories come from a wide range of perspectives. We're excited to see the innovative narratives that will emerge from the AI on Screen - short film program, to witness the conversations they will undoubtedly spark, and to share these incredible short films with the world.",
