  "text": "The best portable projectors, aka mini projectors or beamers, let you watch movies, play games or enjoy TV shows pretty much anywhere you can find a flat surface. Their tiny form factor and low fan noise mean that any dark room, outside wall or even the sides of a tent can be a movie screen. Though they aren't as capable as the best projectors for the home, they let you watch Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney Plus and other streaming services with minimal fuss. I've been reviewing projectors for over 20 years. Here are the best portable projectors I've reviewed. Best Portable Projector for Movies and Gaming Anywhere for 2025 What is the best portable projector for 2025? Best portable projector overall Best small portable projector Best bright portable projector with a battery Best portable projector under $300 Best 1080p mini projector Best budget portable projector Best 4K portable projector Portable projectors compared Other portable projectors I've tested How I test portable projectors Factors to consider when buying a portable projector What makes a mini projector different from a full-size projector? Are all mini projectors portable? Does a mini projector have to be plugged in? Can you watch Netflix on a portable projector? What’s the difference between \"advertised\" versus actual resolution? What is the best portable projector for 2025?I like the Anker Mars 3 Air as the best portable projector overall because it combines a small size, decent price and performance that's better than you might expect. Don't get me wrong, it's still quite dim compared with larger -- and not much more expensive -- home theater projectors, but it does a fantastic job for something so portable, with reasonable brightness, fairly loud audio, 1080p resolution and enough battery life to last the length of a typical movie. Geoffrey Morrison/CNETLike most portable projectors, the Anker Mars 3 Air uses DLP to create an image, so it's detailed even with fast motion. Alhough there are smaller projectors than the 3 Air, they look worse, and though there are better-performing projectors, they're larger and more expensive. The Mars 3 Air hits a sweet spot for a portable projector. Pros Great size Google TV streaming Decent color and contrast for a portable Cons A little pricey Shorter battery life Why I like it:Most portable projectors are compromised in many ways, but the Mars 3 Air manages to do just about everything right. It creates a reasonably bright, colorful, contrasty image, and the streaming interface works the same as those found in more expensive projectors and many TVs. Its onboard sound is better than you’d expect, too, being able to double as a decent Bluetooth speaker. If you want to connect a gaming console, there’s an HDMI input on the back. The battery is rated for 2.5 hours, though if you run it at max brightness, it becomes a lot less. If you’re not on the go, you can plug it in and use it like a regular projector. While traditional home projectors will outperform the Mars 3 Air in just about every way, they lack its battery and ultraportability. I wish the price were a little lower, but given how much better it is than the competition, it’s worth the premium.Who is it for:Anyone looking for a portable projector that can easily fit in a backpack for the occasional traveling movie night.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone looking for a more permanent projector or who wants a really large image should consider a regular home theater projector. For only a little more money, a home theater projector will be significantly brighter. Pros Fun-size projector Full version of Google TV Useful optional accessories Cons Not very bright Not very accurate Why I like it:The Anker Nebula Capsule Air is nearly the same size as a soda can, yet has Google TV built-in and a battery that should last you the length of a movie. There's even an optional tripod with a built-in battery that doubles its playtime. The projector is not especially bright, but it looks good and isn't hugely expensive. While there are other options that have better picture quality, this offers the best size, price and performance package.Who is it for:Anyone looking for the smallest of small projectors, where size and weight are the biggest concerns. This would be great for backpackers, for instance, since it takes up so little space.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone looking for a big projected image. I measured the Capsule Air at 84 lumens, or slightly more in the less accurate Conference mode. This can create a watchable, TV-sized image in a dark space, but it can't compete at all with any amount of light. Price and portability are the Air's strengths. It's best to look elsewhere on this list for better performance. Pros Incredibly bright for its size Huge battery How is this so inexpensive? Cons Color is a bit odd Low resolution Loud in brightest modes Why I like it:Though I like the above projectors better, the AAXA P6X is my pick when money is tight. Not only is it less expensive than the Anker at the top of this list, but it's also brighter and features superior battery life. This mini projector fits in my hand, creates a 720p image and has a huge 15,000-mAh battery. An HDMI input and USB connection let you connect and power a streaming stick. The stick connection is important because the AAXA lacks built-in apps. Light output is impressive for its size and price, about 50% more than the Anker Mars 3 Air, although its contrast ratio is a bit less. The internal battery should last around 90 minutes in the mini projector's brightest mode, and an impressive 240 minutes in Eco mode (probably a little less if you're also powering a streaming stick). The internal speaker isn't great, but there's a headphone jack you can connect to a portable speaker.Overall image quality isn't great, but its size, brightness and price are a great combo.Who is it for:Anyone on a budget who wants to create a larger image than what's possible with the Anker projectors. The image quality isn't better, though. In most ways, it's worse, but it is very bright.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone who's looking for the ultimate in portable picture quality. Pros Literally fits in the palm of your hand Bright for its size and price Some built-in streaming Cons Not powered via USB 540p resolution A few bugs in the menus Why I like it:Unlike many of the other projectors on this list, the AAXA P8 can't run on a battery, you need to plug in its power adapter. However, it's so small, bright and cheap that it makes the list anyway. There are certainly less expensive projectors out there, but nothing I've seen at this price or lower is worth recommending. The P8 is tiny, with roughly the same overall volume as the Anker Capsule Air (which does have a battery), although this projector is rectangular instead of cylindrical. The AAXA is significantly brighter than the Capsule, plus it has a few streaming apps built in and an HDMI port for connecting an external source. The image quality is OK, but for the size, price and relatively high light output, it's hard to knock it.Who is it for:Anyone on a budget who wants a bright image and doesn't mind running an extension cord to the projector or running off an external battery.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone wanting something with a built-in battery for off-grid use, or who is a stickler for picture quality. Pros Roughly the size of a 16-ounce beverage can Google TV streaming USB-C charging Cons Pricey Not very bright Why I like it:The Anker Nebula Capsule 3 is the size of a 16-ounce can, yet it's capable of a big image. Well, maybe not \"big,\" but its certainly \"TV-size.\" The projector is not particularly bright or loud, but for something that can fit just about anywhere, it's great. It has higher resolution and slightly better performance than the Capsule Air, but it's also larger and more expensive. I do prefer the Air for its size and lower price, but the Capsule 3 has its time and place.Unlike the AAXA projectors, the Capsule 3 has the full version of Google TV, so you get the regular version of apps like Netflix, Hulu and so on. The far larger and more expensive Mars 3 Air is twice as bright, but the Capsule 3's contrast ratio is very slightly better. So if you don't mind an image that's half the size, picture quality will be similar.Who is it for:Someone who wants a little better performance than the Capsule Air and doesn't mind a size and price increase. Also, anyone who doesn't mind a smaller but better-looking image compared to the AAXAs.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone who wants a big, bright image. Pros Great speakers Clever handle/stand design Relatively bright Cons Lack of upward throw means you need to use digital keystone Is it... staring at me? The TCL A1 is a little different than the other projectors on this list. It's portable in that it's small and has a built-in handle, but it doesn't have a battery. It has some impressive strengths but also some notable weaknesses.Why I like it:The A1 is like a scaled-down \"regular\" projector rotated 90 degrees. It has a fantastic contrast ratio, great speakers and built-in Google TV streaming. The handle on top extends through the body and becomes a stand to prop up the front and let you get the correct angle to project on your wall. So it's fairly easy to install quickly just about anywhere.Who is it for:The A1 is a little odd, but it's inexpensive and easy to use. If you don't mind some compromises (see the next paragraph), it offers a clever design plus decent image and sound for the money. If you don't want to spend more and don't mind something a bit bigger than the smallest options on this list (and one that you have to plug in), the A1 is great.Who shouldn't buy it:Image quality is quite the mixed bag. While the contrast ratio is great, the brightness drops off significantly at the corners, adding almost a vignette to everything you watch. Color isn't particularly accurate or pleasing. Because there's no upward throw, you either have to use keystone correction or position the projector at the same height as the middle of the image it creates. As in, if you want the center of your projected image to be 3 feet off the ground, the A1 needs to be 3 feet off the ground. Most projectors typically sit at or slightly below the height of the bottom of their projected image. So if you're looking for image quality over all else, the A1 isn't for you. Pros Great design Great contrast ratio Orange \"ears\" add character Cons Underwhelming brightness Expensive Like the TCL A1 elsewhere on this list, the X300G is portable in the sense that it's easier to carry and install than most projectors, but it doesn't have a battery. It's the only 4K projector on this list, but that resolution bump comes with a corresponding price bump.Why I like itThe compact X300G cube is an all-in-one projector with decent speakers, a great contrast ratio, built-in streaming and 4K resolution. It doesn't quite have the light output of some larger projectors, but it holds its own given its smaller size, and it looks great overall.Who is it for:If you want something compact without sacrificing image quality, the X300G compromises only slightly on performance for its cube shape and size. If you want something that sets up quickly to play games in a spare room but also works for a more elaborate movie night in the living room, the X300G is easier to move around than most other 4K projectors. It has the best overall picture of the projectors on this list, but it's also larger and far more expensive. Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone who wants something with a battery, or who doesn't need this level of performance out of their projector. Though the X300G is smaller than \"full-size\" projectors, it's much larger than all the other projectors on this list. It's a bridge between categories, if you will. If size and price are important to you, don't stretch your budget for this. A 1080p projector will work just fine, as will one of the smaller projectors on this list.Portable projectors compared Prices correct at time of review.**As measured by CNET. Not manufacturer claims.

There's also no battery so you'll need to plug it in. It's nice and bright, but the other downsides -- lack of zoom, average overall image quality and a steep price for what you get -- keep it off this list. Read the Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K Projector review.Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K SE: Similar in design to the Laser 4K, it's a little dimmer but also a little cheaper. That makes its price to performance ratio far more interesting. Still large for a \"portable\" projector, but the handle makes it easy to lug around. Read the Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K SE Projector review.BenQ GS50: The GS50 is roughly the same size as the Xgimi Halo Plus, is 1080p and has a built-in battery. You can even use it as a Bluetooth speaker. It's dimmer than the Xgimi Halo Plus for similar money. Read the BenQ GS50 review.BenQ HT2060: While not technically a \"portable\" projector, the HT2060 is small and light. It's wouldn't fit in a backpack, but if you want something for an occasional movie night, it could be stored in a closet and -- when it's time for the movie -- can be set up in just a few minutes. It's one of my favorite projectors. Check out the full review of the BenQ HT2060.Samsung Freestyle: The small, cylindrical Freestyle is an interesting idea, but it comes up short. About the size of a Bluetooth speaker, and can double as one, the Freestyle can pivot on its stand to project an image at any height on walls and even the ceiling. Its built-in streaming is far better implemented than most portable projectors. It lacks a battery, and its performance is average, at best. Worse, its price is 50% higher than it should be based on how it looks and performs. Read the Samsung Freestyle review.Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2: Another relatively expensive small projector I didn't love, the Xiaomi at least has a gorgeous, Apple-like design going for it. I appreciated the compact size, 1080p resolution and built-in Android TV streaming, but the cons outweigh the pros. It's relatively dim, especially for the money, and it lacks both a built-in battery and compatibility with a USB power source, so it's not truly portable. Read the Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 review.I test portable projectors using the same objective and subjective criteria I use to review full-sized projectors. I've been reviewing projectors for over 20 years and have used one (ok, many over the years) as my main \"TV\" since I started reviewing them. I'm Imaging Science Foundation certified and did training at National Institute of Standards and Technology to learn how to accurately measure displays. Specialized test equipment, including a C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Minolta LS-100 luminance meter and an AEMC CA813 illuminance meter, help me determine the reality behind manufacturer specs. The data I collect gets entered into Portrait Displays CalMan Ultimate software for easy comparison, as well as an elaborate spreadsheet I've spent years modifying that helps me tally and compare every projector I've reviewed.I set up every projector to find its most accurate color temp, color mode and other picture settings and use that for comparison and measurement. A Portrait Displays VideoForge PRO 8K supplies the test patterns. Many portable projectors lack the picture settings of more expensive/larger models, so I use whatever's available to get as close to correct as possible. I measure brightness and contrast ratio in multiple lamp/laser/LED settings. I also check the light output in the brightest mode, which is rarely the best-looking mode. Once I've fully set up and objectively measured the projector, I watch a variety of content, including TV, movies and games, both with the projector by itself, and compared side-by-side with two direct competitors in their own most accurate modes. Or to put it more broadly, I use test equipment to objectively measure every projector's light output, contrast ratio and color accuracy. I then subjectively compare them to other similar projectors side-by-side on a big screen. No manufacturer claims about performance are considered in our projector reviews.In addition, I personally pick the products and services I write about based on editorial merit. When you buy through the included links, CNET may get a commission. Read more: How CNET tests projectorsHow portable do you really need? Pretty much every projector is \"portable\" to some degree. Many of the projectors on our best projector list, for example, are small enough to fit in a backpack. They might fill that backpack, but that's their size. If you just want something for the occasional movie night, one of those would be significantly brighter and create a better image. Generally speaking, the smaller the projector, the dimmer it is.How much battery do you need? Most portable projectors have a battery that will last around 2 hours. Some, though not all, can extend that by connecting to a portable power bank. All battery-powered models can run, usually with greater brightness, when connected to a wall outlet.What resolution do you need? Most portable projectors are 1080p, or HD, resolution. Only higher-end models are 4K and there aren't that many. A few are 720p or less. Higher resolution means more visible detail, but also less chance of having the \"screen door effect\" where you can see individual pixels and it's like viewing the image through a screen door. However, resolution isn't everything, especially with portable projectors, since you're usually making a smaller image compared to bigger projectors. Light output, streaming ability, battery life and overall image quality are all more important than resolution.Is audio quality important? If you're hoping to entertain a group of people, you might want to consider a larger portable projector with bigger, higher-powered, built-in speakers. Most models also double as a Bluetooth speaker, which makes them even more useful.How much should you spend? With all portable projectors you're paying more for less, so to speak, compared to less portable \"full-size\" home projectors. As in, you're getting lower brightness and worse image quality but you're gaining the smaller size that in some cases can fit in a pocket. You're paying for that convenience, in other words. Show more The biggest difference is light output. Traditional, full-size projectors can get much brighter than any portable mini projector. Most portable projectors use an LED lamp, while full-size projectors have either UHP lamps (which are effectively high-powered light bulbs) or laser light sources. Projector light output is measured in lumens, and while the brightest portable projectors we've reviewed measure about 350 lumens, a traditional home theater projector measures 1,500 lumens or more. A bright projector can produce a larger image and look better when there's some ambient light around. For that reason, dimmer portable projectors are best enjoyed with smaller images and in as dark an environment as possible.Beyond brightness, mini projectors are much smaller (of course), can run on battery power and usually include built-in streaming and decent speakers. Traditional projectors have more lens adjustments, including focus, zoom and lens shift, and can run louder.  In the sense that you can take them with you places, yes, but some are more or less portable than others. Mini projectors range in size from absolutely tiny pico projectors like the AAXA P8 to models like the \"outdoor\" Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K, which does have a handle but is also expensive, heavy (10.7 pounds) and would require a big backpack to lug around. Many portable projectors have batteries, but some cheaper models do not. It depends. Many portable projectors have built-in batteries that can run for 2 or 3 hours before needing to be plugged in. Some can also attach to external USB battery packs that allow them to be run without plug-in power. On the other hand, many smaller portable projectors, especially cheaper ones, don't include a built-in battery or work with battery packs. They will need to be plugged in to work. Yes. Many mini projectors have built-in streaming that allows them to show Netflix and other streaming services when connected via Wi-Fi. For projectors that don't have built-in streaming, you'll need to connect another streaming device, like a Roku or Fire TV Stick, to the projector's HDMI input to stream Netflix and other services. Portable, or mini projectors, are much smaller than traditional \"full-size\" projectors. While the latter aren't necessarily big, they're something you'd carry with two hands. A portable projector is something you can typically hold in one hand. Keep in mind that not only are they physically smaller, but they also don't have the same performance. While most full-size projectors can easily create a 100-inch diagonal image that's bright and easy to watch, most portable projectors would struggle to do the same. They can create a TV-size image no problem, however. Yes, but perhaps not in exactly the same way. All the portable projectors we recommend can be easily moved from room to room, and most can fit in a backpack. Some are even small enough to fit in a pocket. While most of the smaller options also have a battery, some require power from an outlet or other external power source.While portable, no projector can compete with ambient light. No projector can be used in bright daylight, and many can't be used with room lights on. Even higher-lumen home models will struggle to create a watchable image if you have a few lamps on. So outdoor movie nights are probably OK as long as it's a dark area, but sunny backyard football game watch parties likely aren't possible without significant considerations to make the screen as shaded as possible.Sometimes. Several of our picks have built-in batteries that allow them to work away from an outlet. These typically last around 2 hours, but only in a lower-brightness mode. How much lower varies, but typically about 20% dimmer than when plugged in. A few of our picks are small, and therefore \"portable,\" but have to be plugged into an outlet or other power source to work. These non-battery models are noted as such in their write-ups above. Yes, in all cases, but some are easier than others. For instance, all of our picks have an HDMI input with an adjacent USB connection, so you can connect any streaming stick. Most of our picks have Google TV built in, so you have a normal streaming interface and access to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max and pretty much all other streaming services. However, a few of our picks either don't have streaming built in at all or include a version of Android and Netflix that works differently than you might be used to. We've noted this in the reviews.In all cases, you'll need an internet connection, either Wi-Fi or tethered to your phone's hotspot.While most manufacturers list the actual resolution of their projectors, some can be misleading. They'll list something like \"HD compatible\" or \"4K compatible.\" What this means is the projector can accept an HD or 4K signal, but the projector converts that to its native resolution, which is typically lower. It could potentially be as low as 480p, which will be very noticeable. It will look soft, with visible pixels. Always look for \"native resolution\" when comparing projectors. We only list native resolution in our reviews. What we updated: May 2025Added the TCL A1 and BenQ X300G as recommendations.",

It creates a reasonably bright, colorful, contrasty image, and the streaming interface works the same as those found in more expensive projectors and many TVs. Its onboard sound is better than you’d expect, too, being able to double as a decent Bluetooth speaker. If you want to connect a gaming console, there’s an HDMI input on the back. The battery is rated for 2.5 hours, though if you run it at max brightness, it becomes a lot less. If you’re not on the go, you can plug it in and use it like a regular projector. While traditional home projectors will outperform the Mars 3 Air in just about every way, they lack its battery and ultraportability.

There are certainly less expensive projectors out there, but nothing I\u0026#39;ve seen at this price or lower is worth recommending. The P8 is tiny, with roughly the same overall volume as the Anker Capsule Air (which does have a battery), although this projector is rectangular instead of cylindrical. The AAXA is significantly brighter than the Capsule, plus it has a few streaming apps built in and an HDMI port for connecting an external source.

As in, you\u0026#39;re getting lower brightness and worse image quality but you\u0026#39;re gaining the smaller size that in some cases can fit in a pocket. You\u0026#39;re paying for that convenience, in other words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-cy=\"infoCard_showMore\"\u003e\n        Show more\n      \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"shortcodeFaq\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"shortcodeFaq_answer\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest difference is light output. Traditional, full-size projectors can get much brighter than any portable mini projector. Most portable projectors use an LED lamp, while full-size projectors have either UHP lamps (which are effectively high-powered light bulbs) or laser light sources. Projector light output is measured in lumens, and while the brightest portable projectors we\u0026#39;ve reviewed measure about 350 lumens, a traditional home theater projector measures 1,500 lumens or more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA bright projector can produce a larger image and look better when there\u0026#39;s some ambient light around. For that reason, dimmer portable projectors are best enjoyed with smaller images and in as dark an environment as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond brightness, mini projectors are much smaller (of course), can run on battery power and usually include built-in streaming and decent speakers. Traditional projectors have more lens adjustments, including focus, zoom and lens shift, and can run louder. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the sense that you can take them with you places, yes, but some are more or less portable than others. Mini projectors range in size from absolutely tiny pico projectors like the AAXA P8 to models like the \u0026#34;outdoor\u0026#34; Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K, which does have a handle but is also expensive, heavy (10.7 pounds) and would require a big backpack to lug around. Many portable projectors have batteries, but some cheaper models do not.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt depends. Many portable projectors have built-in batteries that can run for 2 or 3 hours before needing to be plugged in. Some can also attach to external USB battery packs that allow them to be run without plug-in power. On the other hand, many smaller portable projectors, especially cheaper ones, don\u0026#39;t include a built-in battery or work with battery packs. They will need to be plugged in to work.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003cp\u003eYes. Many mini projectors have built-in streaming that allows them to show Netflix and other streaming services when connected via Wi-Fi. For projectors that don\u0026#39;t have built-in streaming, you\u0026#39;ll need to connect another \u003ca target=\"_self\" data-id=\"b38531d4-ec16-4c2a-b5a8-ccdfb25ef48d\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-streaming-device/\"\u003estreaming device\u003c/a\u003e, like a Roku or Fire TV Stick, to the projector\u0026#39;s HDMI input to stream Netflix and other services.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"cf3ae1c2-366c-4ac5-b479-35db9c2dc80a\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-cf3ae1c2-366c-4ac5-b479-35db9c2dc80a\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cp\u003ePortable, or mini projectors, are much smaller than traditional \u0026#34;full-size\u0026#34; projectors. While the latter aren\u0026#39;t necessarily big, they\u0026#39;re something you\u0026#39;d carry with two hands. A portable projector is something you can typically hold in one hand. Keep in mind that not only are they physically smaller, but they also don\u0026#39;t have the same performance. While most full-size projectors can easily create a 100-inch diagonal image that\u0026#39;s bright and easy to watch, most portable projectors would struggle to do the same. They can create a TV-size image no problem, however.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"e340e99b-bbfd-4bde-a373-2c0c906a010a\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-e340e99b-bbfd-4bde-a373-2c0c906a010a\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, but perhaps not in exactly the same way. All the portable projectors we recommend can be easily moved from room to room, and most can fit in a backpack. Some are even small enough to fit in a pocket. While most of the smaller options also have a battery, some require power from an outlet or other external power source.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile portable, no projector can compete with ambient light. No projector can be used in bright daylight, and many can\u0026#39;t be used with room lights on. Even higher-lumen home models will struggle to create a watchable image if you have a few lamps on. So outdoor movie \u003cem\u003enights\u003c/em\u003e are probably OK as long as it\u0026#39;s a dark area, but sunny backyard football game watch parties likely aren\u0026#39;t possible without significant considerations to make the screen as shaded as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"a3f18623-6993-4056-8134-5ab84ad2c156\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-a3f18623-6993-4056-8134-5ab84ad2c156\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes. Several of our picks have built-in batteries that allow them to work away from an outlet. These typically last around 2 hours, but only in a lower-brightness mode. How much lower varies, but typically about 20% dimmer than when plugged in. A few of our picks are small, and therefore \u0026#34;portable,\u0026#34; but have to be plugged into an outlet or other power source to work.

For instance, all of our picks have an HDMI input with an adjacent USB connection, so you can connect any \u003ca data-id=\"33e73216-bbb8-43cf-b643-28c39b067c81\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/best-streaming-device/\" target=\"_self\"\u003estreaming stick\u003c/a\u003e. Most of our picks have Google TV built in, so you have a normal streaming interface and access to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Max and pretty much all other streaming services. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, a few of our picks either don\u0026#39;t have streaming built in at all or include a version of Android and Netflix that works differently than you might be used to. We\u0026#39;ve noted this in the reviews.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn all cases, you\u0026#39;ll need an internet connection, either Wi-Fi or tethered to your phone\u0026#39;s hotspot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"b86c1722-41d9-423c-a80a-896f224061fa\" section=\"cap\" data-id=\"listicle-b86c1722-41d9-423c-a80a-896f224061fa\" data-cy=\"bestListListicle\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile most manufacturers list the actual resolution of their projectors, some can be misleading. They\u0026#39;ll list something like \u0026#34;HD compatible\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;4K compatible.\u0026#34; What this means is the projector can accept an HD or 4K signal, but the projector converts that to its native resolution, which is typically lower. It could potentially be as low as 480p, which will be very noticeable. It will look soft, with visible pixels. Always look for \u0026#34;native resolution\u0026#34; when comparing projectors. We only list native resolution in our reviews.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cblockquote data-ng-block=\"{\" id\":\"dqdukcr5mspkc44\",\"type\":\"blockquote\"}\"=\"\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we updated:\u003c/strong\u003e May 2025\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdded the TCL A1 and BenQ X300G as recommendations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
