  "text": "After a great event last month in San Jose, Ars is switching coasts for October and descending in force on our nation's capital. If you're on the East Coast and want to come hang out with Ars EIC Ken Fisher and me while we talk to some neat speakers and learn some stuff, then read on! Continuing our partnership with IBM, Ars presents \"AI in DC: Privacy, Compliance, and Making Infrastructure Smarter.\" Our tone this time around will be a little more policy-oriented than our San Jose event. We intend to have three panel discussions, with the overall topics looking like this: The key to compliance with emerging technologies Data security in the age of AI-assisted cyber-espionage The best infrastructure solution for your AI/ML strategy Specifically, here are our panels and the panelists we've confirmed: “The Key to Compliance with Emerging Technologies” Whether it was the move to the cloud in the 2010s or AI technology today, companies are continually focused on how to innovate with emerging technologies while remaining compliant with regulations that almost always lag far behind the state of the art. In this panel, we'll discuss the line companies must walk when bringing new things to market and how regulatory compliance doesn't have to be painful. Panelists so far: Anton Dam, VP Engineering for Data AI/ML, AuditBoard John Verdi, SVP, Policy, Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) James Comstock, Program Director, Offering Management, Hybrid Multi-Cloud Storage, IBM Moderator: Lee Hutchinson, Senior Technology Editor, Ars Technica “Data Security in the Age of AI-Assisted Cyber Espionage” Technology evolves, and threats evolve with it—typically faster than threat mitigation. For this discussion, we'll pull together a set of industry-recognized infosec experts brimming with ideas on how to help safeguard your infrastructure, your data, and your people from a gamut of attackers, ranging from script kiddies to nation-states.",
