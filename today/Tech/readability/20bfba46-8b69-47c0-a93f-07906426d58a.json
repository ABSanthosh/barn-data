  "text": "On Wednesday, NYC-based software developer Nick Spreen received a surprising alert on his iPhone 15 Pro, delivered through an early test version of Apple's upcoming Apple Intelligence text message summary feature. \"No longer in a relationship; wants belongings from the apartment,\" the AI-penned message reads, summing up the content of several separate breakup texts from his girlfriend—that arrived on his birthday, no less. Spreen shared a screenshot of the AI-generated message in a now-viral tweet on the X social network, writing, \"for anyone who’s wondered what an apple intelligence summary of a breakup text looks like.\" Spreen told Ars Technica that the screenshot does not show his ex-girlfriend's full real name, just a nickname.

Credit: X This summary feature of Apple Intelligence, announced by the iPhone maker in June, isn't expected to fully ship until an iOS 18.1 update in the fall. However, it has been available in a public beta test of iOS 18 since July, which is what Spreen is running on his iPhone. It works akin to something like a stripped-down ChatGPT, reading your incoming text messages and delivering its own simplified version of their content. On X, Spreen replied to skepticism over whether the message was real in a follow-up post. \"Yes this was real / yes it happened yesterday / yes it was my birthday,\" Spreen wrote. In response to a question about it being a fair summary of his girlfriend's messages, he wrote, \"it is.\" We reached out to Spreen directly via email and he delivered his own summary of his girlfriend's messages. \"It was something along the lines of i can’t believe you just did that, we’re done, i want my stuff. we had an argument in a bar and I got up and left, then she sent the text,\" he wrote. How did he feel about getting the news via AI summary? \"I do feel like it added a level of distance to it that wasn’t a bad thing,\" he told Ars Technica. \"Maybe a bit like a personal assistant who stays professional and has your back even in the most awful situations, but yeah, more than anything it felt unreal and dystopian.\"",
