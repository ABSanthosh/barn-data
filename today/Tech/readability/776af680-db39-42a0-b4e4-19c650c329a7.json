  "description": "Venmo has added the ability to schedule both payments and requests, which has been a long-desired feature. People can use this toolset to send out one-time payments or requests, or schedule things to go out monthly, weekly or bi-weekly. Users will receive a push notification reminder the day before a payment goes out, just in case the funds aren’t available. To that end, the platform will pull from the connected bank account if the Venmo account is dry. These tools are rolling out right now. Venmo This is an obvious boon to those with roommates, as that one roommate who somehow got roped into handling all of the utility bills can let Venmo do the heavy lifting of bothering everybody else. Venmo says that 84 percent of consumers use peer-to-peer payment services to handle stuff like rent, utilities and other living expenses. It’s also good for those with poor life organization skills. I can’t tell you the number of times I forgot to pay a bill, even though I had the money. Setting everything up in advance could be pretty darn helpful. This is just the latest quality of life feature added by Venmo. The company recently integrated tap-to-pay support for Android phones, with no card reader necessary. The payment platform also now lets users send one another crypto.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/venmo-adds-scheduled-payments-and-requests-151251367.html?src=rss",
