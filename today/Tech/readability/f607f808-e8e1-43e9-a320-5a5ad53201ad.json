  "text": "You'll want to check the tags if you purchased a mattress from Amazon within the past couple of years. According to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CSPC), around 100,000 Crayan mattresses are being recalled due to flammability risks as of June 18, 2025. Here’s how to check if you have one of these mattresses and how to receive a refund. What products are being recalled?The recall involves Crayan Mattresses’ 10-inch and 12-inch beds (twin, full, queen and king sizes), sold on Amazon from June 2022 through June 2024. These beds are single-sided with a white-knit quilted top and gray side panels. The brand name ‘Crayan’ is stitched into the front foot panel in white letters. Crayan Mattresses' retailer, Foshanshi Liyue Jiaju Youxian Gongsi, dba Crayan Inc., is based in China. Its mattresses are manufactured in Japan and delivered compressed in a box. The price range for these mattresses is between $100 and $220. Here are examples of the tag labels on the recalled Crayan Mattresses. US Consumer Product Safety CommissionWhy are they being recalled?All mattresses and mattress pads sold in the US must meet the open flame flammability requirements established by the CPSC, known as 16 CFR 1633. Crayan Mattresses violate federal safety standards by failing to meet these requirements, posing a potential risk of serious injury or death from fire hazards. However, no incidents or injuries have been reported.What should you do?The first step is to immediately stop sleeping on your recalled mattresses and contact Crayan Mattresses for a refund. According to the CPSC, you will need to “mark the mattresses permanently with the word 'Recalled’ in large font across the white top panel.” Submit your photo of the mattress to the company’s email at crayan_service@hotmail.com to confirm your purchase, after which you should receive a full refund.If you have questions about the recall, you can call Crayan at 779-605-4458 from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. PT Monday through Friday. If you're having trouble contacting the company or receiving your refund, you can fill out the Recall Complaint Form on the CPSC’s website.
