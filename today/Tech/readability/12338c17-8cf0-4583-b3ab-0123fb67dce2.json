NordVPN is still on a discount run, with 74% off its 2-year plans with 3 extra months. In 2025, you can get NordVPN for as low as $2.99/mo! But that’s not all – the VPN has filled both 2-year and 1-year plans with 3 free months, a bag of jaw-dropping features, and a few more Nord Security products bundled up in this all-around package. We’ll explain everything. See at NordVPN NordVPN January 2025 Deals Holidays aren’t over yet and NordVPN agrees with its meaty discounts. Its 2-year plans have all gone down by 74% and that’s great news because they offer some of the best features we’ve seen. Currently, you can get: Basic at $2.99/mo Plus at $3.89/mo Complete at $4.89/mo Prime at $7.89/mo © NordVPN These four plans contain NordVPN, with associated features like Meshnet, a Double VPN, kill switch, split tunneling, IP leak protection, etc. The Plus plan introduces Threat Protection Pro, which is amazing for blocking out trackers, malware, and ads. This one also has a Dark Web Monitor and NordPass. As you know, the latter is a password manager. We also love the complete plan, which offers all of the above but with an addition of NordLocker which we tested. With 1 TB of encrypted cloud storage, you can do plenty for your vital files. Finally, there’s Prime, which “drops” NordProtect on top. This service offers identity theft insurance, credit monitoring, and other features to keep data brokers, snoopers, and hackers away from you. NordVPN 1-Year Savings Are Here Too If 2-year plans are a bit of an overstretch, don’t fret. You can pick the same plans from above and not pay for 27 months upfront. Instead, you can pay for 15 months and spend less. Here are the prices: Basic at $4.59/mo Plus at $5.49/mo Complete at $6.49/mo Prime at $9.49/mo NordVPN comes with a nifty 30-day money-back guarantee for all plans. As a result, you can virtually pick any, as long as you have enough money, and fully test it for pretty much a month. If you’re unsatisfied, you can obtain a refund on the same day. Notable Features of This VPN Holidays were busy for NordVPN, as it managed to bring some serious improvements to the service while we were busy drinking and celebrating. In 2025, NordVPN offers a handful of amazing features, such as: Over 7,000 servers in 118+ countries Ad-blocking with malware protection Double VPN connections P2P-optimized servers No-logging policy 256-bit AES encryption Apps for all devices 10 concurrent connections, and more. These features pile up like crazy. If you want to know more, we’ll point you to our NordVPN review. One thing is certain – this is THE best deal you can get on NordVPN. Don’t let it slip through your hands. See at NordVPN Daily Newsletter",
