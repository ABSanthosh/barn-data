  "text": "This field guide and investment support AI’s potential in evidence-based mental health interventions and research Today, we’re announcing two new initiatives to explore how AI can support experts in providing better mental health treatment and help people receive much-needed care. Billions of people worldwide face untreated mental health conditions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. To help, we’re exploring AI-based solutions that can democratize access to quality, evidence-based support.The first initiative is a practical field guide for mental health organizations on how to use AI for scaling evidence-based mental health interventions, created in partnership with Grand Challenges Canada and McKinsey Health Institute. This guide offers foundational concepts, use cases and considerations for using AI responsibly in mental health treatment, including for enhancing clinician training, personalizing support, streamlining workflows and improving data collection.For the second initiative, Google for Health and Google DeepMind have partnered with Wellcome Trust, one of the largest charities in the world, on a multi-year investment in AI research for treating anxiety, depression and psychosis. The funding, which includes research grant funding from the Wellcome Trust, will support research projects to develop more precise, objective and personalized ways to measure nuances of these conditions, and explore new therapeutic interventions for them, potentially including novel medications.Together, these initiatives make up a two-pronged approach. By looking into AI’s potential for more immediate mental health support, along with developing better treatments for the future, we hope to help more people around the world find the care they need.",
