  "text": "Netflix doesn’t have the deepest horror library (unless true crime counts), but it has an unusually high number of movies available right now with direct links to current, recent, or much-anticipated releases. Expand your enjoyment of these busy stars, writers, and directors by streaming some of their past work too. Talk to Me Brothers Danny and Michael Philippou have Bring Her Back hitting theaters May 30, so there’s no better time to revisit Talk to Me, their breakout debut about a supremely ill-advised party game involving demonic possession. If you watch it tonight, you might be able to sleep through the night again before the unsettling-looking Bring Her Back refreshes your nightmare cache. Cam With Madeline Brewer back on Hulu starring in the final season of The Handmaid’s Tale, remind yourself of her range even beyond the capricious, danger-prone Janine with this quirky horror mystery. In Cam, Brewer plays a webcam model who’s startled to see herself, or someone who looks exactly like her, has hijacked her stream—and understandably becomes obsessed with finding out what’s happening. His House Did you catch Wunmi Mosaku’s stunning performance in Sinners and wonder what else she’s been up to besides sidekick roles in Marvel projects? If you have Max, you can see another stunning Mosaku performance in Lovecraft Country—but since this is a Netflix list, she’s also fantastic in 2020’s His House, playing a refugee from South Sudan who finds the horrors of her homeland have followed her and her husband to their new London home. I Know What You Did Last Summer You probably won’t have to be familiar with the finer points of 1997’s I Know What You Did Last Summer to enjoy the upcoming reboot, but it’s a fun slasher no matter the occasion. And it couldn’t be more of a 1990s time capsule, riding the coattails of Scream‘s slasher success and starring some of the era’s hottest stars, including Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr.—both of whom are returning for the new film (out July 18). Mr. Harrigan’s Phone With the not-horror The Life of Chuck arriving June 6 from director Mike Flanagan, open up your Stephen King field of vision with the 2022 yes-horror film adapted from the same book of stories: Mr. Harrigan’s Phone. Both Chuck and Phone come from If It Bleeds, a four-story collection that hit shelves in 2020. Now we just need someone to adapt the title story (which features recurring King character Holly Gibney, played by Cynthia Erivo in the late, great HBO series The Outsider) and “Rat,” a creature tale which sounds like the most classic King yarn of the bunch. Little Evil Adam Scott became a ubiquitous media obsession thanks to the recently concluded Severance season two, but in 2017 he starred in this supernatural comedy that riffs on The Omen. At the time, horror fans were like “Ooh, it’s from the director of Tucker \u0026 Dale vs. Evil,” which is still true—but Eli Craig, who gifted the world with that 2010 cult classic, has another movie dropping very soon: Clown in a Cornfield (it’s out May 9). If you’ve only watched Tucker \u0026 Dale, Little Evil (which also has a clown in it) is well worth a spin. Want more io9 news?
