  "description": "OpenAI is keeping up its rapid-fire pace of new AI releases. The company introduced the o3 and o4-mini models to its ChatGPT platform in April. At the time, the business promised that a pro model of the o3 was on the way, and that version became available today. Both the o3 and o4-mini models are meant to use and combine all the tools under ChatGPT's umbrella. When OpenAI adds the \"pro\" designation to a model, it's a version that has been built to spend longer answering queries to provide better and more accurate responses. \"We recommend using it for challenging questions where reliability matters more than speed, and waiting a few minutes is worth the tradeoff,\" the company said in the release notes for the o3-pro. In the testing assessments shared, the o3-pro delivered better benchmarks than the o3 and the o1-pro options. There are some restrictions on the other ChatGPT services the o3-pro can use. Image generation and Canvas are not supported, so users will need to turn to different models for those features. The o3-pro is available today for ChatGPT Pro and Team users, while Enterprise and Edu customers will have access to this option next week.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-adds-the-o3-pro-model-to-chatgpt-today-212126136.html?src=rss",
