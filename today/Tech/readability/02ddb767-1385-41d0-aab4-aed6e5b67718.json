  "text": "What is a 360 camera?A 360 camera is a device that uses two or more lenses and image sensors to record a 360-degree sphere around the camera. What can you do with 360 videos and photos?There are two main options for the content you can capture with 360 cameras. The first, and most common, is to edit the videos and photos into “flat” versions that can be posted to any social media platform. So, for example, you record a 360 video of you hiking, and later you edit that video into a 9:16 format for TikTok or Instagram that shows just the highlights of your hike. The video will be highly stabilized (no shaking), and can feature pans and zooms that are far smoother and more professional-looking than what’s possible with a traditional camera. Because the camera captures everything, you don’t need to worry about where the camera is pointed. The other option is to use the 360-degree content as 360-degree content. This is more limited in where you can post and share it. Facebook and YouTube are the biggest platforms that support 360 content. The photo spheres and spherical videos can be viewed on any phone, often by moving the phone around like a viewfinder “inside” the image. Or, they can be viewed using a virtual reality headset where you can “look around” like you’re there. Google’s Street View uses an advanced 360 camera mounted on a vehicle, but anyone can upload 360 photos to add to the coverage.Are 360 cameras difficult to use?In some ways 360 cameras are easier to use than traditional cameras. There’s no “aiming.” You don’t “point-and-shoot” so to speak. You hold the camera up and it records everything. That’s not to say there isn’t a learning curve to get the best results, but anyone can start taking 360 photos and videos immediately. Insta360 and Kandao offer tutorials in their apps to help you get the most from their cameras.Why is the video resolution so high? My TV is only 4KBecause the camera records everything, the additional resolution is vital for the result to look good. Look at it this way: Your TV offers 4K to reproduce a window-sized image. The 360 camera is recording that plus everything above and below the TV, and everything else around it, so it needs a lot more pixels. Typically, this recording is edited in the camera’s app into something that can be displayed on any phone or TV. The 16:9 portion of an 8K 360 video might be 4K, or it might be even less, depending on how you choose to edit the video.Is a 360 camera required for virtual tours?No. A 360 camera is an option for Matterport-style virtual tours for real estate. Because they’re able to capture everything around the camera, they’re typically faster than using a motorized mount for your phone.Is it easy to damage the lenses?Yes! I have destroyed several 360 cameras with small falls that wouldn’t have bothered a phone or action camera. Because of how they work, the lenses protrude from the body of the camera. So if it falls on a hard surface, there’s a good chance you’ll crack or scratch the lens, and then that will show up in all your photos and videos as a smudge or dark spot or worse, basically ruining everything you capture.Some models, like the Insta360 X4, offer removable lens protectors. These are well worth it if you want to protect your investment or you’re occasionally clumsy. Most come with soft cases, but it’s worth finding a hard shell case if you want to throw the camera in a backpack. When is the best time to buy a 360 camera?Like many products, cameras typically get discounted for Black Friday and Amazon Prime Days (even if you shop at other stores like Walmart and Best Buy). Usually, the cameras get cheaper later in their life too, so six to eight months after release, you’ll start to see deeper discounts. Insta360 also has a history of keeping its older cameras in its lineup at lower prices. For example, the X3 that’s our current budget pick was released in 2023 and is still a great camera at a lower price than when it first came out.What are the best 360 camera companies?The 360 camera market is very small. There are effectively three main companies: Insta360, Kandao and Ricoh. Ricoh essentially invented the category but has lagged behind Insta360 and Kandao in recent years. Kandao has made some interesting cameras in the last few years, but it wasn’t until the QooCam 3 Ultra recommended above that all the pieces fell into place. Insta360 is by far the category leader and has been for many years.Other companies have dabbled in the space, including Nikon, Kodak and action camera heavyweight GoPro with the Hero Max.What about 360 cameras with more lenses and sensors?The cameras we recommend are all consumer cameras. There are professional models with additional lenses and sensors that offer higher-resolution photos and videos. These are all significantly more expensive and beyond the scope of this guide.",
