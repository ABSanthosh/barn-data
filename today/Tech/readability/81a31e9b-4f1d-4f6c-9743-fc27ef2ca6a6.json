This year’s Native American Heritage Month Doodle, illustrated by Inuit Nunangat guest artist Natashia Allakariallak, celebrates the kayak.Google is committed to providing Indigenous communities with equal access to digital literacy and tech education opportunities. Today, to round out Native American Heritage Month, we're providing an update on this work, highlighting the impact of our investments and sharing details on recent grants that will further our commitment to Indigenous communities.This year, Google.org has donated more than $6 million to organizations working to expand educational opportunities, promote digital equity and foster economic development in Indigenous communities across the Americas. This includes $3 million to AISES — a nonprofit focused on increasing the representation of Indigenous peoples in STEM — to help establish an Indigenous Women in Tech program and strengthen cybersecurity education at tribal colleges and universities.This also includes $1 million to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) — the oldest, largest national organization representing tribal nations and native communities— to support AI awareness, training and skills development through workshops and other resources. This further includes $1 million each to Indigitize and IndigiGenius — two organizations that develop and deliver culturally relevant computer science education to Indigenous communities — to support their ongoing work in empowering Indigenous students and educators.This support also extends to organizations in other parts of the Americas that are deeply invested in this work. We've provided a $250,000 grant to the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation in Central America to launch the School of Leadership for Indigenous Women. This program will empower Indigenous women to develop their leadership skills and advocate for their communities. We’ve also granted $250,000 to the Right Relations Collaborative to address pressing issues identified by Canadian Indigenous communities. This includes supporting initiatives focused on food sovereignty, cultural preservation and educational opportunities for Indigenous youth.These investments build on our ongoing efforts to make a real difference in Indigenous communities. Since 2020, including the grants above, we’ve granted more than $35 million to Indigenous communities by supporting more than 28 nonprofit organizations. We’re committed to continuing this work and creating more opportunities for Indigenous people in the years to come.",
