  "text": "Wherever you access Prime, you can now access Apple TV+. Credit: Apple There was once a time when Apple TV simply meant the company's streaming hardware. Now, it either refers to that, or the company's streaming service, Apple TV+. Despite being an Apple product, Apple TV+ isn't just available on iPhones, iPads, and Mac. In fact, you can stream it through the Apple TV app, including the poorly-reviewed Apple TV Android app, or the Apple TV web app. Now, it's getting a little easier to watch Apple TV, at least if you're a Prime Video user. As it happens, Apple and Amazon have come to an agreement to host Apple TV+ as a Prime Video channel. That means you'll be able to subscribe to Apple TV+ directly through your Prime Video account, and stream it through the Prime app. That's how other \"channels\" work on Prime, such as Starz, MGM+, Max, and Paramount+. Interestingly, while Apple TV also has a similar channels feature, Prime Video is not currently available as an option. (You can stream Prime Video through Amazon's app on an Apple TV, however.)Apple's streaming service is coming to Prime Video later this month, and it will cost $9.99 per month, the service's standard costs for new subscriptions. Apple TV+ has amassed quite the library for itself, sporting notable titles like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Morning Show, and For All Mankind. It also owns a number of high-profile movies, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. However, it's still small potatoes compared to other streaming services that have had much longer to build a user base. Not to mention, Apple is relatively new to the entertainment business, compared to other networks like NBC (Peacock), HBO (Max), Netflix (Netflix). While Apple devices are hugely popular, and Apple does offer free trials for its services when purchasing a new Apple product, adding Apple TV+ to Prime Video opens up a larger potential customer base than before.It'll definitely make watching Apple TV+ easier for non-Apple users. While many smart brands have the Apple TV app, more have Prime Video. Anywhere you can watch Prime Video, you can watch Apple TV+—so long as you subscribe to it through Prime, of course.
