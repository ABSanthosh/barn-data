  "description": "Apple was handed a victory today by a jury in Delware, which ruled that two of Masimo's smartwatches and chargers \"willfully violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs,\" according to Reuters. The reward? $250 in damages. 9to5Mac reports: Apple previously accused Masimo of using litigation to boost the launch of its own smartwatch product. In October 2022, Apple filed two patent infringement lawsuits against Masimo. The first lawsuit accused Masimo of copying the Apple Watch design. The second said that Masimo's technical features infringed on Apple patents covering technology used in the Apple Watch. Reuters reports: \"Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that health monitoring tech company Masimo's smartwatches infringe two of its design patents. The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that Masimo's W1 and Freedom watches and chargers willfully violated Apple's patent rights in smartwatch designs, awarding the tech giant $250 in damages. Apple's attorneys told the court the 'ultimate purpose' of its lawsuit was to win an injunction against sales of Masimo's smartwatches after an infringement ruling.\" The jury, however, also determined that Masimo's smartwatches \"did not infringe on Apple patents covering smartwatch inventions that the tech giant had accused Masimo of copying.\" The two companies continue to battle it out over patent infringements regarding the Apple Watch's blood oxygen sensor.
