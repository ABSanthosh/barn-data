Affected devices were manufactured between April 10, 2023 to April 28, 2024.If your iPhone 14 Plus is affected — and you can enter your serial number on the program page to see if yours is — Apple says it or an Authorized Service Provider will service your phone for free. If you’ve already paid to have the camera repaired, Apple says to reach out to ask if you can get a refund. Eligible phones will be covered by this program for three years after they were originally sold.Apple occasionally launches these types of service programs to offer repairs for its products, like one to fix receivers on iPhone 12 or 12 Pro phones and one to fix AirPods Pro that made crackling or static sounds.",
