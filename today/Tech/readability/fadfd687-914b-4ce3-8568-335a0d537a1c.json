He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.An update to the Philips Hue app this week appears to have leaked a new Hue Secure video doorbell, reports Hueblog. The unannounced product shows up in a section offering instructions for adding devices that you have no QR code for.From the screenshots below, taken in the iOS Hue app by my colleague Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, the Hue Secure doorbell is a straightforward video doorbell — tall, rectangular, and with what looks like a large button inside of an LED circle. As of this writing, the app still shows it on my phone.I could only get so far in the instructions before hitting a wall, but there are details to glean. That includes that it might be a wired device, thanks to mentions of low-voltage errors and a need to “physically install” the camera before setup. It also uses both Bluetooth — for setup, at least — and Wi-Fi.Hueblog writes that the camera isn’t expected to launch until this fall, so it could be a while before pricing or camera specs are available. The best way to set your expectations is probably to look at Hue’s other Secure cameras, such as the floodlight and indoor / outdoor options launched in 2023. They each offer 1080p video, two-way talk, and end-to-end encryption of recordings, as well as smart alerts for people, pets, and vehicles. They also don’t support HomeKit Secure Video, and I wouldn’t expect that to change with this device.",
