  "text": "The studio behind the 'Dune' movies will partner up with the 'Hunger Games' studio before potentially buying it entirely. Studios have been threatening to acquire each other the past couple years, and now it seems to be Legendary Entertainment’s turn. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the studio behind recent hits like A Minecraft Movie and the Dune trilogy is potentially snatching up Lionsgate, best known for the John Wick and Hunger Games series. At the moment, the two companies are considering a team up on some films, and if things go well, that’ll blossom into a “more complete offer.” There weren’t any specific movies named that could help test the waters, but the two studios have several upcoming movies between them, including Dune: Part 3, and Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. This past May, Lionsgate itself separated in half—one business for the movies, the other for its Starz TV network, both hunting for acquisition deals. And in October 2024, Legendary CEO Josh Grode indicated mergers and acquisitions were in the cards for the studio after it bought out the stake from its then-parent company, Wanda Group. Neither Legendary or Lionsgate commented on the matter to press, and it doesn’t seem like they’re looking super far ahead in their partnership. No word on the potential affects on Lionsgate’s output going forward should Legendary acquire it, so we’ll learn more about it over time. Want more io9 news?
