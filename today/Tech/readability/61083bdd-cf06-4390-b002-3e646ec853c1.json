  "text": "Finding a budget-friendly laptop that doesn’t compromise on quality can be a challenge. Among the few good Chromebooks available on the market, the Asus CX1 is a rather stylish and affordable option that is perfect for everyday tasks. While it may look like an older generation MacBook, it is actually not. And it offers some good features at an astonishingly low price of $109 during this Black Friday sale, down from its original price of $209. See at Amazon Chrome OS The Asus Chromebook CX1 is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor which provides good performance for basic computing tasks such as web browsing, document editing and streaming videos. With its dual-core architecture and a base clock speed of 1.1 GHz that can boost up to 2.8 GHz, this processor is designed to handle everyday applications efficiently. Coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage, the CX1 ensures quick load times and smooth multitasking capabilities. While the storage capacity may seem limited compared to traditional laptops, Chromebooks are optimized for cloud storage and web-based applications, which is great for users who primarily work online. This CX1 model has a 14-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, and this screen delivers sharp images and bright colors. The laptop also boasts a lightweight design at just 3.24 pounds, making it portable and easy to carry around. Additionally, the Chromebook features a 180-degree lay-flat hinge that allows for flexible viewing angles for easier collaboration during group projects or presentations. The connectivity options are also promising: the CX1 comes equipped with two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C ports, two USB Type-A ports, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Battery life is crucial for any laptop user, and the ASUS Chromebook CX1 delivers with up to 12 hours of usage on a single charge which is cool. The device also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. See at Amazon",
