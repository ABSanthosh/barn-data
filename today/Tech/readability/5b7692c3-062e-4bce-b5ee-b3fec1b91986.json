  "text": "Overview Table of Contents Apple's iPads dominate the market. Even with the plethora of tablets from other retailers, iPads are still our favorite. With the 2024 release of the latest iPad Pro and iPad Air, it's clear that Apple is positioning its tablets as a laptop alternative.Sure, they're great for streaming or reading on the go, but at this point, you can do anything you'd do on your computer on an iPad. Whether you want to illustrate or edit videos, iPads will help you do it. Recent developments in the Pro and Air models are also setting them up to be gaming devices.But since there's not just one iPad to choose from, finding the right tablet isn't so straightforward. Mashable's reporters have hands-on testing experience with the best iPads, so you can figure out which one is for you.Which iPad model should I buy?Which iPad model is best for you purely depends on your needs. Do you want something that has enough storage and speed for streaming? Do you want to use it to read? Do you want it as your primary workstation? All of that should factor into your decision.The best iPad for most people is the iPad Air 2024. It has the latest tech and solid performance but is also in the middle of the range in both price and capability. You can find iPads that are even more advanced or some pared down. Read on for Mashable's list of the best iPads for 2024. Our Pick Read our full review of the iPad Air 2024.Who it's for:The iPad Air is for everyone. It will do the job if you want to use your tablet for streaming, reading, or creative projects. If you plan on using your tablet as a substitute for a laptop, it'll work for that, too. According to Mashable tech editor Kimberly Gedeon, the iPad Air loaded with the M2 chip \"delivers impressive performance and noteworthy battery life that will keep creatives, students, and on-the-go busy bees away from the imprisonment of charging cables and wall outlets.\"Despite being one of Apple's latest releases, it's an exceptional value, loaded with the M2 chip and starting at $599 for the 11-inch model, and $799 for the 13-inch model.Why we picked this:The iPad Air 2024, while no longer the lightest or thinnest, still stands as a testament to Apple's commitment to value. Equipped with the M2 chip, first introduced in the MacBook Air, it delivers the same processing power as a laptop. In our Geekbench 6 tests, it scored on par with the M2 MacBook Air, offering a high-performance experience at a fraction of the cost.It also has an impressive battery life: It ran over 13 hours in our tests, and it has crisp displays for brilliant graphics. In fact, while testing the most recent iPads, Gedeon noted that it was hard to tell the difference between the iPad Air and iPad Pro displays. While Apple is desperate to tout the iPad as a gaming device, we wouldn't say it's your best bet with only 8GB RAM. However, it has plenty of power to handle illustration and design work. Essentially, it gives you everything you'd want in a starter MacBook, but it costs you just $599 and has a touchscreen. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the Apple iPad Pro 2024.Who it's for:Professionals planning on using an iPad as their tablet and laptop should go for the iPad Pro. This 2024 release is loaded with Apple's fastest processing power. Graphic designers can store all of their creative work on the device, which has up to 2TB of storage. It's also a smart choice for video editors, as the 1TB and 2 TB models feature texturized nano-glass, which prevents glare while working in any environment — even full sun.For graphic designers, the Apple iPad Pro 2024 is a dream come true. It's the only iPad on the market that is fully compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, a tool that features a unique squeezable design and a barrel roll feature, enhancing precision and control in design work.Why we picked this:The 2024 iPad Pro is essentially an outstanding laptop. Loaded with Apple's latest M4 processing chip, it's the most advanced option from the brand. When running the Geekbench 6 tests, Gedeon did a double take at the results. It got a score of 14,586, making it more powerful than any MacBook we've ever tested, so if you're chasing powerful performance, this is it. And that performance doesn't drain the battery life, as this beast ran for over 16 hours in our tests. And startlingly, it does all of this in a razor-thin package. As Gedeon says it feels like \"cradling the whispers of technology.\"You can often find 1TB storage in computers, but 2TB is rare in a laptop and nearly unheard of with a tablet, so it can store large files without a problem. Plus, the 1TB and 2TB models come with nano-glass, a texturized glass front that prevents glare no matter what environment you're in. The Good The Bad Details Who it's for:If you prefer saving money over splurging on the latest tech, the Apple iPad (10th generation) is a fantastic choice. It's the base model of all the iPads, meaning it won't have the fastest processor or the latest features, but it is the most affordable. With the 2024 release of the iPad Air and Pro, this iPad's price dropped to $349 — a real steal for Apple technology.Even though its tech is basic compared to the advanced iPad Air and Pro, it's perfect for someone who wants a portable screen for streaming, playing games, and reading. It's also a nice choice if you're interested in using your tablet as a laptop but don't want to spend a ton of money. It's compatible with the Magic Keyboard Folio and together costs $598 — the same price as the iPad Air.Plus, it's especially great for kids, if you want to get them a tablet but don't want to spend a fortune on it.Why we picked this:The iPad (10th generation) doesn't possess the flair of the Pro or Air, but it is a testament that Apple's entry-level tablet is still stellar. It's currently the lowest-priced iPad, even defeating the Mini, making it the most affordable choice. PCMag, our sibling site, reviews the iPad 10th generation, stating that it's the best tablet at its price point.The new landscape camera layout makes video calls look better, and upgraded stereo speakers deliver better sound. It's loaded with the Apple A14 chip, which isn't as impressive as the M-series of chips but is still quick and powerful. It has a decent-sized screen at 10.9 inches, providing plenty of room for those who want to use it as a drawing pad or journal since it is compatible with the Apple USB-C and Apple Pencil 1st generation. The Good The Bad Details Read our full review of the iPad Mini.Who it's for:Tablets are an incredibly versatile device, but we all have our go-to use. If you, like me, use your iPad to read, you gotta go for the iPad Mini. The other iPad models start at 10.9 inches, which is a lot of screen when you just want to flip through your e-book. Speaking from experience, holding a 10.9-inch iPad feels more like holding up a magazine than a book, so at 8.3 inches, the iPad Mini is a more comfortable handle for readers. Plus, it has an anti-reflective coating to protect from glare.But the iPad Mini isn't just a glorified e-reader, it's still a versatile tablet. Like any iPad, you can read on the Kindle Apple, but you can also stream your favorite shows — a level of flexibility that a standard e-reader simply can't match. So when should you avoid the iPad Mini? If you're after a tablet that can double as a laptop, this won't be for you. Eight inches might be plenty of room for reading or watching, but it's going to feel tight when you want to flip between email and Slack. As Mashable's Stan Schroeder noted in his review, when up against his M1 MacBook Pro, the iPad Mini 7th generation didn't stand a chance. Plus, it's not compatible with Apple's Magic Keyboard, but you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard in a pinch.Why we picked this:The iPad Mini just got a 2024 upgrade. The iPad Mini is now equipped with the A17 chip but with the same 5-core GPU and 6-core CPU. Along with the chip upgrade comes Apple Intelligence, which is especially helpful if you plan to use it for reading as it can summarize articles. It's more advanced in some ways than the iPad 10th generation. But on the flip side, it's missing key features like a landscape view camera and Magic Keyboard compatibility. When we calculate all that, it's clear that the iPad Mini is a great tablet, while the rest of the iPads in Apple's line-ups are capable of being great tablets and laptops. Above all, I love the iPad Mini for reading. Previously, I read with my iPad 9th Generation, which works great but is just too big. When I'm in bed reading, my wrist feels strained with a standard-sized iPad. So when I switched to using the iPad Mini, I was delighted by its light weight; it weighs just over half a pound. At 8.3 inches it's about an inch and a half bigger than a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, but having used both, the hand feel is negligible. Plus, unlike the iPad 10th generation, it has an anti-reflective coating to help you read in any lighting. The iPad Mini, while great for reading, doesn't have the matte screen of other e-readers, which at night leads to some eye strain. If you want to give your iPad Mini the Kindle treatment, these Paperlike screen protectors add some nice friction to the screen so you feel like you're reading and writing on paper.The iPad Mini's smaller size also makes it a better option for traveling. It will take up less space and weight in your bag than any other iPad on this list. Despite being smaller than the iPad 10th generation, it costs more. So what are you paying for? Slightly more advanced tech, the convenience of portability, and a better reading experience. The Good The Bad Details Mashable staff has tested and reviewed all of the iPads on this list. We assessed each model for performance, usability, and special features.Performance: We looked at the specs of each product and how that measured up. Sure, the iPad Pro has the M4 chip, but does it outperform the iPad Air with the M2 chip? We assessed its speed and processing through hands-on testing and Geekbench tests.Displays: iPad displays are essential — they are a portable touchscreen. We watched videos to test displays and run creativity apps like ProCreate for accuracy and detail.Usability: Through daily use, we inspected the usability of these iPads. We assessed things like screen size, placement of front-facing cameras, and how useful special features were.Special features: With the release of the iPad Pro, we're assessing the special features available on these models, like the nano-texture glass, to see if it's just added flair or actually valuable. Frequently Asked Questions Our answer is slightly complicated because all the models on this list are the latest generations offered. The newest releases are the iPad Pro and iPad Air, released May 15, 2024. The 2024 iPad Pro features Apple's M4 chip, the most advanced processor among both iPads and MacBooks. Meanwhile, the iPad Air has the M2 chip, the same as the MacBook Air M2.The iPad Mini also got an upgrade in 2024. Now in its 7th generation, the newest iPad Mini comes with the A17 chip. That makes the base iPad model the oldest model, as it debuted in 2022. Any iPads on this list can be an illustration tool if you have an Apple pencil. If we were going to eliminate any of the options from this list, it would be the iPad Mini because it has the smallest surface area for designing.But in terms of the best, the iPad Pro is the best for those looking to draw. The 13-inch option provides a plentiful area to design, and it's the only iPad available with the Apple Pencil Pro that now features a squeezable grip and a barrel roll, both expanding creative possibilities. Yes, you can read on your iPad — no need for an additional e-reader. In fact, reading on your iPad makes traveling far more convenient. You can read and stream on one device rather than pack an e-reader that just lets you read.All iPads come pre-downloaded with Apple Books and Apple News to read books, magazines, and more. However, you can rely on something besides Apple's apps to read. If you're a Kindle convert or just want to use both, the Kindle app is available on iOS. And don't forget to support your local library and use Libby to gain access to endless audio and e-books.

Loaded with Apple\u0026#39;s latest M4 processing chip, it\u0026#39;s the most advanced option from the brand. When running the Geekbench 6 tests, Gedeon did a double take at the results. It got a score of 14,586, making it more powerful than any MacBook we\u0026#39;ve ever tested, so if you\u0026#39;re chasing powerful performance, this is it. And that performance doesn\u0026#39;t drain the battery life, as this beast ran for over 16 hours in our tests. And startlingly, it does all of this in a razor-thin package. As Gedeon says it feels like \u0026#34;cradling the whispers of technology.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can often find 1TB storage in computers, but 2TB is rare in a laptop and nearly unheard of with a tablet, so it can store large files without a problem.

The other iPad models start at 10.9 inches, which is a lot of screen when you just want to flip through your e-book. Speaking from experience, holding a 10.9-inch iPad feels more like holding up a magazine than a book, so at 8.3 inches, the iPad Mini is a more comfortable handle for readers.

Eight inches might be plenty of room for reading or watching, but it\u0026#39;s going to feel tight when you want to flip between email and Slack. As Mashable\u0026#39;s Stan Schroeder noted in his review, when up against his M1 MacBook Pro, the iPad Mini 7th generation didn\u0026#39;t stand a chance. Plus, it\u0026#39;s not compatible with Apple\u0026#39;s Magic Keyboard, but you can connect a \u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-wireless-keyboards\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"\u003eBluetooth keyboard\u003c/a\u003e in a pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy we picked this:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe iPad Mini just got a 2024 upgrade. The iPad Mini is now equipped with the A17 chip but with the same 5-core GPU and 6-core CPU. Along with the chip upgrade comes Apple Intelligence, which is especially helpful if you plan to use it for reading as it can summarize articles. It\u0026#39;s more advanced in some ways than the iPad 10th generation. But on the flip side, it\u0026#39;s missing key features like a landscape view camera and Magic Keyboard compatibility. When we calculate all that, it\u0026#39;s clear that the iPad Mini is a great tablet, while the rest of the iPads in Apple\u0026#39;s line-ups are capable of being great tablets \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e laptops. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove all, I love the iPad Mini for reading. Previously, I read with my iPad 9th Generation, which works great but is just too big. When I\u0026#39;m in bed reading, my wrist feels strained with a standard-sized iPad. So when I switched to using the iPad Mini, I was delighted by its light weight; it weighs just over half a pound. At 8.3 inches it\u0026#39;s about an inch and a half bigger than a \u003ca href=\"https://mashable.com/review/kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition\" target=\"_self\" data-ga-click=\"1\" data-ga-label=\"$text\" data-ga-item=\"text-link\" data-ga-module=\"content_body\"\u003eKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition\u003c/a\u003e, but having used both, the hand feel is negligible. Plus, unlike the iPad 10th generation, it has an anti-reflective coating to help you read in any lighting. The iPad Mini, while great for reading, doesn\u0026#39;t have the matte screen of other e-readers, which at night leads to some eye strain.
