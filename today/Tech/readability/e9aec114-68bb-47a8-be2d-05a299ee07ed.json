  "description": "A dating site launched last week by Belgian artist Dries Depoorter matches potential partners based on their internet browsing histories rather than curated profiles or photos. Browser Dating requires users to download a Chrome or Firefox extension that exports and uploads their recent search data, creating matches based on shared online behaviors and interests rather than traditional dating app metrics. Less than 1,000 users have signed up since the platform's launch, paying a one-time fee of $10.3 for unlimited matches or using a free tier limited to five connections. Depoorter, known for digital art projects exploring surveillance and technology, says the concept emerged from a 2016 workshop where participants shared a year of search history data. The platform processes browsing data locally using Google's Firebase tools. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
