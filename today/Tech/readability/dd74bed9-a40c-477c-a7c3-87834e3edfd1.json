Credit: Ben Kriemann/Getty Images for Samsung Samsung kicked off CES 2025 with a splashy media day before the shows open — pulling top-tier tech reporters into a private event to unveil its latest lineup of Bespoke AI smart appliances. Held at the glitzy Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, the showcase made one thing abundantly clear: Samsung wants AI to power everything in your home. Backed by the trio of Samsung Knox, Bixby, and SmartThings, the company has envisioned an AI experience designed to be user-friendly, energy-efficient, and, most importantly, focused on helping you take care of yourself. Think Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, but with an oven that can pinpoint exactly how hot your turkey is.For context, Samsung Knox is the company's mobile security platform; Bixby is Samsung's AI voice assistant, and Smart Things is the device hub that provides the interconnectivity between all the appliances. These are devices such as the SmartThings Hub, Motion Sensor, and Camera. Mashable Light Speed Credit: Chance Townsend / Mashable Samsung showcased a sprawling ecosystem of connected devices. From ovens and refrigerators to washer/dryer combos, vacuums, and even HVAC systems, the company’s lineup is designed to integrate seamlessly — at a cost. Even the PR rep we spoke to admitted they couldn’t afford the AI-powered utopia Samsung envisions for its customers. The most connected of the bunch is the new fridge, equipped with AI Vision technology and internal cameras that track everything going in and out. Integrated with Instacart’s product-matching system, it can recommend items to replenish and let you place an order with just a few taps. You can even browse your grocery list directly on the fridge’s touchscreen and arrange for same-day delivery, turning your kitchen into a high-tech command center. In addition to Bixby’s voice assistant enabling hands-free control, Samsung has offered a clear peek into its ambitious “screens everywhere” vision for the modern home, where every appliance is part of an interconnected, AI-driven ecosystem.Mashable is on the ground live at CES 2025!
