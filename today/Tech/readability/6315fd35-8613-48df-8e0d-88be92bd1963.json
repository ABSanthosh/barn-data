Credit: Silas Stein / picture alliance / Getty Images Apple's plans to add Google Gemini to Apple Intelligence are well underway, according to backend iOS code. 9To5Mac analyst Aaron Perris looked into the backend update for the iOS 18.4 beta and discovered mentions of \"Google\" alongside \"OpenAI\" and \"Third Party Model.\" This suggests Google's AI model Gemini might soon be another option for Apple users to choose from as an alternative to ChatGPT. Tweet may have been deleted This discovery is not unexpected. Following the keynote announcement of Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024, software exec Craig Federighi confirmed rumors of an Apple and Google partnership, saying, \"We’re looking forward to doing integrations with other models, including Google Gemini, for instance, in the future.\" Of course, this came after Apple had announced a partnership with OpenAI, bringing ChatGPT to Apple Intelligence as a third-party option to use with Siri and other AI features. However, Federighi made it clear that Apple wanted to allow users to choose from multiple models. At the time, Federighi didn't share any specifics on a timeline, but this leak shows us that the Google Gemini integration is coming soon. Mashable Light Speed As 9To5Mac noted, this doesn't mean Gemini will be part of the iOS 18.4 update, it definitely means Apple is actively working on it. The Apple Intelligence launch has been a bit of a mixed bag. Users were frustrated with the staggered (and delayed) rollout, underwhelmed by gimmicky features, and annoyed by AI-generated summaries that are sometimes inaccurate. Plus, users are still waiting for the alleged new and improved Siri which is slated for the upcoming iOS 18.4 release. By comparison, Samsung has been quicker and more aggressive in deploying AI features for its Galaxy series and already has Google Gemini integration. It's unclear how Apple will plan to integrate Gemini, but it would be a way to catch up to its competitors and cover some of its shortcomings in the voice assistant department. On that note, Apple is reportedly working on its own LLM for iOS 19 and macOS 16, which will likely be announced at this year's WWDC.
