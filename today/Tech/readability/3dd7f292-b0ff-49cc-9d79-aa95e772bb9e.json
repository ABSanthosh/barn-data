  "text": "The October Prime Days we’ve been waiting months for has already ended. These two days of deals took place earlier this week on October 8 and October 9. Now here we are on October 10, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Apple the event has ended. For the past two days, Amazon has had the Apple 2022 MacBook Air laptop with M2 chip priced at $749. This is a 25% discount from its normal price of $999 — amounting to a total savings of $250. However, if you go to the product page right now, you’ll see it is still listed at $749. That means it’s not too late so save a whole lot on a new MackBook Air for the holidays. See at Amazon Perfectly Portable This laptop is an excellent option for anyone who values portability above all. The 2022 model weighs in at only 2.7 pounds and is strikingly thin in its design. Despite its sleek size and shape, this laptop is just as capable as ever — having been built on the M2 chipset. This impossibly thin form factor still manages to get high performance out of it, somehow managing to fit an 8-core CPU along with the up to 10-core GPU and 24GB of memory. When compared to the MacBook Air with the M1 chipset, this comes in up to 1.4 times faster and a staggering 12 times faster than the Intel-based MacBook Air. Long stretches of work time are no issue at all thanks to this thing’s battery — it reaches up to 18 hours in a single charge. Do you spend a lot of time on work calls with Zoom? The front facing camera is capable of 1080p video and uses a three-mic array to makes sure when it picks up your audio, it comes through crisp and clear. The backlit keyboard features touch ID, making sign on simple and easy, while still being secure. Just use your fingerprint to quickly let the MacBook Air know it’s you trying to log in. It’s fast and easy to connect to other devices with the two thunderbolt ports along the side. The MagSafe port keeps the battery charger securely fit to the side of the laptop. And the headphone jack is perfect for folks like me who refuse to let go of our old headphones, preferring the wired connection. iPhone users have an easy time passing files, texts, and more easily between their MacBook Air and other Apple devices. The MacBook Air is available with either 256 GB of storage of 512 GB. The 256 GB model is 25% off right now at just $749 — a discount of $250. The 512 model is down 21% off at $949 which equates to a $250 discount. See at Amazon",
