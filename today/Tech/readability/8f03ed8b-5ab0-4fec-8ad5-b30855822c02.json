It also comes just days before the government’s international business summit on Monday, where Starmer will look to pitch the UK as “open for business.”  In September, Gustafsson left her long-standing position at Darktrace just before US equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired the company in a £4.2bn deal concluded earlier this month.  The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Before Darktrace, Gustafsson worked at Lynch’s software firm Autonomy before its highly controversial $11.7bn sale to HP. The 42-year-old was awarded an OBE for services to cyber security in 2019. “I have first hand experience of building and scaling a business here in the UK,” she said. “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share with the international investment community what I already know to be true; the UK is a great place to do business.” While political adviser and consultant Benjamin Wegg-Prosser was first choice for the role, Gustafsson’s business acumen is good fit for the position, past occupants of which have tended to be investors or business leaders. These include former ex-Barclays deputy chairman Gerry Grimstone and former Financial Times Group CEO Rona Fairhead. Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.
