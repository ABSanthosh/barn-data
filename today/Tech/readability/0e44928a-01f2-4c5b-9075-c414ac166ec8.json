Perhaps it’s time to cool down and chill out with a safe and secure VPN. This year’s line-up is an amazing one, with discounts reaching up to 83%. The best Black Friday VPN deals aren’t only pocket-friendly. We’re discussing some of the top VPN services around, with exquisite performance, ironclad security, impenetrable privacy, and streaming prowess. Let’s see what’s on the table. Best Black Friday VPN Deals Rundown Already jumping in excitement? Here are the absolute best VPN deals you can get for this year’s Black Friday: NordVPN: $2.99/mo + 3 free months for the 2-year plan (74% off) ExpressVPN: $4.99/mo + 6 free months for the 2-ear plan (61% off) PIA VPN: $2.03/mo + 4 free months for the 2-year plan (83% off) Proton VPN: $2.99/mo for the 2-year plan (70% off) CyberGhost: $2.03/mo + 4 free months for the 2-year plan (83% off) Best Black Friday VPN Deals 2024: A Detailed Comparison Not sure which one to pick? Don’t turn this amazing Black Friday into Friday the 13th. Read our detailed comparison and we’ll review all of the features of each provider. 1. NordVPN NordVPN is the best overall VPN for Black Friday; not the cheapest but one of the most amazing. This VPN is now 74% and its 2-year plans are combined with 3 free months. The price of $2.99/mo is for its Basic plan. Enough for most. However, if you want more features, such as Threat Protection Pro and NordPass, the Plus plan is a phenomenal value. At 74% off and $3.89/mo, this Black Friday VPN discount tops our list expressly. NordVPN packs a punch, or let’s say, a kick of a buffalo. © NordVPN You’ll get 256-bit encryption, over 6,500 servers, Double VPN, P2P optimization, and streaming abilities. NordVPN’s Black Friday offer includes apps for all devices, and the Plus plan brings ad-blocking and tracker-protection abilities. Don’t think NordVPN’s trickery is over. The provider’s Black Friday hype extends to its 1-year plans as well, all boosted by 3 extra months. We’re looking at 60%+ discounts and a total of 8 plans to check for extra money-saving. NordVPN means business. Instead of $12.99/mo, you pay only $2.99, save 74%, and enjoy 27 months of top-tier VPN privacy. See at NordVPN 2. ExpressVPN ExpressVPN blasts the doors to greatness and positions itself highly on the list of the top Black Friday VPN offers. Its shiny new 2-year deal is slashed by 61% and now costs only $4.99/mo. EpxressVPN is the cheapest it’s ever been! Best of all; the plan is amped up by 6 free months. ExpressVPN’s 1-year plan is also a good option for savings. With 3 free months and $6.25/mo, savings are imminent. The flagship status of ExpressVPN stems from its many features. © ExpressVPN The VPN is one of the fastest, with over 105 countries on the list. Users get access to its apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. On top of that, there are 8 simultaneous connections. ExpressVPN’s security is unbreakable. Thus, there’s a kill switch and IP leak protection to keep your activities private. With Advanced Protection, you can even block ads, while Parental Control prevents access to porn sites. Useful for those with children in the household. ExpressVPN’s no-log policy is almost unbeatable, making it an ideal Black Friday candy for revolutionizing your online experience. See at ExpressVPN 3. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access is an affordable VPN but now even more so. The Black Friday frenzy has nearly killed the price entirely, making it almost free. With 83% off, PIA is the highest discount here, at the price of $2.03/mo. The 2-year plan is accompanied by 4 free months for good measure. This translates to merely $75 for the first 28 months; such a delicacy. Private Internet Access offers unlimited connections for ultimate device protection. © Private Internet Access An even sweeter addition is Multi-hop which will encrypt your connection twice. The VPN is famous for its WireGuard protocol that speeds everything up. This makes PIA ideal for streaming, torrenting, and gaming without ping. The Private Internet Access Black Friday deal includes uncapped bandwidth and over 30,000 servers. You’ll also enjoy Shadowsocks for overcoming censorship and full support for all desktop and mobile systems. Rest assured, the VPN has all you need to make this Black Friday magical. See at PIA VPN 4. Proton VPN Three quids are enough to get you a record-breaking VPN deal for Black Friday. Proton VPN is now 70% off. It broke its own record by costing only $2.99/mo for the 24-month plan. The 12-month VPN Plus plan is 50% off at $4.99/mo. As you can see Proton VPN’s generosity was overhauled. You can now enjoy its Secure Core servers and VPN Accelerator at a fraction of the price. Speaking of fractions, not a single fraction of your data is stored by this secure VPN. © Proton VPN Proton VPN’s revolutionary RAM-only servers in 112 countries are safer than Alcatraz. Encryption also does a wonderful job. Packed with WireGuard and DNS leak prevention, you’ll be in good hands as soon as you connect. Proton VPN isn’t only your privacy junkie. It fares well in streaming, torrenting, dark web protection, and ease of use. 10 simultaneous connections are there and you can even test its 100% free plan. Proton has other security products. One is Proton Pass, which you can now try at 80% off and just $1/mo. See at Proton VPN 5. CyberGhost Become a ghostie at only $2.03/mo and ride the wave of privacy for 28 months. CyberGhost’s 2-year deal with 4 free months is now 83% off. A unique addition is a 45-day money-back guarantee, whereas, others offer 30. This VPN isn’t the best overall. At the price, however, it’s a solid contender. CyberGhost is fast, streaming-ready, and useful for torrenting. Another aspect is the size, as the VPN spans 100+ counties and offers 12,000+ servers. © CyberGhost CyberGhost includes NoSpy servers, WireGuard, a kill switch, and an ad-blocker. Its Black Friday VPN deal isn’t only for the VPN. Optional but crucial add-ons such as antivirus and dedicated IPs have been slashed by 78% and 50%. You can now get virus protection at only $1/mo or a dedicated IP at $2.50; or both! Despite being so affordable, CyberGhost doesn’t exclude Perfect Forward Secrecy, Private DNS, RAM-based servers, and other modern technologies. It’s the cheapest Black Friday VPN deal along with PIA; both are 83% off. See at CyberGhost Are Black Friday VPN Deals Worth It? The audacity to ask this… Of course, they are! This is the best time to save on a VPN and not worry about overpaying stuff. If you think these deals are a waste of time, let this period pass and go back. Seeing something different? Perhaps lower discounts? That’s because you’ve missed the train ride. This is a perfect opportunity to get a long-term VPN and protect your privacy for the years to come. Besides, the lowest you’ll pay is a speck above two monthly dollars. At this price, you’re practically getting the VPN for free. Are Black Friday VPN Discounts Live? They’re not only live but in full swing. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, Proton VPN, and CyberGhost are already knees-deep in this frenzy. The Black Friday hype continues into Cyber Monday, where you can still take advantage of great deals. It’s time to take your budget seriously and stop wasting money. These VPNs let you do just that — but only for a limited time. We have many Fridays ahead of us, but none as ‘black’ as November’s.",
