One early test case was the survival thriller Fall, which was directed by Scott Mann ‚Äî the co-founder of Flawless. AI editing arrives in Tinseltown Mann applied the software to clean up the movie‚Äôs dialogue. The first cut featured dozens of f-bombs, which were pushing Fall towards an R rating that would have severely restricted the audience. Those curse words had to go. To replace them, Flawless first converted the actors‚Äô faces into 3D models. Next, neural networks then analysed and reconstructed the performances. Facial expressions and lip movements were then synchronised with the new dialogue. The experiment was a success. Fall secured a PH-13 rating and became a sleeper hit, grossing a reported $21mn against a budget of just $3mn. A sequel is now shooting in Thailand. The results convinced Mann to bring the tech to market, which led to today‚Äôs commercial launch of DeepEditor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already altering where people are shooting,‚Äù Mann told TNW last month. ‚ÄúAnd as it extends out, I think it‚Äôs going to completely transform how we make movies.‚Äù Flawless has also integrated protections for creators.
