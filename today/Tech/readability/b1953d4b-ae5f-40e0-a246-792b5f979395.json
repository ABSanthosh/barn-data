And for the first time, the newest rendition of the vehicle that will carry Pope Francis to his public appearances is all-electric and emissions-free. Representatives for Mercedes-Benz presented the pontiff with the keys on Wednesday at the Vatican, though the pope himself will be riding, not driving himself, around in the EV.\"With this Popemobile, we are also sending out a clear call for electromobility and decarbonization,\" said Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius.This vehicle, based on the new electric G-Class Mercedes-Benz, is a one-off, made specifically for the needs of the pope, who must travel slowly and be seen by admirers. It's been delivered in time for the 2025 Jubilee, which takes place every 25 years. The Jubilee Year begins on Dec. 26 and runs through Jan. 6, 2026, and is expected to attract millions. A representative of Mercedes-Benz presents Pope Francis with the keys to the new, all-electric Popemobile. Mercedes-BenzThe electric drivetrain of the new Popemobile was adapted for slow journeys, Mercedes-Benz said in a press release. Its bench seat was replaced by a centrally positioned and height-adjustable single seat, which swivels so the pope can address audiences from different angles. The papal seat is heated and features a grab bar so the pope can stand to address crowds. Two single seats were added in behind the main seat for passengers.Read more: CNET Cars: Find What Moves YouThe roof was removed at the car's B-pillar, and, a separate hardtop offers protection from the elements.

It reads, \"In 2002, John Paul II requested that the media stop referring to the car as the 'popemobile,' saying that the term was 'undignified.'\" The joke is that the Wikipedia article immediately goes on to ignore that request.
