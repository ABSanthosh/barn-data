Our own Allison Johnson just published her full review ahead of the phone’s launch on July 25th, and while there’s certainly no denying it’s a spendy device, know that various carriers and retailers are offering a host of preorder incentives, many of which will expire at launch.Although the Z Fold 7 isn’t miles ahead of last-gen Z Fold 6 in terms of performance, it measures just 8.9mm thick when folded, making it look and feel like something of a next-gen foldable. The outer screen has also increased in size from 6.3 inches to 6.5 inches, which, when taken into account alongside its thickness, makes the Z Fold 7 feel more akin to a normal phone when folded. Alas, if only it had a “normal phone” price tag instead of an exuberant starting price of $1,999.That being said, it’s still possible to save on a preorder purchase, or at the very least receive some credit you can then spend on accessories like the Galaxy Watch 8. Whether you plan to shop directly through Samsung, your carrier, or a traditional retailer, here are the biggest promotions along with the key details you’ll want to keep in mind.You can get up to $1,100 in trade-in creditThe current trade-in savings are big enough to chop the Z Fold 7’s $1,999.99 price tag in half. Ahead of its release on July 25th, Samsung is offering up to $1,000 in credit for the last-gen Z Fold 6 and S25 Ultra — or less, if you’re trading in an older phone. Samsung will give you an instant discount based on the estimated value of your trade-in, which lowers the out-of-pocket cost to $999.99. That’s great, and thankfully, you can get instant trade-in credit even if you’re activating the phone on Verizon or AT\u0026T through Samsung’s site. But that’s not how trade-in credit works if you’re buying directly through carriers.Carriers across the board are currently offering a $1,100 trade-in credit toward the Z Fold 7, which will be paid back in the form of monthly installments. AT\u0026T will provide $1,100 in credits over 36 months to customers on postpaid unlimited plans who purchase the new phone with an installment plan. As for the phones that AT\u0026T is currently accepting, they include any Galaxy S, Note, and S-series phone, regardless of its age or condition.Verizon is also offering up to $1,100 in monthly credits over 36 months with an eligible trade-in in “any condition,” although the carrier doesn’t list or even mention any eligible phones. You must also be on an Unlimited Ultimate plan to get that much credit.T-Mobile is offering up to $1,100 in monthly credits for those auto-paying for a plan that costs $85 or more per month — no trade-in required.Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeSamsung is offering a lot of bonus credit, with a small catchIf you’re preordering directly through Samsung, you will receive a $50 Samsung credit to use on accessories as an extra perk. Those who aren’t trading in a device will get an extra $300 to spend, totaling $350. However, the credit is “use it or lose it,” so to speak; you’ll forfeit it all if you don’t use it at checkout. So, if you do go this route, you’ll want to pick up a pair of earbuds, a case, a Galaxy Watch 8, etc etc.Keep in mind that the aforementioned credit is exclusive to Samsung’s online storefront and isn’t available when purchasing the Galaxy Z Fold 7 through a carrier, Best Buy, Amazon, or any other retailer.Not all carriers are offering a free storage upgrade right nowSome retailers, but not all, are offering the 512GB Z Fold 7 for no extra charge through July 24th. This includes Samsung, T-Mobile, Best Buy, and Amazon, the latter of which is also throwing in a $300 Amazon gift card with each purchase. However, AT\u0026T and Verizon aren’t, at least through their respective sites. They each are offering the 256GB model at the same $1,999 price that you can get the 512GB model for elsewhere. That said, activating the Z Fold 7 via Best Buy will allow you to purchase the 512GB variant for $1,899.99 as a one-time payment (or as a $55.55-a-month payment for 36 months).Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.",
