Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Amazon If you're looking for a DIY home security system for your one- or two-bedroom home or apartment, you’ll want to check out this eight-piece Ring Alarm kit. It’s currently on sale for $149.99—40% off the regular $329.99 price tag, which according to price-tracking tools, is the lowest price this kit has ever hit. That said, this deal is exclusive to Amazon Prime members, so you’ll need to be subscribed to take advantage of the deal. This Alarm kit comes with a base station, a motion detector, a keypad, four contact sensors, and a range extender, giving you everything you need to get started with home security. To get it up and running, you only need to download the Ring app, plug in the base station, put the sensors where they’re needed, and activate it using the app. It gives you three pre-set security modes to choose from: home mode (which keeps the exterior sensors active while disabling the indoor ones), away mode (which arms everything), and disarm mode (where all sensors are off). (This PCMag eview notes that you won’t get any notifications or alerts when your system is in disarm mode.)If you’re comfortable handling the monitoring and alerts on your own, you can skip the $20 monthly fee and take the DIY approach. But if you’d prefer the added peace of mind that comes with 24/7 professional monitoring and automatic dispatch of authorities when required, you’ll need to subscribe to the Ring Protect Pro plan. This subscription also unlocks smart home integration with devices like Amazon Echo and Alexa, along with compatibility with other Ring products.For those looking for a home security system with broader third-party compatibility or integration with Apple HomeKit or Google Assistant, the Abode Iota is a good alternative, though it comes with a higher price tag of $329.99.
