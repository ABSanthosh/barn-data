  "text": "Good news for fans of the Dan Da Dan anime: it’s coming to Toonami. The hit shonen romcom will air the dubbed version of its first season on Saturday, July 26 at 12:30 AM ET, just after Dragon Ball Daima. That’s good news for those who missed that season last year or want to further support the show, which is just a handful of episodes into season two. At time of writing, there’s no word on whether Toonami will also air season one’s subbed version; it’s currently airing the Lazarus sub and previously done the same for the Rick \u0026 Morty anime and Uzumaki. LINEUP UPDATE: Via the official #Toonami Facebook page #DanDaDan will be coming to the block July 26th at 12:30am!https://t.co/65aMh6QE7m pic.twitter.com/NPlLA4Rhky — Toonami Squad (@ToonamiSquad) July 11, 2025 In addition to that, Shonen Jump has made chapters 33-40 of the Dan Da Dan manga free for a limited time, which make up half of the “Cursed House” arc adapted for the early episodes of season two. If you want to read in sync with the show, chapters 33 and 34 are equivalent to episode 12 of the anime, and the recently aired episode 14 equals chapters 38-40, and chapter 41. A short freebie run, but it helps anime fans get on board with the source material. For everyone else, Dan Da Dan’s second season will keep airing new episodes (subbed and dubbed) Thursdays on Netflix and Crunchyroll through mid-September. Want more io9 news?
