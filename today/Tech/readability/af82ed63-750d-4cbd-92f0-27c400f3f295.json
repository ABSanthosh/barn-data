If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. The clever Chefman Everything Maker can make breakfast sandwiches, grilled cheese, pizza, pancakes and more.

Too often, all-in-one kitchen appliances end up doing a lot of things poorly instead of doing one thing well. And, because some models have a lot of components, they can be a nightmare to clean. But the Chefman Everything Maker quickly won me over. The nonstick cooking surfaces heat up quickly and cleanup takes minimal effort (a serious win in my book). I've made crispy hash browns, gooey grilled cheese, breakfast sandwiches and perfectly golden pancakes -- all in one compact machine. And it's not just a breakfast tool. I've used it for late-night quesadillas and quick lunches more times than I can count in the past few weeks.  The design is intuitive, easy to store upright (although I rarely put it away) and surprisingly durable. No extra bells and whistles here. It's just a well-made, easy-to-use appliance that works every time. Right now, you can get a sweet 20% discount on the Everything Maker. The normal list price of $60 on the Chefman website already feels like a good deal for what this appliance can accomplish --which is, well, everything. But right now on Amazon, you can get it in the Midnight color for just $48, which is a steal. The Concrete-hued version is also on sale for a few bucks more. How I use my Everything Maker Macy Meyer/CNETThe Chefman Everything Maker lives up to its name by offering a versatile, all-in-one cooking solution that fits easily on a countertop. With a 12-inch nonstick cooking surface and a slim, compact design, it's well-suited for small kitchens or anyone looking to simplify meal prep. I've found it particularly convenient for cooking breakfast foods like eggs and pancakes with the lid open, then switching to grilled sandwiches or quesadillas with the lid closed.  It also heats quickly and evenly, reaching up to 428 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius), which is enough for searing, sautéing or even light grilling. I made a summer flatbread (with burrata, pesto and prosciutto) over the weekend and used the Everything Maker to lightly sear some peaches to add as a topping. They came out perfectly.  Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. Cleanup is another strong point. The nonstick surface wipes down easily after use -- no scrubbing or soaking required -- which has made it a reliable go-to for quick weekday meals.  The Everything Maker also comes with a digital cookbook featuring 16 chef-crafted recipes, which I've used as inspiration for trying new dishes beyond my usual routine. While it doesn't replace every kitchen tool, the Everything Maker handles a surprising variety of tasks in a compact footprint. My buying advice Whether you're shopping for a gift or just want to level up your own cuisine game, the Chefman Everything Maker is a surprisingly versatile little appliance. Even at full price, it offers solid value and delivers big on convenience, but for just $48, you really can't beat the value. While the Everything Maker isn't on sale on the Chefman website currently, it's still worth checking Chefman's website from time to time. They run promotions regularly (in fact, my favorite blender is almost 20% off right now). If you're looking for other useful, fun gifts for your favorite hostess or the chef in your life, here are our favorite kitchen gifts under $50.",
