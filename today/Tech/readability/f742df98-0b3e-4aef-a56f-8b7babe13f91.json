  "text": "Without YouTube Premium, you’re doomed to watch ads every few minutes, sometimes more often. If you’re exhausted by head-spinning ads, consider purchasing a YouTube Premium subscription. Sensible, right? Well, not for everyone. YouTube Premium’s recent price increases made it unaffordable for many. People online have found a simpler way to block YouTube ads. You wouldn’t believe it, but these two VPNs make YouTube ads vanish in seconds! Ditch YouTube Ads With These VPNs NordVPN and Surfshark are renowned for their reliability. They provide exceptional privacy, streaming prowess, and compatibility with all devices. While both VPNs include ad blockers, they’ve become ineffective in blocking YouTube ads. Well, that’s what most people thought. Namely, when you use NordVPN or Surfshark and connect to a server in Albania, YouTube ads suddenly disappear. Having tested the trick, we realised it’s true. You may be wondering how this works. Avoid YouTube Ads With NordVPN As many people there have reported, YouTube doesn’t display ads in Albania. Simultaneously, NordVPN and Surfshark work like all other VPNs. They allow you to connect to a remote server and use its IP address. Given these VPNs’ strong presence in Albania, connecting to an associated server is a breeze. With the Albanian IP address, users can overcome YouTube ads and enjoy an experience similar to what YouTube Premium provides. Things like adding videos to the queue and playing videos with the screen off aren’t there. At least, you won’t notice any ads, allowing for uninterrupted entertainment on all devices. Other Reasons to Use a VPN While YouTube is a big part of our lives, splurging on a VPN gives you much more. Watching YouTube without ads is just a speck in the universe of possibilities. One of them is very popular, and it’s bypassing geo-blocks. NordVPN and Surfshark are particularly effective at streaming and unblocking many websites. They offer over 100 locations globally, with modern 10 Gbps servers and fast protocols to enable industry-leading speeds. Many people latch onto torrenting as a perk. Both VPNs are equipped with optimised servers for P2P. In addition, they provide MultiHop (Double VPN) capabilities for double the encryption and more security and privacy. All-around VPNs like these are fantastic for gaming, and you can even enable them on public WiFi networks for added protection. If you’re an avid traveller, more privacy and ad-free YouTube enjoyment sounds exciting. No bandwidth limits mean endless possibilities, but more importantly, you don’t need wealth to get them. NordVPN and Surfshark cost pennies these days, so you don’t have to ditch your summer vacation for their subscriptions. Try Surfshark risk-free today Daily Newsletter",
