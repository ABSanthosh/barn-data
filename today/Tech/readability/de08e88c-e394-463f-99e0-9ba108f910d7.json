Explore other styles: From my first day on the Google Home PR team three years ago, I’ve been excited to introduce as much smart home technology into my home as possible. I dabbled while living in my New York City apartment, but since my husband and I bought our first home this year, I’ve been able to dive head first into the world of Google Home.Now, the holidays are upon us, and my Google Home is primed to create holiday magic. But, let's be honest, amidst all the joy and merriment, the holidays can also be a bit chaotic, especially if you love to host.Between decorating, shopping, cooking and entertaining, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That's where my devices, automations and routines come in. Google Home has become my secret for navigating the holiday season with ease and keeping the festive spirit alive. Here are eight ways I use my Google Nest devices and the Google Home ecosystem to create my own winter wonderland for the holidays. Embracing the holiday spirit1. Jingle all the way with festive musicI start by filling my home with Christmas cheer every morning as a part of my wake up routine. So at 6:30 a.m., when my morning routine begins, my instrumental holiday playlist gently plays on my Nest Mini in my bedroom and my Nest Audio in my living room.2. Twinkle, twinkle, automated lightsBeing that this is the first year in our home, I went all out with the holiday decor, especially the holiday lights. I was sure to use compatible smart outlets so I can control them directly in the Google Home app. Now, instead of spending time going around to each individual room to turn them on or off, I can simply tap which lights I want on and off in the app, saving both me (and my husband) time at the end of night.3. Put memory lane on displayMy guests love checking out the Nest Hub Max in our kitchen that doubles as a digital photo frame. I love showing a rotating slideshow of my favorite photos from years past. It's a wonderful way to reminisce and add a personal touch to my holiday decor. Getting comfy and cozy4. Make things warm and toastyWith Google Home, I can adjust myNest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) across multiple surfaces, including my Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Pixel Tablet, Pixel Watch and even the home panel on Google TV. It’s the perfect helper while hosting, too, as it automatically adjusts to keep the room comfy for everyone.5. Let it (virtually) snowAs a Midwest native now living in the South, I often miss snow during this time of year. One of my favorite features of the new Google TV Streamer are the Ambient screensavers. Now, thanks to Google AI, I can describe the exact snowy scene I want to display and use it as the screensaver on my TV.6. Go for a holiday movie marathonNothing says cozy quite like a movie night. As soon as December hits, I commit to watching one Christmas movie or episode a day. Thankfully, Google TV and the Google TV Streamer make it easy. It uses Google AI to make finding what to watch easier with personalized recommendations from across my subscription services and helpful AI-generated overviews of popular movies and shows. Becoming the ultimate holiday hostess7. Pull off a perfectly-timed mealTiming is everything when you're cooking a holiday feast. \"Hey Google, set a timer for 20 minutes\" is my constant refrain in the kitchen. With hands-free timers and reminders, I can focus on curating the vibe and crafting culinary masterpieces without worrying about burning the roast.8. Make a festive entranceMy nieces and nephews always get a kick out of my doorbell chimes when they come over during the holidays. From December through January, our Nest Doorbell (wired) has just as much holiday spirit as we do thanks to the seasonal doorbell chimes. From setting the mood to simplifying my to-do list, these devices are a game-changer. And if you need more inspiration, here are even more ways Google products can make your holiday season easier to navigate and more special than ever.",
