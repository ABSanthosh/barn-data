  "description": "60-year-old Chinese virologist Shi Zhengli led the Wuhan Institute of Virology's group studying bat coronaviruses (prompting Science magazine to call her \"Bat Woman\"). In June of 2020 Scientific American described Zhengli as \"distressed because stories from the Internet and major media have repeated a tenuous suggestion that SARS-CoV-2 accidentally leaked from her lab — despite the fact that its genetic sequence does not match any her lab had previously studied.\" More than four years later, Nature writes Friday that Zhengli \"reported that none of the viruses stored in her freezers are the most recent ancestors of the virus SARS-CoV-2,\" presenting data at a conference in Japan \"on dozens of new coronaviruses collected from bats in southern China.\" Shi has consistently said that SARS-CoV-2 was never seen or studied in her lab. But some commentators have continued to ask whether one of the many bat coronaviruses her team collected in southern China over decades was closely related to it. Shi promised to sequence the genomes of the coronaviruses and release the data. The latest analysis, which has not been peer reviewed, includes data from the whole genomes of 56 new betacoronaviruses, the broad group to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, as well as some partial sequences. All the viruses were collected between 2004 and 2021. \"We didn't find any new sequences which are more closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,\" said Shi, in a pre-recorded presentation at the conference... The results support her assertion that the WIV lab did not have any bat-derived sequences from viruses that were more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than were any already described in scientific papers, says Jonathan Pekar, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK. \"This just validates what she was saying: that she did not have anything extremely closely related, as we've seen in the years since,\" he says. \"Earlier this year, Shi moved from the WIV to the Guangzhou Laboratory, a newly established national research institute for infectious diseases.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
