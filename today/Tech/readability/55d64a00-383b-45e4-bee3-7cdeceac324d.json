  "description": "Microsoft temporarily rolled back its Bing Image Creator upgrade from OpenAI's DALL-E 3 PR16 to the previous PR13 version after users reported degraded image quality, including cartoonish and \"lifeless\" results. TechCrunch reports: Ahead of the holidays, Microsoft said it was upgrading the AI model behind Bing Image Creator, the AI-powered image editing tool built into the company's Bing search engine. Microsoft promised that the new model -- the latest version of OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model, code-named PR16 -- would allow users to create images \"twice as fast as before\" with \"higher quality.\" But it didn't deliver. Complaints quickly flooded X and Reddit. \"The DALL-E we used to love is gone forever,\" said one Redditor. \"I'm using ChatGPT now because Bing has become useless for me,\" wrote another. The blowback was such that Microsoft said it'll restore the previous model to Bing Image Creator until it can address the issues. \"We've been able to [reproduce] some of the issues reported, and plan to revert to [DALL-E 3] PR13 until we can fix them,\" Jordi Ribas, head of search at Microsoft, said in a post on X Tuesday evening. \"The deployment process is very slow unfortunately. It started over a week ago and will take 2-3 more weeks to get to 100%.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
