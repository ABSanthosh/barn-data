  "text": "Samsung has officially launched its latest smartphone series, the Galaxy S25 Series, with pre-orders now available on its official website. The new lineup includes the Galaxy S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, all of them offering technology and innovative (AI) features. This pre-order period runs until January 31st (next Friday) and gives you a great opportunity if you’re looking for the most premium Android phone at a fraction of its price. See Galaxy S25 Series at Samsung.com More Storage Samsung has eliminated the 128GB option across its S25 lineup, acknowledging the growing demand for ample storage. What’s more, Samsung offers double the storage for the pre-order period, and this pricing strategy extends to the entire S25 range. It means that you can buy the 512GB version at the 256GB pricing, or the 1TB model at the 512GB cost. Samsung sweetens the pre-order deals further with instant credit ranging from $50 to $150, depending on your chosen model. This bonus can be applied to an array of accessories, many of which are already discounted. Galaxy S25 Ultra or S25+ buyers can get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for free, while substantial discounts of 50% to 80% are available on Galaxy Watches. Interestingly, you can have the biggest instant credit if you choose the Galaxy S25+ ($150), not the Galaxy S25 Ultra ($130). See Galaxy S25 at Samsung.com See Galaxy S25+ at Samsung.com See Galaxy S25 Ultra at Samsung.com Trade-In for Tremendous Savings The trade-in program for the Galaxy S25 series is particularly generous this year: Galaxy S25 Ultra buyers can save up to a staggering $900 by trading in their old device. Even those eyeing the base S25 model can benefit from up to $500 in trade-in value, with the S25+ offering up to $700. This program gives a great opportunity to experience Samsung’s latest AI features powered by most powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It’s not all. Every purchase through Samsung’s official channels earns 1.5% back in Samsung Rewards points. While this may seem modest, these points accumulate over time and can be redeemed across Samsung’s extensive product range. When all these offers/discounts/trade-ins are combined, the value proposition becomes compelling. Consider the Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB: starting at $1299 (already discounted from $1419), you can potentially save up to $900 through trade-in, receive $150 in instant credit, and earn 1.5% cashback on your purchase. This means you can get a Galaxy S25 Ultra for less than $400, meaning you save over $1000 when pre-ordering.
