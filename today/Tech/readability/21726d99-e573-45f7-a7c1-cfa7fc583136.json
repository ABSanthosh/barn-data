  "description": "Google Gboard for Android is introducing circle or pill-shaped keys for some beta testers today. \"Instead of the key borders being rounded rectangles, Gboard is switching to circles and pills for letters, while the space bar and other keys are now pill-shaped,\" reports 9to5Google. \"While there should be no functional change to touch targets, these new shapes really shift the look of Gboard for Android.\" From the report: On paper, it's a bit more modern (and rounded) compared to what came before. However, it's a bit cramped if you have \"Long press for symbols\" enabled, which goes from the top-right corner to being directly above the letter. The physical analog Gboard is moving away from is how most keys on laptops and desktops are square. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
