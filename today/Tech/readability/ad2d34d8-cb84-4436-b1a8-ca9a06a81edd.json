BLAZE is deployable on the battlefield in less than a minute. It comes in a small briefcase which doubles as a launchpad and charging dock.  Powered by computer vision, BLAZE has been trained to spot the difference between different aircraft types and distinguish them from other objects, such as birds. It combines this system with traditional radar to track aerial targets with high precision.    Once it locks onto an enemy unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), BLAZE takes off from the ground and zips off to intercept it. Equipped with a warhead, it smashes into the target, blowing up itself and the enemy drone too. It can also self-detonate once it gets close to its adversary.   While this may seem wasteful, each unit costs at least 10 times less than the drone threats it is designed to intercept, Origin told TNW, without revealing the exact price tag. While BLAZE is autonomous, Origin says operators retain oversight until the final moment. The device also has a “wave-off” function, which allows the drone to return safely or self-destruct if needed. This aims to reduce the chances of friendly fire.  As drones reshape modern warfare, Origin pitches BLAZE as a cheap solution to counter them, filling the gap between gun-based air defence and pricey missile interceptors.  “The need for a system like BLAZE is immediate — it’s driven by real-world operational demands that are unfolding right now,” Agris Kipurs, CEO and co-founder of Origin Robotics, told TNW. He added that the company plans to “enable NATO armies across Europe.”  One of its potential customers is the military in Ukraine, where small UAVs equipped with explosives have quickly become the weapon of choice in the fight against Russia. Origin’s flagship drone, BEAK, is already deployed in active combat in Ukraine.  But Ukraine also faces its own onslaught of Russian drones, which has left it scrambling for lower-cost ways to counter these mass-produced aerial threats.  In January 2025 alone, Russia launched over 2,500 drones into Ukrainian territory.  “We designed BLAZE specifically to address this threat — a fast, intelligent, and cost-effective addition to existing air defence systems,” Kipurs said.  “In asymmetric warfare, drones are relatively inexpensive and widely deployed to overwhelm air defences and strike targets both at the frontline and deep behind it, making it challenging and costly to counter,” he added. Ukraine has increasingly relied on first-person view (FPV) interceptor drones to counter Russian UAV attacks. These piloted FPVs are basically consumer-grade drones with an explosive attached.   “While creative, this approach is extremely challenging and not scalable,” Kipurs said. Using FPVs as interceptors, he continued, “requires an exceptionally skilled pilot with extensive training and flight time — skills that are rare, even among experienced operators.” Kipurs co-founded Origin in 2022 alongside Ilja Nevdahs. The company has raised over $9mn to date. It also recently secured an R\u0026D contract from the Latvian Ministry of Defence and a grant from the European Defence Fund. Defence tech is a key theme of the Assembly, the invite-only policy track of TNW Conference. The event takes place in Amsterdam on June 19 — a week before the NATO Summit arrives in the city.
