CredentialsNamed a Tech Media Trailblazer by the Consumer Technology Association in 2019, a winner of SPJ NorCal's Excellence in Journalism Awards in 2022 and has three times been a finalist in the LA Press Club's National Arts \u0026 Entertainment Journalism Awards. Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Fold seems to be joining forces with the top-of-the-line Galaxy Ultra. The company on Tuesday shared a rather cryptic post teasing its next book-stye foldable, noting that it's bringing \"an Ultra-experience\" to \"a smaller and more portable form factor.\" The phone is scheduled to launch this summer, Samsung says, and will include a \"powerful camera\" and \"AI-powered tools.\"Samsung didn't share much more than that and hasn't noted anything else about what's in store for the successors to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6. But the post does confirm that we can expect foldables in the summer.This teaser raises many questions. Namely, just how powerful will the camera be on this new phone? Will it, like the skinny S25 Edge, match the 200-megapixel main camera on the S25 Ultra? And will the new foldable's cover display also match the size of the S25 Ultra?Samsung appears to be on a \"pushing the limits of engineering\" kick, what with the recent launch of the super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge, and now this mystery Ultra foldable. We'll see what other details unfold with time. Watch this: Galaxy S25 Edge Review: This Skinny Phone Left a Big Impression 06:24",
