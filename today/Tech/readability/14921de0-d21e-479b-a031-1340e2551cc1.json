  "text": "The Spider-Man actor joins Matt Damon in the latest mystery film from the Oppenheimer director. Spider-Man actor Tom Holland was just cast in the next film by Oscar-winning filmmaker Christopher Nolan and while no one is exactly sure what that movie is about yet, we just heard a super exciting, juicy rumor about it. Since Universal announced it was reteaming with Nolan, fans everywhere have been speculating about the nature of the film. One rumor is that it’s a horror movie. Another is that it’s a helicopter action movie like 1983’s Blue Thunder. And the Hollywood Reporter story about Holland’s casting writes that “the setting is not present day (although it’s unclear whether it’s set in the past or the future).” Well, we heard two of those could potentially be true. io9 got word from a reliable source that Nolan’s film is a vampire movie set in the 1920s. We know what you’re thinking: “Isn’t Ryan Coogler already making that movie?” Yes, he is. It’s called Sinners and it’s out in March. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for two visionary filmmakers to tackle the same topic, especially when the releases are so far apart. Don’t forget, not only was Nolan one of many directors to tackle Batman, he did a magic movie—The Prestige—around the same time as a rival studio was doing a magic movie, The Illusionist. He’s not beholden to what other people are doing. Plus, it’s not like period horror movies are all over the nation’s multiplexes these days or ever. There’s plenty of room for two or maybe even more of these. io9 reached out to Universal for confirmation or denial of the rumor and didn’t hear back as of publication. We’ll update the post if or when we do. So is Nolan’s latest a period vampire movie? Probably, but we can’t say for sure. What we can say for sure is it’s Nolan’s first movie since winning Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for Oppenheimer. It stars Matt Damon and, now, Tom Holland—who’ll reportedly shoot the film alongside Spider-Man 4 and Avengers: Doomsday. We also know it’s being released by Universal, in IMAX, on July 17, 2026. Let’s be honest though. We all want this rumor to be true, right? We want to see Matt Damon and Tom Holland in long, flowing coats ripping out people’s throats in 70mm IMAX with your seat shaking from the huge Hans Zimmer score. That sounds like the perfect night at the movies. Let’s cross our fingers… but don’t show the vampires. Want more io9 news?
