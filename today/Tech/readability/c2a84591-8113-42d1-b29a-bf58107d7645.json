The best Android phones have years of software and security updates, great cameras, a powerful processor and a battery life that lasts a day or more. Samsung's Galaxy S25 makes the cut as does Google's Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro XL. CNET editors have tested and reviewed every phone on this list, so you should have no trouble finding one that suits your needs. While tariffs and a general uncertainty around the economy have caused people to consider upgrading their phone, companies like Samsung and Google have not raised the prices on their current offerings.

The Best Android Phones of 2025: Tested by Our Experts What's the best Android phone? Best Android phones of 2025 Best Android phone Best Android Phone Value Best phone for Android purists Best premium Android phone Best S25 Ultra alternative Best Google phone Best built flip phone Best small Android phone Best for productivity Best Android phones compared Recent updates Factors to consider when buying an Android phone How we test phones Other phones we tested Android phone FAQ What to look forward to in 2025 What's the best Android phone?The $800 Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life is amazing. That's not the only reason it's our pick for best Android phone. It gets seven years of major Android updates, and the cameras are good (there's even a 3x telephoto lens for zooming). Then there are all the AI features: Most are just OK, but Circle to Search is outstanding. Samsung tries to set the Galaxy S25 apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as embracing the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And we're definitely impressed. There are plenty of other excellent choices, with the Pixel 8A being another current favorite.Best Android phones of 2025 Pros Camera consistently delivers good images Impressive battery life that last a day or more More AI features that actually feel practical Cons Several gimmicky AI tools Not many changes over the S24 The Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra – but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM – making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty. And while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.Why we like itHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.Who it's best forIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.Who shouldn’t get itYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24. Pros The screen is delightfully bright Cameras are good for $499 Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful Solid build The under-$500 price Cons Battery life is just OK, will get through a day Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity) Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting For $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.But don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.Why we like itThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.Who's it best for?In theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.Who shouldn't get itAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras. Pros Beautiful design that feels durable Fun and somewhat useful AI features New ultrawide camera takes good photos 7 years of software updates for longevity Cons More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8 There’s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google’s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.The Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren’t must-haves, and they’re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.Why we like itThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.Who it's best forIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.Who shouldn't get itIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro. Get it now Buy a Google Pixel 9, get $100 store credit Pros Best screen on any phone Versatile cameras Most powerful phone I've tested Good battery life Cons $1,300 price Design is almost too minimal AI features are hit-or-miss S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.If you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.Why we like itThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.Who it's best forIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.Who shouldn’t get itThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit. Pros Lightning fast charging Nice big screen 7 years of OS and security upgrades Great performance with games, movies and animations Cons Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25 Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price Rival phones at the same price have better cameras If the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity – without upgrading all the way to the Ultra – the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.That said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.Why we like itWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.Who it's best forIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.Who shouldn’t get itIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses Pros Genuinely fun new AI skills Sleek new design Seven years of software updates Cameras can take great daytime shots Cons Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription The Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.The phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.Why we like itGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.Who it's best forIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.Who shouldn't get itIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999. Pros Robust design Bright high resolution inner screen Battery life should last you a day or more It's so damn fun to use Cons Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur Only three years of major OS updates Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently The Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed. Read our Motorola Razr Ultra review.But in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.Why we like itThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.Who's it best forSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.Who shouldn't get itIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger. Pros Matte finish New main camera take good photos 7 years of OS updates Auto zoom for photos Cons $1,100 starting price is high Cover screen is a step down in quality from the internal one Adding apps to cover screen is wonky For better or worse, Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6 foldable is packed with AI. It can take a rough sketch and turn it into artwork or help me have a conversation in French or Korean despite me only knowing a few words of either language. The new autofocus/auto zoom feature lets you prop the phone in a half-open position, the Z Flip 6 will automatically zoom in or out (switching between the main and ultrawide cameras) to get a photo that best suits the moment. But the AI features are the least impressive aspects of the the Z Flip 6.Samsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, a smaller hinge and crease, a larger battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. But all this comes at a higher starting price: $1,099 which makes it hard to appreciate the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for the absolute great phone that it is. Read our full review for the Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 6.Why we like itSamsung's latest clamshell style foldable has a new 50-megapixel main camera, finally putting it on par with non-folding flagship phone cameras. The hinge is smaller and helps reduce the size of the crease on the internal screen. It has a new chip, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and 12GB of RAM for flagship performance. There's even a larger battery. For all intents and purposes, the new Z Flip 6 is a Galaxy S24 that can fold in half – which is fantastic.Who it's best forIf you already have a Samsung phone and have been itching to try a flip phone, then then the Galaxy Z Flip 6 brings the software and features you're used to in a cutting-edge design that is equally nostalgic and seemingly futuristic.Who shouldn’t get itIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you. Pros Larger and more symmetrical front screen Improved design with less noticeable crease Inner screen is best on any foldable phone I've used Better ultrawide camera than previous Fold 5 7 years of software upgrades Cons $100 more expensive than the Z Fold 5 Mediocre charging speeds and battery life that mostly gets through a day New software features don't add more benefit to the foldable design With the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung is getting closer to its goal of making a device that doubles as a phone and a tablet without compromising too much in either direction. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 has an improved design with a sleeker look that’s easier to grip, a less noticeable crease, a new processor and an upgraded ultrawide camera.But it’s really the Galaxy Z Fold 6’s big, bright and crisp internal screen that makes it the best choice for those who want a foldable phone for entertainment. However, be prepared to spend a pretty penny: The Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at an eye-watering $1,900, making it $100 more expensive than last year’s Z Fold 5 was at launch. Read our Sasmung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in-depth review.Why we like itWith the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Samsung finally achieved its goal of making a foldable that can truly replicate the experience of a traditional phone while doubling as a sleek tablet. Roughly five years after the original Galaxy Fold's launch, Samsung's book-shaped device has gotten lighter, slimmer, more durable and natural to use as a phone; a seemingly mundane but necessary improvement.Who's it best forIf you can get past the sticker shock, there's a lot to love about the Galaxy Z Fold 6. I just don't know how many people are willing to fork over $1,900 to experience it. Carriers and retailers still offer some discounts that knock down that high price, but those deals usually come with conditions like trading in an eligible device or opening a new line of service.Who shouldn’t get itSamsung also hasn't provided the two biggest things I'm looking for in tablet-style foldable phones: more affordable prices and innovative software that makes better use of their dual screens.Best Android phones compared ProductSamsung Galaxy S25Samsung Galaxy S25 PlusSamsung Galaxy S25 UltraGoogle Pixel 9Google Pixel 9 ProGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XLMoto G Power 5G (2024)Motorola Razr Plus (2024)Samsung Galaxy Flip 6Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60-120 Hz variable refresh rate6.3-inch LTPO OLED; 2,856x1,280 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate6.8-inch LTPO OLED; 2,992x1,344 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate6.7-inch LCD; 2,400 x 1,080 pixels, 60-120Hz refresh rate4-inch pOLED; 1,272 x 1,080 pixels; 1-165Hz variable refresh rate; 6.9-inch pOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels, 1-165Hz variable refresh rate3.4-inch AMOLED; 720 x 748 pixels; 60Hz refresh rate; 6.7-inch AMOLED; 2,640 x 1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz refresh rate6.3-inch AMOLED; 2,376x968 pixels; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate; 7.6-inch AMOLED; 2,160x1,856 pixels;1-120Hz variable refresh ratePixel density 416 ppi509 ppi501 ppi422 ppi495 ppi486 ppi391 ppiCover: 417 ppi; Internal: 413 ppiCover: 306 ppi; Internal: 425 ppiCover: 410 ppi; Internal: 374 ppiDimensions (inches) 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in.6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in.6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in.6x2.8x0.3 inches6x2.8x0.3 inches6.4x3x0.3 inches6.6 x 3 x 0.3 in.Open: 6.75 x 2.91 x 0.28 in Closed: 3.47 x 2.91 x 0.6 inOpen: 6.5 x 2.83 x 0.27 in Closed: 3.35 x 2.83 x 0.59 inOpen: 6.04x5.21 x0.22 in; Closed: 6.04x2.68x0.48 inDimensions (millimeters) 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm152.8x72x8.5 mm152.8x72x8.5 mm162.8x76.6x8.5 mm167.2 x 76.4 x 8.5mmOpen: 171.42 x 74 x 7.09mm Closed: 88.09 x 74 x 15.32mmOpen: 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9mm Closed: 85.1 x 71.9 x 14.9mmOpen: 153.5x132.5x5.6mm; Closed: 153.5x68.1x12.1mmWeight (grams, ounces) 162g (5.71 oz.)190g (6.70 oz.)218g (7.69 oz.)198g (7 oz.)199g (7 oz.)221g (7.8 oz)201g (7.09 oz.)189g (6.67 oz)187g (6.6 oz)239g (8.43 oz)Mobile software Android 15Android 15Android 15Android 14Android 14Android 14Android 14Android 14Android 14Android 14Camera 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto)50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto)200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto)50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide)50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto)50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide), 48-megapixel (5x telephoto)50-megapixel (wide), 8-megapixel (ultrawide)50-megapixel (wide) 50-megapixel (2x telephoto)50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide)50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto)Front-facing camera 12-megapixel12-megapixel12-megapixel10.5-megapixel42-megapixel42-megapixel16-megapixel32-megapixel10-megapixel4-megapixel (inner screen under-display); 10-megapixel (cover screen)Video capture 8K8K8K4K4K4K1,080p4KTBD8KProcessor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for GalaxyGoogle Tensor G4Google Tensor G4Google Tensor G4Mediatek Dimensity 7020Snapdragon 8S Gen 3Snapdragon 8 Gen 3Snapdragon 8 Gen 3RAM + storage 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB16GB + 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB8GB RAM + 128GB12GB + 256GB12GB + 256GB, 512GB12GB + 256GB, 512GB, 1TBExpandable storage NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneUp to 1TBNoneNoneNoneBattery 4,000 mAh4,900 mAh5,000 mAh4,700 mAh4,700 mAh5,060 mAh5,000 mAh4,000 mAh4,000 mAh4,400 mAhFingerprint sensor Under displayUnder displayUnder displayUnder displayUnder displayUnder displaySideSideSideSideConnector USB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CUSB-CHeadphone jack NoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneYesNoneNoneNoneUS starting price $800 (128GB)$1,000 (256GB)$1,300 (256GB)$799 (128GB)$999 (128GB)$1,099 (128GB)$300 (128GB)$1,000 (256GB)$1,100 (256GB)$1,900 (256GB) In May 2025, we added the Google Pixel 9A and the Motorola Razr Ultra to our list. The Pixel 9A replaces last year's Google Pixel 8A and come with a new processor, new design, updated screen and cameras–all for the same $499 price. The Razr Ultra is the best build foldable flip phone that we've tested. The battery life gets you through a day with charge left to start a second day. The main camera is solid and the displays are brighter. The biggest downside is the $1,300 price.Look at last year's phones: Companies typically keep previous models around at a discounted price. For example, while you can buy the $699 Pixel 8 or $999 Pixel 8 Pro for less than the current Pixel 9 equivalents.Get more for less with cheap phones: For a fraction of the cost, you can get a solid phone that does almost everything a pricier flagship phone can do. The Google Pixel 8A packs a good camera and is frequently discounted to under $400.Check your Android type: Some phones, like Google's Pixel series, run a stock version of Android. Others, like Samsung's Galaxy phones, have their own software (OneUI) on top of Android. Each type has its own appeal and drawbacks. If you've been rocking a Samsung phone for years, you'll likely still be more at home on a new Galaxy phone.Be ready for Cyber Monday sales: The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones.Test your phone: It's definitely worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it.Find peace of mind with a case: You spent all this time choosing a phone, now protect it from damage with a case. We test every aspect of a new phone from the battery and processor to the cameras. John Kim/CNETWe test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.PhotographyPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes such as the 4K 120fps slow motion mode that debuted on the iPhone 16 Pro or the Add Me photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.Battery lifeBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 largely has the same camera hardware as the Z Flip 4. But the new chip brings some image processing improvements. Lisa Eadicicco/CNETPerformanceWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo. Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNETWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.Read more: How We Test Phones The Galaxy S24 FE does a decent job taking photos, but the more expensive Galaxy S24 uses its more powerful processor to enhance them. Numi Prasarn/CNETSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments our reviewer, Mike Sorrentino, felt like he was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line. Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE.The OnePlus 13 is the first true flagship phone of 2025 and there's plenty to like. From its powerful performance to its fast charging and vibrant display, it has much of what we expect from a top-end phone right now. It looks good too, has great waterproofing, a scattering of new AI skills and a reasonable six years of security support. But while accomplished in some respects, the OnePlus 13 feels more like a \"pretty good\" 2024 phone, rather than kicking off a new year of tech with any kind of fanfare.
