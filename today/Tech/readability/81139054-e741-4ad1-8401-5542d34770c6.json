  "text": "We close the curtains on great savings this year as Prime Day comes to a close. Or at the very least, Amazon is closing its curtains. Yep, Amazon doesn’t own a patent on big savings. That’s right, a ton of stuff may have shot back up in price, but not everything. While Amazon was promoting its Prime Big Deals Days on Tuesday and Wednesday, Samsung was also running a whole bunch of deals, and guess what, they still are! At this moment, you can get yourself a 75-inch The Frame QLED smart TV for a huge $700 off, or get it in other sizes for other varying discounts. This Samsung TV that looks like a piece of art is down in price by as much as $700. But be warned, Samsung savings event may be going on longer than Amazon’s Prime Day, but it still has an end. These deals are active now until Sunday, October 13, so make your decision before it’s too late. Also, there’s a huge bonus, you can get HW-S61D soundbar for free!  See 32″ The Frame at Samsung See 55″ The Frame at Samsung See 75″ The Frame at Samsung Turn Your Entertainment Center Into a Work of Art The truly unique aspect about the Samsung The Frame which is unlike anything else from other manufacturers, is its Art Mode. When the TV is off, it doesn’t just going to black No sir. Instead, it will display your art collection for all to see. The TV has a matte display that has virtually no light or glare coming off it. It seriously looks like you are staring at a painting. You choose from a wide selection of art an images to showcase from the Samsung Art Store, or if you have your own artwork or photos you’d like to display, you can choose to do that as well. While you may think the TV running constantly is bad for energy consumption, that’s not exactly the case. The display actually has a built-in motion sensor so it will only showcase the images when it knows there are people in the room to observe and enjoy. It will default back to being off when no one is detected. The Frame’s literal frame is available in a couple of different colors to match the style of your home. The bezel comes in your choice or modern brown, or sand gold — go with whatever coordinates best with the rest of your furniture, walls, and art. The Samsung’s The Frame TV comes in many sizes, all of which seeing different discounts. The 32-inch is $50 off, The 43-inch is $150 off, The 50-inch is $350 off, and the 55-inch is $500 off. The 65-inch actually has a smaller discount than the 55, only at $400. Then the 75-inch has the largest discount at $700, and the 85-inch goes back down to a discount of $500. Again, save up to $700 off and don’t miss to chance to get HW-S61D soundbar for free! See at Samsung",
