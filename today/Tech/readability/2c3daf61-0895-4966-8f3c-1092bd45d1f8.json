  "text": "Tickets are now on sale for Universal Horror Unleashed, opening this summer in Las Vegas’ immersive entertainment hub AREA15. The Universal Destinations and Experiences satellite interactive station brings Halloween Horror Nights to a year-round venue just off the Strip with monsters in tow beginning August 14, hot off the heels of Epic Universe’s opening. The attraction’s first major featured franchises include the Universal Monsters, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist: Believer, and a HHN fave in Scarecrow: The Reaping. So get those Summerween plans started to kick off the season in Vegas with Leatherface, the Universal Monsters, and friends. From the looks of it, it’s sure to be a killer way to beat the heat, with haunted houses, thrilling entertainment (Jack the Clown!), and spooky dining. The experience will be joining AREA15’s other offerings, including Meow Wolf’s Omega Mart. Here’s a preview: It was previously announced that the year-round attraction will host limited runs of houses inspired by Universal Studios’ horror properties and Horror Nights original canon characters as seen at Universal’s theme parks. We’re hoping some of our favorite all-timer haunts (Universal Studios Florida’s Slaughter Sinema and Universal Studios Hollywood’s Alien vs. Predator, for starters) get featured down the line. As opening date approaches, we’re excited to learn more about the themed dining and drinks that will no doubt homage the studio’s legacy in horror past and present. You know HHN East’s cult fave pizza fries cannot be excluded from the menu. And speaking of cult, it’s such a gas to see Jack the Clown all over the teaser—the HHN icon deserves the limelight and to have more people know his name. Tickets are now on sale through Universal Horror Unleashed’s official site. They start at $69 to go through the haunts once and $99 to have unlimited access to them. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
