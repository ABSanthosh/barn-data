  "text": "NordVPN pulled an excellent move with the latest promotion. Instead of discounting its services, as all other VPNs do, NordVPN decided to pay its users to stay safe online. Select NordVPN two-year plans now come with Amazon Gift Cards of up to $50. That’s quite a gift! The bad news is that the promotion is temporary, and you don’t have a year to take advantage of it. This guide will explain the promotion and instruct you on how to get your NordVPN + Amazon Gift Card in a few minutes. Snatch the Exclusive NordVPN Bundle NordVPN + Amazon Gift Card Explained NordVPN is a master of cheap VPN subscriptions. This time, you can take it to the next level if you select one of the three plans: Plus, Complete, or Prime, all discounted by at least 70%. NordVPN’s Basic plan is a stellar option at $3.39 monthly, but being so affordable, it’s excluded from the equation. If you pick Plus, Complete, or Prime plans, you’ll be awarded a $20, $40, or $50 Amazon Gift Card. However, you must use NordVPN for at least 30 days. Immediately after, NordVPN will issue you an Amazon Gift Card that you can use to shop on Amazon in the USA, the UK, Canada, and Australia. Remember that NordVPN omits its annual and monthly plans from the promotion. Only its 24-month plans are valid. Best of all, the discounts are the same as before, and the Amazon Gift Card is really free, with no hidden tricks. Is the VPN Worth the Money? Even without the above-mentioned gift card, NordVPN is a fantastic VPN. It’s widely adopted by thousands, if not millions, of people globally. If you select the Plus plan, you’ll likely get the most for the least money. Besides NordVPN’s usual features, the plan also includes Threat Protection Pro. It’s known for blocking ads, trackers, and malicious sites. Moreover, NordVPN lets you use 7,800 servers in 125 locations; ideal for unblocking sites. The VPN is an epitome of safety and security. It combines mighty 256-bit encryption with a state-of-the-art no-log policy. Advance features like a Double VPN, Meshnet, and NordLynx are there if you need them. However, one of its main appeals is compatibility. NordVPN supports all devices and can be used on up to ten of them at a time at no additional cost. It’s an impressive all-arounder that works for streaming, torrenting, or browsing the internet in complete privacy. Now that you have the Amazon Gift Card, you can buy something nice, as if NordVPN weren’t already lovely enough. Don’t take too long—NordVPN won’t throw around Amazon Gift Cards forever.
