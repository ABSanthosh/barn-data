  "text": "Hackers have discovered a new way to remotely take control of your computer — all through the Google Chrome web browser.A report from cybersecurity company SquareX lays out the new multifaceted cyberattack, which the firm has dubbed \"browser syncjacking.\"Chrome profile takeoverAt the core of the attack is a social engineering element, as the malicious actor first must convince the user to download a Chrome extension. The Chrome extension is usually disguised as a helpful tool that can be downloaded via the official Chrome Store. It requires minimal permissions, further cementing its perceived legitimacy to the user. According to SquareX, the extension actually does usually work as advertised, in order to further disguise the source of the attack from the user.Meanwhile, secretly in the background, the Chrome extension connects itself to a managed Google Workspace profile that the attacker has set up in advance. With the user now unknowingly signed into a managed profile, the attacker sends the user to a legitimate Google support page which is injected with modified content through the Chrome extension, telling the user they need to sync their profile.When the user agrees to the sync, they unwittingly send all their local browser data, such as saved passwords, browsing history, and autofill information, to the hacker's managed profile. The hacker can then sign into this managed profile on their own device and access all that sensitive information. Mashable Light Speed Chrome browser takeoverThe attack up to this point already provides the hacker with enough material to commit fraud and other illicit activities. However, browser syncjacking provides the hacker with the capability to go even further.Using the teleconferencing platform Zoom as an example, SquareX explains that using the malicious Chrome extension, the attacker can send the victim to an official yet modified Zoom webpage that urges the user to install an update. However, the Zoom download that's provided is actually an executable file that installs a Chrome browser enrollment token from the hacker's Google Workspace.After this occurs, the hacker then has access to additional capabilities and can gain access to the user's Google Drive, clipboard, emails, and more.Device takeoverThe browser syncjacking attack doesn't stop there. The hacker can take one further step in order to not just take over the victim's Chrome profile and Chrome browser, but also their entire device.Through that same illicit download, such as the previously used Zoom update installer example, the attacker can inject a \"registry entry to message native apps\" by weaponizing Chrome’s Native Messaging protocol. By doing this, the attacker basically sets up a connection \"between the malicious extension and the local binary.\" Basically, it creates a flow of information between the hacker's Chrome extension and your computer. Using this, the hacker can send commands to your device.What can the hacker do from here? Pretty much anything they want. The attacker will have full access to the user's computer files and settings. They can create backdoors into the system. They can steal data such as passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, cookies, and more. In addition, they can track the user by controlling their webcam, take screenshots, record audio, and monitor everything input into the device.As you can see, browser syncjacking is nearly completely unrecognizable as an attack to most users. For now, the most important thing you can do to protect yourself from such a cyberattack is to be aware of what you download and only install trusted Chrome extensions.",
