This week’s HELOC rates Current HELOC rates and trends Top HELOC rates for October 2024 Comparing the best HELOC lenders for October 2024 HELOC Basics What is a HELOC? How does a HELOC work? Who qualifies for a HELOC? Pros and cons of a HELOC How to apply for a HELOC Tips for comparing multiple HELOC offers Alternatives to a HELOC Methodology FAQs HELOC: A variable-rate line of credit based on your home value that you can continually borrow from and pay back over a set time frame. Home Equity Loan: A loan that lets you borrow against the value of your home, with funds delivered as a lump sum. Cash-Out Refinance: In a cash-out refinance, you replace your current mortgage with a larger one, withdrawing the difference -- a portion of your home’s equity -- in cash as a lump sum. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) gives homeowners with at least 15% to 20% equity access to flexible financing.  You can tap into that credit line for expenses such as home renovations or to consolidate debt. Because the credit line remains available for a long time -- a typical draw period is 10 years -- it’s a good way to fund ongoing home projects. A HELOC can also be a source of funding for unexpected expenses, and the interest rate you pay will be lower than a credit card.  The main drawback of a HELOC is that your home serves as collateral for the loan. If you fall behind on payments, you risk foreclosure and could lose your home. I’ve spoken with experts about how these lines of credit work and where to find the best rates. Here’s what you need to know to determine if a HELOC is the right fit for you. This week’s HELOC rates Here are the average rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit as of Oct. 16, 2024. Loan typeThis week’s rateLast week’s rateDifference$30,000 HELOC8.69%8.73%-0.0410-year, $30,000 home equity loan8.46%8.46%None15-year, $30,000 home equity loan8.38%8.37%+0.01Note: These rates are averages determined by a survey conducted by Bankrate of the top 10 banks in the top 10 US markets.  Current HELOC rates and trends Aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve have directly impacted variable-rate HELOCs for more than two years, increasing the costs for borrowers. Average HELOC rates are currently around 8.73%, according to data from CNET sister site Bankrate.  That’s higher than current average mortgage rates -- which are now around 6.5% -- but is still a better deal than other financing options like credit cards, which average upwards of 20% APR, or personal loans which average 12.35%.  Now that the Fed has started cutting interest rates, HELOC rates should begin trending down. “As rates start to decline this year, variable-rate products like HELOCs become more attractive as borrowers will be able to benefit from the rate of decreases without the need to refinance,” said Matthew Sanford, administrative vice president of mortgage lending at Skyla Federal Credit Union.

It’s a loan taken out against your home while your original mortgage is still being paid off. A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is a type of revolving credit similar to a credit card, but that’s secured by your home. You’ll be able to access funds from your HELOC as you need them, instead of taking out a set amount at the onset, like with a home equity loan. There’s usually a minimum withdrawal amount based on the total amount of your credit line. HELOCs are commonly used for home improvements, such as adding solar panels, as well as debt consolidation and other large expenses. There are no restrictions on how you use the money from a HELOC.  HELOC, but there’s always a risk in taking on debt that’s tied to your home.HELOCs typically have variable-rate APRs, meaning your interest rate adjusts over time based on the benchmark US prime rate. The prime rate is the base rate on corporate loans posted by at least 70% of the 10 largest US banks, according to the Wall Street Journal. Similar to a home equity loan, a HELOC lets you borrow against the percentage of your home that you’ve fully paid off. Since your home serves as collateral for the loan, it’s important to have a repayment plan in place so you don’t lose your property.  HELOCs are typically divided into two periods: a draw period and a repayment period. During the draw period (often 10 years), you can take funds from your HELOC up to the amount of your credit line. With interest-only HELOCs, you’re required to make monthly payments toward the accrued interest, not the principal, during the draw period.  Once the draw period is over, you can no longer withdraw money, and you’ll enter the repayment period, where you begin paying back both principal and interest. While terms may vary by lender, the draw period typically lasts five to 10 years, while the repayment period usually lasts 10 to 20 years. Who qualifies for a HELOC? To qualify for a HELOC you’re typically required to meet the following criteria:  Have at least 15% to 20% equity built up in your home: Home equity is the amount of home you own, based on how much you’ve paid toward your mortgage. Subtract what you owe on your mortgage and other loans from the current appraised value of your house to figure out your home equity number. Have adequate, verifiable income and stable employment: Proof of income is a standard requirement to qualify for a HELOC. Check your lender’s website to see what forms and paperwork you will need to submit along with your application.  Have a minimum credit score of 620: Lenders use your credit score to determine the likelihood that you’ll repay the loan on time. Having a strong credit score -- at least 700 -- will help you qualify for a lower interest rate and more amenable loan terms.  Have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less: Divide your total monthly debts by your gross monthly income to get your DTI. Like your credit score, your DTI helps lenders determine your capacity to make consistent payments toward your loan. Some lenders prefer a DTI of 36% or less.  Pros and cons of a HELOC Pros HELOCs usually have lower interest rates than other financing options like personal loans or credit cards. You can withdraw funds anytime during the draw period and only have to pay for the amount of money you use, plus interest. HELOCs have very few restrictions on what the money can be used for. Lenders often offer discounted rates for an introductory rate period. Cons Because HELOCs are secured by your house, you could lose your home if you default on your debt. HELOCs can have a minimum withdrawal amount. The interest rate is variable, so your rate and monthly payment could increase unexpectedly. HELOCs could come with annual fees, application fees, appraisal fees and other closing costs, depending on the lender. How to apply for a HELOC Applying for a HELOC is similar to applying for a mortgage. Before you do so, make sure you qualify for the loan amount you need and that you meet basic requirements: at least 15% to 20% equity in your home, a good credit score and a low combined loan-to-value ratio (the ratio of all of your outstanding mortgage balances compared to the market value of your property). 1. Determine your LTV ratio Your lender will calculate the amount of equity in your home to determine your loan-to-value ratio, which expresses how much you still owe on your home’s mortgage compared to its current appraised value. Generally, your LTV should be less than 80% and no higher than 90% to qualify. Having a high LTV tells a lender you may be a risky borrower. Here‘s the basic formula: To calculate the equity in your home: Look up your outstanding mortgage balance and subtract it from your home’s appraised value. For example, if your home is currently worth $500,000 and you have $400,000 left to pay on your mortgage, then you have $100,000 of equity in your home.  To determine your loan-to-value ratio: Divide your current mortgage balance by your home’s appraised value. If you owe $400,000 on a $500,000 home, the calculation would be:  $400,000 [outstanding mortgage balance] / $500,000 [current appraised value] = 0.80 Then multiply that answer by 100 to get your LTV ratio expressed as a percent. In this example, you have an 80% LTV ratio. 2. Determine your HELOC credit limit Most lenders will let you borrow in the neighborhood of 75% to 90% of your home’s value, minus what you owe on your primary mortgage. To determine whether you’ll hit that threshold, you can use the below formula, which assumes a lender will allow you to borrow up to 85% of your home equity: $500,000 [current appraised value] X 0.85 [maximum equity percentage you can borrow] – $400,000 [outstanding mortgage balance] = $25,000 [what the lender will let you borrow] 3. Reach out to lenders  It’s important to interview multiple lenders when you want to use your home equity for financing. The more banks and lenders you contact, the better your chances of finding more favorable rates and fees overall. You can start with the lender or bank that issued your first mortgage, since they’ve already approved you for one loan and you have an existing relationship. You might also compare rates from online lenders. 4. Send in your application  Once you’ve chosen a lender, gather all of your financial documentation to verify you can pay back the HELOC. You’ll need proof of income and employment, and in some cases, you may need to pay for a new home appraisal to assess the current market value of your property.  After all your financial paperwork is submitted, the final step is to close on the loan, which can take anywhere from 30 to 60 days depending on the lender. Tips for comparing multiple HELOC offers The offers you receive will vary from lender to lender, but the more you know about the specific ins and outs of those offers, the better your chances of saving money and interest. There are a few major factors to consider when deciding which HELOC offer to go with.  Introductory rate period Since HELOCs have variable interest rates tied to the prime rate, your interest rate will go up and down over time. Be aware of what the prime rate is and know that you’ll be paying a markup on that interest rate.  In the beginning, most HELOCs come with a lower introductory rate period, but the length of those initial rates will differ by lender, and you want to find the longest one possible. The longer you have a lower interest rate, the more money you’ll save over time. There are also some lenders who allow you to fix your interest rate for a portion of the loan, which offers a more predictable payment. Rate cap Ask about your maximum HELOC interest rate cap. HELOCs have lifetime interest rate caps, so even if the prime rate rises and surpasses your rate cap, your HELOC rate won’t increase any further. If you have an existing HELOC, you can attempt to negotiate a lower rate with your lender.  “Ask your current HELOC lender if they will fix the interest rate on your outstanding balance,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, CNET’s sister site. “Some lenders offer this, many do not. But it is worth asking the question.” Minimum withdrawals Some lenders require minimum withdrawals regardless of your total line of credit. You don’t want to get stuck making interest payments on funds you don’t actually need if that amount is less than the mandatory minimum withdrawal amount set by your lender. It’s also important to know when your draw period ends so you can afford the larger principal-plus-interest payments once you enter your repayment period. Alternatives to a HELOC Home equity loans are another type of home equity financing. With a home equity loan, you take out a one-time loan with a set amount, loan term and interest rate, then pay it back in monthly installments. A home equity loan works like a personal loan except it is secured by your home, just like a HELOC.  Cash-out refinances are also a common way to tap into your home equity for cash, but they work differently than a HELOC or home equity loan. While a HELOC or home equity loan acts as a second mortgage on your home, a cash-out refinance replaces your current mortgage with a new one. With a cash-out refi, you’ll take out a mortgage with a larger loan amount than your current one, use it to pay off your existing mortgage and pocket the difference as cash.  Personal loans are a good option if you want to avoid putting your home up as collateral. However, personal loans tend to have higher interest rates than HELOCs and home equity loans.  Methodology We evaluated a range of lenders based on factors such as interest rates, APRs and fees, how long the draw and repayment periods are, and what types and variety of loans are offered. We also took into account factors that impact the user experience such as how easy it is to apply for a loan online and whether physical lender locations exist.

As of October, average HELOC interest rates are in the high 8% range.  Some lenders advertise even lower interest rates, but those rates are typically available only to borrowers with excellent credit and an LTV ratio below 80% (often close to 60% or 70%). Getting a better rate could depend on your financial situation, including your credit score, income level, debt-to-income ratio and how much equity you have in your house. HELOCs can be useful for large expenses, like home renovations, medical emergencies or college tuition. They’re particularly good for ongoing expenses because you’ll only need to pay back what you spend during the draw period. A HELOC can be a good option if you have big expenses coming up that you need cash to cover. If you’re unsure how much money you’ll need and don’t need all the funds upfront, a HELOC gives you plenty of flexibility. An added advantage is that current HELOC rates are comparatively lower than other types of financing, like personal loans or credit cards. But if you’re unsure you’ll be able to comfortably repay the loan, a HELOC isn’t worth the risk of losing your home. While HELOCs are variable-rate revolving lines of credit, home equity loans are fixed-rate installment loans. With a home equity loan, you get a sum of money when you take out the loan and pay it back (with interest) in fixed monthly payments.  With a HELOC, you can draw from a line of credit as much as you want, whenever you want during the draw period and pay it back with interest during the repayment period. Your monthly payment will depend on how much you draw and the current interest rate on your HELOC.  The interest rates you’ll get for either loan are determined by your credit score, home equity, where you live, your property’s value and other factors.
