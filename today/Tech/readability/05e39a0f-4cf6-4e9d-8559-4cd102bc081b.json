They said 46 percent of all counties studied had at least one pharmacy desert, and that 15.8 million people in the U.S. live in pharmacy deserts. The authors also found that communities that are pharmacy deserts have higher proportions of “people who have a high school education or less, have no health insurance, have low self-reported English ability, have an ambulatory disability and identify as a racial or ethnic minority.” For a summary of the study, click here.

Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics to tackle barriers to pharmacy access, including closures, by providing real-time information on pharmacy shortage areas. Click here for more on the partnership. We will be updating the tool soon with up-to-date information. The goal of our initiative is to serve as a resource for federal and state policy and public health officials by conducting research, generating real-time evidence on the scope and impact of the problem of pharmacy access, and identifying sustainable policy solutions to address it.
