  "text": "Looking for a new cloud storage service? pCloud might offer exactly what you need. Dropbox is cool and everything, but not as cool as pCloud. People are looking to ditch Dropbox and stop paying ridiculously high prices for average-sized storage. If you’re one of them, pCloud will spike your interest. This time, pCloud came up with an offer you can’t refuse. If you act now, you can get up to 10 TB of Lifetime Family storage for up to 5 members. Store files safely, collaborate, and enjoy peace of mind with pCloud. See Offers at pCloud No Subscriptions or Referring Fees: Get pCloud Now The beauty of this popular online storage is that it doesn’t require a subscription. You don’t pay a single recurring fee, as the Family Lifetime plan is a one-time payment. Pay now and use pCloud for the rest of your life! This Easter promotion lasts just a couple more days, but if you act now, one of the three discounted Family plans can be yours: 2 TB Family plan at $399 (69% off) 5 TB Family plan at $599 (68% off) 10 TB Family plan at $1,049 (60% off) pCloud is down by at least 60% and is currently one of the least expensive online storage services. Not to mention, all plans include pCloud Pass Family, a password manager that all five members of the family can use. Finally, all three plans are covered by a 14-day money-back guarantee. There’s virtually no risk in giving it a shot. In the worst-case scenario, you’ll be able to get a refund. Frankly, we don’t think that’ll happen with pCloud. Millions of pCloud users are still in love with everything it offers. Key Features of pCloud Family A Family plan from pCloud allows up to five users to share the given storage. There’s storage allocation, as well, so you can split it equally or on a per-need basis to each family member. pCloud also supports file synchronization. This means you can access and sync your files in real time on all devices. Cloud backups are another excellent tool, backing up your quintessential files to prevent losses. One of pCloud’s key features is security and file safety. pCloud uses 256-bit encryption and offers 2FA to prevent unauthorized access. It also relies on file redundancy, keeping multiple copies of your files on different servers, having them ready for you if one of the servers malfunctions. Users can enjoy password-protected file sharing, as well as apps for iOS and Android. With a seamlessly integrated pCloud virtual drive on Windows and macOS, pCloud helps you save ample space by moving your files to the cloud. Work, collaborate, share files, and have fun with the most impressive cloud storage provider. But hurry. The Easter sale won’t last a lifetime — your chosen pCloud Family plan will, though!
