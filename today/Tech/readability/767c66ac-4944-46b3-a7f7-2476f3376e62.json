In an evolving digital landscape, it’s becoming more complex to engage consumers and truly resonate with their interests. For advertisers, that means it’s now critical to connect with customers across a wider range of channels to meet them where they are. Google Display Ads (GDA) are a powerful tool for building those connections. GDA helps advertisers drive reach and performance across websites and apps using visually immersive and engaging creative. Today we’re sharing updates designed to help advertisers cut through with more compelling ad experiences across Display inventory. More flexibility and reach across surfacesGDA, and the wider Google Display Network (“GDN”), helps advertisers expand and diversify their marketing strategies across more than 3 million sites and apps.1 And now we've added even more inventory across a range of platforms and categories, like news, sports, social and gaming. Over the next few weeks, you’ll see a new selection of third-party Connected TV (CTV) inventory across key categories, including TelevisaUnivision, MLB, and FOX News. With this wider breadth of networks and channels, you can ensure your brand shows up across your audience’s favorite media.We’re also giving you more flexibility over how you buy Display ads. Today, you can use them in both standalone Display and Performance Max campaigns. We recently announced that we’re also adding Google Display inventory to Demand Gen campaigns to help advertisers stay top of mind with more customers — wherever they are browsing visual-first content. Demand Gen previously only had access to a video-eligible subset of the Google Display Network via Google Video Partners (“GVP”). If you’ve previously opted into GVP and have image assets uploaded to your existing Demand Gen campaigns, your image ads will start serving on the Google Display Network as part of this transition. In testing, on average, advertisers who added Google Display Network to their Demand Gen campaigns saw a 16% lift in conversions.2 To learn about how to add the Google Display Network to your Demand Gen campaigns, you can visit our Google Ads Help Center. Easier and faster generation of quality creativeAccording to Ipsos, 75% of an ad's recall potential is determined by the quality of the creative.3 It’s essential to ensure your brand shows up in the right way across Display surfaces — so we’ve recently launched a range of creative features to help. For example, we upgraded our image generation models across all campaign types, including Display, to Imagen 3. This is our most advanced text-to-image model, tuned using ads performance data across industries so you can harness the power of Google AI to drive even stronger creative performance. Use generative AI and our latest Imagen 3 models to create new and high-quality images We’re also making it easier for teams to review and collaborate on building creative assets. Now, all your assets can be previewed in a dedicated gallery. This will provide greater transparency into how imagery has been enhanced and combined using AI, and how different assets will show across a wide variety of formats and surfaces on desktop, video and mobile. Plus, if you need other teams to weigh in, it’s now easy to review, approve and generate a sharing link to send to partners for their review — all from the preview gallery. GDA Preview Gallery - mobile ads view GDA Preview Gallery - desktop ads view Lastly, we know that it’s a balance. Accelerating creative production is great, but you also need to stay in control of how your brand is represented across different channels. To make that easier, we’re introducing a range of creative templates for Display ads, so you can keep your brand standards top-of-mind when building new assets. Responsive display ad templates Enhanced quality standards and protectionsWe’re continually working to improve the quality of inventory that Google Display Ads serve on. We regularly review and evaluate publishers and their inventory on the Google Display Network, defend our systems against invalid activity and advertising fraud, and add new protections to reduce exposure to potentially invalid leads and invalid traffic.
