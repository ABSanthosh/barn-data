  "text": "Credit: Apple I like Apple Maps. I want to love it, but I can't. Despite the obvious integrations with iOS, and the generally pleasing aesthetic, Google Maps simply does some things better. One of those things is particularly key: finding somewhere to eat.Searching for a restaurant on Apple Maps and Google Maps is the same on the surface: You make your query, scan the map for a name that jumps out, then tap that restaurant to learn more. Apple Maps serves up Yelp reviews, which you can see previews of, but if you tap any of them for more details, you're taken to the Yelp app. If you don't have the Yelp app, you're taken to the App Store to download the Yelp app. Google Maps, on the other hand, has Google reviews. If you tap a review, you read the review right then and there, without actually leaving the app. Genius. Now, Apple is taking a small step towards making the experience of finding a good restaurant on Apple Maps easier—at least, so long as you're okay with fancy dining. Searching for Michelin-starred restaurants on Apple MapsOn Thursday, the company announced a new search filter, which lets you specify Michelin distinctions when looking for restaurants. Here's how it works: After searching for your restaurants (even with a general search term like \"restaurants\"), you can scroll through the search filters underneath the search bar (e.g. \"Top Rated,\" \"All Cuisines,\" etc.) until you find \"Michelin Distinctions.\" Here, you can look for restaurants with one, two, or three Michelin stars; \"Bib Gourmand,\" which a restaurant can earn if it doesn't quite meet a true star level; and \"Green Star,\" which Michelin awards to sustainable restaurants. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong on my end, or the feature hasn't quite rolled out in full yet, but I cannot get any Michelin-starred restaurants to appear in my search. No matter which filter I try, Apple Maps says it can't find any matching places. And unless I missed some major news, I think New York City has at least some Michelin-starred restaurants.Assuming the feature will eventually work on my device, this is a cool way to find fine dining experiences in your area, or the area you're visiting. If you're looking for a great restaurant that isn't the peak of fancy, Bib Gourmand might be where it's at. If you're looking for a spot that might've been featured in some Netflix doc on fancy chefs, the \"3 Star\" filter might be your move. You're not limited to restaurants here, either. Apple Maps now lets you search for Michelin Key hotels, as well. I'll admit, I've never taken the time to double-check with Michelin before booking a room somewhere, but I suppose that could be a helpful search filter for some. What do you think so far? Apple says it is also working on bringing search filters for recommendations from The Infatuation, as well as Golf Digest, the latter of which will supply recommendations for golf courses.Apple Maps still has some catching up to doWhile searching for Michelin-starred restaurants (and hotels) is a great to feature to have—a feature Google Maps doesn't have, actually—it doesn't place Apple's navigation app on par with Google's when it comes to finding somewhere to eat. For one, most of us are not searching for fine dining options most of the times we go out to eat. Most of us just want a great restaurant, and if it doesn't break the bank, even better. Until Apple figures out a way to incorporate more in-app insights into the restaurants that pop up in a search, I think many will continue to use Google Maps. I know I will.
