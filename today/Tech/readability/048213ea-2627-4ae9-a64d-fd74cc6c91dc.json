  "text": "Prices for most major tech products will be driven up in the coming year thanks to US President Donald Trump's steep new import duties, according to economists. The tariffs have already had a sharp impact on US stocks, which have been sinking rapidly on the back of the tariff implementations. But constant changes to the tariffs make it tricky to advise consumer purchases.On Wednesday, the president paused most of the tariffs, with the exception of China, raising tariffs on that country to 125%. Then late Friday, the administration exempted certain tech gear from some tariff fees, though it wasn't clear whether the exemption would stick or if additional fees would come into play later.Whether the tariffs will change the timing of your next tech purchase depends on what kind of tech you need. Before Wednesday's announced tariff pause, we asked CNET's experts for their thoughts on what devices you should consider buying now and what you can wait on, covering everything from phones, earbuds, TVs and laptops to gaming consoles, smart thermostats, electric vehicles and cameras.Many of these products are either imported in their entirety or contain components that are not made in the US, like graphics processing units for PCs. Importing all those separate components will lead to higher costs under Trump's barrage of tariffs.Read more: Tariffs Explained: Impacts for You as Trump Confirms Worldwide Tariff WaveThe tariffs will have an effect on a sweeping range of consumer expenditures, well beyond just tech products. Your groceries will likely see bumps in the prices of bananas, coffee and seafood, among other things. Much of the clothing, footwear and furniture we buy is made overseas. It's an indication of how the modern economy is built on a global scale with often complicated lines of interdependence. The Trump administration is hoping that the tariffs will lead to more manufacturing on American soil.If you're not ready to make a purchase now, don't let yourself be rushed -- especially for products priced in the thousands of dollars. You should always make sure that a purchase is a good fit for your budget. It's also unknown at the moment how long the tariffs might be in effect. During the first Trump administration, tariffs pushed up the prices on washing machines, and prices of dryers followed suit, even though the tariffs weren't directly affecting those appliances. Marc Beresford/Getty Images\"The tariffs are sweeping, and the effects are going to be even broader,\" says Neale Mahoney, director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and professor of economics at Stanford University. \"It's not a good time to be a consumer.\"Read more: How Much Will iPhone and Other Apple Prices Increase With 'Liberation Day' Tariffs?Even goods that aren't directly impacted by the new tariffs could increase in price, according to Mahoney. During the first Trump administration, tariffs increased prices on washing machines, not dryers, but dryer prices increased as well. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, used car prices increased along with new car prices.\"There's going to be some uncertainty as we move to what economists call a new equilibrium,\" he says.Read more: CNET Survey: Worries Over Tariff Price Hikes Are Pushing Americans to Buy Tech SoonerMobile devicesPhones Even the lower-end iPhone 16E could see a price hike. Celso Bulgatti/CNETWhile Trump's tariffs are aimed at increasing US-based manufacturing and boosting sales of products already made here, CNET's managing editor for the mobile team, Patrick Holland, points out that there isn't a mainstream phone that's completely made in the US.\"Components come from all around the world,\" Holland says. \"That's true for Apple, Samsung or Xiaomi. So Apple being based in the US is at a similar disadvantage from tariffs as Samsung is being based in South Korea.\"Holland is optimistic that Apple will find a way to absorb some of the increased importation costs in the short term. Nearly all iPhones are made in China, with the rest also made overseas. Read more: Mortgage Rate Predictions: Will Tariffs Impact Spring Homebuying?Holland's advice is to hold onto your current phone for as long as you can, rather than running out to buy one in the hopes of beating a possible price hike.Other experts also warn against panic buying an iPhone, despite predicting that Apple's prices could rise by around 10% in coming months. \"[Tariffs] could lead to price increases of $50 to $150 on higher-end products like the iPhone Pro Max models and MacBook Pros,\" Stephan Shipe, a certified financial planner and CEO of Scholar Financial Advising, told CNET earlier this week.Wall Street analysts from Rosenblatt Securities, according to Reuters, anticipate that if the 43% tariff on China is passed to consumers, the cost of an iPhone 16 could rise from $799 to $1,142; the iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase from $1,599 to $2,300; and even the newly launched low-end iPhone 16E could increase in pricing from $599 to $856. A breakdown by the Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, looks at individual components and the retail price for an iPhone 16 Pro to show how much tariffs would raise manufacturing costs for Apple.And prices could be driven even higher after China on Friday retaliated by placing export restrictions on rare earth elements used in producing phones, EVs and other electronics.If tariffs and general inflation are affecting your ability to pay for a brand new, high-end phone, Holland's best budget pick for those looking for a deal on a phone is the $500 Google Pixel 8A. \"It has one of the best values of any phone sold today,\" he says. \"But I look forward to testing the recently announced Pixel 9A that goes on sale Thursday, April 10.\"SmartwatchesSmartwatches may not be affected by the tariffs this year, according to Vanessa Hand Orellana, CNET lead writer for smartwatches and wearable technology. \"I'm not sure if it will hit this year's smartwatch production cycle despite reports,\" she says. \"At this point in production, it's likely that all the manufacturing pieces for the 2025 watch models have already been ordered.\"But for next year's watch production, she's hopeful that Trump will realize the economic blow to businesses and individuals and reverse his stance on tariffs just like he did with the TikTok ban. Otherwise, tariffs will no doubt affect the pricing of 2026 smartwatches.Hand Orellana also cautioned against panic buying: \"I know a lot of people who are stocking up on products right now because of tariffs, and I can't help feeling that this doomsday-style planning is just going to leave me with a pile of stuff,\" she says. Headphones and earbudsIf you're in the market for a new set of headphones or earbuds, CNET executive editor David Carnoy says pricing will likely remain the same for existing inventory already in stores. \"But as inventory is depleted, prices could rise if the tariffs remain in place. And all bets are off for new products coming to market,\" Carnoy says. Current products should remain stable, but we could be in for \"sticker shock\" with new product releases from big names later this year. Carnoy has already seen Edifier increase its price of the NeoBuds Planar; they were initially set to be launched at $200, but when they hit the market on March 11, they were adjusted to $300 due to an increase in tariffs.\"As Edifier did, companies will bake in the price increase at launch. We were seeing $10 to $20 inflationary price increases on more premium next-gen earbuds and headphones even before the tariffs. We could see $40 to $50 price increases now with new products,\" Carnoy warns.TVsNow is a good time to shop for a 2024 model if you're looking for a new TV, according to CNET senior director of content David Katzmaier. TVs from last year are currently at their lowest prices as retailers clear out inventory for new stock.\"New 2025 TVs are hitting store shelves and online retailers this spring, but their prices will remain high until the fall and the holiday season,\" he says. But if you don't need a new TV right now, Katzmaier advises against buying until you do need one.\"TVs last a long time,\" he says. \"Yes, tariffs could push prices higher on new TVs, but whether they'll affect TV prices around sales times -- think Black Friday and later in November and December -- is an open question.\"Gaming consoles Preorders of the Nintendo Switch 2 are already delayed due to the tariffs. NintendoHigh-end consolesThe question is whether retailers will instantly begin raising prices, or whether new pricing would only apply to inventory that's imported from now on, CNET senior editor and gaming writer David Lumb says. He advises buying before the next restock in the next few days or the next week or two, just to make absolutely sure, if a purchase is something you've already budgeted for.\"If you really want a console already on the market, my instinct is to buy before the next restock to make absolutely sure -- whether that means in the next few days or the next week or two,\" Lumb advises. \"Companies are reeling now, but still selling.\"The Nintendo Switch 2, introduced this week, is also likely to be affected. It won't be available until June 5, but already US preorders of the Switch 2 have been delayed due to the tariffs. Preorders of the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, with a starting price of $450. It's not yet known whether the pricing will increase, or what date preorders will begin.\"If people want a console currently on the market, like the PS5 or Xbox Series X, it might be smart to buy now,\" Lumb says. \"Even if retailers don't need to raise prices, they might anyway out of uncertainty, panic or greed.\"Gaming PCsLike laptops and phones, the biggest worry is over the internal components of gaming PCs. \"These will almost surely get hit with tariff-related increases -- especially since many are made by smaller companies than Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft that can absorb some or all of these tariff increases (if they want),\" Lumb says. Several factors have already made GPUs a high-cost component, and this will likely only worsen with tariffs.\"GPUs have seen skyrocketing prices in the last 6 to 8 years due to successive event trends that caused scarcity -- namely the crypto mining craze and pandemic-related supply chain issues, during which the world's biggest GPU maker, Nvidia, steadily raised its prices,\" Lumb explains. That, combined with its central role in the gen AI boom, caused stocks to skyrocket and Nvidia to become one of the richest companies in the world, he says. \"So they won't blink at raising GPU prices even more.\"AMD told CNET that while semiconductors are exempt from the new tariffs, it is \"assessing the details and any impacts on our broader customer and partner ecosystem.\"Handheld consolesAs for handheld gaming consoles, like the Steam Deck, Lenovo Go S and the other smaller PC-on-the-go handhelds, Lumb predicts tariff pricing increases will kick in pretty quickly as these devices \"don't have the institutional resistance to keep prices low.\"\"If you're thinking about a handheld, it's probably better to buy one now,\" he advises.So the gamers who are most advised to \"buy now\" are those buying PCs or handheld gaming devices. Computers Acer prices have already gone up. Matt Elliott/CNETLaptops and PCsThe tariffs are going to require buyers to be smart shoppers, hunting for bargains.\"I've already seen prices increase on laptops since the threat of tariffs were known,\" says Matthew Elliott, CNET senior editor for laptops and computers. \"But most vendors and online retailers offer rotating sales, so you can still find a good deal if you have the time and patience to monitor pricing, and time your purchase for when a discount hits the model you want.\"Tariffs have already affected laptop pricing. Acer CEO Jason Chen said in February that the company would raise its prices by 10% in anticipation. \"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,\" the CEO of the Taiwan-based company said. \"We think 10 (percent) probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It's very straightforward.\"Even if computer companies want to shift and obtain their parts from the US, it's not likely to be practical.\"All computers and peripherals are likely to be touched by these global tariffs in some way,\" says Josh Goldman, CNET managing editor for computers. \"While there are companies big and small that assemble PCs in the US and there are US component makers, it's unlikely all parts can currently be sourced from US manufacturers.\"His advice is to get that computer soon if you need one, but -- as Elliott notes above -- look for sales and deals, like the upcoming Memorial Day sales.\"I wouldn't wait to see if prices go up and out of financial reach,\" Goldman recommends. \"That said, spring is typically filled with sales on tech for Memorial Day weekend, dads and grads and then back-to-school. Discounts might not be as deep as in the past, but if you keep an eye on a model you want, you should be able to minimize the impact of the tariffs on your purchase.\"One tiny bit of good news is that you may not have to worry about the pricing of used and refurbished tech devices and laptops. They could be a good way to save money and keep tech out of landfill.But don't get too excited: \"If the tariffs do drastically increase the prices on new computers for an extended time, it's possible even the prices on refurbished devices will go up with demand,\" Goldman warns.Home tech Now's a good time to buy a smart doorbell like the Google Nest. Tyler Lacoma/CNETNow is also a good time to buy smart home tech like higher-end security cameras, video doorbells, smart thermostats and smart displays, according to the advice of Tyler Lacoma, CNET smart home and home security editor. Especially if you're eyeing home devices in the over-$200 price point.\"The impact of tariffs will be most noticeable among smart home technology that already has higher prices,\" Lacoma says. But don't expect to find a secret cache of smart-home products that will go untouched by the tariffs.\"Home tech devices are a combination of computer chips, electronic components and many different frame materials,\" he says. \"I doubt there is any device that will be unaffected by the latest tariff news.\"CamerasIf you've got a camera on your wish list, you shouldn't wait to buy it, says CNET senior writer Jeff Carlson -- who's written numerous books about photography and who co-hosts the PhotoActive.co podcast.\"I hate to inspire panic-buying, but I'd say if you're already planning on buying a camera now but wanted to wait until the next revision rolls around, it's possible that waiting will cost you more,\" Carlson warns.A lot of camera equipment comes from Japan, and as recently as a week ago, some photography experts were hoping that country wouldn't be affected by the tariffs. But Carlson still found himself in an exceptionally crowded camera store recently, as buyers worried that any electronics from Asia might jump in price.\"And now we know that Japan is included, so they were right to come in,\" Carlson notes.Electric vehicles and other cars Electric vehicle chargers could also see a price hike due to new tariffs. FordMost Americans can't rush out and stock up on SUVs just because of the new tariffs, even though car prices will almost certainly go up. But you might not realize that vehicles aren't the only automotive item that will be affected -- things like dashboard cameras and EV chargers for your home could also become more expensive.\"The tariffs will also likely affect automotive parts and accessories, so if you're on the fence about picking up a dash cam, portable jump starter or extra EV charger, now might be a good time to pull the trigger,\" says Antuan Goodwin, CNET writer and automotive and EVs expert.The tariffs aren't good news for car junkies, Goodwin notes.\"Many of the tariffs are laser-targeted at the automotive industry, so there's not much that won't be affected,\" he says. \"From the vehicles themselves to the parts they're made of, consumers should expect that everything automotive, even for domestic makes, will get more expensive.\"The tariffs could also mean more expensive repairs and replacement parts for the cars we already own.",
