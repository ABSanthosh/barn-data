Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.I jumped on the smartwatch bandwagon a bit late, but now I can’t go a day without mine. Beyond delivering helpful notifications, it’s perfect for setting timers, tracking workouts, and monitoring my sleeping habits (which are terrible). If you haven’t yet joined the smartwatch party or you’re looking to upgrade, Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 is down to $199.99 ($100 off) in the 40mm / Bluetooth configuration at Amazon and Walmart. If you prefer a larger display, the 44mm model is on sale at Amazon starting at $229.99 ($100 off).$199The Galaxy Watch 7 adds a faster processor and a new 3-in-1 BioActive sensor. It’s an iterative update, but it’s more comfortable for sleep tracking than the Galaxy Watch Ultra.While the Galaxy Watch 7 isn’t as flashy as other Samsung wearables, its more simplistic approach is part of its charm. It retains the signature circular design and slim profile of prior models, which remains a stark contrast to the adventure-ready Galaxy Watch Ultra. It’s comfortable to wear while sleeping and working out — as our own Victoria Song noted in her review last year — and it comes with a selection of welcome features, including heart rate tracking, an Energy Score for gauging recovery, and FDA-approved sleep apnea detection.One of the new marquee tools of the Watch 7 is its AI-powered wellness insights, which provide personalized suggestions to help you hit your health and fitness goals. There’s also a 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor that can measure metabolic health thanks to an experimental advanced glycation end products (AGEs) metric, though both features were rather hit or miss in our testing. Of course, the wearable also offers a range of basic smartwatch features, such as the ability to stream music, send texts, and take calls when your phone is nearby.Despite its slimmer design, the Watch 7 offers around 24 hours of battery life with the always-on display enabled, though if you upgrade to the 44mm Watch 7, you can eke out a few additional hours. Samsung’s wearable also runs Wear OS 5, as of now, though we’re expecting the Gemini-powered Wear OS 6 to arrive via an update later this year. All that being said, the timing of these deals could indicate that a Galaxy Watch 8 is on the horizon. Samsung typically holds an Unpacked event in mid-July, and this year it may introduce a refreshed lineup of foldable and wearable devices.Other deals to check outAmazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is down to an all-time low of $174.99 ($75 off) at Amazon. The 37-inch soundbar features three speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, providing a nice upgrade over your TV’s built-in speakers. Plus, it supports Dolby Atmos for richer, more three-dimensional sound. A dedicated center dialogue channel promises you’ll actually hear what people are saying as well, allowing you to turn off closed captions, while its relatively compact size makes it a great option for smaller setups.The Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe is available from Amazon and Anker (with code WS7DV2DYGOBA) for $103.99 (about $46 off), matching its best price to date. The 3-in-1 charger is perfect if you own multiple Apple devices, allowing you to simultaneously charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. The primary wireless pad delivers 15W of power, with an adjustable viewing angle of up to 60 degrees. The Apple Watch charger, meanwhile, features a convenient slide-in and slide-out mechanism, while the AirPods charging pad can be accessed by angling the main charger. It also comes with a 30W USB-C charger and a 5-foot USB-C cable, so you’re ready to go out of the box.The Soundcore Select 4 Go is back down to its all-time low of $19.98 (about $15 off) at Amazon in select colors. The diminutive Bluetooth speaker is perfect for listening to your favorite playlist while relaxing by the pool, at the park, or in the bath. It features IP67 waterproofing, allowing it to withstand immersion in up to 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes, thus providing peace of mind when used outdoors. A handy lanyard also lets you attach it to your bag or your bike’s handlebars, while the speaker’s 20-hour battery ensures it can keep the party going during all-day events.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.",
