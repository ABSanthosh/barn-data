Credit: Meredith Dietz Purchasing a full set of individual dumbbell pairs between five and 60 pounds can cost well over $1,500, not to mention how much space you'd have to dedicate to storing them. That's why I'm a huge fan of adjustable dumbbells like the REP QuickDraws or Nüobells, which I reviewed here and here, respectively. If you know you want to be able to up to 60 pounds at five-pound increments, effectively combining 30 weights into one compact set, then adjustables like the REP QuickDraws are how you can save significant money and space in your home gym equipment setup. But let's say your strength progresses beyond your adjustable dumbbells' capacity. First of all: Nice work. Secondly: What do you do now? I've seen users on Reddit directly asking \"what's stopping me from adding more plates to keep going heavier?\" Adding extra weight plates seems like a logical solution, as opposed to spending all that money on an entirely new set for just a few pounds beyond the recommended capacity. So, let's take a look at what is stopping you—and what's not. Here's what you should know about using add-on weights to your adjustable dumbbells, from what is officially considered unsafe to why it gets impractical even aside from that. How to add weight to your adjustable dumbbellsFirst off, not all adjustable dumbbells allow for this type of modification. Selector pin systems (like PowerBlocks) generally don't allow for unofficial weight additions due to their enclosed design. Dial systems (like my favorite, the Nüobells) have security features specifically preventing modifications outside the cradle. Then you have spin-lock dumbbells, like the QuickDraws, which allow for customization and additional weight outside the cradle. For this reason, I'll be speaking to the REP QuickDraws specifically, as opposed to Nüobells or Powerblocks.Still, adding weight beyond the manufacturer's specifications will almost certainly void your warranty. REP Fitness designed these dumbbells for specific weight ranges and cannot guarantee safety beyond those limits. I spoke with a REP representative (REP-resentative?) who informed me, \"internal testing was not conducted beyond the 60 pound maximum, so REP cannot guarantee the safety of additional weight beyond that.\"Outside of your warranty, there are safety concerns. The handles, locking mechanisms, and materials are engineered for specific maximum loads. Exceeding these limits risks equipment failure and potential injury. Even if the dumbbells can technically handle the additional plates, the result might be bulky and awkward, affecting your form and increasing injury risk.All that being said, it still is entirely feasible to bend the rules and take your 60-pound dumbbells up to 70 pounds. Assuming you play it safe and only add a few plates to each side, here's what you should know:Only add compatible plates: The QuickDraw system uses standard plate dimensions that can be supplemented with additional compatible plates.Manual addition required: You'll need to add these plates manually outside the cradle system, as the selection mechanism only works within the advertised weight range. This pretty much negates the whole \"quick draw\" appeal.Secure them properly: Ensure the additional plates are secured with the locking mechanism to prevent dangerous slippage during exercises.Manual tracking required: The dial indicator becomes inaccurate once you exceed the designed range. You'll need to manually calculate and track the added weight.Can you (and should you) add more weight to REP QuickDraw Dumbbells?The short answer: Yes, technically you can add additional weight plates to REP QuickDraw dumbbells beyond their advertised maximum. The long answer: Just because something is possible doesn't mean you should make a habit of it. Sure, it's fully above-board to order add-on weights in five-pound increments (which, side-note, I love so much more than a 10-pound jump). However, going beyond 60 pounds isn't sanctioned by REP. What do you think so far? For this reason, I naturally had my boyfriend test my DIY super-QuickDraws creation. In the image below, you can see how I manually added weights outside of the cradle. With the spin-locks, you can keep adding weights outside the cradle without any resistance. Just slide the weights on and flip the lock switch.I snapped a picture of it in its lopsided form, so you can see just how far outside the cradle the five-pound add-ons will go—and how precarious it starts to look right off the bat. Behold, my DIY super-QuickDraws creation. Credit: Meredith Dietz As we steadily increased the weight from 65, to 70, to 85 pounds, he noted growing concerns with how much the dumbbells could handle while still feeling safe. The all-steel design gives these guys a premium feel during standard use. But when you go beyond the sanctioned weight capacity, there's a sense that the dumbbells wouldn't bend or snag, but simply snap. And again, you'll need to manually keep track of how much weight you're adding, since the individual plates are not labeled, and you're exceeding the labels of the cradle. That mental math might not be a deterrent for you, but it's something to note.The bottom lineIn most cases, the hassle and safety concerns outweigh the benefits. The primary advantage of the QuickDraws—quick, convenient weight changes—is totally undermined when manually adding plates.Investing in a higher-capacity adjustable dumbbell set (like 80- to 90-pound models) or supplementing with specific heavier fixed dumbbells for certain exercises might be safer and more practical. For serious lifters approaching the upper limits of their adjustable dumbbells, I'd recommend supplementing with individual heavier dumbbells. The Daily Ready to do everything better?
