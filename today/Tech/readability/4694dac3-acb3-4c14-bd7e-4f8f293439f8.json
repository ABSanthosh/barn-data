Its cast boasts an array of all-star actors over 60: Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, and Isabella Rossellini. And it follows the process of electing a new Pope. But the papal thriller has drawn an unlikely online fandom due to its modern mess and drama. It's inspired jokes, memes, and even fan edits. A fan captured the unlikely appeal of the movie by describing it as \"just Mean Girls for popes.\" One X user wrote, that Conclave \"is a 10/10 movie for gasping and gagging. movie version of the “hey girly” message. every time ralph finnes served diva the crowd gasped an a man blew raspberries. I’m a believer.\" Mashable Top Stories Another said, \"what if the pope DIED before letting you QUIT and you have to run the CONCLAVE while you were HAVING DOUBTS and the italian candidate was VAPING and FASCIST so you tried to vote for YOURSELF and you FELL DOWN.\" Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Fans also compared it to The Real Housewives franchise. One user captioned an image of two Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, \"This is exactly what Conclave is like.\" Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Others are experimenting with the new vocabulary of the Vatican. One user joked, \"i want to know what all the cardinals in conclave had chosen as their popenames.... i want to hear about the popesonas that never made it...\" Another wrote, \"(me asking my friends if they have time to see Conclave with me) what's your Conclavability this week.\" Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted Tweet may have been deleted But the most iconic Conclave post is the edit to Charli XCX's \"Sympathy is a Knife.\" If that doesn't convince you to see the film, just know you're missing out.
