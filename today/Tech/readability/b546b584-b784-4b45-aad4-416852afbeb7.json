Credit: Hanesh Mehta / EyeEm - Getty Images We hate mosquitoes, and so companies make a lot of anti-mosquito things: candles, wristbands, chemical and herbal sprays—even electronic devices. But if you want to keep mosquitoes off your bare skin this summer, you really just need two things: bug spray and a fan. The many alternatives either don’t work, or aren’t worth your time. Citronella candles aren’t significantly more effective than regular candles, which, as you might guess, don’t do much to ward off mosquitoes. Those light-up bug zappers aren’t helpful, because mosquitoes don’t care about light. Wristbands only keep mosquitoes off your wrists, so unless you’re weaving them into a full-body jumpsuit, they aren’t much help. You get the idea. I've explored these disappointing truths in more depth here.So what does work? Two things, one chemical and one not, which I'll explain below. It's also worth mentioning that you should make sure your yard isn't a mosquito breeding haven. Dump out or take steps to dry up their breeding places (like buckets and puddles) and consider setting up a \"bucket of doom\" trap. But when it comes to that evening where you'd like to hang out on your porch and need to control the mosquito population ASAP, here are the two things to do: Get a bug spray that actually works on mosquitoesFirst, bug spray. I know, you’re shocked. DEET really works, and so do picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus. If a mosquito repellent spray (especially a “natural” one) doesn’t have one of these ingredients, it’s probably no good. The easiest way to tell which products are legit without memorizing a list? Check the back of the label for an EPA registration number. DEET was the subject of some fearmongering in previous decades, but it's not actually a dangerous chemical—EPA reviews keep concluding that it's safe when used as directed. (Don't put it on your food or in open wounds, for example. But I hope you weren't going to anyway.) My favorite bug spray is Cutter Skinsations, which doesn't smell as nasty or feel as sticky as some of the more traditional bug sprays out there. It's 7% DEET, which is plenty for most backyard lounging and casual use—but you can buy stronger stuff for, say, camping in a swamp. What do you think so far? Set up a box fanSecond, a fan. If you’re hanging out on the porch and don’t want to spray anything on yourself—or if you did use the spray but they’re still flying around you and getting on your nerves—just set up a box fan. You can get one for about 20 bucks at a hardware store, which is less than you’d spend on, what, four mostly useless citronella candles? Mosquitoes are weak flyers, which is why they surround you when the air is stagnant and soupy. Set up a fan—or take advantage of a natural breeze—and you’ll keep them at bay.Besides these effective strategies, there are a couple more that I didn’t mention because they’re no-brainers: wear long sleeves and pants if you can stand them, and stay inside if you don’t need to be out. I know, those are no fun. So if you want to enjoy your porch beers in shorts and a tank top, get yourself some bug spray and plug in a fan. The Daily Ready to do everything better?
