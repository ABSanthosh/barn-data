  "text": "Good stuff rarely comes for free, yet, NordVPN is dangerously close to being free. This 74% discount that everyone blabbers about is live! You can save that much on ALL 2-year plans thanks to 3 free months, reducing the Basic plan to a tiny $2.99 a month. Not free – logically – but $2.99 a month can be afforded by pretty much anyone. Take advantage of the NordVPN promotion What Makes NordVPN’s 74% Off Deal So Special? What doesn’t? That’s a better-formulated question. NordVPN’s 2-year Basic plan is the name of the game here, and with this price, it packs so much that you won’t believe it. For example, you can enjoy over 6,500 servers in 111 countries; more than most providers. NordVPN offers special P2P servers, along with impeccable streaming abilities. Users who want to watch Netflix with a VPN for cheap will oblige. Furthermore, NordVPN’s features include a Double VPN, which helps encrypt your traffic twice. A no-log policy is standard here, while the NordLynx protocol ensures rocket-like speeds for all your activities. This time-limited deal provides you with 10 simultaneous connections too, and with apps for all devices, NordVPN can protect you from all angles. More Options (Plus \u0026 Complete) NordVPN’s package can be expanded if you opt for slightly pricier, yet still 74% discounted plans. The Plus plan sticks from the crowd as the most impressive, at $3.89/mo and only $105.03 for the first 27 months. That plan offers Threat Protection Pro that blocks malware, ads, and trackers. Another perk is NordPass which keeps your passwords safe and ready for use. The Complete plan is a special beast and at only $4.89/mo or $132.03 upfront, you even get NordLocker! NordLocker is an integral part of the bundle given its zero-knowledge encryption and the 1 TB of storage you get. While pCloud is a tad better, NordLocker is pretty close and offers impeccable security to preserve your files and prevent their loss. Trying NordVPN is Risk-Free Are you afraid of spending money on NordVPN and not liking it? We haven’t seen many people disliking NordVPN. Besides, you’ll spend only $2.99 a month, so it’s not like you’re losing a fortune. If that bothers you, NordVPN’s 30-day money-back guarantee is here. It allows you to test the waters, see how it functions, and decide if you want to keep using it. NordVPN’s fusion of security, privacy, ease of use, accessibility, speed, and reliability is paramount to success. That makes this VPN deal so ground-breaking for budget-oriented users.
