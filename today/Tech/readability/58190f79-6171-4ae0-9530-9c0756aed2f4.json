  "excerpt": "Today, we’re announcing Google’s first offshore wind power purchase agreement (PPA) in Taiwan — which represents our first in Asia Pacific.Google will purchase renewable energy from the Fengmiao I offshore wind project, developed by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. As the first project from Taiwan’s Round 3.1 auction to achieve financial close, it's an important catalyst for the local offshore wind sector. Once operational in 2027, the project will provide reliable power to support Google's data center, cloud region and offices in Taiwan.This milestone builds on our existing portfolio of energy technologies in Taiwan, including solar and geothermal, which provide reliable, cost-effective energy to meet rising demand and bring us closer to running on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) on every grid where we operate.",
