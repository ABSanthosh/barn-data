Read Full Bio  on May 13, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Airbnb's revamped app. Credit: Courtesy Airbnb At a celebrity-packed Tuesday press event in Los Angeles, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky announced a refreshed app for the home rental site, new curated \"Experiences,\" and the opportunity to book professional \"Services.\"Chesky began the media event by highlighting the humble beginnings of the stalwart rental site, which started in 2007 when he offered up his own San Francisco apartment to travelers seeking a place to stay. Beginning over a decade ago, Airbnb began to take off in popularity, attracting 272 million bookings in 2019 — but business, unsurprisingly, fell off a cliff with the COVID pandemic in 2020. Now, with travel picking back up and the website reaching profitability for the first time in 2022, Airbnb is working to diversify its current offerings of rentable homes and apartments. With the newly offered \"Services,\" travelers can use the relaunched Airbnb app to book catered meals, massages, makeup services, workouts, professional photography, and more. Airbnb \"Services\" are available in 260 cities, and anyone can book, even those not using Airbnb for temporary lodging. Similarly, \"Experiences\" are available to anyone and offer highly curated opportunities, like touring temples with a mystic in Peru or sipping mezcal with a sommelier in Mexico City. Airbnb is also launching \"Airbnb Originals,\" a new tier of Experiences, which Chesky described as \"extraordinary experiences hosted by the world's most interesting people.\" Some examples cited were learning to dance in Seoul with a K-Pop star, touring Note Dame with the architect who worked on its restoration, and performing with your own alter ego created with help by Megan the Stallion (who was in attendance at the launch, along with other celebrities like Doechii, Karlie Kloss, and too many influencers to count). Mashable Light Speed Jud Coplan, Vice President of Product Marketing at Airbnb, says Services and Experiences allow people to continue a relationship with Airbnb after a trip, by utilizing its offerings in their own home.The people behind Airbnb's Services and Experiences are carefully vetted, Coplan and Chesky attested. \"Services hosts have an average of 10 years of experience, have completed Airbnb’s identity verification process, and are required to submit relevant licenses and certifications,\" according to a press release. Airbnb sees Services and Experiences as offering new opportunities to its current hosts (including American hosts dealing with a drop in guests from Canada), where homeowners can expand their offerings with things like tours and catered meals. Interested hosts can apply to be part of Services and Experiences through Airbnb's website.Chesky also announced the Airbnb app's new features, which include easier access to booking Experiences and Services, expanded options for messaging and sharing photos with travel buddies, and a more elaborate calendar that allows trips to be synced with Google calendars. The app's new Profile section also allows travelers to quickly see all the places they've visited and contacts for Airbnb members they've interacted with on their journeys.
