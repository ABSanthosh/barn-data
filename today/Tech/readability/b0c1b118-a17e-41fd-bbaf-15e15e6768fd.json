  "text": "Get the snacks ready. Super Bowl LIX is nearly upon us, and it might feel like a bit of deja vu. Not only is it a rematch of last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, but the Chiefs are hoping to make this their third consecutive NFL championship. Here’s a fun fact you’ll surely hear a lot leading up to and during the game: No team since the 1965-1967 Green Bay Packers has won three consecutive Super Bowls. The Packers are the only NFL franchise to do it twice (1929-1931 and 1965-1967). But let’s be honest: Plenty of us are mainly watching the game for the commercials, despite knowing we will see fewer movie trailers this year. When Is the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl is Sunday, February 9, 2025. Kickoff is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. Where Is the Super Bowl? The Super Bowl LIX is happening at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, home to the New Orleans Saints. How Do I Watch the Super Bowl on TV? The Big Game is airing live on FOX (check local listings). Where Can I Stream the Super Bowl? The FOX broadcast can be streamed on the following apps: Tubi (this is free and is the official streaming partner) Hulu with Live TV DirecTV Sling TV YouTube TV Fubo Tubi is free, but you have to sign up for an account to log in and watch the game. The other streaming platforms offer free trials; remember to cancel your subscription when the trial ends if you don’t want to pay. The game will not be streaming on the Fox Sports app, and there will be no kids’ broadcast this year. So, if you were looking forward to hearing SpongeBob and Patrick call the game, you’re out of luck. Can I Watch the Super Bowl for Free? You can watch the Super Bowl for free on the Tubi, though you’ll have to check if the app is available on your smart TV. If you really want to avoid signing up for cable or another streaming app, you could pick up an over-the-air antenna to pick the signal up for free. Just make sure it carries your local FOX affiliate and tune into that channel. Who’s Performing in the Super Bowl Halftime Show? Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winner Kendrick Lamar will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show. Fellow Grammy winner SZA is joining Lamar on the big stage. Catch @KendrickLamar with guest @SZA. #AppleMusicHalftime #SBLIX@AppleMusic @RocNation @pgLang @NFLonFOXpic.twitter.com/97EeiP1Pix — NFL (@NFL) January 23, 2025 Will Taylor Swift Be at the Super Bowl? Seems like it! We are seeing a rise in Swift-related prop bets on various betting sites about who the mega-star will sit next to and how many times we will see her face during the game.",
