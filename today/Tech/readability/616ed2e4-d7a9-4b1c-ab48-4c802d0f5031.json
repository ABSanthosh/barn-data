New York Comic Con is later this week and, as one would expect, artists and brands have all sorts of awesome exclusives coming to the event. Sure, there will be all sorts of toys, games, and collectibles at the con—but we gravitate to the limited-edition art. And, just to give you a taste of what’s in store, we’ve pulled together a few of our favorites. First up, artist Truck Torrence, aka 100% Soft, brings his unique artistic style to the world of Spider-Man. In this brand new, 24 x 36 inch screenprint, we get to see Spidey take on all of his most famous villains—everyone from Sandman and Rhino to Green Goblin, Venom, and even J. Jonah Jameson. Can you spot them all? The full Spider-Man poster by 100% Soft. “Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, and his Rogue’s Gallery is, in my opinion, the best set of villains out there,”  Torrence told io9. “I wanted to create a print that pays tribute to both them and Spider-Man as a uniquely New York hero.” The print is a run of 200 and costs $60. It’s available at booth 1665 along with some super cool and cute new, exclusive Dumpster Fires. Read about them all here. Another one of our favorite artists, Jason Edmiston, is bringing his usual excellent array of new art to the convention and you can see it all at booth 2058. We aren’t going to highlight them all but here are just a few standouts. First, Edmiston tackles one of the year’s best genre films, The Substance. “Pump It Up” is an edition of 75 and costs $25. Sue from The Substance by Jason Edmiston Released as part of the show, but available online, is the eighth wonder of the world himself: King Kong. 8th Wonder of the World is being released as a signed and numbered timed edition for $250 either at the booth or on Edmiston’s website. It’s as big as Kong too, measuring a whopping 56 x 24 inches. King Kong by Jason Edmistion Those are some of our favorite individual artists, but what about galleries? Spoke Art has a ton of awesome stuff coming to booth 1481 but here’s just one… Godzilla by Matt Taylor. Find out about this print and more at this link. Godzilla by Matt Taylor – Spoke Art And while we don’t love to talk about Mondo much after what Funko did to the company, I can’t deny that this Goonies poster by Dan Hipp is simply incredible. The 18 x 24 inch print in an edition of 165 costs $60 and it’s available at booth 1000 along with a ton of other stuff. See that here.  The Goonies by Dan Hipp – Mondo Again, that’s just a small taste of what you’ll find on the floor at New York Comic Con this weekend. It’s at the Javits Center in NYC from October 17-20. Keep an eye on io9 for more coverage. Want more io9 news?
