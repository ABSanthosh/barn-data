  "description": "Senator Josh Hawley has introduced a bill that would criminalize the import, export, and collaboration on AI technology with China. What this means is that \"someone who knowingly downloads a Chinese developed AI model like the now immensely popular DeepSeek could face up to 20 years in jail, a million dollar fine, or both, should such a law pass,\" reports 404 Media. From the report: Hawley introduced the legislation, titled the Decoupling America's Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, on Wednesday of last year. \"Every dollar and gig of data that flows into Chinese AI are dollars and data that will ultimately be used against the United States,\" Senator Hawley said in a statement. \"America cannot afford to empower our greatest adversary at the expense of our own strength. Ensuring American economic superiority means cutting China off from American ingenuity and halting the subsidization of CCP innovation.\" Hawley's statement explicitly says that he introduced the legislation because of the release of DeepSeek, an advanced AI model that's competitive with its American counterparts, and which its developers claimed was made for a fraction of the cost and without access to as many and as advanced of chips, though these claims are unverified. Hawley's statement called DeepSeek \"a data-harvesting, low-cost AI model that sparked international concern and sent American technology stocks plummeting.\" Hawley's statement says the goal of the bill is to \"prohibit the import from or export to China of artificial intelligence technology, \"prohibit American companies from conducting AI research in China or in cooperation with Chinese companies,\" and \"Prohibit U.S. companies from investing money in Chinese AI development.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
