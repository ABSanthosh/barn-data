  "text": "Cue your oohs and aahs, because Lego is giving fans a first look at its upcoming San Diego Comic-Con displays. When visitors step into the Lego booth, they'll find a brick-built model of the convention floor, along with sneak peeks at new Lego-fied products for Wicked, Stranger Things, DC's Batman and the Nintendo Game Boy.

Prices will range from $20 to $160. Here's a taste of what's coming ahead of the film hitting theaters in November: Here are four of the six upcoming Lego sets with the Wicked movie theme.  LegoLego and Netflix are also taking us back to the Upside Down before Stranger Things returns for its final season later this year.
