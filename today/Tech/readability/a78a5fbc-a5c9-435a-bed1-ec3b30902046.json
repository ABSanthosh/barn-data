  "description": "The U.S. and China \"are racing to build a truly useful humanoid worker,\" the Wall Street Journal wrote Saturday, adding that \"Whoever wins could gain a huge edge in countless industries.\" \"The time has come for robots,\" Nvidia's chief executive said at a conference in March, adding \"This could very well be the largest industry of all.\" China's government has said it wants the country to be a world leader in humanoid robots by 2027. \"Embodied\" AI is listed as a priority of a new $138 billion state venture investment fund, encouraging private-sector investors and companies to pile into the business. It looks like the beginning of a familiar tale. Chinese companies make most of the world's EVs, ships and solar panels — in each case, propelled by government subsidies and friendly regulations. \"They have more companies developing humanoids and more government support than anyone else. So, right now, they may have an edge,\" said Jeff Burnstein [president of the Association for Advancing Automation, a trade group in Ann Arbor, Michigan].... Humanoid robots need three-dimensional data to understand physics, and much of it has to be created from scratch. That is where China has a distinct edge: The country is home to an immense number of factories where humanoid robots can absorb data about the world while performing tasks. \"The reason why China is making rapid progress today is because we are combining it with actual applications and iterating and improving rapidly in real scenarios,\" said Cheng Yuhang, a sales director with Deep Robotics, one of China's robot startups. \"This is something the U.S. can't match.\" UBTech, the startup that is training humanoid robots to sort and carry auto parts, has partnerships with top Chinese automakers including Geely... \"A problem can be solved in a month in the lab, but it may only take days in a real environment,\" said a manager at UBTech... With China's manufacturing prowess, a locally built robot could eventually cost less than half as much as one built elsewhere, said Ming Hsun Lee, a Bank of America analyst. He said he based his estimates on China's electric-vehicle industry, which has grown rapidly to account for roughly 70% of global EV production. \"I think humanoid robots will be another EV industry for China,\" he said. The UBTech robot system, called Walker S, currently costs hundreds of thousands of dollars including software, according to people close to the company. UBTech plans to deliver 500 to 1,000 of its Walker S robots to clients this year, including the Apple supplier Foxconn. It hopes to increase deliveries to more than 10,000 in 2027. Few companies outside China have started selling AI-powered humanoid robots. Industry insiders expect the competition to play out over decades, as the robots tackle more-complicated environments, such as private homes. The article notes \"several\" U.S. humanoid robot producers, including the startup Figure. And robots from Amazon's Agility Robotics have been tested in Amazon warehouses since 2023. \"The U.S. still has advantages in semiconductors, software and some precision components,\" the article points out. But \"Some lawmakers have urged the White House to ban Chinese humanoids from the U.S. and further restrict Chinese robot makers' access to American technology, citing national-security concerns...\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
