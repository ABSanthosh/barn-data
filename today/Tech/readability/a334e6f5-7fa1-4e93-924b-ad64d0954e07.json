  "text": "Venom: The Last Dance might be exactly that for this version of the character—but, surely, Venom will live on. The film’s ending and end-credits scenes hint at where things might go in the future and, with the film now in theaters, it’s time to talk all about it. Major spoilers are below. In the film’s big finale, Venom detaches himself from Eddie and dies, along with all the evil xenophages sent by Knull to secure the codex the pair are holding. With one of them (in this case Venom) dying, the codex once again goes away and keeps Knull in his unbreakable symbiote prison. Eddie then goes to New York, as per their plan, and that’s that. Or is it? We very clearly see that Juno Temple’s character Dr. Teddy Payne survives and she still has a symbiote in her. The movie kind of explains the reason Venom and Eddie hold the codex is because Venom used his powers to bring Eddie back to life, which was the key to unlocking this special codex. So, with a human and symbiote still together, there’s the potential of a resurrection, and thereby a codex still exists. That gives hope to Knull, leading into that first end-credit scene. The first end-credit scene shows Knull still in prison, promising to get out and that the “world will burn.” He then looks up, revealing his scary and menacing face. Basically, the scene says even though Venom: The Last Dance introduced this supervillain without really using him, he’s still on the table and maybe we’ll see him again in the future. That’s then followed by the film’s second end-credit scene, which shows Cristo Fernández’s bartender character escaping Area 55 after the battle. Earlier in the movie, this universe’s version of the character was taken into custody but that story never wraps up. Here it does, but not before we also see a piece of symbiote potentially going into a cockroach. Is that how Venom will survive? Seems like a possibility. Basically, The Last Dance feels like the last dance for Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock but in the infinite Marvel multiverse, there are still symbiotes, still humans linked to symbiotes, and still an evil being that can control or destroy any of it. Personally, I didn’t find the above teases that compelling. The best part of Venom: The Last Dance‘s ending is the “Memories” by Maroon 5 montage showing Eddie reminiscing about all the good times with Venom. It’s a surprising, touching, and satisfying conclusion for this version of the character, one that is unlikely to be topped moving forward, even with all the loose ends. What do you think about the ending and end credits of Venom: The Last Dance? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?
