  "text": "Echoing the conclusion of My Hero Academia‘s manga, which ended in August, its anime adaptation by Studio Bones is set to broadcast its final season in 2025. According to Screen Rant, the latest edition of Weekly Shonen Jump included a special pamphlet which revealed that My Hero Academia will end sometime next year. This news comes as no surprise to folks who’ve been following the manga, considering the anime’s seventh season is nearing the source material’s final stretch. Although the pamphlet, which has done the rounds on social media via anime enthusiast accounts, doesn’t specify when My Hero Academia‘s final season will air, IGN posits that it may come in the fall anime season. However, nothing on this front has been made official. My Hero Academia, originally created by Kohei Horikoshi, began serialization in 2016. It follows Deku, a powerless high schooler as he inherits an all-powerful “quirk” from All Might—its mythos’ Superman. Since the debut of its manga, My Hero Academia has become a worldwide anime phenomenon that even garnered a couple of arena fighter video games in the stylings of the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series. Its manga, which concluded in an even 430 chapters, earned props from Eiichiro Oda, creator of the long-running One Piece, who paid tribute to the series’ conclusion by redrawing fan art Horikoshi drew of Smoker before he ventured into making MHA. If that’s not a perfect parallel for Deku and All Might’s mentor-student relationship, I don’t know what is. In other, likely less enthusiastic MHA news, fans also have the Netflix live-action movie looming over the horizon as well. Kenobi executive producer Joby Harold is set to write the film’s screenplay. In case that doesn’t instill confidence, the film will also mark the directorial debut of Shinsuke Sato, whose previous works include the live-action anime adaptations of Inuyashiki and I Am A Hero. So at least we know it’s not Sato’s first rodeo. If any of the above or Overwatch 2‘s collab with the anime have raised your nerves on MHA ending on multiple fronts, I recommend checking out Horikoshi’s recently released one-shot manga, A Piece of Cake. Not only does it act as a neat tie-in to You’re Next, it also retroactively adds a thematic cherry on top of the manga’s ending. Want more io9 news?
