  "description": "Hades II announced its third update today. The sequel to 2020 indie game darling Hades is technically still in early access on PC and Mac, but has been getting some beefy updates ahead of its expected official release later this year. The Unseen Update is a free, automatic update that mostly focuses on new combat development. There's a new Vow of Rivals that allows players to challenge more powerful Guardian foes. All of the main weapons have received hidden aspects that offer new forms and fighting styles. There's also new hexes and blessings, some fresh artwork, and new story events to help grow your relationships with the many members of the ancient Greek pantheon. When Hades II does exit early access with the launch of v1.0 — and developer Supergiant said that it doesn't have a timeline for that yet — the game will follow its predecessor's launch schedule. Switch 2 and Switch will be the first consoles to get the full release alongside PC and Mac, with PlayStation and Xbox players needing to wait before they'll get a version of the rogue-like.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hades-ii-adds-more-combat-options-in-its-third-major-early-access-update-225206452.html?src=rss",
