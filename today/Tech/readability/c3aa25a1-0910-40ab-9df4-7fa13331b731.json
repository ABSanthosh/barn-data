  "description": "The \"Chief People Officer\" of dataops company Astronomer resigned this week from her position after apparently being caught on that \"Kiss Cam\" at a Coldplay concert with the company's CEO, reports the BBC. That CEO has also resigned, with Astronomer appointing their original co-founder and chief product officer as the new interim CEO. UPDATE (7/26): In an unexpected twist, Astronomer put out a new video Friday night starring... Gwyneth Paltrow. Actress/businesswoman Paltrow \"was married to Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin for 13 years,\" reports CBS News. In the video posted Friday, Paltrow says she was hired by Astronomer as a \"very temporary\" spokesperson. \"Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days,\" Paltrow begins, \"and they wanted me to answer the most common ones...\" As the question \"OMG! What the actual f\" begins appearing on the screen, Paltrow responds \"Yes, Astronomer is the best place to run Apache Airflow, unifying the experience of running data, ML, and AI pipelines at scale. We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.\" (Paltrow also mentions the company's upcoming Beyond Analytics dataops conference in September.) Astronomer is still grappling with unintended fame after the \"Kiss Cam\" incident. (\"Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,\" Coldplay's lead singer had said during the viral video, in which the startled couple hurries to hide off-camera). The incident raised privacy concerns, as it turns out both people in the video were in fact married to someone else, though the singer did earlier warn the crowd \"we're going to use our cameras and put some of you on the big screen,\" according to CNN. The New York Post notes the woman's now-deleted LinkedIn account showed that she has also served as an \"advisory board member\" at her husband's company since September of 2020. The Post cites a source close to the situation who says the woman's husband \"was in Asia for a few weeks,\" returning to America right as the video went viral. Kristin and Andrew Cabot married sometime after her previous divorce was finalized in 2022. The source said there had been little indication of any trouble in paradise before the Coldplay concert video went viral. \"The family is now saying they have been having marriage troubles for several months and were discussing separating...\" The video had racked up 127 million videos by yesterday, notes Newsweek, adding that the U.K. tabloid the Daily Mail apparently took photos outside the woman's house, reporting that she does not appear to be wearing a wedding ring.
