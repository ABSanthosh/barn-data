And to do that, we’ll need the right policy frameworks to secure America’s position as an AI powerhouse and support a new era of opportunity.We share some ideas on that front in our response to the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Request for Information.Our response recommends focusing on three key areas:Invest in AI. The federal and local governments should work together on policy reforms to address surging energy needs, an essential part of expanding AI infrastructure. We also need export controls that both protect our national security and enable America to export and provide AI services in foreign markets. American scientists need access to computational resources for research, which means forging new advanced partnerships with national labs. And the federal government should embrace policy frameworks that preserve access to data for fair learning, advance a risk-based approach to AI applications based on existing regulations, and preempt a chaotic patchwork of state-level rules on frontier AI development.Accelerate and modernize government AI adoption. The government should lead by example in AI adoption and deployment. Ideas include implementing multi-vendor, interoperable AI solutions and streamlining procurement procedures for AI and other emerging technologies.Promote pro-innovation approaches internationally. The federal government should champion market-driven and widely adopted technical standards by building on the Commerce Department’s leading role with the International Standards Organization and other standard-setting organizations. Working with industry partners and aligned countries, we should also develop protocols and benchmarks around potential risks of frontier AI systems. Finally, the Administration can support American AI leadership by combatting restrictive foreign AI barriers.As Vice President Vance said earlier this year in Paris, now is our chance to “catch lightning in a bottle.” AI gives us an opportunity to improve the lives of people everywhere — we have a responsibility to not let that opportunity slip through our fingers. Make no mistake: Policy decisions will shape the outcome of the current global AI competition. A pro-innovation approach that protects national security and enables widespread benefits will help us realize AI’s transformative potential and ensure that America’s lead endures. Google is committed to doing its part, including by working with the federal government to ensure the success of the AI Action Plan.",
