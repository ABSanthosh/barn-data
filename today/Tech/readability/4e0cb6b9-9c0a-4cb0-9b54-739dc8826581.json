  "text": "Two months after it hit theaters, Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim is making its way to Max on Friday, February 28. Per Deadline, the anime film will come to Warner Bros.’ streaming service ahead of its broadcast debut on Saturday, March 1. When it came out, Rohirrim pretty much got buried by other, bigger movies, it made $20 million worldwide at the box office. Two weeks after it hit theaters, it was already available on various digital platforms, and it recently hit Blu-Ray and DVD with (apparently) not much fanfare. So if you’ve had an interest in it but didn’t want to spend money to see it, here’s your chance. Directed by Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex’s Kenji Kamiyama, War of the Rohirrim is set nearly 200 years before the Lord of the Rings film trilogy and stars Gaia Wise as Héra, the daughter of Rohan’s then-king, Helm Hammerhand (Brian Cox). After Helm accidentally kills the lord of the neighboring Dunlendings, a war breaks out between the two kingdoms that pits Héra against her would-be bethroed, Wulf (Luke Pasqualiano). Reviews for it—including our own—were fairly mixed, with many appreciating the scale, but underwhelmed by its animation and story, which is based on the appendices of J.R.R. Tolkein’s works. This may not have lit the world on fire, but maybe it’ll turn out to be a hidden gem when you see it. And if Rohirrim’s not to your liking, there’s other Rings media to look forward to: Rings of Power is coming back for a third season on Prime Video, and WB’s still got that Gollum spinoff movie it’s doing.
