  "text": "The surviving Nublar Five escape to Europe in the aftermath of finding out their former friend Brooklynn has now joined the bad guys in dealing with even more dinosaur danger in the next chapter of Netflix and Amblin’s animated Jurassic World franchise. In the trailer for Jurassic World: Chaos Theory, we reunite with the core group as they continue on their adventures in saving dinosaurs from corrupt hands. Castmembers Paul-Mikél Williams (Darius), Sean Giambrone (Ben), Darren Barnet as (Kenji), Raini Rodriguez (Sammy), Kausar Mohammed (Yasmina), and Kiersten Kelly (Brooklynn) return to reprise their roles. This time the Nublar Five’s current mission takes them to Italy, where they join up with new friends including Ben’s totally real girlfriend Gia, played by Beatrice Grannò, and Isabella Rossellini (yes, that one) as Nonna. Seeing these kids grow up over the course of both series has been a blast and the way the show has never pulled any punches with dino horror and tragic themes makes it such an underrated gem in the Jurassic canon.  It’s definitely been more engaging, exciting, and memorable than the recent live-action trilogy and we’re so happy it’s back for more. The kids trace Brooklynn’s journey into the world of dinosaur trafficking, where she might be getting in too deep to stay a double agent while her friends attempt to reach out to her. And really, they’re not kids anymore—and having the events of the films be used as a backdrop to this dark coming-of-age story has always worked really well in upping the stakes. Every season is so good and just builds from camp friendship forged during the Jurassic World opening era to its destruction, when the kids got castaway’d into young adulthood. Now, they’re doing their best to cope with the responsibility they feel to keep each other and dinosaurs safe. It makes sense their experiences activated their drive to protect the dinos from those who seek to exploit them, though it seems one of them might have since taken up with the wrong cause. It appears this season catches up to the events of the last film with the scene that features those very large prehistoric bugs Dr. Sattler and co. had trouble controlling in Jurassic World Dominion. And who knows, it might tie into the events of the upcoming Jurassic World Rebirth. We’ll keep hoping the kids will show up as live-action characters in the films. Tune in on April 3 for Jurassic World: Chaos Theory season three only on Netflix. Want more io9 news?
