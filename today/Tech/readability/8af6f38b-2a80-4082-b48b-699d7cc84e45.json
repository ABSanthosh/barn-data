Here are some considerations to keep in mind.Co-sleepingTwin-size mattresses are the most affordable but also the smallest bed models. If you are considering co-sleeping on a twin-size mattress, consider opting for at least a full-size instead.ConstructionYou don't have to compromise comfort or quality to buy an affordable twin-size mattress. I recommend buying a mattress thicker than 6 inches unless you're buying one for your small child of ten years or younger. Luckily, plenty of options within that range are easy on your wallet.FirmnessIf you're looking to buy a twin mattress for yourself, consider your sleeping position. Side sleepers fare better on softer beds, while back and stomach sleepers typically prefer firm mattresses. Consider a soft model if you're buying a twin-size mattress for your child. The smaller you are, the firmer a mattress tends to feel. Kids also tend to like a lighter, plusher feel. If you're searching for a twin-size mattress for your guest bedroom, consider a model with a medium firmness level. This accommodates anyone who decides to stay, from your side-sleeping Aunt Kathy to your back-sleeping and snoring Grandpa Joe.PriceOf course, budget will play a significant role in the mattress you end up purchasing. The average twin-size mattress price tag ranges from $800 to $1,200, but plenty of great options are below that price point. Determining your budget first will help narrow down the best picks for you -- and you don't necessarily have to sacrifice comfort or quality when purchasing a cheaper bed. For example, our best overall twin-size mattress choice costs less than $400.",
