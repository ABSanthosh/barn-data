  "description": "Computex 2025 is approaching, and it’s sure to bring a ton of announcements about the latest chips, laptops, gaming devices and more from leading brands. The event in Taipei will kick off on Monday, May 19 with a keynote from NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at the Taipei Music Center. There will be a livestream for anyone not attending in person, so you can watch along on the Computex website or YouTube channel. Huang’s keynote is scheduled for 11PM ET/ 8PM PT on May 18 (11AM on May 19 in Taiwan Time), and we can expect to hear all about the company's developments in the AI space. It’ll be followed that same day by a keynote from Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. Computex this year will, perhaps unsurprisingly, focus heavily on AI, with the overall theme being “AI Next.” It’ll also highlight products in three categories: AI \u0026 Robotics, Next-Gen Tech and Future Mobility. An estimated 1,400 exhibitors will be in attendance, including ASUS, Acer and AMD, all of which have previously made big announcements at the annual expo. Computex 2025 will run from May 20 to May 23.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-deliver-the-computex-2025-keynote-205326521.html?src=rss",
