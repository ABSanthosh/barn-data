Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in fusion energy this year, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s booming defence tech arena.  Europe’s defence tech startups secured $971mn in funding in the first half of this year, as VCs look to capitalise on the continent’s push to rearm amid heightened geopolitical tensions.  Funding in H1 2025 has already shot past the whole of 2024 — the previous record year — which saw defence startups raise $605mn, according to Dealroom data. German startups led the charge, raising $881mn — 90% of Europe’s total defence tech investments.  Munich-based Helsing took the lion’s share. In June, the startup secured a whopping €600mn ($660mn) in Europe’s largest funding round of the year so far. The deal, led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s VC firm Prima Materia, valued Helsing at €12bn ($13.2bn), making it one of the continent’s most valuable private companies.

Its tech has been integrated into battlefield simulations, electronic warfare for fighter jets, and drones in Ukraine. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomous reconnaissance submarines to boost Europe’s maritime defences.

The drones can also be used by farmers to inspect their crops, by energy companies to check power lines, and by search and rescue teams to look for survivors.   Quantum Systems’s Vector AI drone.

The round came shortly after ARX announced plans to invest £45mn ($58mn) into a new UK factory.  ARX’s machines drive around on treads and can be fitted with equipment such as radar, mine-sweeping devices, or medical stretchers.

The company is developing military simulation tech for the British Army and NATO. Another German business also got a big funding boost: Swarm Biotactics. The startup raised €10mn ($11mn) to advance its unusual biorobotic system, which equips live cockroaches with sensors to monitor extreme environments.  Swarm Biotactics is developing backpacks for cockroaches that allow you to control them remotely and gather data from hard-to-access locations.
