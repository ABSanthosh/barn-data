Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Dollar Flight Club Getting a premium economy or business class seat for the price of economy sounds like a fantasy, but that’s what the Dollar Flight Club Premium+ Plan helps you do: This subscription service does the heavy lifting of hunting down the best flight deals and sending them to your inbox. Usually, a year of DFC Premium+ costs $99.99, but right now, new users can get it for just $29.99 on StackSocial. That’s a solid discount—unless, of course, you already have an account (in which case, no dice). Also, you have to redeem your code within 30 days of buying, and after your discounted year, the membership renews at full price automatically. If you’re okay with that (or plan to cancel before renewal), you could lock in some serious travel savings with this deal.With a Premium Plus+ membership, you get access to discounted fares across Economy, Premium Economy, and Business Class, meaning there’s a chance you could score a lie-flat seat to Europe for the price of an economy ticket. You’ll also get alerts for domestic and international mistake fares (those rare but amazing airline pricing errors), plus exclusive deals not available online, since DFC works directly with airlines. On top of that, members also get discounts on travel perks like Priority Pass and TSA PreCheck. Before you get too excited, though, keep in mind that Dollar Flight Club currently only covers members in North \u0026 South America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.If you travel frequently or have a bucket list trip in mind, this subscription might be an easy way to catch mistake fares, last-minute deals, and discounts on flights—sometimes up to 90% off. Just set your home airports, pick your ideal destinations, and let Dollar Flight Club scour the internet for the best fares. And unlike generic flight deal newsletters, this service tailors alerts to your preferences (departure airports and destinations), so you won’t waste time on irrelevant deals.
