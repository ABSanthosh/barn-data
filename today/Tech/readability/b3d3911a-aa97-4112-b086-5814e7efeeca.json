Experts and teachers have argued that phones distract students from learning and socializing. Credit: Thomas Barwick / Digital Vision / Getty Images Watch out, teens and tweens: A majority of adults want cellphones out of the classroom, according to a new poll. The recent Pew Research Center survey of 5,110 U.S. adults found that 68 percent backed a ban on middle and high school students using a cellphone in the classroom. Twenty-four percent of respondents opposed the idea while 8 percent were unsure. When asked to identify why they supported a ban, participants said they thought students would develop better social skills and be less likely to cheat, as a result. They also think such a ban could reduce school bullying. But they drew the line at a more restrictive approach. Only roughly a third of the respondents favored blocking phone access for the entire day, not just in the classroom, while more than half opposed it. The survey findings may inform the ongoing struggle over the role of technology and internet-connected devices in the classroom. Educators and their unions have long argued that phones and constant access to social media platforms distracts students, enables bullying, and burns teachers out. School districts have even sued technology companies, including Meta and TikTok, arguing that they don't sufficiently warn young users of the risks of using their platforms. Mashable Top Stories Adults surveyed by Pew who oppose any kind of ban overwhelmingly cite concern about parents being able to reach their child when needed. They also believe the rule would be too hard for teachers to enforce, and that cellphones can be a useful teaching tool. Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone-Free Schools Movement, told Mashable in an email that the organization backs a day-long phone-free policy in order to offer students and teachers the \"most benefits.\" Whitman said placing phones in a storage tool, like a phone locker or in baskets secured in the school office, can further reduce cyberbullying, social media conflict, and poor face-to-face engagement with peers. Some school districts and state governments have already moved toward different types of bans. California recently passed legislation requiring school districts to develop a policy for restricting phone use at school by 2026. Florida banned phone use in the classroom this school year. Louisiana is poised to prohibit students from using and possessing a cellphone for the entire day, starting in the 2024-2025 school year. The Pew survey did find more resistance to the idea of a ban from younger adults. Less than half of survey respondents under the age of 30 support restrictions on cellphones in the classroom, whereas more than three quarters of adults ages 30 to 49 favor them. That percentage rises to 80 percent among participants ages 50 and older. Whitman said that students \"deserve\" phone-free schools so they can focus and engage with students and peers. \"This means loud lunch rooms and more students participating in afterschool activities, which creates community and greater sense of belonging,\" Whitman wrote in an email. \"Don't we want this for all kids?\" UPDATE: Oct. 14, 2024, 2:33 p.m. EDT This story has been updated to include comment from Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone-Free Schools Movement.
