After Lando Norris edged out Max Verstappen at the Australian GP, everyone’s eager to see if he can repeat the result. Luckily, you don’t have to spend a cent to watch the F1 Chinese Grand Prix online. You can catch the free stream on ServusTV (from Austria) or SRF (from Switzerland). Both channels are 100% free and don’t even require an account to work. While they’re not in English, at least, you’ll be able to catch up with the event in Full HD. You can learn more about watching all F1 races for free here. How to Watch F1 Chinese GP on Free Channels? ServusTV and SRF are licensed to broadcast within their respective countries. This means being outside Austria or Switzerland will produce an error message. Here’s what happens when you try to watch Servus TV: © ServusTV Since it’s a foreign TV channel in your case, it’s inaccessible. ServusTV and SRF have an IP-detection system, which enforces the geo-restriction. If the IP address is outside Austria or Switzerland, ServusTV and SRF will be unavailable respectively. The goal is to, therefore, claim an IP address from one of these countries and watch the F1 Chinese GP on a free channel. People online frequently mention NordVPN as their choice. Watch the Chinese GP Online With NordVPN This VPN has hundreds of servers in Austria and Switzerland. It also comes with unlimited bandwidth for streaming, excellent speeds, and apps for all devices. The latter is especially praised by VPN users. Ths allows for cathing up with the free live stream of the F1 Chinese Grand Prix on phones and tablets, for example. NordVPN is risk-free, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee. ServusTV broadcasts F1 Shanghai GP for free © ServusTV Thus, people just need to subscribe, set up the VPN, and connect to a server. Once they finish watching the F1 Shanghai GP on a free channel, they can get a full refund, thereby not losing a single cent. F1 China GP Race Weekend Schedule Whether you’re looking to stream just the main event or those that come before, you must be acquainted with the schedule. You can watch the F1 China Grand Prix live stream from the 21st to the 23rd of March, 2025. The schedule is as follows: Practice 1 – 21st of March, 11:30 to 12:30 (GMT+8) Sprint Qualifying – 21st of March, 15:30 to 16:15 (GMT+8) Sprint Race – 22nd of March, 11:00 to 12:00 (GMT+8) Qualifying – 22nd of March, 15:00 to 16:00 (GMT+8) Race – 23rd of March, 15:00 (GMT+8) Shanghai International Circuit Information © formula1.com We can see that the main event is on the 23rd of March. All times are GMT+8, so make sure you “adapt” them to your local time zone. You can also refer to the official F1 website for exact times based on your location. Should I Just Pay for the Livestream? If the free TV channels we mentioned aren’t your bag of beans, you can always opt for a premium streaming service. In a recent post, we explained how to watch Sky Sports in the US and the way a VPN helps. However, if you’re paying for the VPN in the first place, it’s much better to watch the F1 Chinese Grand Prix on a free channel. Otherwise, you’ll spend money on the VPN plus the selected streaming service. We must warn you that streaming services usually don’t have a money-back guarantee, so there’s no refund option. They’re expensive, as well (up to $85/mo). Such services are also region-locked, which, as stated, begs for the use of a VPN. With the method we explained, you can join thousands of racing fans globally and enjoy bombastic Grand Prix races from all over the world. By the way, the same trick works for streaming MotoGP races anywhere for free. Try NordVPN risk-free today Daily Newsletter",
