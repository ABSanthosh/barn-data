Read Full Bio  on July 4, 2025 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Flipboard Are they worth $299? Credit: Nothing What if you could get a really good pair of over-ear headphones that didn't cost more than $400?That's the question Nothing, a UK-based tech startup, is trying to answer with the new Nothing Headphone (1) headphones, just unveiled this week. A bunch of tech publications got to try out the new headphones prior to their reveal and launch, meaning there are now a good number of reviews available out there for folks interested in potentially getting this $299 pair of over-ear cans. Nothing Headphone (1) priceWhat did the critics have to say about these new headphones? For starters, many agree that they're a great value at $299. The closest points of comparison in terms of features and audio quality are things like the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and the Apple AirPods Max, both of which retail for well over $400. From that perspective, Nothing is already at an advantage. But what about everything else?The designFor starters, these headphones have kind of a funky design that might turn off some customers, but might appeal to others. They have big, rectangular cases for the ear cups, and they only come in two colors: white and black. Ben Schoon summed it up nicely in 9to5Google's review:\"Nothing’s design here is unique, to say the least. The partially square, partially rounded design gives off cassette tape vibes, which I rather like,\" Schoon wrote. Pretty much every other review I read aligned with that viewpoint. Whether you personally are into the design or not, Nothing deserves some credit for trying something. Mashable Light Speed Matt Bolton, meanwhile, made sure to emphasize in TechRadar's review that the headphones are comfortable for long sessions, regardless of how they look.\"This fit will also be a little divisive – some people really prefer just a lighter-weight headphone that doesn't need to grip so much – but I found them more comfortable than the AirPods Max, and fine to wear for a good stretch of time,\" Bolton wrote. The soundThis is the tricky part. Little else, not design, comfort, or active noise cancelation features, matters more than the sound quality when it comes to headphones. Unfortunately, it's pretty broadly agreed in most reviews I read that this is one area where the price difference between Headphone (1) and its closest competition manifests.That's not to say the sound is bad, though. In James Pero's review for Gizmodo, he praised the quality of the noise cancelation and the audio output in general. It may not be quite at the level of AirPods Max, but there's a $250 price difference between the two, so that's probably to be expected. \"I still think Apple’s AirPods Max have a slight edge in the sound department — mid-to-highs just have slightly more texture and room, which makes vocals feel more organic and clear,\" Pero wrote. \"That being said, Nothing holds its own against a competitor that charges a very hefty premium.\"Bolton, on the other hand, was more critical in his review for TechRadar.\"The audio is tuned by the great hi-fi brand KEF, and is reasonably refined, well-balanced, and broadly enjoyable,\" Bolton wrote. \"But it also feels compressed, and lacks the openness and expansive sound I'm used to from testing the competition at this price.\"The battery lifeFor $300, you'd expect good battery life out of a pair of headphones. It sounds like Nothing delivered in that department. Schoon said in his 9to5Google review that the batteries lasted 35 hours with ANC turned on and 80 without it. My goodness, that's pretty darn good. Based on these reviews, it sounds like Nothing's first over-ear headphones are solid, at worst. You may have to deal with slightly worse audio quality than some of the more expensive models, and you may not like the design, but they seem like a good value where it counts.
