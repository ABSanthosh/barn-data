  "text": "See more content from your favorite sites, pick up where you left off and more. When you're searching, staying up to date with your personal interests and favorite sites is top of mind. While our systems aim to automatically bring you the most helpful results, what's relevant for you might be different from someone else who's using Search. Whether you want to quickly pick up where you left off, shop your personal style, catch up on your local news or get the latest from your favorite sports team, here are some of the ways you can have a more customized Search experience and find the information you're looking for.Start with a new experiment in Labs, then explore options that we’ve long offered in Search — and that people still find helpful today. Your personalization experience on Search is always in your control and you can adjust your settings at any time.1. New: See more content from your favorite sitesWith a new “Preferred Sources” experiment in Labs (available in English in the U.S. and India), you can now choose to see more results in Top Stories from the sites you love, whether that’s your favorite sports blog or local newspaper. If you opt in to the experiment, you can tap the starred icon to the right of the Top Stories header. Then, you’ll have the option to select your preferred sources (if a site is publishing fresh content). You’ll start to see more of the latest updates from your selected sites in Top Stories when they have new articles or posts that are relevant to your search. Your sources will be clearly labeled and will appear in addition to other results in Top Stories, so you can see what your favorite sites have to say along with a range of sources. 2. Stay up to date on evolving topicsWhen you have Search personalization turned on and you search for a topic you’ve searched for before, features such as Top Stories and What People Are Saying will automatically update to show new content since your last visit. And when you look at your recent searches (in the drop down under the Search bar), we’ll let you know if new updates are available in Top Stories. 3. Pick up where you left offTo help you quickly find and visit your favorite sites, with personalization on Search, results you return to often will be promoted in your results when relevant for your search.4. Follow your favorite sports teams in DiscoverIf you’re an avid sports fan, our systems will show a feature in Discover that allows you to pick your favorite teams to follow, across a range of different sports and leagues. Discover will then show you scores, game highlights and more.5. Shop for your personal styleWhen you search for certain apparel, shoes or accessories, you’ll see a section labeled “save your favorite styles.” Choose items that match your personal style, and Search will remember your preferences to provide a more personalized shopping experience next time. 6. Curate your personal shopping feedGoogle Shopping makes it easy to shop what you love. The shopping homepage delivers a personalized feed of videos and products inspired by your interests and hobbies, like fashion, gaming, home decor and more. Just select categories you love to shop and you’ll see products tailored to your interests. Easily browse deals, check prices and discover new trends in one convenient place. These are just some of the ways that you can easily find and connect with the information and topics that are most relevant to you and your interests on Search. Related stories",
