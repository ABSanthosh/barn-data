  "text": "SAVE $70: As of March 29, 2024 MacBook Air with M3 chip, 24GB RAM, and 512GB SSD is on sale for $1,099 at Amazon. That’s $400 off its usual $1,499 list price. I thought this one would vanish from Amazon faster than a Lightning cable port. 2024 MacBook Air with the M3 chip is not only the newest kid on the block, but this particular config (24GB RAM and 512GB storage) is a power user’s dream. And yet, somehow, it’s still up for grabs for $1,099. That’s $400 off. I checked twice.This is the kind of laptop that makes my current one look like a potato with a keyboard. The new M3 chip boasts an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU, which is Apple’s way of saying, “Go ahead, open 43 Chrome tabs and Photoshop at the same time. We can take it.” I genuinely think this MacBook is overqualified for my Google Docs and occasional Netflix, but that’s not stopping me. What makes this deal even more ridiculous is the 24GB of unified memory. That’s the kind of RAM you usually only see in developer builds or MacBook Pros that cost as much as rent. Pair that with 512GB of SSD and you’ve got a machine that keeps up with your ambition, or your TikTok editing habit. No judgment here.It’s also stunning. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports a billion colors, which sounds excessive until you see your desktop background and suddenly feel something. The Starlight finish is classy without screaming “look at me,” and it’s absurdly light at under half an inch thick. Toss it in a tote bag and go pretend you work at a café like the rest of us.Price: $1,099.00 (Was $1,499.00)Retailer: AmazonModel: 2024 MacBook Air (M3)Display: 13.6-inch Liquid RetinaMemory: 24GB Unified MemoryStorage: 512GB SSDProcessor: Apple M3, 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU Mashable Deals Battery Life: Up to 18 hoursExtras: Touch ID, Spatial Audio, 1080p cameraBattery life is listed at up to 18 hours, which is code for “yes, you can skip packing the charger.” Plus, it has the usual perks like Touch ID, a 1080p FaceTime camera that doesn’t make you look like a potato, Spatial Audio, and enough microphones to host a podcast you’ll never finish editing.MacBooks don’t usually go on sale this soon after launch, and yet this one’s hanging out on Amazon like it isn’t one of the hottest laptops of 2024. If it disappears tomorrow, I won’t be shocked. I’ll just be annoyed I didn’t click “Buy Now” fast enough.",
