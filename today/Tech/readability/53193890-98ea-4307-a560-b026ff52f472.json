  "text": "It's not every day you get a trailer for a new, live-action Predator movie, but today is one of those days. 20th Century Studios just released the first teaser for Predator: Badlands, a feature film that unconventionally makes the classic movie monster a protagonist. The film follows Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), a young member of the predator species and society who has been banished. He'll work closely with a Weyland-Yutani Android named Thia (Elle Fanning) to take down \"the ultimate adversary,\" which the trailer dubs a creature that \"can't be killed.\" The adversary looks like a very large monster we haven't seen before, judging from a few shots in the trailer. Some or all of the film is rumored to take place on the Predator home world, and the movie intends to greatly expand on the mythology around the Predators' culture, language, and customs. It's intended as a standalone movie in the Predator/Alien universe. Predator: Badlands teaser trailer. The trailer depicts sequences involving multiple predators fighting or threatening one another, Elle Fanning looking very strange and cool as an android, and glimpses of new monsters and the alien world the movie focuses on. Predator: Badlands' director and co-writer is Dan Trachtenberg, who directed another recent, highly acclaimed, standalone Predator movie: Prey. That film put a predator in the usual antagonist role, and had a historical setting, following a young Native American woman who went up against it. Trachtenberg has also recently been working on an animated anthology series called Predator: Killer of Killers, which is due to premiere on Hulu (which also carried Prey) on June 6. Predator: Badlands will debut in theaters on November 7. This is just the first teaser trailer, so we'll learn more in subsequent trailers—though we know quite a bit already, it seems.",
