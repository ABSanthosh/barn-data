However, Apple also announced a new line of MacBook Pro M4 laptops, but those did come with a hardware redesign.The good news is that Apple does have a redesigned line of MacBooks in the works! Unfortunately, it seems if you're looking to buy one, you'll be waiting quite a while. According to the outlet The Elec (as picked up by CNET) Apple's redesigned line of MacBooks have been pushed back due to issues with the computers' displays. Mashable Light Speed The report claims that Apple's new MacBook lines are utilizing \"premium display technology,\" so the pricing of Apple's MacBooks may be drastically increased. However, Apple is concerned about how these price changes could affect consumer purchasing decisions.Bloomberg's Apple insider Mark Gurman shared that Apple was originally looking to launch a redesigned MacBook Pro in 2025, but because of these issues, the new MacBook Pros that are released next year will likely have the same design as its predecessors. The redesigned MacBook Pros are now slated for 2026. A redesigned MacBook Air with an OLED display is also in the works, but that appears to have also been pushed back all the way to 2028 due to the same display concerns. As CNET points out, Apple launched an OLED iPad Pro earlier this year with a starting price of $999. Apple initially expected to ship 10 million iPad Pro devices but has since revised the number to between 6 and 7 million.So, if you're an Apple fan looking for a new MacBook with upgraded performance, Apple has a slew of great new options powered by the M4 chipset. But if you're looking for a new MacBook with a redesigned look, it looks like you're saddled with the current design options for at least a few more years.",
