  "text": "'Encanto', 'Turning Red', 'Coco' and 'A Goofy Movie' step into the spotlight in the party's festivities. Disneyland is turning 70 this summer, and festivities begin this weekend at Walt Disney’s first theme park. While past anniversaries emphasized a throwback to opening day nostalgia, this milestone wants to bring the party energy like no other. Thankfully, that doesn’t mean turning the castle into a Birthday cake, but the zany fun comes in the form of mix-taping the greatest hits with the latest number ones from the studio. After attending the media week preview at the Disneyland Resort, that’s what we loved about this year’s theme. The unabashed excitement for so many characters, from the fairytale Disney Princesses, The Muppets and Star Wars icons to the niche like Duffy the Disney Bear and A Goofy Movie. There were also incredible moments as well, including new Pixar and Disney animation faves Inside Out, Turning Red, Encanto and Moana all over the resort’s 70th offerings. It’s certainly celebration of cartoon chaos and we welcome Robot Walt’s imminent arrival in July to coincide with the actual anniversary of the opening date of the park. Some of the best things we found at the event were discovered on their own. When I wandered around Disney California Adventure I stumbled upon the most unhinged Disneyland 70 merchandise. And it confirmed that Disney really got all of its various types of fans when I looked upon the face of an official googly-eyed Mickey Mouse shirt, and a spinner-top colorful baseball cap. Yes, there’s the glam Loungefly Minnie ears and purses and Disney trendy lifestyle spirit jerseys, but the zany and bizarre get representation too. What’s hilarious is that those items weren’t made with meme comedy in mind, but actually straight from the Disney Vault of yester-merchandise. © io9 Gizmodo And just across the way at the Animation building, a new set of visuals debuted in the musical lobby which highlighted added moments from Coco, Moana, Encanto, The Princess and the Frog, and Zootopia. When I need a time to just bask in the magic of animation while staying out of the heat, this is where I (like so many others) go, and it’s such an underrated gem that rarely gets a refresh–not since the release of Frozen! And the Encanto representation at DCA didn’t stop there–while we love “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”, I’m glad to get a break from it to let the other amazing songs shine. In the new World of Color: Happiness, Anxiety from Inside Out 2 (my rising sun sign of the emotions) presents a great sequence where Luisa’s “Surface Pressure” gets a moment on the water, and it was so cool to hear everyone sing along. Hot take: it’s the better song between it and Bruno. The Muppets opener for the show is an all-timer, too, with a muppety death defying act from Gonzo the Great. World of Color: Happiness also finally featured a kaiju-sized Panda Mei on the mist screen projections set to “Nobody Like You” which led into the best in-universe run of real fake Disney pop hits, right into a Powerline moment from “A Goofy Movie”. The beat drop on “I2I” sent the crowds into a frenzy as Powerline electrified the stage like we were really at the show with the Goofs. We are loving the Max Goof inclusion too, as he joins his dad over at Disneyland for the Celebrate Happy Character Calvacade parade, right behind Duffy and ShellieMay Bear leading the way. I know they’re tossing around all the different nomenclatures around “Happy”, but this was for those of us who are into the offbeat or niche things of the Disney fandom. © io9 Gizmodo For Star Wars fans, there’s even a new R2 unit available at Droid Depot, with exteriors to match the pinks, purples, blues and yellow of the 70th. And we also took a peek at the new scrap pieces that debuted earlier this month for May the Fourth at Savi’s lightsaber build experience. The ombre chrome look of the blaster emitter is a fierce need. Unfortunately, these pieces aren’t individually available for those who have already built their lightsabers for over 200 bucks–if you want to cop these parts you’ll have to try to get in on the limited time action with another whopping purchase before they’re gone. © io9 Gizmodo Paint the Night, the rave-inspired answer to the Electrical Parade is back and we got to see it near the Small World promenade with a special new projection show on the ride’s facade. Spooky and bizarro Disney lore fiends got a treat here with a fun Grim-Grinning Ghosts montage right into “Hellfire” from The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Mr. Toad crazy eyes, the crone Evil Queen and Frollo giving children some gateway frightful imagery that they’ll obsess over later in life. At the end of my second night, it capped off with Wondrous Journeys which takes the pages of countless animation cells and brings them to life on the Disneyland Castle walls showcasing the stories that have spoken to generations for 100 years. It really does feel like Disney wanted to reach far and wide for the park’s big anniversary this year–and not be afraid to get a little zany in the process. Want more io9 news?
