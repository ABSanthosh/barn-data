It would also make a generous holiday gift for the health enthusiast in your life. On its vivid AMOLED display, you can clearly see and track everything you need to know about your health. To boost your fitness, the smartwatch has 25 built-in indoor and GPS sports apps to track everything from walking and running to swimming, cycling and HIIT workouts. Free preloaded workouts also include yoga, cardio, Pilates and more, while you can create your own with the free Garmin Connect smartphone app. Runners can use Garmin Coach for free to create personalized adaptive training plans.  All of this comes with 4GB memory storage, 11 days of battery life (so you can forego charging to track your sleep) and bonus features such as smart notifications when paired with an Apple or Android smartphone.
