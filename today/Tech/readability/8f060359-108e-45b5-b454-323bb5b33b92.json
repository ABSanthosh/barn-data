  "text": "Oct 22, 2024 [[read-time]] min read We're taking a step further by supporting the next generation of female talent. Women's football is exploding in popularity, and for good reasons. From record-breaking World Cup viewership to sold-out stadiums, the beautiful game is attracting a new generation of young fans worldwide. In the UK alone, more women and girls are playing football than ever before, and viewing figures for the UK Women’s Super League have more than tripled this season since moving to YouTube. But this surge in interest hasn't translated to equal representation off the pitch, particularly in sports media where barriers to entry are perceived as insurmountable. A recent study found that while nearly half of young women in the UK who love sports are passionate about careers in sports media, a staggering 55% lack the confidence to break into the field.At Google, we believe in the power of storytelling to inspire and drive change. Following the success of Pixel FC, our collective of football creators at the Women’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, we're incredibly excited to announce the launch of Pixel FC Academy, a pioneering program created by Google Pixel and The Powerhouse Project, in partnership with Arsenal FC, Liverpool FC, and The FA.This initiative marks a significant step forward in our ongoing commitment to championing women in football, both on and off the pitch.
