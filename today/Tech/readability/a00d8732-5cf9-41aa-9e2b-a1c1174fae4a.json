Explore other styles: Twenty years ago, Google Maps transformed how we see and navigate the world. Today, it's become an indispensable tool for more than 2 billion users per month — shaping the way people navigate and explore, whether they’re traveling to new places or rediscovering their hometown. Here are just a few mind-blowing stats 🤯 about Maps: 1 trillion: how many kilometers of directions we provided in 2024. This is the distance of Earth orbiting the sun over one thousand times! 250 million: the number of businesses and places on the map. If you were to visit one of these places every hour without sleeping, it would take you more than 28,500 years to get through this list! 500 million: the number of users who contribute information like reviews, photos, ratings and driving disruptions to the map per year. A vertical stack of 500 million pieces of paper would be 50km high! 100 million: the number of updates made to the map each day. That means that in the time it took to read this sentence, the map was updated 10,000 times! Today we're sharing 20 of our most popular and all-time favorite features — along with helpful hidden gems you might have missed over the years.1. Drive in style (new!)Now when you drive with Google Maps, you can customize your navigation icon with new car types and colors. Depending on your mood, choose a powerful pickup truck, a stylish SUV, a roaring racecar and more in eight vibrant colors. Just start navigating, tap on the blue arrow and let your creativity lead the way. 2. Ask Maps for inspiration with GeminiNeed ideas for where to go, but don’t have much time? Just ask Maps for “things to do with friends at night in NYC,” “fun winter activities in Seattle” or “interactive date nights in SF” to get inspiration curated with Gemini and helpful results that are grounded in Maps’ trusted data. You can also ask questions about a place, like what the dress code is or if there’s parking, and get answers in a snap. 3. Get menu highlightsIf you’re checking out a new restaurant, use Maps to quickly understand its most popular dishes in advance. Search for a restaurant and scroll down to “menu highlights” — you’ll see photos and reviews of top dishes from the Maps community to help you tap into your inner foodie and order with confidence. 4. Understand an area at a glance with ARIt can be tough to get your bearings when you pop out of a subway station or if you’re in a new neighborhood. With Lens in Maps, tap the camera icon in the search bar and lift your phone to let augmented reality instantly overlay helpful information, like the name of a place, how busy it is and if it’s highly rated. 5. See HOV lanes along your routeHeaded somewhere new and want to save time? Just get directions to your destination and quickly see if there are HOV lanes along your route so you can get there as efficiently as possible. 6. Time travel with Street ViewGo back in time with Street View! You can see loved ones and even check out your childhood home: Open Google Maps and turn on the Street View layer. Search for your home address, tap “See more dates” and scroll through the images to watch your neighborhood evolve over time! 7. Make reservations right from MapsForget frantic phone calls or scrambling for last-minute reservations: Google Maps can help you snag a table at your favorite restaurant. Search for the restaurant, and if it works with a booking partner, tap on “Reserve” to book your reservation. 8. Plan group hangouts with listsLists in Google Maps make it a breeze to save and share places you want to visit – and they also make it easy for groups to pick a spot. The next time you have an outing planned, create a collaborative list where everyone can save places and vote on them with emoji (maybe a heart ❤️ means you want to try a place and a thumbs down 👎 means it’s a pass) so you can make a quick decision on where to go. 9. Arrive with confidenceIt can be tough to find the right entrance at a large apartment complex or unfamiliar building. With arrival guidance, we’ll highlight the entrance, show you nearby parking lots and remind you to save your parking spot. Once you’re parked, you can get walking directions from your car to the entrance — and even enter Street View or AR walking navigation to orient yourself quickly. 10. Know before you goWith Immersive View, you can experience what stadiums, parks and routes look like and even check the weather and traffic so you can be ready in advance. If you’re driving, see where the nearest parking is and if there are any tight turns on your route — you can never be too prepared! 11. Send your trip from your phone to your carIf you’re in a rush, you can plan your trip from your phone and send it straight to your car if it has Google built-in. No need to waste time re-entering the address. 12. Check air qualityHeading outdoors for a hike or run? Google Maps uses our comprehensive model — which incorporates data from government stations, community sensors, weather patterns and live traffic — to show highly accurate air quality information. Just tap the layers icon and select \"Air Quality\" to see a color-coded map with air quality levels. 13. Find the hottest restaurants in townWhether you're exploring a new city or rediscovering your neighborhood, Google Maps’ restaurant lists can help you find the perfect spot. Check out our trending list 🔥to find places that have recently surged in popularity, the top list 🏆 for tried-and-true favorites and the gems list 💎 to find the next hot spot before everyone else does. 14. Avoid the crowdsIt’s helpful to know how busy a place will be before you get there so you can save time and avoid long lines. Search for a place and scroll down to \"Popular times\" — you’ll see a graph of how busy it typically is, and even how busy it is at that moment. New efficiency hack unlocked! 15. Don’t get lost — even when you’re off the gridWhen you’re exploring a new city or in an area with bad signal, you can use Google Maps offline to access essential navigation information. Search for an area, tap the name or address and select \"Download\" to give yourself access to navigation and key details without a connection. Perfect for travel and adventures off the beaten path. 16. Alleviate range anxietyIf you drive an EV, range anxiety is real — but Google Maps can help ease your fears. Just add your electric vehicle’s make and model into Maps and we’ll automatically show you compatible charging stations near you or along your route. Save time by using the “speed” filter to find stations that can charge in as little as 40 minutes. You can even check availability in real time to make sure you’re not pulling up to a charger that’s being used. 17. Get accessibility information anywhereFor those with accessibility needs, turn on “Accessible Places” in your settings and a wheelchair icon will show if a place has accessible entrances, seating, restrooms and parking. Those with visual impairments can get detailed voice guidance while walking, with helpful alerts about routes, upcoming turns and nearby intersections. 18. Minimize airport stress with the “Directory” tabFinding your way around an unfamiliar airport can be tricky, but Google Maps can help. Next time you're flying, search for your airport and tap on “Directory.” You’ll see what’s available, including restaurants, shops, lounges, parking lots, car rentals and more. 19. Save money and gasLots of people tell us that they want ways to get around more sustainably. Fuel-efficient routing in Google Maps (now available globally!) can help — it uses AI to show you the most fuel- or energy-efficient route to your destination, if it’s not already the fastest one. Just pull up directions and tap on the route with the green leaf. 20. Have fun with Pegman!Pegman is our beloved Street View mascot, and depending on where in the world you’re browsing, he might transform into someone new! Hint: Check out Loch Ness, Scotland for a fun surprise!",
