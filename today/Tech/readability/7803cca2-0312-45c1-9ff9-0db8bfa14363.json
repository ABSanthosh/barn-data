  "text": "Amazon contends the policy \"protects\" its employees from crime. Credit: David Paul Morris / Bloomberg via Getty Images A new lawsuit filed against delivery and tech giant Amazon accuses the company of intentionally slowing down Prime deliveries to select neighborhoods in Washington D.C.— areas that happen to be home to predominantly Black households. Submitted by D.C. attorney general Brian Schwalb on Dec. 4, the lawsuit claims Amazon imposed a secret \"delivery exclusion\" to zip codes in southeast and northeast D.C. in mid-2022. The alleged policy, which saw Amazon removing its own vehicles from delivery routes in the region, effectively strips Prime-subscribed residents in those areas of the advertised one-day, two-day, or same-day shipment options, constituting a violation of consumer protection laws. Notably, these areas (specifically zip codes 20019 and 20020 in Ward 7 and Ward 8) are highly-populous and predominantly Black. The areas are \"historically underserved,\" according to Schwalb. \"While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" wrote the attorney general. \"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide.\" Mashable Light Speed This is not the first accusation levied against Amazon for discriminatory delivery practices. A 2016 investigation by Bloomberg found that much of Amazon's free same-day delivery service area excluded predominantly Black ZIP codes. Amazon—initially blaming disparities in service on lack of proximity to warehouses—later announced it would expand same-day delivery to affected areas in Boston, New York City, and Chicago as a result of the findings. An Amazon spokesperson told NBC that the lawsuit's claims of \"discriminatory or deceptive\" business practices are \"categorically false.\" Instead, according to Amazon representative Kelly Nantel, the policy was enacted to \"protect\" its employees from area residents. \"In the zip codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages,\" she said in a statement. \"We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\" Chase joined Mashable's Social Good team in 2020, covering online stories about digital activism, climate justice, accessibility, and media representation.
