  "description": "This year's Summer Game Fest will feature a new showcase for games that highlight environmental causes and make direct contributions to real-world sustainability efforts. The Green Games Showcase, led by the not-for-profit PlanetPlay, will be held on Saturday, June 7 at 4:00PM ET (1:00PM PT) and streamed live on YouTube. PlanetPlay says the event will be \"a celebration of game studios that have raised over $100,000 for certified environmental projects around the world.\" Those projects so far include Abundant Village, a regenerative garden project in South Africa; the carbon forestry project WithOneSeed in Timor-Leste; The Hongera Clean Cookstove project in Kenya; and The Teeny Tiny Truth, which aims to reduce microplastics in New Zealand's fresh water systems. The Green Games Showcase is one of several streams that are set to take place between Summer Game Fest Live on Friday and the Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday. Be sure to also check out Day of the Devs, Devolver Direct, Wholesome Direct, the Women-Led Games Showcase, the Latin American Game Showcase and the Southeast Asian Games Showcase. It'll all wrap up with a Death Stranding 2: On the Beach premiere event, where you can get an early look at the game ahead of its release on June 26.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/how-to-watch-the-green-games-showcase-at-summer-game-fest-2025-000057640.html?src=rss",
