Built to generate comprehensive reports from single prompts, Corpora promises in-depth analysis and accurate outputs. Speed is another big selling point. According to Corpora, the engine can process 2 million documents per second. After receiving a prompt, the AI model scans through academic papers, news articles, legal documents, and other data on the web. The content is then compiled into summaries or reports. Corpora has shared an array of the results. They range from analyses of autism and AI investments to reports on documentaries about the Roswell incident. Links to sources are provided throughout every text. “We’re a research engine — we’re not a search engine,” Morris said. “The breadth and depth of what we produce and look at is really important.” Morris shared news of Corpora’s public release exclusively with TNW. The announcement marks another milestone in his colourful career. Behind the AI research engine A self-made tycoon who left school at 16, Morris is the former chairman of Candy Crush creator King. When the company went public in 2014, Morris became one of Britain’s richest men. A further windfall flowed from his dating website uDate, which he sold for around $150mn. An ill-fated spell running Derby County Football Club bit a painful chunk out of his fortunes, but Morris remains a wealthy man. Last August, he placed in the top 10 of the first-ever Sunday Times Gaming Rich List. A substantial slice of his funds is now going into Corpora.ai. Corpora.ai vs OpenAI Alongside the launch announcement, Morris revealed that he’s invested $15mn of his own money into Corpora. His funding aims to create a new business model for LLMs. Rather than challenge the leading GenAI firms, Corpora plans to bring a new service to the sector. The research engine can also integrate existing models on the market. “We don’t compete with OpenAI, Google, or DeepSeek,” Morris said. “The nice thing is, we can play with all of these AI vendors quite nicely. As they improve their models, our output gets better. It’s a really great symbiotic relationship.” Those outputs are where Corpora plans to make its mark. According to the company’s tests, the engine produces superior research at faster speeds and lower costs than the latest reasoning models on the market. The service is now available via a subscription-based model. Users are offered monthly plans tailored to their needs. To tempt them in, Corpora is also introducing an array of new features: Instant running of new queries on highlighted text Hashtags to categorise reports for easy searching Support across more than 20 languages Access to lesser-known studies, alternative viewpoints, and hidden connections Prioritisation of original sources to eliminate repetitive or derivative content Morris envisions Corpora.ai digging further into research than the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek. “These technologies skim the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “We’re letting you see beneath the surface.”",
