  "text": "The hype is dead. The Tesla Cybertruck, once billed as the future of electric vehicles, is now looking like a commercial bust. In the second quarter of 2025, Tesla sold just 4,306 Cybertrucks, down a staggering 50.8% from the 8,755 units it delivered during the same period last year, according to new data from Kelley Blue Book. This plunge is a signal that America’s most hyped truck may already be out of gas. When the Cybertruck was first revealed in November 2019, Elon Musk called it a “better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911.” Its sci-fi stainless steel exoskeleton and futuristic angles made it an instant viral sensation, and a lightning rod for debate. But almost six years later, the truck’s surreal design, awkward size, high price, and late delivery have turned it into a niche curiosity, not a mass-market hit. The Cybertruck officially launched in November 2023, years behind schedule, with base models starting at $72,235 and top-tier variants pushing well beyond $100,000. Early reviews raised red flags over software glitches, poor fit and finish, and disappointing range for a vehicle of its size. Now the numbers confirm what critics and former fans have been warning: the Cybertruck is not resonating with buyers. Cybertruck looks like the future https://t.co/K2GAhH0vaN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2024 It’s not just Tesla feeling the pain. Ford’s F-150 Lightning, another flagship electric pickup, also had a rough quarter, with sales dropping 26.1% to 5,842 units, down from 7,902 in Q2 2024. The decline suggests that enthusiasm for big, expensive electric trucks may be cooling fast. By contrast, Chevrolet’s Silverado EV, which leans into a more conventional design and pricing strategy, is gaining traction. GM sold 3,056 Silverado EVs in the quarter, up 39.2% year over year. That’s still behind Tesla and Ford in raw numbers, but the growth shows there is appetite. Just maybe not for experimental luxury trucks. For Tesla, the Cybertruck collapse comes at a rough time. The company’s overall U.S. EV sales fell 12.6% in Q2, part of a broader industry slowdown. But while the Model 3 gained traction and the Model Y remained the best-selling EV, the Cybertruck is already looking like Tesla’s weakest link. The Cybertruck was supposed to be a cultural event, a product that broke all the rules and redefined what a truck could be. Instead, it’s quickly becoming a case study in overpromising and underdelivering.",
