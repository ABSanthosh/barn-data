From cutting-edge electronics to everyday essentials, the breadth of discounted products continues to impress, even in the aftermath of the main event. Apple enthusiasts still have reason to celebrate as substantial price cuts persist on the tech giant’s products. The AirPods Pro 2, a favorite among audio aficionados, remains available at an enticing $189 this Thursday morning, down from their usual $249 price tag. Other Apple devices haven’t been left behind, with significant discounts continuing on iPads (still 40% off the original price), AirTags, and the AirPods Max. See all deals at Amazon Amazon’s own product line unsurprisingly maintains its position at the forefront of the discounts. Smart home devices like Echo speakers, Fire TV Sticks and Blink and Ring security cameras are still seeing price reductions ranging from 40% to a massive 70% off their original prices, one day after Prime Day. In a move that’s caught many by surprise, Amazon is also continuing to clear out stock of the Google Nest Wifi router and offers it at a mere $38 down from its original $169 price tag. The deals extend far beyond just electronics, including this Thursday. Shoppers can still find significant savings across major categories including televisions, with offers on Fire TVs, LG, TCL, and Sony models. Headphones, home appliances, gaming devices, beauty products, health products, and toys all continue to be part of the post-Prime Day festivities. Amazon, Samsung, etc. It’s not just Amazon that’s participating in this extended shopping event. Other retailers have launched their own competing offers on their platforms. Samsung, for instance, is offering great discounts on its latest technology through its official store with special deals and trade-in offers on the new Galaxy S24 smartphones and both Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldable models. As we enter this post-Prime Day period, it’s crucial for bargain hunters to act swiftly. Many of the best deals introduced at the start of the event are still available but popular items are likely to sell out very fast (and some might expire this morning). Even Amazon’s inventory management systems can be stretched to their limits during such high-demand periods. For those who have been considering a Prime membership, now might still be the perfect time to take the plunge. While many deals are accessible to all, Prime members continue to enjoy additional perks such as free and fast shipping, access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, and exclusive deals throughout the year. The sheer variety of deals across categories and brands and the opportunity for all shoppers to participate makes this an unmissable occasion for anyone looking to make significant savings, even after the Prime Day on Amazon. Whether you’re in the market for the latest tech gadgets, home appliances, fashion items, or everyday essentials, now is the time to take advantage of these substantial discounts that have lingered beyond the official Prime Day event. As these post-Prime Day offers continue to dwindle, it’s advisable to act quickly on any deals that catch your eye. Remember, these extended discounts won’t last forever, and it may be a long wait until the next major shopping event rolls around. Don’t miss out on the chance to snag that item you’ve been eyeing at a fraction of its usual cost. See all deals at Amazon",
