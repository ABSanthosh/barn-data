  "description": "Hideo Kojima doesn't really go for half measures. Following a 10-minute trailer that unveiled some early details, the game creator participated in a beefy 80-minute panel discussion with Geoff Keighley about Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on the final day of Summer Games Fest 2025. The wide-ranging conversation included some clips from the sequel to the acclaimed Death Stranding, including its first five minutes, which sparked lots of cheers as people recognized performers' names in the opening credits. Kojima also showed the English language version of a scene that was revealed during the Tokyo Game Show, highlighting the performances of Elle Fanning as Tomorrow and Shioli Kutsuna as Rainy. Fans also got a chance to see Tomorrow in action as she literally gets down and dirty in the tar to take out some robotic combatants. There was also a live gameplay demo, first showing Sam in combat with a blood boomerang and a tar cannon, then a more challenging fight against Neil that showed off some stealth attacks as well as some more weaponry. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available on PlayStation 5 starting June 26.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/watch-22-minutes-of-death-stranding-2-gameplay-from-summer-games-fest-224814307.html?src=rss",
