General summary Google Colab has new features for higher education data science. Students and faculty in the U.S. can get free one-year Pro subscriptions for better computing resources. Also, instructors can now use Slideshow Mode for interactive presentations and control the visibility of AI features at the notebook level. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Bullet points Google Colab has new features for college data science! Let's see what's new for teachers and students. Students and faculty at US colleges can get free one-year Colab Pro subscriptions. Slideshow Mode lets you turn notebooks into presentations and run code live. Teachers can now turn AI features on or off for each notebook to help students learn. These updates aim to make data science learning and teaching better in Colab. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: As the new academic year approaches, we're announcing a suite of new features in Google Colab designed for higher education data science instructors and their students. The academic community has unique needs when it comes to a coding platform — so here’s what’s new for students and educators.Free one-year Pro subscriptions for students and facultyWe're offering a limited number of completely free, 1-year Colab Pro subscriptions to faculty and students at U.S.-based higher education institutions. This initiative is designed to provide greater access to enhanced computational resources, allowing for more complex data analysis, faster model training, and an overall smoother experience in your data science coursework.These free subscriptions are available to anyone who can verify their identity as a faculty member or student at a U.S.-based higher education institution. See our FAQ for more. Simply visit our sign up page (look for the “No cost to students and educators” button) to begin the verification process and claim your free Colab Pro subscription.Slideshow Mode with live code executionSlideshow Mode is designed to eliminate the need to juggle multiple tools during a lecture. It allows you to effortlessly convert your Colab notebooks into interactive presentations — plus, you can execute code directly within the slide view. This means you can demonstrate concepts, run live examples, walk through code and explain results all from a single, familiar environment, making your lessons more dynamic and engaging. A way to turn AI features on or off on each notebookWe've heard your feedback that AI features, such as inline autocompletion, can sometimes get in the way of learning, especially from instructors teaching introductory courses. Previously, students often had to manually disable AI features at the start of each class to ensure a foundational learning experience. Now, you can toggle visibility of AI features at the notebook level. This means professors can set this preference for an entire notebook, ensuring a consistent default environment for all students and saving valuable class time. This lets learners focus on the core concepts without distraction. We believe these new features will significantly enhance the data science learning and teaching experience in Google Colab. Here's to a successful and inspiring 2026 school year for all teachers and students! Related stories",
