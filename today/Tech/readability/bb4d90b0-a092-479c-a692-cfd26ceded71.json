  "text": "Credit: Justin Pot Do you remember a time when the internet was a more chaotically personal place? When the experience of using social media wasn't so uniform? SkySpace seeks to recapture those days. The site transforms your Bluesky profile into a Myspace-esque page, complete with backgrounds, music, and a section for your top eight friends. I kind of love it.\"I miss when social media was more about being social and less about media,\" wrote Ste Curran, who built the site, in the project's FAQ. \"I miss the personality, the ugliness, the chaos, the feeling of planting a flag in tiny part of the internet and saying 'this is mine'.\"And SkySpace certainly delivers there, allowing you to customize basically every aspect of your profile page. Choose any image on the web as your background—including animated GIFs—and tweak the fonts, color scheme, and borders. Add a song to your profile using a Spotify, Soundcloud, or Apple Music link. List your interests. There's even a version of MySpace \"friends\"—complete with an optional top eight.You can view the SkySpace version of any Bluesky profile, but most of them are boring. To make yours interesting you need to sign in—head to the Skyspace homepage, type your Bluesky handle in the top-right corner, then click \"Log In\". You will be asked by Bluesky to authorize SkySpace; do that, and you're in. You can now click the various edit buttons to really tweak your profile. Credit: Justin Pot You can link to any image on the web to add it to the background, then choose how the image will be positioned. You can choose the color of each panel, and its transparency. You can choose the thickness and style of the line around each panel. You can even change the text font and color. Hit Submit, and the change will stick.(The way this happens is pretty interesting. Your options are actually turned into a Bluesky post as a reply. SkySpace doesn't store any of your settings on its own servers—the service just scans profiles for relevant posts and renders the page using them. As the FAQ explains it: \"When you edit a section the site creates a new post tagged with #skyspace and sends it as a reply to a dead account, @skyspacenull. That effectively hides each post from your followers but SkySpace can see them, parse them and turn them into something beautiful/horrific/beautiful to you.\")Explore the rest of your page and tweak everything you can. You can add a quote, a location, blurbs, a song, and even a list of interests. All of this will feel vary familiar to MySpace veterans, as will the friends section at the bottom: Credit: Justin Pot This is populated entirely from your mutuals on Bluesky—people you follow who also follow you back. You can optionally choose which eight people show up here, bringing back the most important decisions one could make on the internet in 2005: Who deserves a spot in your top eight?This site doesn't really return us to the friendlier, simpler internet of two decades ago—if only!—but it's a nice reminder of the chaos and customization we once took for granted.
