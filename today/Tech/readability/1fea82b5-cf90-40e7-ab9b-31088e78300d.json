Credit: Kaspars Grinvalds/Shutterstock Pod-based coffee machines like Keurig and Nespresso are more convenient than their pot-filling predecessors, but they still get dirty inside, the same as any coffee maker. Whether you're a seasoned owner or just got yours, you may not know you should be descaling your machine every three months or so, removing calcium buildup and other gunk. Sure, you can buy products designed to do this for you, but you can also just use vinegar. Here's what to do either way.How to clean and descale a KeurigTo descale your Keurig machine, fill your water reservoir with a mixture of half water and half distilled white vinegar. Place a large mug or bowl where you’d typically put your coffee cup and run the machine as normal, dumping the mixture every time the mug fills. Keep doing this until the water reservoir runs out of mixture. Wash and refill the reservoir, then repeat the process to rinse it out, refilling your container until there’s nothing left in the machine. (Obviously, try to use a large bowl if possible so you're not running back and forth to the sink with a full mug.)Be careful not to overwork your poor Keurig—consider giving it a half-hour break between descaling and rinsing. It's designed to dispense a cup at a time, not to run for extended periods like a traditional brewer. How to clean and descale a NespressoNespresso warns against using vinegar or other-branded descaling solutions, which you could argue is because they want you to spend money on theirs. If you’re nervous about messing up your machine, just buy the Nespresso cleaning products. But online, plenty of people have discussed using vinegar to clean their machines out. If you’re going to try it, first dilute the vinegar significantly—in my own Nespresso, I use one part vinegar and two parts water, and only run the solution through once. It works great.  Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Here are general instructions for how to do it (but it's a good idea to check your manual, or look it up online, and follow the directions for your specific model): First, turn off your machine, then push the top button and the lever simultaneously until the light turns orange. Next, press the lever down once to start descaling. The process will take a while, and will empty your reservoir. (Conversely, I just “brewed” a cup of the mixture and had no issues.) Rinse the machine by washing out the reservoir, filling it with water, and running some plain water through a few times. If you’re cheap like me, grab some distilled white vinegar and get to it. If you want to go with the \"official\" products, Amazon sells Keurig’s three-month brewer maintenance kit ($14.98) and Nespresso’s descaling solution ($14).
