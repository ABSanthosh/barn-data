  "text": "If the winter season wasn’t chilling enough, Peacock is adding Nosferatu next Friday, February 21. Robert Eggers’ critically acclaimed remake will come to the streamer with two cuts: the original theatrical version in all its erotic, gothy glory; and an extended cut (with a handful of deleted and extended scenes) available on other platforms and DVD/Blu-Ray. Peacock will also have a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the film, including insight from its star-studded cast, Eggers, and others. If you haven’t seen Nosferatu in a while, it’ll be good to watch it again, since it’s up for several Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup/Hairstyling. Nosferatu was a sizable hit last Christmas: not only was it Eggers’ best-performing movie with a $176.5 million box office, it was Focus Features’ second highest-grossing domestic release and its fourth-highest worldwide. While it was still playing in theaters and making money, Focus revealed it was reteaming on a new gothic horror movie, this one about a werewolf and called…Werwulf. All we know about it right now is, it’s set in the 13th Century (with the dialogue that fits the time period), and Eggers hopes to have it out by Christmas Day 2026. After what he did with Count Orlok, a lot of eyes are going to be on whatever he does next, be it Werwulf or that Labyrinth sequel he’s attached to. Want more io9 news?
