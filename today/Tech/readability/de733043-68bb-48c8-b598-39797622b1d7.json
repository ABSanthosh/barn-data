  "text": "Credit: Pranay Parab While iOS 26's Liquid Glass design deservedly got most of the attention at Apple's WWDC 2025 keynote, there were still several other additions worth talking about. These include a bunch of new Apple Music enhancements, such as lyrics translation, a new DJ-like feature called AutoMix, and animated cover art on the lock screen. Here are all the new Apple Music features in iOS 26.Lyrics Translation for your favorite songsApple Music has had time-synced lyrics for a while now, which works great when you speak the language of the song. However, it's not as helpful when you're listening to songs in different languages, and that's where Lyrics Translation comes in. It adds translations below each time-synced lyric line, making it easy to follow the song's meaning, too. This hasn't yet been added to all songs, but I expect that to change over the coming months.Learn how to pronounce lyrics correctlyAnother iOS 26 lyrics upgrade lets Apple Music show you the correct pronunciations for lyrics in foreign languages. Not every song has lyrics in the Roman script, so if you can't read the alphabet they're in, this new feature will help you learn how to pronounce those words. It does this by showing you a transliteration from the original script to Roman, which makes it easier to sing along.AutoMix is an AI DJ for your playlistsAutoMix is a new addition to Apple Music's playback controls. You'll see it alongside the Shuffle, Repeat, and Autoplay buttons. When enabled, AutoMix will analyze the audio features of songs and use DJ-like tricks such as time stretching and beat matching to deliver continuous playback. Some people may like this, but I tried this during a run today and I'm not a big fan. I make lots of custom playlists on Apple Music, and some of those are painstakingly curated by matching the sounds at the end of one song with the start of the next one. AutoMix undid all my hard work and made the transitions feel unnatural. This may work for some types of playlists and for people who don't care much about transitions, but it's not doing much for me.Pin your favorite playlistsThis is a sweet feature that lets you quickly open your favorite Apple Music playlists. You can press and hold any playlist in the Music app in iOS 26, and pin it to the top of the Library tab. If you've pinned your favorite contacts in Messages, then you'll find music pinning to be a familiar feature. What do you think so far? Animated cover art comes to your lock screenAnimated cover art is one of the more visually appealing features of Apple Music, and now it's coming to your lock screen as well. When you play a song that has animated album art, you can tap the player on the lock screen to see it in a neat full-screen view.A karaoke feature for Apple TV usersApple Music is also getting a new feature called Sing, which only works if you have an iPhone with iOS 26 and an Apple TV running tvOS 26. With all those requirements in place, you can use your iPhone as a mic and have your voice amplified by Apple Music to have a fun karaoke experience right at home.
