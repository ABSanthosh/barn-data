  "excerpt": "Today Google Cloud is unveiling Automotive AI Agent, a new way for automakers to create helpful generative AI experiences. Built using Gemini with Vertex AI, Automotive AI Agent is specially tuned to allow automakers to create highly personalized and intuitive in-car agents that go beyond current vehicle voice control. Its ability to provide multimodal reasoning and multilingual support enables assistants that can enable natural conversations and agentic responses like “Is there an Italian restaurant nearby?” as well as follow-up questions like, “Does the restaurant have good reviews?” or “What is the most popular dish there?”Mercedes-Benz is among the first automakers to implement Automotive AI Agent in its MBUX Virtual Assistant, coming to the new Mercedes-Benz CLA later this year. The enhanced MBUX Virtual Assistant, which offers fresh and factual information from Google Maps Platform, will allow drivers and passengers to use voice commands to obtain comprehensive and personalized information about points of interest, traffic conditions and more, within seconds. Google Cloud’s Automotive AI Agent will also enable the MBUX Virtual Assistant to handle complex, multi-turn dialogue and can remember conversations, so drivers can stop and start speaking and it will be able to pick up where you left off.
