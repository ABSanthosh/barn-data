  "description": "America's next president \"announced Wednesday he has selected Jared Isaacman, a billionaire businessman and space enthusiast who twice flew to orbit with SpaceX, to become the next NASA administrator,\" reports Ars Technica: In a post on X, Isaacman said he was \"honored\" to receive Trump's nomination. \"Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,\" Isaacman wrote. \"On my last mission to space, my crew and I traveled farther from Earth than anyone in over half a century. I can confidently say this second space age has only just begun....\" \"Jared Isaacman will be an outstanding NASA Administrator and leader of the NASA family,\" said Jim Bridenstine, who led NASA as administrator during Trump's first term in the White House. \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\" Lori Garver, NASA's deputy administrator during the Obama administration, wrote on X that Isaacman's nomination was \"terrific news,\" adding that \"he has the opportunity to build on NASA's amazing accomplishments to pave our way to an even brighter future.\" Isaacman, 41, is the founder and CEO of Shift4, a mobile payment processing platform, and co-founded Draken International, which owns a fleet of retired fighter jets to pose as adversaries for military air combat training... Isaacman, an evangelist for the commercial space industry, has criticized some of NASA's decisions on the Artemis program. In several posts on X, he questioned the agency's decision to fund two redundant lunar landers, while not planning for any backup to the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which costs $2.2 billion per copy, not including expenses for ground infrastructure or the Orion spacecraft itself. One of those casualties might be the SLS rocket. The program is managed by NASA, with suppliers spread across the United States and prime contractors working under cost-plus arrangements with the space agency, meaning the government is on the hook to pay for any delays or cost overruns. If confirmed he'll be the 4th NASA administrator who's actually flown in space, according to the article. And according to Wikipedia, Isaacman was the commander of Inspiration4, a private spaceflight using SpaceX's Crew Dragon Resilience that launched in 2021. The crew returned to Earth on September 18, 2021, after orbiting at 585 km (364 mi) in altitude. The mission was part of a fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, to which Isaacman pledged to donate $100 million. Thanks to Slashdot reader FallOutBoyTonto for sharing the news.
