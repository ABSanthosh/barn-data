  "text": "After teasing us last year with Lestat’s transformation from the Brat Prince to an even brattier music idol, AMC returned to San Diego Comic-Con to really bare the fangs for Interview With the Vampire‘s third season. Officially being dubbed The Vampire Lestat for the Anne Rice novel the season will draw on, Interview With the Vampire‘s third season will see Sam Reid’s vamping vamp react to his portrayal in Daniel Molloy’s Interview With the Vampire book (first, he’s busy guest starring in the third AMC/Anne Rice show, Talamasca) by setting his own record straight… via the medium of rock music. Check out the new footage below, as Reid sets up where Lestat’s at in this heady mix of some real rock-star-on-tour behind-the-scenes footage. The highly anticipated return of Lestat in The Vampire Lestat left the hall breathless with new moments that highlighted the upcoming season. Centering Lestat’s rockstar journey, the music of the night from the Brat Prince vampire is hypnotizing and maybe even awakening the likes of one Queen Akasha, though you may know her as the Queen of the Damned—a crucial figure in Rice’s Lestat trilogy, the first vampire in existence, who no doubt is going to become a major player in the show as it continues. Interview With the Vampire season 3, The Vampire Lestat, hits AMC in 2026. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
