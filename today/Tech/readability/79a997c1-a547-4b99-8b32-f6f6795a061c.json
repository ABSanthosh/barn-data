  "text": "The recent finale for Star Wars: Skeleton Crew finally shed some light on Jude Law’s mysterious Force user, Jod Na Nawood. Growing up as a poor kid, he was taken in by a Jedi and trained in the ways of the Force. He’s been on the run ever since he watched her die, and it turns out we would’ve met her during the sequence. On Instagram, actor Yasmine Al Massri (who you’ve heard as Morana on Castlevania) posted photos of herself as Jod’s master, Jedi robes and doing some brief lightsaber training that would’ve presumably been her putting up a fight before her death. According to her, it was the “shortest active job I’ve done,” but impactful nonetheless: after her single scene wrapped production, she recalled telling the Skeleton Crew team they “just created the first Arab female Jedi.” To Massri’s dismay, the scene wasn’t part of the Skeleton Crew finale, but she’s taking it in stride. “These things happen,” she continued. “It was the most meaningful [job] to the child in me. […] I can’t not share my experience and feelings.” Now that Jod’s officially confirmed to have been a Jedi-in-training and had a master at one point in his life, it raises some questions. Who between them was the Order 66 survivor, or could they both have escaped the Jedi Purge? Additionally, who is she—neither Skeleton Crew’s finale or Massri’s post name the character, and it feels like she should have one. If the show gets another season, maybe we’ll learn more about her and Jod’s relationship, and how he grew from Jedi survivor to pirate with a lot of false identities. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
