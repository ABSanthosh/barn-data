  "excerpt": "Tenno is an app that lets you create powerful dynamic documents where you can easily add and orchestrate computational elements. You can think of it as a mix between Word and Excel with a sprinkle of Javascript. You could also think of it as a more interactive and user friendly version of Jupyter notebooks. With Tenno you can build formulas like you do in spreadsheets, you can create charts, but you can also easily call APIs and mix and match everything. Tenno has an interactive live mode, where you see changes as you type, allowing for a very quick iteration loop. If you are into literate programming, Tenno could be something for you.",
