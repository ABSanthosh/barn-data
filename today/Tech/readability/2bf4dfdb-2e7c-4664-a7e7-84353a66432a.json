Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can download it and watch it with your favorite video player! Ten years ago, we set out to make Android simpler, more consistent and more secure for our customers and partners. What we launched in Android Lollipop (Android 5) became the foundation for Android Enterprise — a unified platform built for security, manageability and choice. Today, Android is helping businesses of all sizes adapt to a world where work happens anywhere and everywhere.Our ecosystem has experienced significant growth, fueled by incredible partnerships. And our commitment to delivering customer value extends to industry-leading customers like McLaren Racing, IIFL Finance, Amedisys, Brink’s Brazil and many others. Creating the foundationOver the past decade, we have focused Android Enterprise on three core areas:Security and manageability: With features like Android Work Profile, Zero-touch enrollment and the Android Management API, we made it easier for IT teams to deploy, manage and protect devices at scale.A network of trusted partners: Android Enterprise Recommended has helped businesses choose secure, up-to-date devices and device management solution partners. What started with a few device manufacturers has now expanded into a diverse, global network of device manufacturers, enterprise mobility providers and resellers — giving you more choice on how to customize Android to your business.Support that scales: From the Partner Portal and Android Enterprise Academy to direct engagement channels like our Customer Community and Advisory Services, we’ve made sure that partners and customers get the help they need when they need it. Powering what’s nextThe world of work has changed, and Android is evolving with it. Here’s what we’ve been up to lately:With Android 16, we’ve added a more intuitive UI, a new generation of productivity tools, simplified deployment and next-level security controls for mobile connectivity.Last month, we launched Device Trust from Android Enterprise, helping businesses verify access and protect data — even on unmanaged devices.And we’re integrating Gemini directly into Android so teams can work faster, smarter and more securely, with helpful assistance built right into the OS.We’re also making it easier to unlock the full power of Google's business ecosystem (Gemini, Google Workspace, ChromeOS and Chrome Enterprise) with a single, unified account. All of your essential Google services will now work better on Android, helping you be more productive on the go and across devices.We’re building an intelligent platform — from chip to cloud — that adapts to the way people work today. With projects like Gemini Live with camera and screen sharing and Agentspace, we’re making it easier for teams to interact with information, automate tasks and get real-time support, powered by Google’s latest AI research and prepare for the next wave of Android devices, like XR headsets and glasses.Building for everyoneWhether you work in a hospital, warehouse, retail store or behind a desk, Android brings the best of Google services and AI to help you get your job done securely, efficiently and with less friction. From the beginning, it’s been our mission to transform computing to empower everyone at work. Thank you to our partners, customers and teams who’ve helped shape this journey. We wouldn’t be here without you and couldn’t be more excited about the next decade of enterprise computing — let’s build the future together. Related stories",
