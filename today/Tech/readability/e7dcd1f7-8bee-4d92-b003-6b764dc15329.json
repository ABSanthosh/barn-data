  "text": "The DJI Osmo Mobile 6 isn't your average smartphone gimbal. Yes, it can hold and stabilize your smartphone, but it can also do much more. And now, thanks to B\u0026H's early Black Friday deals, the gimbal is $50 off, bringing the price down to $89. This makes it a perfect holiday gift for anyone who loves shooting photos and videos on their smartphone.  To improve its previous version, DJI made the Osmo Mobile 6 gimbal with a more compact frame that is easier to hold, balance and store. Despite this more economical design, the gimbal now has an additional 8.5 inches of length with its extension rod. To mount the gimbal on the included grip tripod and additional accessories, the bottom of the product's handle has a mounting thread. Any smartphone up to 3.3 inches wide can be placed in the Osmo Mobile 6's phone cradle. Plus, the improved magnetic phone clamp automatically detects your phone and aligns it with the clamp. This is great for photographers and videographers who are on the go and don't have time to deal with pesky manual clamps. With this magnetic version, connecting your phone is quick and easy.  Once you connect your phone, you can use the following features: Dynamic Zoom (for stretching and compressing effects), ActiveTrack 6.0 (automatically tracks subjects), Sport (for faster movements), Time-Lapse and Hyperlapse (to play with time and space) and Panorama Modes. With the DJI Mimo app, you can control both your gimbal and phone and connect your Apple Watch to use as a remote control.  However, if you prefer to use the gimbal itself, there are onboard controls like an integrated joystick, a side wheel and other buttons, along with a system status indicator that shows the battery level and gimbal mode. Hand gestures can also be used to control the gimbal.  The Osmo Mobile 6 has a built-in battery that can run for about 6.4 hours after 1.5 hours of charging with the included USB-C cable. When not in use, the Osmo Mobile 6 comes with a handy pouch for effortless storage and transportation.  Why this deal matters We've been fans of the DJI Osmo Mobile 6 for several years, and this is the lowest price we've seen for the gimbal this year. Normally, it is $139, but B\u0026H currently has it for $89 with free expedited 1- or 2-day shipping to the lower 48 US states. While several other retailers have similar prices, they don't have shipping deals that are this free and this fast. So, if you've been wanting to take better photos and videos on your smartphone or know of a giftee who does, this discounted gimbal stabilizer is the ticket.  For more, check out some of the best early Black Friday deals.",
