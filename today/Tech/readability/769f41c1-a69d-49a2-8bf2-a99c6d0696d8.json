  "description": "President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to delay the upcoming TikTok ban while he works on a \"political resolution.\" In a legal brief (PDF) on Friday, his lawyer said Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.\" The BBC reports: Trump had met with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last week. In his court filing on Friday, Trump said the case represents \"an unprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national security concerns on the other.\" While the filing said that Trump \"takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute\", it added that pushing back the 19 January deadline would grant Trump \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution\" to the matter without having to resort to the court. [...] Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president. \"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he claimed at a press conference earlier in December, although a majority of young voters backed his opponent, Kamala Harris. \"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that,\" he added. Earlier this month, TikTok asked the Supreme Court to block the ban, saying that the law violates both its First Amendment rights and those of its 170 million American users.
