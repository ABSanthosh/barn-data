This is what a VPN does but this one offers much more. For instance, it governs over 30,000 servers in 91 countries worldwide. Additionally, PIA VPN endorses unlimited simultaneous connections. This means you can protect all devices and share your subscription costs with friends and family. The VPN is great for Netflix, while also supporting anonymous P2P. PIA also doesn’t limit your bandwidth. With excellent speeds thanks to WireGuard, this allows you to browse, stream, download torrents, and play games without hassle. Better yet, the VPN keeps your privacy intact through a no-logging policy. This, in turn, prevents ISPs and other snoopers from tracking you. With features like MultiHop, Shadowsocks, 256-bit encryption, RAM-based servers, Private DNS, and more, PIA is a widely adopted VPN in the US and abroad. Wait until you hear how inexpensive it is with the deal in place! 83% Off Deal: Here’s How to Claim It Private Internet Access includes three plans but the 2-year one is by far the most valuable option. As hinted at before, its price has dwindled by 83% thanks to 4 free months, making the entire package cost as little as $56.94. © Private Internet Access This is a price for 28 months and yearly thereafter. To get this deal, use any of the buttons in this guide. Once on the website, locate the deal (it will be in the middle), and press “Get Started Now“. Now, pick the preferred payment method, purchase it, and follow the steps to set up the account.
