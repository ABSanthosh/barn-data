They join London, which began OpenAI’s international expansion in 2023, and Dublin, which became the firm’s first EU base a few months later. Alongside the European hubs, OpenAI is also launching new offices in New York City, Seattle, Paris, Brussels, and Singapore. Job openings at all the sites will be listed here. For OpenAI, the European locations offer diverse attractions. The company has praised London for its “vibrant technology ecosystem” and “exceptional talent.” Announcing the Dublin office, the AI giant pointed to Ireland’s regulatory and business development landscape, but denied that its famous tax regime had motivated the move. For the new European additions, OpenAI is yet to explain their lures, but we can hazard a few guesses. In the case of Paris, the city is emerging as a hotbed for artificial intelligence. The French capital’s blend of  tech talent, government support, and new investment streams has created fertile ground for startups in the field. Brussels, meanwhile, is the de facto capital of the EU — a global leader in AI regulation. OpenAI could benefit from close proximity to the corridors of power. AI will take centre stage at next year’s TNW Conference. Early birds can now buy 2-for-1 tickets for the June event.  Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.
