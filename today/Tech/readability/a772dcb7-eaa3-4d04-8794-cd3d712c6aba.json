Many of them echoed Mensch’s sentiment.   “Ambition in Europe is on par or higher than the US — it’s not a talent problem but a structural one,” said Schmidt.  The 💜 of EU techThe latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

The act lays out a rulebook for governing AI based on risk levels, designed to ensure the technology is deployed safely, transparently, and ethically.    The US, meanwhile, is moving in a very different direction. While the EU imposes strict rules, the Trump administration is removing AI protections and giving tech sector leaders prominent roles in government. At the AI Action Summit in Paris this week, US Vice President JD Vance criticised the EU’s efforts to regulate the burgeoning AI sector. He said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments “tightening the screws” on US tech firms. Get the TNW newsletter Get the most important tech news in your inbox each week.
