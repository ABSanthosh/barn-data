  "text": "The level of secrecy on Disney’s prized franchises is known to be on another level. Between Marvel and Star Wars, script and set leaks are something the studio wants to keep the spigot closed on. But it turns out that sometimes tight security makes the work challenging for its stars, including certain cast members of the hit Disney+ show Andor. The nugget of behind the scenes lore was revealed while Andor star Diego Luna, who is currently doing a stint hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live, had own his Star Wars universe co-star Adria Arjona on to reminisce about shooting the Disney+ series. He brought up that production resorted to high-tech alternatives for its actors to learn their lines. “They wouldn’t print a script for you because you would lose it. So we would have iPads to work,” Luna explained of the protocol before asking Arjona how she fared under that decree. “I didn’t use it,” she admitted, “I took pictures of it and I printed the whole script.” As in pictures of the screen, which Luna cracked was very much in line with the spies they played on the Tony Gilroy show. “You were so mad at me the first time in rehearsal. You looked at me like, ‘Adria, they’re gonna find out!’ You were so paranoid.” Arjona revealed, “And my answer was like, ‘Stellan [Skarsgård] did it too.’ I just completely threw Stellan under the bus.” “I remember that. Stellan didn’t give an [expletive],” Luna said. “He was like, ‘Yes, I’ve been doing it.'” Arjona continued, “I just kept doing it. Season two, I did it too.” She explained, “I just need the paper. I need to write things down. [The iPad script] also has so many passwords and then I would have ADD and then do something else and then it would lock me out … it was so complicated. So I printed it.” Since the ending of Andor featured Arjona’s character holding a real hell of a twist in her arms, we’d say she was successful.
