  "excerpt": "Google is contributing $1.5 million for a regenerative agriculture program with Indigo Ag, aiming to replenish an estimated 1.5 billion gallons of water in Oklahoma over the next seven years. This initiative will help local farmers in the Arkansas-Keystone and Lower Cimarron Basins in North-Central Oklahoma adopt practices like cover cropping and no-till farming.These methods help enhance soil-water retention, increase groundwater levels and improve crop resilience, creating healthier farming ecosystems that use less water for irrigation. This program directly supports our commitment to replenish 120% of our freshwater consumption, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030, while also improving watershed health in the communities where we operate.We are dedicated to supporting water security in Oklahoma and beyond.
