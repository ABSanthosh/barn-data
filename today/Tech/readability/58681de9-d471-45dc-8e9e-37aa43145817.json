  "text": "Dyson is often compared with Apple because of the latter’s image as a premium brand, and rarely discounted. For all who have been holding off for a discount, any discount on a Dyson item is a news worth noting, especially when it occurs on one of the lowest priced models within the product offering. Right now, Amazon is offering the Dyson V8 Plus cordless vacuum for $349 which is a 26% savings off its usual $469 price. This is the lowest price seen in months, and you’d have to go back to Black Friday to find it offered for even slightly less. With Dyson’s latest models now exceeding $1,000, this deal is a rare chance to own a Dyson at a reasonable price point. See at Amazon Power and Convenience The Dyson V8 Plus vacuum is powered by the digital motor V8, it generates strong suction and up to 40 minutes of fade-free cleaning time on a single battery charge. The vacuum is… cordless and lightweight so it can be easily moved around furniture, up stairs or even out to the car (which is not the case of a robovac). It’s meant for fast, daily cleaning but is also capable of deeper work, thanks to its two power modes: a regular setting for everyday tasks and a MAX mode for dealing with tough dirt or pet hair. One of the V8 Plus’s main features is its Motorbar cleaner head which automatically detangles long hair and pet fur while you clean. It’s a definite bonus for pet owners or families with long-haired family members. The vacuum also quickly transforms into a handheld unit which is great for cleaning car interiors, upholstery, or stairs. The Dyson V8 features whole-machine filtration to trap 99.99% of 0.3-micron particles to remove allergens and dust from the air inside your home. The dustbin is simple to empty with a single lever and transparent, so you’ll never have to get in touch with the dirt. Care is convenient, too: the filter is reusable and washable to keep recurrent costs low. Given Dyson’s history of not offering discounts on its products, this $349.99 deal is a great opportunity for you (until the supply lasts). The V8 Plus gives a premium cleaning experience at a far lower cost than the latest models which now routinely exceed $1,000. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to buy a Dyson, this is one of the best deals you’ll find all year. See at Amazon",
