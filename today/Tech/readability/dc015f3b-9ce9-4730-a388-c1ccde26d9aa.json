Credit: Kevin Mazur/WireImage for Parkwood As Beyoncé prepares to take the stage for her highly anticipated halftime performance during Netflix's live NFL Christmas Gameday, those in the Bey Hive are buzzing with excitement — not just for her electrifying set, but for who might join her. While the full list of special guests remains under Beyoncé's lock and key, speculation is running wild, and one thing is certain: This performance will be full of surprises. Beyoncé is no stranger to making a jaw-dropping entrance, and we assume this Cowboy Carter Christmas event will be no different. Could we see a duet with one of the country superstars who helped shape Cowboy Carter? With the genre-bending album featuring everyone from country icons to electrifying newcomers, the possibilities for guest appearances are endless.The most likely guests are the artists whose voices are woven throughout the fabric of Cowboy Carter. Shaboozey Credit: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Spotify Shaboozey, a genre-blurring artist whose country sensibilities have earned him a rapidly growing fan base and a Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper, could appear. His breakout song, \"A Bar Song (Tipsy),” has been a massive success, and his two collaborations with Beyoncé on Cowboy Carter were a match made in musical heaven. Mashable Top Stories Miley Cyrus Credit: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images Miley Cyrus, whose country-rock influences blend effortlessly with Beyoncé’s eclectic style, is another natural choice. Their collaboration on the soaring ballad \"II MOST WANTED\" gave the album a radio hit, and a live performance of this track would undoubtedly set the stage ablaze with Bey and Miley's powerhouse vocals. Dolly Parton \u0026 Willie Nelson Credit: Katherine Bomboy/NBC via Getty Images But what about the country legends who brought Cowboy Carter to life? Dolly Parton, whose iconic voice and timeless storytelling played a significant role in the album’s shaping, seems like a perfect candidate for a surprise cameo. The mere thought of Beyoncé and Dolly sharing the stage for a duet can make any fan's heart skip a beat. And then there’s Willie Nelson, whose laid-back charm and soulful guitar work could add a new layer to the performance. Both of these legends helped Beyoncé blend conventional country with her own unique sound, and their appearance during the halftime show could spark a moment that transcends genres and generations. Rhiannon Giddens Credit: Judith Burrows/Getty Images In addition to these stars, let’s not forget the contributions of Black country musicians who gave Cowboy Carter its depth and authenticity. Rhiannon Giddens, whose musicianship has reshaped the country genre, would be an incredible addition to a performance of \"Texas Hold 'Em.\" Her masterful contributions to the track on the banjo reflect the intersection of Black folk traditions with country music, and having her on stage would be a nod to the rich, often overlooked history of Black country musicians.Tanner Adell, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy, and Brittney Spencer L-R: Reyna Roberts, Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, and Tiera Kennedy Credit: John Shearer/Getty Images for CMT On Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé held space for the Black women in country music pushing its rigid boundaries. For her cover of the Beatles' 1968 hit \"Blackbird,\" Beyoncé was joined by Nashville artists Tanner Adell, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts, and Brittney Spencer. While we can’t say for certain who will join Beyoncé during her Christmas Day performance, one thing is clear: She has a knack for pulling off the unexpected. Whether it’s a legendary duet, an intimate family moment with her daughter Blue Ivy, or a surprise guest, Beyoncé knows how to share the stage while making sure all eyes stay on her.
