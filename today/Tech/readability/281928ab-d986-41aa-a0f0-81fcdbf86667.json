  "description": "If you have Spotify's soon-to-be-bricked Car Thing, there are a few ways you can give it a new lease on life. YouTuber Dammit Jeff has showcased modifications to Car Thing that makes the device useful as a desktop music controller, customizable shortcut tool, or a simple digital clock. Ars Technica's Kevin Purdy reports: Spotify had previously posted the code for its uboot and kernel to GitHub, under the very unassuming name \"spsgsb\" and with no announcement (as discovered by Josh Hendrickson). Jeff has one idea why the streaming giant might not have made much noise about it: \"The truth is, this thing isn't really great at running anything.\" It has half a gigabyte of memory, 4GB of internal storage, and a \"really crappy processor\" (Amlogic S905D2 SoC) and is mostly good for controlling music. How do you get in? The SoC has a built-in USB \"burning mode,\" allowing for a connected computer, running the right toolkit, to open up root access and overwrite its firmware. Jeff has quite a few issues getting connected (check his video description for some guidance), but it's \"drag and drop\" once you're in. Jeff runs through a few of the most popular options for a repurposed Car Thing: - DeskThing, which largely makes Spotify desk-friendly, but adds a tiny app store for weather (including Jeff's own WeatherWave), clocks, and alternate music controls - GlanceThing, which keeps the music controls but also provides some Stream-Deck-like app-launching shortcuts for your main computer. - Nocturne, currently invite-only, is a wholly redesigned Spotify interface that restores all its Spotify functionality.
