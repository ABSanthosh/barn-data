As Mashable's Tech Editor, I have way too many charging cables, power blocks, and USB-C blocks in my apartment. But there aren't many that I actually like to use. While most chargers are simply necessary evils, only one of these products has earned permanent status in my bedside AC outlet.The Charger, from under-the-radar brand Counterpart, solves the biggest problem with most USB-C wall chargers — it features a retractable cable that snakes up inside the device when it's not in use. That means no annoying cable cluttering up your desk, countertops, or bedroom. It's one of those ingenious product innovations that makes you wonder, \"Why aren't all chargers like this?\" You have to be pretty confident in your charger to name it The Charger. And I think it's worthy of the name. Because on top of its innovative design, this puck-shaped charger also looks attractive, which isn't something I can say about any other charging product I own. (And, again, there are so many). Mashable Light Speed This 35W USB-C charger features a retractable four-foot ribbon cable. When not in use, simply press a button on the front of the device, and the cable retracts like a tape measure. As you can see in my video review, it's immensely satisfying. And as a GaN charger, it offers more efficient charging than the average device. While you can find some chargers with retractable cables for cars, this is one of the only options for the home. Yes, the $44 price tag may give you pause, but it's well worth it for a product that's attractive, functional, and comes with a two-year warranty. These chargers also make great gifts, especially if you're looking for stocking stuffers or under-$50 gift ideas. The Charger comes in five different color options and can be purchased at the Counterpart online store.
