  "text": "Apple is always under pressure on Prime Day and this year is no different, particularly as far as their tablets are concerned. The iPad, iPad Air, and iPad Mini are all getting major reductions although these are only available to Prime members who shop through Amazon. One of the most interesting deals is the newest 2025 iPad Mini (128GB, WiFi) which is now down to a record low of $379 from its typical $499. See at Amazon Best in Class Mini Tablet The 2025 iPad Mini brings the full iPad experience to an ultraportable form: With an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, you get vivid colors, sharp detail and advanced features like P3 wide color, True Tone, and ultra-low reflectivity. That makes everything you do from reading and streaming to gaming and editing photos look sharp and interesting. The display is large enough to be productive and creative but the iPad Mini is lightweight and simple to carry with you wherever you go. Powering the new iPad Mini at its core is the A17 Pro chip that delivers blistering performance and ultrawide graphics. Whether it’s multitasking between apps or 4K video editing or graphics-heavy game playing, the iPad Mini handles it with ease. With 128GB of storage, there is plenty of space. All-day battery life also ensures that you are able to use your iPad Mini from morning until evening without going in hunt of a charger. Apple Intelligence is also included in this model and offers a personal intelligence system to aid you in writing, editing, and getting things done more efficiently. With privacy protection included, your data is secure, and you can confidently use your device in any way you prefer. The iPad Mini runs on iPadOS which is designed for productivity and creativity. You can use multiple apps simultaneously, take notes or sketch with the Apple Pencil Pro and download over a million apps from the App Store. The 12MP Ultra Wide front camera has Center Stage which perfectly frames you during video calls and selfies. The 12MP camera on the rear, which is accompanied by a True Tone flash, is ideal for document scanning, photography and recording 4K videos. If you’re looking for a compact yet powerful tablet, the 2025 iPad Mini at $379 is an incredible deal. See at Amazon",
