  "text": "How do you add more to \"unlimited\"? As carriers offer unlimited talk, text and data on their wireless plans, Xfinity Mobile's answer is to launch a new Premium Unlimited plan that includes high-resolution streaming, 30GB of fast hotspot data per month and, for customers chasing the latest phones, the ability to upgrade devices twice per year. The Premium Unlimited plan is available now. Here's a breakdown of what you'll get.More perks for PremiumThe Premium Unlimited Plan, which costs $30 per line on top of required Xfinity Internet service, includes unlimited full-speed data. That's a boost over the regular Unlimited plan, which throttles data speeds after 30GB.For mobile hotspot usage, the Premium Unlimited plan includes 30GB of data before speeds are reduced. By comparison, the Unlimited plan offers only slower speeds, although both plans give you unlimited hotspot data so you won't be cut off.Also unique to the Premium Unlimited plan is 4K resolution video streaming (the Unlimited plan serves up only 480p standard resolution) and Xfinity Call Guard service for intercepting spam calls.Xfinity Mobile uses Verizon's network for 5G and 4G LTE cellular access, but also leans heavily on its installed base of home and business internet service with modems that double as public Wi-Fi hotspots. Both the Premium Unlimited and Unlimited plans feature WiFi PowerBoost, which can automatically hop onto a Wi-Fi connection and deliver faster speeds, up to 1GB, according to Xfinity.The company states that more than 90% of mobile data traffic happens over Wi-Fi. If you're connected at home (and your Xfinity service uses an XB7 or XB8 Gateway to route the data), your phone can get the faster speeds, even if you're not paying for that level of bandwidth.Stay on top of the newest phonesIf you know someone who replaces their phone every year for the newest model, you can literally one-up them by being on the Premium Unlimited plan. The new Elite Upgrade option allows for twice-yearly phone upgrades with a \"guaranteed new-device discount of up to $830 with an eligible trade-in,\" according to the company.For those switching from another carrier, Xfinity Mobile will pay up to $500 per line for as many as five lines to buy out existing contracts.See more: Discover the Best Phones for 2025.
