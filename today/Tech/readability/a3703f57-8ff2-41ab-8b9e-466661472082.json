To amplify the enjoyment, you’ll need a VPN that can unblock some terrific shows and movies and protect your privacy. Worry not, NordVPN’s crazy Holiday discounts are here for that! NordVPN is now 74% off for the Basic 2-year plan at only $2.99/mo. That’s not the end. Amidst the Holiday season, NordVPN has two more 24-month plans cut down. All 2-year plans are also decorated by 3 extra months for the best value. See at NordVPN Save 74% on NordVPN Basic Interested in making the leap of faith and jump right onto the hype train? Look no further than NordVPN’s 24-month Basic plan with 3 free months, 74% off, and the price of only $2.99/mo.

However, NordVPN offers two more plans that you can capitalize on during the Holiday season: NordVPN Plus at $3.89/mo for 27 months NordVPN Ultimate at $7.89/mo for 27 months These plans extend NordVPN’s capabilities beyond the “standard” security. For example, the Plus plan includes Threat Protection Pro, which shields against malware, viruses, and other threats. NordPass is also there for the ultimate password management and control. The Ultimate plan is the best. It includes everything we mentioned PLUS NordLocker 1 TB and NordProtect.

Buying NordLocker or NordPass separately would be a lot more expensive, making this bundle extremely satisfying. Why choose this VPN over another? NordVPN is the most popular VPN in the world. It’s simultaneously the largest VPN company, with the most satisfying users. We can leave you with this sentence and call it a day. Okay? Of course not!
