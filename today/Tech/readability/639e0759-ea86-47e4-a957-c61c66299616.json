Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: AdGuard VPN A good VPN works like a bouncer for your internet traffic, keeping snoops out while letting you move freely. AdGuard VPN is one of those solid, no-nonsense choices that does exactly what it promises. Right now, StackSocial is offering a five-year AdGuard VPN subscription for just $39.97, a steep drop from its regular price. That’s five years of private browsing, streaming, and secure connections across most major platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, and up to 10 simultaneous connections (making it great for multi-device users without juggling logins). If you like the idea of browsing without trackers and being able to access geo-restricted content without hassle, this deal makes sense. Just a heads-up, though—this offer is only for new users, and you’ll need to redeem it within 30 days of buying.Performance-wise, AdGuard VPN uses AES-256 and its proprietary protocol, which is supposed to be faster and harder to detect than the usual VPN options. That means fewer annoying speed drops, which is a win if you stream a lot or hate buffering. It also offers over 60 server locations, covering key regions without overwhelming you with choices, so finding a decent connection shouldn’t be an issue. More importantly, AdGuard sticks to a strict no-logs policy, meaning it won’t track your browsing or sell your data to advertisers, unlike some other VPNs. What do you think so far? AdGuard VPN is best suited for anyone looking for a low-maintenance, long-term privacy solution without monthly bills. It’s easy to set up, has a clean interface, and works well for everyday browsing and security. Five years of coverage for under forty bucks is hard to beat, and if you don’t like it, at least you won’t be locked into another high-priced subscription.
