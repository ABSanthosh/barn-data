  "text": "How Ricken Hale helped me become the me I are. Credit: Severance / Apple TV+ Fans of Apple TV+'s Severance, your day is about to be improved: Apple has released eight chapters of The You You Are, the fictional self-help book by Dr. Ricken Lazlo Hale that is central to the plot of the show. If you want to read it, you can even download it for free, or listen to the audiobook version, narrated by Ricken himself (actor Michael Chernus).The brief excerpts from The You You Are that have appeared in Severance are among the funniest bits in the show, but the book as released isn't just for laughs: It's also a great representation of how propaganda works, both in the Severance universe and in real life. In the \"outie\" world of the show, The You You Are is a joke, a pretentious self-help book only fools take seriously. But in the world of the innies, an ill-gotten copy of The You You Are is seen as a work of towering genius with the power to change lives and change the world. This is only because the sole other book in the Lumon office is The Compliance Handbook, a ponderous, quasi-religious text that exists only so Lumon can keep control of its employees. The innies' reaction to Ricken's work reminds me of those people who read half a book (or a single headline) and suddenly think they know everything about a complex topic, and who hasn't met a few of them?What is The You You Are about?Ricken's book excerpt is hilarious and in keeping with the show's darkly comic style. It opens with, “It’s said that as a child, Wolfgang Mozart killed another boy by slamming his head in a piano. Don’t worry. My research for this book has proven the claim untrue,” and continues in that vein. Ricken's book purports to be a practical guide to self-improvement, where readers are meant to gain self-knowledge by following a series of steps:Figure out your YouType (more on that below), write it on a piece of paper and affix it to your vanity.Write your name on another post-it and tape it next to your YouType.Choose a theology and add a \"totem\" of it to your YouShrine. “This could be a Christianman’s cross, an An-Ra Scarab, or a Masonic square and compass,\" Ricken writes, also suggesting you can \"use a photo or etching of me.\"Add something you consider sexy. As the author puts it: \"Something that whispers to your nethers in a voice only they can hear. This may be a pinup photo from wartimes of yore, a beloved undergarment, or a still life of a sinewy gourd.\" Ricken also suggest you can use a picture of him for this step.Think of an insult you've heard. Write an acrostic poem using the letter of each word of the insult and add it to your vanity. Ricken goes with \"Everyone laughs at you the second you walk out of the fucking room,\" which was once said to him by Severance main character Mark S. Print out a copy of a poem that Ricken wrote and paste it to your vanity. “Conceive and found a charitable organization based on a cause that you hold dear...Whether you wish to curtail bear populations, bathe the infirm, or send bottled water to astronauts, stay the course until the organization is procedurally viable. Then, once your licensing paperwork comes in, affix it to the vanity amongst your other totems.”This is where the excerpt ends. Too bad; I hear page 197 slaps. Does The You You Are include any clues about the plot of Severance?In Chapter 3, Ricken mentions going to a theater to see \"an American religious satire film which I consider to be the most over-celebrated piece of commercial cinema ever produced,\" a film we know as Sister Act. There's other evidence in the show, but the Sister Act bit confirms that Severance takes place somewhere around now in something like our world, despite the ancient computers and everyone driving cars from the '80s and '90s. The You You Are also gives us a ton of backstory about Ricken's character and history. For instance, he was conceived and born as part of a \"nine-month performance art piece originated by [his] parents titled 'Smells Like Afterbirth, F**ker.'” There's no information about how, exactly, Ricken has enough money to afford his relatively lavish lifestyle. It certainly isn't from sales of his books, and his parents were performance artists, so it's not likely to be family money either—unless, as some have theorized online, that Ricken is actually a black sheep member of the Eagan clan. Maybe the most important thing in The You You Are are the passages where we learn about Ricken's feelings toward Mark's (maybe) dead wife Gemma. When Ricken writes about Gemma, he seems to be in love with her. This could be a red herring, but as Severance unfolds, I wouldn't be surprised if Ricken's feelings toward Gemma become a major plot point.The deeper meaning of The You You Are within the Severance universeThe \"big idea\" behind Ricken's book is the \"YouType,\" the kind of made-up psychological concept common to self-help books, pseudo science, and cults—think \"love languages,\" the Myers-Briggs personality inventory, and Scientology's \"emotional tone scale.\"According to Ricken, everyone fits into one of five YouTypes: The Coward, The Warrior, The Dove, The Scribe, and The Vestal. This mirrors the idea behind Lumon's Compliance Manual. According to Kier Eagan, there are four \"tempers,\" Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice, and everyone else are defined by the ratio of each within themselves. Kier's ponderous religiosity and Rickens' brain-dead aphorisms seem like two sides of the same coin. In the show, when the \"powers that be\" at Lumon discover the book has inspired the innies to revolt, their reaction isn't to ban or discredit The You You Are. Instead, they approach Ricken with an offer to write a new version of the book, specifically for innies. Ricken, ever the egotist and attention seeker, is eager to go ahead with the project so at least someone will take his book seriously. Lumon's plan is no doubt to coopt the (unintentionally) subversive ideas in Ricken's book and twist them to support the Lumon status quo. It's not a heavy lift, given the book contains passages like, \"A society with festering workers cannot flourish, just as a man with rotting toes cannot skip.”This is all a sly commentary on how revolutionary ideas are routinely manipulated and co-opted to serve the ruling class, and how easily people can be tricked into feeling like they're \"sticking it to the Man,\" even when the Man is at once profiting and protecting itself by taking the teeth out of dangerous ideas. Think Wal-Mart selling Che Guevara t-shirts, or one of the richest corporations in the world making a TV show about the dehumanization and misery of corporate drudgery.
