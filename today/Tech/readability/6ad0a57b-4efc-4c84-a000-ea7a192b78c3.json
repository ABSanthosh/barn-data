If you buy something through links on our site, Mashable may earn an affiliate commission. No matter the gifting occasion, you want to wow your mom. She sacrificed a lot for you, and now you're in a place where you can show her how grateful you are. Part of our larger series dedicated to the Best Gifts for Everyone, this list of gifts for mom attempts to dismantle the played-out tropes that have plagued moms at major holidays for dedicates. When gifting to your mom (or any mom, for that matter) consider hyper-specific things that speak to her unique hobbies or interests. Your mom (or mom figure) should revel in her own glory with gifts that make her feel smart, sophisticated, and valued. Consider what she does when she has no one putting demands on her time — then shop for those moments. And if you get stuck, visit our guide to the best gifts under $50 for even more winning ideas. Rain Shower Head Best for moms who need to relax Gift your mom a trip to the spa every time she takes a shower with this luxurious, high-pressure fixture. Available in chrome and black, it comes with both a rain shower style head and a detachable shower wand that has five different spray settings. At 12 inches wide, it'll be like standing under a waterfall — in the best way possible. An electric composter Best for moms who have a garden Composting is the eco-friendly art of recycling food scraps into garden-ready fertilizer. Vitamix's FoodCycler makes indoor composting possible (and easy) — it's particularly handy for people who don't want to deal with worms. It's no bigger than a toaster oven and silently converts scraps into a soil-like substance. Best of all, it's not stinky like a trash can. SPONSORED A subscription to Hulu Best for watching her shows Comfy chair? Check. Remote in hand? Double check. Now get Mom set up with access to all her favorite shows. Sign her up for a subscription to Hulu + Live TV for $59.99 per month for 3 months from now through Nov. 19. As part of the deal she’ll also get access to Disney+ and ESPN+, so there will be plenty of entertainment options for you to watch together next time you visit. (It’s what she really wants, anyway.) A Roomba robot vacuum Best for multitasking moms The simple truth is that no one needs to push around a vacuum anymore. Robot vacuums are a little piece of futuristic tech that we are totally obsessed with — and we know your mom will be too. Here's a thought: pop on a movie and spend some quality time with your mom while the robots take over. SPONSORED An Alienware gaming monitor Best for gamer moms Elevate your mom's PC gaming experience with a curved monitor. This is the kind of gift every gamer mom would love to get, but definitely won't splurge on for themselves. The 32-inch QD-OLED monitor features a 4K resolution with a coveted curved design that creates a more immersive experience that's particularly suited to gaming. An Apple Watch Series 9 Best for Apple fans Whether she's always jetting off to a workout class or just needs to keep track of her millions of weekly appointments, the new Apple Watch Series 9 is a must-have for moms who are die-hard Apple users. The new smartwatch features a speedy new chip, a bright display, and a fun Double Tap hands-free feature. An automatic wine opener Best for the wine enthusiast She'll be thankful for this when the only thing that stands between her and her post-work glass of vino is a stubborn cork. Pressing the \"down\" side of the button will pull the cork up and out, while the \"up\" side unscrews it off the end. A long-distance touch lamp Best for moms who live far away These colorful touch lamps let your mom know you're thinking about her in real time while doubling as decor. After each person connects their lamp to WiFi, they'll sync up, and a quick tap sends a message to the other. (A touch to one lamp will make the other light up.) Get them in a pair or as many as you need to keep the whole fam connected. SPONSORED The Frame TV Best for moms with Pinterest-worthy homes Here's the thing about big-screen televisions: They're an eyesore. For the mom who appreciates aesthetics, Samsung's The Frame is here to make her day. The ultra flat screen smart TV looks like any other wall art when not in use, seamlessly blending into the decor and thus creating a more well-appointed space. A temperature-controlled mug Best for tea connoisseurs Instead of gifting yet another mug that'll collect dust, try the Ember Mug 2 — it'll become her new go-to. It's a temperature-controlled smart mug that keeps drinks at her desired temperature (120 through 145 degrees Fahrenheit), which she can choose in the app. Oh, and its charger doubles as a coaster. Sony noise-canceling headphones Best for moms who need peace Is your mom constantly being interrupted by everyone else in the house? If so, help her build a wall around her alone time with some noise-canceling headphones. Sony's flagship pair are chic and have some of the best sound-blocking tech out there. (Great for flying, too.) Better yet, they're frequently on sale for $278. SPONSORED Diamond tennis bracelet Best for moms who like bling Dazzle your mom with something sparkly — it's the kind of gift you know she'll love, but won't ever get for herself. Blue Nile has lots of gorgeous options, but we are partial to this understated diamond tennis bracelet. For a limited time, get 50% off select jewelry during Blue Nile's Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday sales. Roses that last a year Best for moms who love flowers Gifting flowers isn't cliché if it's done right. Venus Et Fleur's roses are treated with a proprietary solution to keep them looking fresh for up to a year. The packaging itself is also beautiful, and you can choose a single rose or a whole bouquet. Not sure if you believe the hype? Just ask Gigi Hadid or Sarah Jessica Parker — they're both fans. Hardside luggage Best for moms who pack way too much Moms overpack simply because they are the queens of being prepared, and that's that. The 21-inch Freeform spinner suitcase by Samsonite has a durable shell that expands to squeeze the necessities in (without going over those annoying carry-on size requirements). Choose from 12 colors to find one that best fits your mom's style. A Dyson Supersonic Best for moms with long locks She spent years putting you before her hair care routine. Now, you can gift her a salon-level blowout every time she washes her hair. The Supersonic is Dyson's first high-end hair dryer that uses a high-velocity jet of controlled air for extra-fast drying and precise styling on all hair types. It goes so far as to measure its own temperature every 20 seconds to prevent heat-related damage and frizz. A Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle Best for pour-over coffee fans Some people just *know* that pour-over coffee reigns supreme and that tea tastes better when the water is just the right temperature. If your mom is a part of this club, get her this stylish, minimalist kettle. It has temperature control from 135 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and will look great in her kitchen. A Ninja Foodi Best for moms expanding their menu Air frying has been *the* cooking method in the spotlight for the past few years, beloved for its ability to achieve a crispy texture without using an excessive amount of oil. The Ninja Foodi takes the place of an air fryer as well as a pressure cooker, broiler, and more, saving some serious storage space in the kitchen. A Yeti Rambler tumbler Best for moms on the go This durable 20-ounce tumbler has double-wall insulation that'll keep your mom's beverages at her desired temperature until the very last drop. (Bonus: Both it and its lockable magnetic lid are dishwasher-safe.) It comes in more than 10 colors, so you're sure to find one in her favorite shade. A Philips Hue starter kit Best for keeping her home cozy Smart lightbulbs: Because no one likes coming home to a dark house. (Or getting up to flick a switch once they're comfy in bed). This particular kit contains a hub and four white Philips Hue bulbs, which Mom can control using their companion mobile app or by talking to her go-to smart assistant; it works with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Homekit. A bathtub tray Best for the stressed mom This convenient bathtub caddy has spots for a tablet or phone, a wine glass, and a candle — or whatever else your mom needs to have for a relaxing bath. The extending sides make the tray adjustable and compatible with most bathtubs. An espresso maker Best for moms who love coffee Moms who refuse to be addressed before they've had their coffee know that some mornings require a little extra zing. She'll appreciate being able to add a shot or two to her mug by simply hitting a button on her Nespresso Vertuo Next. Available in white and dark grey, this compact machine can whip up barista-level espresso and rich regular coffee. Jungalow Hook Pillows Best for the home If she’d never be satisfied with run-of-the-mill throw pillows, Jungalow offers a huge variety of fun and unique hook designs. We're talking everything from pomegranates to matching rainbow sets, plus designs like the popout flowers of the Primavera Pillow or the lounging feline on the lumbar-supporting Tigress Pom Pom Pillow. A Tile tracker Best for moms who lose stuff Ah, the perfect gift for any mother who’s ever uttered the phrase, \"I wish I could call my keys.\" The Tile Mate Bluetooth tracker attaches easily to keyrings, but she can stick it to pretty much anything she has a habit of misplacing. Have her install the companion smartphone app so she can ring the Mate every time the object in question goes MIA. (She can also press a button on the Mate to do the reverse if her phone decides to wander away.) A portable printer Best for nostalgic moms A mom who loves digging through old photo albums would also probably love to be able to add to that collection whenever she wants. With Fujifilm's Instax Mini Link 2, she can print photos (using real instant film!) directly from her smartphone's camera roll via Bluetooth anytime, anywhere — no need to lug around any separate equipment. A personalized ring dish Best for sentimental moms While there are a ton of sites and stores that sell personalized ring dishes, we're particular fans of ThePaintedPress, a California-based Etsy shop that sells clay pieces with adorable hand-painted designs. Each dish starts at $17, and you can choose to add extra details like a heart, a name or phrase, or a floral arrangement for a few bucks more. A hanging egg chair Best for moms who love their yard If your mom is one to insist on sitting outside on every warm night, this egg-shaped swing will give her an ultra-relaxing place to do so. Made from weather-resistant resin wicker and steel for sturdiness, it'll look great on a porch or in the yard, and comes complete with a comfy cushion. A MasterClass subscription Best for the mom with a dream hobby Has your mom ever wanted to take up interior design? Has she ever thought about getting into screenwriting? What's the status of her wilderness survival skills? There's a MasterClass for all of that (and then some). Sign her up for a year-long subscription to the online learning platform, and she'll get unlimited access to an ever-changing library of over 100 celebrity-taught classes. A Bluetooth record player Best for moms who enjoy the oldies Take your mom back to her younger years with this fully automatic turntable from Sony, which finds a happy medium between modern technology and nostalgia. She can blast her favorite LPs throughout the house by connecting it to a Bluetooth speaker or soundbar, and even rip them into digital MP3 files for on-the-go listening via USB. An earring subscription box Best for moms who like to accessorize Gifting subscription boxes can sometimes be expensive, but EarFleek will send your mom a new pair of earrings every month for as low as $4.33 per month. That's way cheaper than most earrings in stores, and you get free shipping to boot. (They won't just be random earrings, either: You can personalize the boxes based on your mom's personal style.) The LUNA mini 3 Best for skincare-obsessed moms The next best thing to a professional facial, the LUNA mini 3 is an app-controlled cleansing brush that can help Mom tackle her skincare routine like a pro. Suitable for all skin types, it pulsates gently for a deep clean, promising great-looking and softer-feeling skin in just minutes. (For especially busy moms, there's also a 30-second Glow Boost mode). The Philips SmartSleep Best for sleep-deprived moms This specialty alarm clock is designed to wake the user up naturally by gradually increasing its light intensity, starting 30 minutes before her wake-up time. (It basically mimics a sunrise.) By the time her room is filled with light, the alarm will set off a beep. This is ideal if your mom struggles to get up in the morning, or if she just wants a gentler morning routine. An Amazon Prime membership Best for a gift that keeps giving If she's still using someone else's Prime membership, bring her up to date by gifting her one of her own. She'll get perks like free two-day shipping, access to Prime Video and Music, free Kindle ebooks, grocery delivery, one free year of Grubhub+, and more. A smart plug Best for the techie mom While many of us are all set with smart devices, a smart plug might help her streamline her smart home one step further. It might not seem like the most exciting gift at first glance, but it’ll allow her to automate everything from her living floor lamps to her essential oil diffuser. Some nice hand cream Best for the mom who loves a manicure You really can’t go wrong with a tube of L'Occitane hand cream — especially if Mom is regularly complaining about dry hands or cuticles. This fast-absorbing shea butter cream is one of the best we’ve found and will help her hands remain healthy and moisturized — even into the winter. Some SK-II Facial Treatment Masks Best for at-home facials Looking for a luxurious gift for mom? Consider picking up a pack of SK-II facial masks. These high-end masks are a favorite among beauty experts because they're full of moisturizing ingredients that melt into the skin. A Le Creuset utensil set Best for elevating her kitchen counters Sure, she probably doesn’t need a five-piece utensil set, but this little Le Creuset gift set will still some elegance to her kitchen counter. Available in classic Le Creuset colors, this charming pack is both affordable and sophisticated. A fancy humidifier Best for the interior-design minded mom Humidifiers are great for skin, plants, and health in general, especially during winter months. They're a nice addition to any space, but to be honest, not a lot of them are design-friendly. Your mom might not treat herself to a more expensive humidifier simply because its prettier, but that's what makes this Vitruvi pick especially great as a gift. Plus, the interior can be cleaned in the dishwasher and it makes almost no sound. A fancy bathrobe Best for encouraging spa vibes If your mom is a go-getter type, encourage her to kick back and relax with a spa-like robe. Made of 100% Turkish cotton, Brooklinen's stylish robe will help your mom get into a calm state of mind and make her feel like she lives in a luxury resort. An upgraded towel set Best for updating mom's bathroom If she's still using the towels you also used when you lived in her house as a kid, it's time for a much-needed upgrade. The Parachute Soft Rib towels are plush, super absorbent, and the earthy tones will look great in any bathroom.
