  "text": "DreamWorks Animation, Sony Pictures Animation, Walt Disney Animation, LAIKA, WB Animation, and more have contributed to the fundraising efforts. The animation industry in partnership with ASIFA-Hollywood has launched AnimAID, and a fundraising auction at Sotheby’s is set to raise money for industry folks affected by the LA wildfires. The Walt Disney Company, Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation, LAIKA, and more big studios have all donated an array of rare and unique pieces of animation art for interested parties to bid on. The online auction opened this week with the hopes of aiding artists and professionals within the animation industry who are facing displacement or have lost their homes as the city of Los Angeles continues to come together and rebuild. Animation producer Don Hahn (Beauty and The Beast, Howard) spoke on behalf of the cause on Instagram: “The animation community was hit hard by the Los Angeles fires. Now the animation world is banded together by donating artwork, priceless artwork to Sotheby’s for a very special auction to benefit an organization called AnimAID and those profits will go completely to victims of the LA fires.” The curation of over 90 years of incredible art draws from both cinema and television, including Snow White, The Simpsons, Inside Out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Wild Robot, Beauty and the Beast, Avatar, and other beloved titles. Hahn continued, “Every bid makes a difference and helps people rebuild their homes and their lives.” The exhibition’s bidding is now ongoing and here’s a look at some of the pieces that are up for auction. Items also include film industry artist commissions, tours of the animation studios, signed posters, and more, as well as original production drawings and animation cells.
