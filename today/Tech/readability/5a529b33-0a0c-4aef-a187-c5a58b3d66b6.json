Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Product image courtesy of Amazon. Apple's AirTags use the Find My network to track just about anything you can put them on, like car keys, luggage, or even a dog's collar. Right now, Amazon has a four-pack on sale for $69.99 (originally $99), matching the record-low price, according to price-checking tools. If you're a Prime Member, you'll be getting them before Christmas. AirTags are useful gadgets, and their usefulness extends to your creativity. They are mostly marketed for purses, keys, and travel bags, but there are examples of people using them much more creatively (the author of this Reddit post used it on their dog collar and trained it to come back whenever they pressed the \"play sound\" feature). It works by using Apple's network of iOS devices to create a Bluetooth network. Essentially, every person with an iPhone (or iPad) is part of this iOS network, and as long as one of these people is within Bluetooth range of your AirTag, it will show up on your Find My app.As you can see on PCMag's \"excellent\" review of the AirTag, the Find My app has a screen that points you in the direction of your AirTag like a compass, including the distance away it is from you. There is also an option to play a sound, which is perfect for, say, finding a remote that's buried under the couch. Once you are more than 30 feet from your phone, the network of iOS users will kick in. When the AirTag is below that range, it uses your own Bluetooth. There are security measures in place set by Apple, including end-to-end encryption so nobody (not even Apple) knows where your AirTag is except for you. The batteries last about a year and are replaceable. There is also no monthly charge for these, unlike competitors like Tile for Android users.
