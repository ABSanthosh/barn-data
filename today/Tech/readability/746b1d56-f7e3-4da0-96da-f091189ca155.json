Aaron Taylor-Johnson stars as Kraven the Hunter in \"Kraven the Hutner.\" Credit: Sony Pictures Since Nick Fury first broke into Tony Stark's cliffside mansion, comic books fans have been primed to expect bonus goods once the credits roll on the superhero movies. The MCU has unleashed jaw-dropping cameos, bizarre callbacks, and teases for future adventures, and Sony Pictures followed super suit. At the end of Morbius, a cameo of Michael Keaton as Adrian \"The Vulture\" Toomes seemingly tied this movie to the MCU's Spider-Man: Homecoming, in which he was the Big Bad. More recently, the post-credits scene in Venom: The Last Dance revealed the fate of a character caught in the military-versus-symbiote crossfire — and set up a path to a could-be sequel. However, what path forward might Kraven the Hunter tease when The Wrap is reporting Sony's closing up shop on Spider-Man spinoffs for now? Mashable Top Stories Does Kraven the Hunter have a post-credit scene? Nope. At the film's New York premiere, critics, cast, and crew who stayed through the credits saw the long list of names of all the people who worked on J.C. Chandor's curious action movie. But there was not a post-credit scene with bonus goodies. However, seeing the incredible amount of people power that went into Kraven the Hunter is its own reward, right? Kraven the Hunter opens only in theaters Dec. 13. Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.
