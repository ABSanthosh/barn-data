Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Ian Moore Another Prime Day sale has come and gone. Well, mostly anyway. \"October Prime Day\" (which Amazon officially referred to as \"Prime Big Deal Days,\" but the company was pretty much the only one) officially ran from Oct. 8-9, offering big discounts on items across hundreds of product categories. Though the sale is over, some killer deals are still live.Here are 17 of Lifehacker's favorite October Prime Day deals, as recommended by our staff, that you can still take advantage of (as of the time of this writing, anyway—these prices could change at any time too). The best MacBook for most people is $750For years, Lifehacker Tech Editor Jake Peterson has called the M1 MacBook Air the best MacBook for most people, especially considering it regularly went on sale for $750. It's time to update that advice, because now the two-years-newer M2 MacBook Air, with an even faster chip, seems to have taken over at that $750 sale price point. Honestly, I have been using an M1 for four years and it still works like new, but why not get the newer model, I ask you? A basic iPad for a killer priceThough it dates from 2021 and still has a physical Home Button and older screen tech, the ninth generation iPad is still a pretty great device, particularly if you're looking for something not too pricey for the kids to bang around. Right now, this model is edging into \"ridiculously cheap\" territory at $199, down from $329. (If you want something fancier, there are more deals where this one came from.) AirPods Pro for $60 offApple updated its basic AirPods earlier this year, and while the AirPods 4 are great headphones, they aren't on much of a sale right now, and they lack many of the features of the pricier AirPods Pro. At the moment the 2nd gen Pros are $60 off, not quite as low as yesterday, but still not too bad. The Beats Fit Pro (my preferred AirPods Pro alternative) AirPods are iconic, but my preferred Apple-made active noise canceling headphones are actually the Beats Fit Pro. They do most everything the AirPods Pro can do, thanks to the inclusion of the Apple H1 chip (including in-ear detection, Find My tracking, and spatial audio), they come in fun colors, and they don't have those stupid looking AirPod stems (but maybe that last point only matters to me). Anyway, they're also a lot cheaper than the AirPods Pro—right now you can get them for $150, a 25% discount. Apple's pricey AirPods Max, significantly less priceyIf earbuds aren't your jam and you're still all-in on the Apple ecosystem, you've probably been lusting after the enviable, top-of-the-line AirPods Max for as long as I have. The wireless cans are still Apple's premiere audiophile offering even years after their initial release. This year's upgrade added only a USB-C charing port, but if you're willing to stick with using a Lightning cable, you can pick up these puppies for $155 off the $550 list price. The Beats Studio Pro headphones for more than half offApple-owned Beats makes great headphones that happen to work really well with Android devices too. I personally prefer my Beats Fit Pro earbuds (currently 25% off for Prime Day!) to Apple's AirPods Pro. Were I in the market for some new over-the-ear headphones, I'd give serious thought to the well-reviewed Beats Studio Pros—especially at 51% off. At $169, they're cheap enough that you could buy a pair and some fancy earbuds and still come in under the price of the AirPods Max. An Apple Watch for less than $170The Apple Watch now rivals the iPhone and iPad for the sheer number of models on the market, and choosing the best one for you can be tricky. But if a combination of great features and a reasonable price is your sweet spot, I recommend going with the 2nd generation of the Apple Watch SE from 2022, currently $170 (down from a list price of $250). Yeah, it's a couple years old, but it still does all the things most people want out of an Apple Watch, from health tracking to syncing all the notifications from your phone. I just got one for my middle school-aged daughter, because I'm a huge sucker. A bigger QLED TV for a ridiculously low priceTime was, giant widescreen TVs were luxury items, but if Prime Day has taught us anything, it's that a screen big enough to occupy an entire wall of your home is well within your reach—and you don't have to settle for a no-name brand either. While there are a lot of good (and big) TVs on sale, I'm eyeing this 58-inch QLED model from Hisense, which is currently nearly 40% off. An HD projector so sharp, you won't miss your TVSure, you could buy a series of ever-larger TVs, or you could just get a projector and go big without centering your decor around a big black rectangle. Lifehacker's deals guru Daniel Oropeza recommends the Yaber K2S 800, an indoor/outdoor 4K projector with Dolby audio and built in support for streaming apps. It's currently $400, 33% off the usual $600 price. A floodlight camera that can see a lot moreYou needn't limit yourself to a limited field of view from your outdoor floodlight. Our smart home reviewer Amanda Blum says that eufy cameras are the ones she prefers (when she's not testing other cameras) and today she's highlighting the Prime Day deal on the eufy Security Floodlight Cam S330, which offers a 360 degree field of view with tilt and pan controls—and there's no monthly fee required, as it includes 8GB of local storage. A PlayStation 5 that doesn't cost $700Last month, Sony received a mixed reception to its announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro, a minor upgrade to its flagship console with a major upgrade in price, with some models going for more than $700. If that's too rich for your blood but you still want to get in on the tail end of this console generation, it's a pretty good time to grab a regular ol' PlayStation 5 Slim edition. Right now, the disc-based version is $50 off, coming in at just under $450. A three-pack of water leak sensors that could save you big on repair billsA couple years of editing our smart home writer Amanda Blum's posts have opened my eyes to all the areas of my home I'm not paying attention to, and how various sensors could be doing the job for me. Case in point: These leak detecting sensors from Aqara, which will alert you when they detect water where it shouldn't be. If you own a home, you know why that's a big deal, because the sooner you find a leak, the less damage that errant water will do. Certainly seems worth investing $38 for a three-pack (down from $55). A Nespresso with a milk frother, if you mustLook, I'm a coffee snob. I don't try to hide it. And while I generally eschew pod- or packet-based coffeemakers of any sort, I cannot deny they are really convenient, especially if you want to make a fancy espresso drink. We might even have one that I got off someone's stoop in Brooklyn. If you have no such stoop-based marketplace thriving near you, right now is a good time to buy one: The Nespresso Veruto Pop+ makes coffee and espresso and includes a milk frother, so you can play barista in your kitchen. It's currently about $54 off for Prime Day. (Use the savings to pick up a bunch of coffee pods.) A six-cup Vitamix blenderLong considered the white whale of wedding registries, the Vitamix blender is always a pricey purchase, but you'll feel the sting a little less if you can get a good discount. The Vitamix Explorian blender has a 1340-watt motor and stainless steel blades that can pulverize entire fruits, with a large six-cup capacity. Normatec compression boots (and a budget version)I don't work out often (unless a brisk walk to Aldi counts), but Lifehacker Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki sure does, and she's excited about this deal on Normatec boots: \"These boots massage your legs while you relax after a workout,\" she says. \"Normatec makes the iconic version of these boots, on sale today for $699.99 (normally $799.99). If you’re looking for a more budget-friendly compression boot, try the QUINEAR for $279.99.\" This Bulgarian split squats standObviously this one is all Beth too (did you know she's a competitive weight lifter?). \"Bulgarian split squats (BSS), a lunge-like exercise, are traditionally done with your rear leg on something like a bench,\" Beth says. \"But if you do this lift often, it’s really nice to have a stand with a roller to place your ankle on, instead of working awkwardly with a bench. Besides being more comfortable, the height is adjustable.\" It's currently   This delightfully silly pet toy/pet cameraAs Lifehacker's Stephen Johnston tells it, the Rola Cat Robot is \"a completely ridiculous but completely awesome robotic cat toy and surveillance camera\" responsible for bringing him as his feline friend Peepers closer together. \"It's an adorable little robot you can control with an app on your phone, and it takes surprisingly nice-looking 2K video, even when it's dark,\" Steve continues. \"It transmits and listens to sound, and you can press a button to make it meow, bark, or quack. It can even act as a surveillance camera and take pictures or video when something moves in front of it.\" You can use it to keep your cat or dog company while you're away, or just to keep an eye on your home. It's weird, but cool, and Isn't that the best way to spend your prime day dollars? It's $119, down from $150. The Best Amazon Prime Day Deals Right Now Deals are selected by our commerce team",
