  "text": "Version 3.5.11 of iTerm2 was built on January 2, 2025. This release contains a critical security fix. I strongly recommend updating immediately. Who is affected? ---------------- You may be affected if you used the SSH integration feature in any of the following versions: * 3.5.6 * 3.5.7 * 3.5.8 * 3.5.9 * 3.5.10 * Any beta versions of 3.5.6 and later. What is the issue? ------------------ A bug in the SSH integration feature caused input and output to be logged to a file on the remote host. This file, /tmp/framer.txt, may be readable by other users on the remote host. When does this occur? --------------------- The issue occurs if both of the following conditions are true: 1. Either: a) You used the it2ssh command, or b) In Settings \u003e Profiles \u003e General, the Command popup menu was set to \"SSH\" (not \"Login Shell\", \"Command\", or \"Custom Command\") AND \"SSH Integration\" was checked in the SSH configuration dialog. That dialog is shown when you click the Configure button next to the ssh arguments field in Settings. 2. The remote host has Python 3.7 or later installed in its default search path. What should you do? ------------------- * Upgrade immediately to version 3.5.11. * Delete /tmp/framer.txt on affected hosts. How I'm addressing this ----------------------- I deeply regret this mistake and will take steps to ensure it never happens again. The code to write to log files in SSH integration has been deleted and will not be publicly released again. If you have questions you can contact me at gnachman@gmail.com.
