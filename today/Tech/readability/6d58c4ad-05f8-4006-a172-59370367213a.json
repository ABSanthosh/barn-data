  "description": "Saturday night two men were arrested near Boston \"following a hazardous drone operation near Logan Airport's airspace,\" according to a police statement. They credit an officer \"leveraging advanced UAS monitoring technology\" who \"identified the drone's location, altitude, flight history, and the operators' position.\" Recognizing the serious risks posed by the drone's proximity to Logan's airspace, additional resources were mobilized. The Boston Police Department coordinated with Homeland Security, the Massachusetts State Police, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Logan Airport Air Traffic Control to address the situation. \"Both suspects face charges of trespassing, with additional fines or charges potentially forthcoming.\" Meanwhile on Friday night \"Officials at Stewart International Airport, located roughly 60 miles north of New York City, said they shut down their runways for an hour,\" reports ABC News, after America's Federal Aviation Administration \"alerted them that a drone was spotted in the area around 9:30 p.m.\" Though officials say flight operations weren't impacted during the closure, the article notes that New York's governor is now calling for federal assistance, including more federal law enforcement officers, saying \"This has gone too far.\" [Governor Hochul] called on Congress to pass the Counter-UAS Authority Security, Safety, and Reauthorization Act, which would strengthen the FAA's oversight of drones and give more authority to state and local law enforcement agencies to investigate the activity. The article explores the larger problem of Americans reporting drone sightings: Officials from a wide range of federal agencies spoke with reporters Saturday on a phone call and emphasized that the federal investigation into drone sightings in New Jersey is ongoing. One FBI official said that out of the nearly 5,000 tips they have received, less than 100 have generated credible leads for further investigation. A Department of Homeland Security official said that they are \"confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones.\" The FBI official also talked about how investigators overlaid the locations of the reported drone sightings and found that \"the density of reported sightings matches the approach pattern\" of the New York area's busy airports including Newark-Liberty, JFK, and LaGuardia. But, an FAA official says that there have \"without a doubt\" been drones flying over New Jersey, pointing to the fact that there are nearly a million drones registered in the U.S. \"With nearly a million registered [unmanned aircraft systems] in the United States, there's no doubt many of them are owned and operated here within the state,\" the FAA official said... A Joint Chiefs of Staff official said that there have been visual sightings of drones reported by \"highly trained security personnel\" near Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. The official said that they do not believe the sightings \"were aligned with a foreign actor, or that they had malicious intent.\" \"We don't know what activity is. We don't know if it is criminal, but I will tell you that it is irresponsible,\" the official said. \"Here on the military side, we are just as frustrated with the irresponsible nature of this activity.\" Later ABC News reported that the FAA had imposed temporary drone flight restrictions in New Jersey over the Picatinny Arsenal military base. And they added that America's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas \"said the federal government is taking action to address the aerial drones that have prompted concern among New Jersey residents. \"I want to assure the American public that we in the federal government have deployed additional resources, personnel, technology to assist the New Jersey State Police in addressing the drone sightings....\" There have been numerous reports of drone activity along the East Coast since November. Mayorkas cited the 2023 change of a Federal Aviation Administration rule that allows drones to fly at night as to why there might be an uptick in sightings. \"I want to assure the American public that we are on it,\" he said, before calling on Congress to expand local and state authority to help address the issue. \"It is critical, as we all have said for a number of years, that we need from Congress additional authorities to address the drone situation,\" Mayorkas said. \"Our authorities currently are limited and they are set to expire. We need them extended and expanded... We want state and local authorities to also have the ability to counter growing activity under federal supervision,\" he added, echoing sentiments from local officials... Addressing national security concerns the sightings have prompted, Mayorkas said the U.S. knows of no foreign involvement and that it remains \"vigilant\" in investigating the drone sightings. [ABC News anchor George] Stephanopoulos pressed Mayorkas about past security threats drones have caused, including the arrest of a Chinese national last week who allegedly flew a drone over an Air Force base in California. \"When a drone is flown over restricted airspace, we act very, very swiftly,\" the homeland security secretary said. \"In fact, when an individual in California flew a drone over restricted airspace, that individual was identified, apprehended and is being charged by federal authorities.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
