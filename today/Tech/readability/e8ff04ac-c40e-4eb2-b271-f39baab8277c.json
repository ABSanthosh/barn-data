  "description": "A revealing demonstration with Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode is raising concerns about whether fully autonomous cars are ready to hit the streets. Tesla has reportedly pushed back the rollout of its upcoming all-electric, fully autonomous car called the Cybercab, while a recent demonstration in Austin, Texas showed a Tesla Model Y running through a school bus' flashing lights and stop signs, and hitting child-size mannequins. The tests were conducted by The Dawn Project, along with Tesla Takedown and ResistAustin, and showed Tesla's Full Self-Driving software repeating the same mistake eight times. It's worth noting that Tesla's autonomous driving feature is formally known as Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and \"requires a fully attentive driver and will display a series of escalating warnings requiring driver response.\" Tesla even has a warning that says, \"failure to follow these instructions could cause damage, serious injury or death.\" However, it's not the first time that Tesla's FSD software has found itself in hot water. The Dawn Project, whose founder Dan O'Dowd is the CEO of a company that offers competing automated driving system software, previously took out ads warning about the dangers of Tesla's Full Self-Driving and how it would fail to yield around school buses. In April 2024, a Model S using Full Self-Driving was involved in a crash in Washington, where a motorcyclist died. With anticipation building up for an eventual Cybercab rollout on June 22, the company's CEO posted some additional details on X. According to Elon Musk, Tesla is \"being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift.\" Beyond that, Musk also posted that the \"first Tesla that drives itself from factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/tesla-blows-past-stopped-school-bus-and-hits-kid-sized-dummies-in-full-self-driving-tests-183756251.html?src=rss",
