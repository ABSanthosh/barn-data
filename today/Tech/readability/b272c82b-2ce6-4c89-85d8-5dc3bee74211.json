The sub-$100 category has become the wild west of wearables; crowded with imposters making big claims and delivering on very few. We haven’t tested every bargain-bin watch on the market, but we’ve tested enough to know when we’ve found a rare gem. A watch that goes beyond just the basics, with solid health and fitness tracking, smartphone features that actually work, and a multi-day battery life that can outlast some pricier models. Here are our picks for the best smartwatches (and smartwatch hybrids) under $100, plus a couple of alternatives that almost made the cut. We also share a few tips on what to look for when shopping in this cluttered (and sometimes sketchy) category. SMARTWATCH DEALS OF THE WEEK Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Best Budget Smartwatches: Top Cheap Picks What's the best cheap smartwatch overall? Best budget watch for Android Best smartwatch/fitness tracker hybrid for Samsung fans Amazfit Bip 6 specs and features Recent updates Factors to consider when choosing a smartwatch How we test smartwatches Other smartwatches we've tested FAQs What we look forward to in the second half of 2025 What's the best cheap smartwatch overall?The best budget smartwatch by a landslide is the Amazfit Bip 6. This is the kind of watch that makes you forget its sub-$100 price tag, packing features you’d normally expect from models that cost at least twice as much. This includes advanced health metrics like SpO2 (blood oxygen), wrist temperature tracking, stress levels and women’s health insights. It also lasted more than a week on a single charge during our testing, and can be tweaked to stretch even longer with custom settings.Smartphone integration isn’t as seamless as what you’d get from Wear OS or WatchOS smartwatches, since the Bip 6 runs its own proprietary system. But that also means it’s compatible with both Android phones and iPhones. Just note that iPhone users won’t be able to respond to notifications from the watch.The Bip 6 delivers where it counts, making it a great option for anyone prioritizing price and willing to spend a little more time setting it up to fit their needs. Pros $80 price is much less than most watches Works with Android and iOS Great battery life (lasts a week with heavy use) Tracks a wide variety of fitness activities accurately Temperature tracking and advanced sleep monitoring Cons Single sizing option (44mm) is limiting UI and app are unintuitive Some health metrics are hard to interpret Voice assistant is unreliable Bluetooth range is short (especially on iPhone) The $80 Amazfit Bip 6 is the most affordable option on this list, and a rare standout in the budget smartwatch category because it delivers on all the basics (and more) without many compromises. The design and interface aren't as refined as what you'll find with pricier models, but that feels like a fair trade-off considering how much the Bip 6 gets right. It offers accurate fitness tracking, with customizable training tools like heart rate zones, plus advanced health features including SpO2 (blood oxygen); temperature and sleep tracking; and high and low heart rate alerts.Why we like itWhile its low price might be its main draw, the Amazfit Bip 6 is one of the few sub-$100 smartwatches that's actually worth your time. Beyond all the features mentioned above, we also like it for its weeklong (or longer) battery life and its compatibility with both iPhones and Android phones.Who it's best forThe Amazfit Bip 6 is ideal for anyone looking to try out a smartwatch without making a major investment. It's a great fit for folks willing to do a bit of customization on the back end to make the watch work for their specific needs. Pros $60 price is the cheapest entry point into Samsung's ecosystem Robust health tracking and sleep coaching tools 3-day battery life with always-on display (up to 13 days with lighter use) Slim, lightweight design that looks fancier than most budget trackers Cons No built-in GPS for phone-free outdoor workouts No voice assistant or dictation features No mobile payments or third-party app support Limited notification handling (can't initiate calls or texts) The $60 Galaxy Fit 3 sits right on the line between fitness tracker and true smartwatch. It has a sleek design that's flattering on most wrists and a simple UI that doesn't overcomplicate your health data. There are a few concessions given its affordable price and simplicity, like the lack of a voice assistant and true message response, but it’s still plenty for Samsung fans or people looking for an entry-level way to track fitness.What we like itAt $60, it's the most affordable entry point into Samsung's health and fitness ecosystem, which includes metrics like heart rate and SpO₂ monitoring, stress levels, and sleep scores for much less than flagship smartwatches like the Galaxy Watch 7. Its pared-down size and simplified features also give it a battery boost: expect around three days with the always-on display enabled, or up to 13 days in battery saver mode.Who it's best forThe Fit 3 is great for anyone looking to track their health and fitness without committing to the price or bulk of a full-fledged smartwatch. It's best for Samsung users already in the ecosystem, but it can also be paired with other Android phones.Amazfit Bip 6 specs and features SpecGalaxy Fit 3Amazfit Bip 6 Price $60$79Display 1.6″ AMOLED (256 × 402, 16 M colors)1.97″ AMOLED (390 × 450, up to 2,000 nits) (us.amazfit.com)Body 42.9 × 28.8 × 9.9 mm46.3 × 40.2 × 10.45 mmWeight 36.8 g27.9 gMaterials Aluminum + glassAluminum frame + polymer caseWater Resistance 5 ATM + IP685 ATMOS FreeRTOSZeppOSRAM 16 MB64 MBStorage 256 MB512 MBBattery 208 mAh340 mAhBattery Life Up to 13 daysUp to 14 days typical; 26 days saverFast Charge 65% in 30 min?Connectivity Bluetooth 5.3Bluetooth 5.2, GPSGPS No (phone GPS)Yes, built-in, supports offline mapsSensors Accelerometer, gyro, barometer, optical HR, SpO₂, lightBioTracker™ PPG (5PD+2LED), accelerometer, gyro, ambient light, geomagneticNotifications Calls, text, media controlsCalls, texts, notifications; voice replies on AndroidAdditional Features 100+ workout modes, sleep, stress140+ activity modes, Zepp Coach, offline maps, menstrual trackingVoice Assistant NoZepp Flow voice controlNFC Payments NoNoPlatform Compatibility AndroidiOS \u0026 Android In June 2025, we added the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 to our round-up as a simple, more affordable alternative for Samsung fans looking to track their health and fitness. Picking a budget smartwatch can be trickier than it looks, mostly because of the sheer volume of bad options out there. This list is a great place to start, but it’s worth thinking through your priorities (beyond just price)  before you commit. Here's what to keep in mind when shopping under $100: Software and UI If reliability and user-friendly design matter to you, stick with more established brands like Samsung, Fitbit or even other Amazfit options. At this price, you can likely score some older models at a discounted rate or opt for fitness tracker hybrids like the Samsung Fit 3 or the Fitbit Inspire 3 with some smartwatch features that work well with your phone. Samsung pairs seamlessly with Samsung phones, while Fitbit and Amazfit options tend to work reliably across both iOS and Android. Design Design is often where budget watches cut corners. Many use plastic cases and silicone bands, which can feel bulkier and look less refined. Screen quality is another trade-off -- lower resolution displays can appear grainy or pixelated. If aesthetics matter, consider older models of premium brands or a fitness tracker with a sleeker look.  Samsung's Galaxy Watch4 can often be found at a discounted rate for under $100. Lexy Savvides/CNETBattery Life Battery life claims can be misleading at this price. Make sure what's advertised for the specific watch reflects typical use, and includes some kind of stripped-down low-power mode that only shows the time. Always-on displays that often accelerate battery drain are rare on wearables under $100, but most watches should last 24 hours (at the bare minimum) using raise-to-wake mode.Connectivity and GPSExpect only Wi-Fi models in this range, meaning you won’t be able to make calls or send texts without your phone nearby. Also, check the GPS capability; some watches, like the Bip 6, can track outdoor workouts independently, while others, like the Fit3, rely on your phone for mapping. PriceYou’re already filtering for watches under $100, but even within that range, you’ll find differences. Going closer to $50 usually means fewer features, but that could be fine if you don’t need all the bells and whistles. If you’re looking for something more well-rounded, the $80 to $100 range tends to offer better value overall. We put all our smartwatches through the paces of everyday life including at least one outdoor workout. With budget smartwatches, we follow the same rigorous testing guidelines as their premium counterparts, paying even closer attention to categories where we may see potential trade-offs like sensor accuracy and software support.The Basics: First, we evaluate how well these watches hold up to real-world use: notifications, texting (if available), and phone pairing. We also review the companion app experience, which is particularly important for budget watches, many of which rely on proprietary apps for health data and customization. Some may lack advanced phone integration -- especially for iPhone users -- so we flag those limitations in our reviews.Performance and navigation: While lower-cost models rarely have the processing power of premium options, we assess how smooth and responsive the interface is during typical use. That includes swiping between menus, launching workouts, syncing to the app and responding to notifications (when available).Design and durability: Affordability doesn’t have to mean cheap build quality. We test for comfort, fit, and how the watch holds up to daily wear and tear. Most budget models don’t come with military-grade durability or high water resistance ratings so we're not as “rough” on these devices and only go up to what the rating allowed, but will fully acknowledge this trade off in the review. The Amazfit Bip 6 has new sensors under the hood that improve precision for health and fitness tracking.  Vanessa Hand Orellana / CNETBattery life: Budget smartwatches tend to outperform premium ones when it comes to battery life because of the lesser-quality screen and power-hungry apps, but it's not always a given. We start our testing with a fully charged battery and then test how long a watch lasts with normal use. This includes sleep tracking, mirrored notifications from our phone and at least one outdoor (using GPS). Once it’s drained, we’ll time how long it takes to charge back up to 100%. We'll also flag any battery-saving tactics unique to that model, although our core testing is done at full capacity (not battery-saving mode).Sensor accuracy: Sensor quality can be hit or miss in this category, so we run side-by-side comparisons with gold-standard tools. For heart rate, we test against a chest strap during cardio workouts. For SpO2, we use a fingertip pulse oximeter. For watches with built-in GPS, we also assess how quickly the GPS locks in for outdoor workouts and compare its accuracy to a smartphone GPS (separate from the one it's paired to). We'll call out any obvious inconsistencies in route and tracking.Ultimately, we’re looking for watches that deliver true value and not just a long spec sheet of half baked-features. The Amazfit Active 2 is a slightly more refined, and expensive version of the Bip 6 which is our favorite budget pick. AmazfitWe've also tested the Amazfit Active 2, which shares a lot of the same great features as the Bip 6 but comes in a smaller, circular design that feels a bit more premium thanks to its stainless steel frame and slimmer body. It’s more expensive than the Bip 6, but at $100, it technically still makes the cutoff to land a spot on this list (barely).For a more full-featured alternative to the Galaxy Fit 3, the older Galaxy Watch 4 still holds up to today’s standards with ECG and blood pressure tracking (but no skin temperature). It may not be as speedy as the newer models, but it will run the latest version of Wear OS and you can often find it for under $100 through third-party retailers like Walmart. The Galaxy Watch 4 still holds up, and can often be snatched up at a steep discount form third party sellers. Scott Stein/CNET What features should I be looking for in a smartwatch? If you’re on this list, you’re already price-conscious, so we can check “affordability” off the list. Beyond that, there are some core features you should be on the lookout for in this category. For starters, make sure your watch and your phone speak the same language. Some budget-friendly brands like Amazfit work with both Android and iOS, but others, like Samsung’s Fit 3, are optimized for Android only. Also keep in mind that only Apple Watches allow full iMessage support, including replying to texts directly from the wrist. From a performance standpoint, focus on a few key areas: accuracy of health metrics, especially during workouts and sleep; and battery life that holds up with core features enabled, like notifications and workout tracking. Built-in GPS is a bonus at this price, but be aware that many budget models will use your phone to track your route. Display quality also matters more than you might think –some cheaper models still use low-res or dim screens that are tough to read in broad daylight. Lastly, check the companion app. You’ll need it to access most health stats, and not all of them are intuitive or reliable. Show more What are the best smartwatch brands? For budget alternatives, brands like Samsung and Fitbit (tracker hybrids) tend to be safe bets, especially when it comes to user interface and compatibility. But relative newcomers like Amazfit and Xiaomi (though Xiaomi watches aren’t sold directly in the US) are emerging as top contenders in the budget smartwatch category, with impressive specs at a fraction of the price. These newer brands are becoming worthy competitors to the established veterans, who often don’t offer lower-priced versions of their latest and greatest flagships. Show more Are there any downsides to going budget for a smartwatch? There are definite downsides to going with more affordable models, especially once you hit the under-$100 category. That’s why we made this list in the first place: to help you weed out the many options that are not worth your time. If you do decide to go rogue and look at other options, though, there are some compromises to look out for.Sensor accuracy is a big one, especially for heart rate, SpO2 and sleep tracking, which can vary widely at this price point. So, if you rely on your watch for closely monitoring health data, it’s worth managing expectations or cross-referencing with other devices. Built-in GPS is another common omission (they use the GPS on the phone), and you won't be able to go on a run phone-free if you want accurate tracking.You also won’t find LTE options in this category, so going truly untethered isn’t even a possibility. Less expensive watches often tend to use cheaper materials that may not hold up as well to wear and tear, and could scratch more easily if they’re made of lower-quality cover glass. Finally, software support and UI can be hit or miss, and integration with your phone, especially if you’re an iPhone user, may not be as seamless. Show more Smartwatches are only getting smarter about health, and I hope that continues; whether it’s better sensors, new metrics, or more personalized coaching, especially as more brands start leaning on AI to make sense of your data. One trend I’d love to see stick around in this year’s launches is better battery life. Smarter software and hardware upgrades like the dual CPU architecture on the OnePlus Watch 3 are finally making multiday wear feel realistic. Meanwhile, the definition of a wearable is expanding fast, with more smart rings making their debuts as well as upgraded earbud options with built-in health sensors that are already nudging into smartwatch territory. They probably won’t replace watches entirely, but they’re definitely raising the bar, and will continue giving the smartwatch category a healthy push forward.",

We start our testing with a fully charged battery and then test how long a watch lasts with normal use. This includes sleep tracking, mirrored notifications from our phone and at least one outdoor (using GPS). Once it’s drained, we’ll time how long it takes to charge back up to 100%.

Beyond that, there are some core features you should be on the lookout for in this category. For starters, make sure your watch and your phone speak the same language. Some budget-friendly brands like Amazfit work with both Android and iOS, but others, like Samsung’s Fit 3, are optimized for Android only. Also keep in mind that only Apple Watches allow full iMessage support, including replying to texts directly from the wrist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom a performance standpoint, focus on a few key areas: accuracy of health metrics, especially during workouts and sleep; and battery life that holds up with core features enabled, like notifications and workout tracking. Built-in GPS is a bonus at this price, but be aware that many budget models will use your phone to track your route. Display quality also matters more than you might think –some cheaper models still use low-res or dim screens that are tough to read in broad daylight. Lastly, check the companion app. You’ll need it to access most health stats, and not all of them are intuitive or reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-8d7af1a1-7af2-4b6a-bd71-dc93001aaa0c\" data-location=\"LIST\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eWhat are the best smartwatch brands?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor budget alternatives, brands like Samsung and Fitbit (tracker hybrids) tend to be safe bets, especially when it comes to user interface and compatibility. But relative newcomers like Amazfit and Xiaomi (though Xiaomi watches aren’t sold directly in the US) are emerging as top contenders in the budget smartwatch category, with impressive specs at a fraction of the price. These newer brands are becoming worthy competitors to the established veterans, who often don’t offer lower-priced versions of their latest and greatest flagships.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"\" data-cy=\"shortcodeListicle\" data-id=\"listicle-7d57bb18-20c9-45db-bf69-3b84fd13d00c\" data-location=\"LIST\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e  \u003ch3\u003eAre there any downsides to going budget for a smartwatch?\u003c/h3\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e    \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are definite downsides to going with more affordable models, especially once you hit the under-$100 category. That’s why we made this list in the first place: to help you weed out the many options that are not worth your time. If you do decide to go rogue and look at other options, though, there are some compromises to look out for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSensor accuracy is a big one, especially for heart rate, SpO2 and sleep tracking, which can vary widely at this price point. So, if you rely on your watch for closely monitoring health data, it’s worth managing expectations or cross-referencing with other devices. Built-in GPS is another common omission (they use the GPS on the phone), and you won\u0026#39;t be able to go on a run phone-free if you want accurate tracking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou also won’t find LTE options in this category, so going truly untethered isn’t even a possibility. Less expensive watches often tend to use cheaper materials that may not hold up as well to wear and tear, and could scratch more easily if they’re made of lower-quality cover glass. Finally, software support and UI can be hit or miss, and integration with your phone, especially if you’re an iPhone user, may not be as seamless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003ca\u003e\n      Show more\n    \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-cy=\"infoCard\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmartwatches are only getting smarter about health, and I hope that continues; whether it’s better sensors, new metrics, or more personalized coaching, especially as more brands start leaning on AI to make sense of your data. One trend I’d love to see stick around in this year’s launches is better battery life. Smarter software and hardware upgrades like the dual CPU architecture on the OnePlus Watch 3 are finally making multiday wear feel realistic. Meanwhile, the definition of a wearable is expanding fast, with more smart rings making their debuts as well as upgraded earbud options with built-in health sensors that are already nudging into smartwatch territory. They probably won’t replace watches entirely, but they’re definitely raising the bar, and will continue giving the smartwatch category a healthy push forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
