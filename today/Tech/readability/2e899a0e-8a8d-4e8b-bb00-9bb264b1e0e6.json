  "text": "Credit: Elena Berd/Shutterstock With Apple finally killing the Home button in today’s iPhone 16e announcement, the company’s phones have now all adopted the same general look: boring. Apple’s latest budget phone might have a bigger battery and surprising power for a follow-up to the iPhone SE, but anyone looking for something that breaks the mold will have to wait for the iPhone 17. That’s because Apple’s next lineup of phones finally seems to be doing something different with the iPhone’s design. For the first time since the Dynamic Island was introduced on the iPhone 14 Pro, it looks like you might finally be able to tell if someone has a new iPhone from a simple glance.Is the iPhone 17 getting a camera bar?According to leaks from YouTuber Jon Prosser, the iPhone 17 might be taking cues from Google, making for a significant change to its design. Notably, it’ll supposedly be ditching its camera bump for a full-on camera bar. In a video posted to YouTube over the weekend, the leaker posted renders of what the iPhone 17 Pro might look like, based on information from a number of unnamed sources, as well as a model he has supposedly seen. In the render, the iPhone’s camera lenses appear to be laid out in a similar triangular fashion as on current iPhones, but the bump housing them is now extended across almost the entire phone’s back. The flash, LiDAR, and mic are also now sitting opposite the lenses, on the other side of the extended bump.If true, the new iPhone would definitely need a new case, but it would also be aping Google’s Pixel series of phones, which adopted a “camera bar” back in 2021 that looks suspiciously similar to this leak.Reviews, including my own, haven’t always been kind to the camera bar, which can stick out of an otherwise slick looking phone like a sore thumb, so it’s not clear at first why Apple would make this change. Some social media users have speculated that Apple might use the camera bar’s extra space to add a small display to the phone’s back to aid in taking selfies or seeing information from widgets, but these are just guesses for now. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. Granted, that’s the nature of leaks in general. While Prosser claims to have seen the phone, other sources are more split on the camera bar idea. Most notably, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who has his own sources within Apple, insinuated that Prosser’s renders appear to be based on a fake CAD design from January. Leaker Majin Bu had already shown this CAD to designers, who said it was likely not real.Prosser, however, isn't the only one predicting a camera bar for the iPhone 17. Both supply chain analysis from technology publication The Information and assertions from Chinese leaker Digital Chat Station have hinted at a pill-shaped camera bump, which would be similar in design to the Pixel camera bar.Both rumors have issues, though, which has led to doubt from other known leakers including Instant Digital and Ice Universe. Most notably, a pill-shaped camera bar would interfere with how the iPhone currently captures spatial video, while Prosser’s design would put the flash and LiDAR far away from the camera lenses, which could impact their usefulness.Whatever camera layout the iPhone 17 gets, there is more to be excited about with this phone, even if it may not be as immediately visually interesting.The iPhone 17 AirAlongside its base iPhone 17 and two iPhone 17 Pro models (the typical Pro and Pro Max), the iPhone 17 is rumored to introduce a new, lighter version of the phone called the iPhone 17 Air. The new model would take the place of an iPhone 17 Plus, although it wouldn’t be directly comparable.Rumors of an iPhone 17 Air started in November with Korean social media account yeux1122 and have since been repeated by Apple analyst Jeff Pu (via MacRumors), The Information, and Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.Supposedly, the phone would roughly be between 5mm and 6mm thick, depending on which source you go with, which would still make it far thinner than Apple’s current thinnest phone, the 6.9mm iPhone 6. As for how big the phone would be, despite it not having the “Plus” branding, it will supposedly be a little taller than the 17 Pro and a little shorter than the Pro Max, with specifics again depending on which rumor you go with.The Information also claimed a camera bar will be present on the Air, reporting it will be pill-shaped with a centered camera. It’s possible this is where the iPhone 17 line’s camera bar rumors began, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Pro models skip the camera bar while the Air has one, but nobody seems to know for sure. It would make sense, though, as a way for the Air to save some thickness. Additionally, Prosser also has a render of an Air with a pill-shaped camera bar, although his model places the lens closer to the edge of the phone, once again far away from the flash and microphone.The standard iPhone 17While the iPhone 17 Pro and Air models might bring some new excitement to Apple’s traditional candy bar layout, current rumors put the base iPhone 17 about where you’d expect based on the past few models. No camera bar is currently rumored for this phone, although MacRumors is speculating, based on the iPhone 17 Pro’s expected size, that it might get a slightly bigger screen at 6.3-inches as opposed to 6.1-inches. Instant Digital also claims that the base iPhone 17 will get an improved OLED panel, which will allow it to hit higher frame rates using Apple’s ProMotion feature.The usual improvementsIn addition to new design quirks, the iPhone 17 series is also expected to get the usual lineup of improvements. The Pro models will likely upgrade from the A18 chip to an A19 chip, while the base model will possibly stick with the A18 chip instead. Similarly, we might see camera specs increase, with Jeff Pu (via MacRumors) expecting all iPhone 17 models to have a 24MP selfie camera, up from 12MP across the iPhone 16 line. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is also expecting the iPhone 17’s Pro models to upgrade all lenses to 48MP next year, which would improve the 12MP telephoto lenses from the current batch.A report from The Information also points to a potential mechanical aperture on at least one model, which would let users control how much light their lens sees, while Chinese site MyDrivers speculates that the entire lineup will use a vapor chamber for improved cooling. These would indicate entirely new directions for Apple, and should probably be taken with a grain of salt.There’s also one potential downgrade in store, with The Information's analysis pointing to the possibility that Apple might return to an aluminum frame for its Pro models rather than the current titanium frame. This could reduce cost, but might also make the phones slightly heavier.Price and release dateA report from the Wall Street Journal estimates that Apple will price the iPhone 17 Air somewhere between the base 17 and the 17 Pro models, but aside from that, cost is still up in the air. The base iPhone 16 costs $799 while the Pro costs $999 and the Pro Max costs $1,199, so expect to pay at least as much for these upgrades—although with tariffs inbound for Chinese parts manufacturers, there could be a slight price bump.As for a release date, Apple usually launches new iPhone series in September, so expect the iPhone 17 line to debut sometime this fall.
