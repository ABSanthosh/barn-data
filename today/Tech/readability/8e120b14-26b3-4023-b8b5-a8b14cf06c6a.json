It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now! Lovable has now reached over 2.3 million active users and seen more than 10 million projects built on its platform. According to the company, more than 100,000 new projects are being created each day.  Last week, Lovable announced a $200mn Series A round led by Accel, with participation from 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. The funding valued the startup at $1.8bn and ranks among the largest Series A rounds ever raised by a European company. Lovable also revealed it is now “fully agentic,” giving the platform the ability to “think through problems, make plans, and proactively take actions like a real developer.” The upgrade enables Lovable to search the web for content, debug code, and edit applications with full context — all without human intervention. The company has also launched a Business Plan offering “enterprise-grade security, privacy, and control,” which includes features like reusable templates, self-serve SSO, private projects, and data opt-out. Early customers include Klarna, Hubspot, and Photoroom. “Despite our rapid growth, we are still just beginning to understand what this means for people and businesses around the world,” Osika said in a statement. “AI is unlocking the potential for people to build easily, create new companies at an unprecedented rate, and have a positive impact on the world.”",
