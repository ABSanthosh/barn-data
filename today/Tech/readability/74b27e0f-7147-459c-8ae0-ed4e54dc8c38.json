Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Credit: Amazon If you’re in the market for a wireless mechanical keyboard, the Logitech G915 Lightspeed is one of the best options out there—especially at $159.99 (down from $249.99). Its low-profile mechanical design offers a more comfortable experience than your typical laptop keyboard, even with the shorter key press. Plus, you get a full set of keys with dedicated media controls, macro buttons (G1 through G5), and even a fancy aluminum volume roller, among others. For gamers, those macro buttons could be a game-changer—though they do take some getting used to.As for wireless performance, Logitech’s Lightspeed tech (basically, their wifi connection via a 2.4GHz dongle) reportedly ensures quick response times and super low-latency performance with barely any lag. There's also a Bluetooth option, though you might experience a slight lag when you switch to Bluetooth. At 2.24 pounds, the G915 feels a bit heavier than expected, which could be a drawback if portability is high on your list. It’s not exactly bag-friendly, and the dongle has no onboard storage, so misplacing it is always a risk.On the upside, its battery life is solid—Logitech claims around 30 hours with the RGB lighting on max, which is pretty decent for a wireless keyboard. And the G915 works with Logitech’s G Hub software, making it easy to set up macros, custom lighting, and store profiles. You can save up to three profiles in the keyboard’s onboard memory and as many as you want on your computer. However, according to this PCMag review, the process of switching profiles could be a bit confusing since you need to activate them through the keyboard settings rather than the profile menu.If you’re looking for something more affordable, the HyperX Alloy Origins at $87 (down from $109.99) could be a good alternative. It doesn’t have the wireless feature, but it’s worth considering if you’re after something simpler. Lifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.
