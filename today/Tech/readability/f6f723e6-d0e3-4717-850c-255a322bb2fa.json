Workers are talking about the risks of job automation. Entrepreneurs are chewing over the business opportunities. And the tech world is discussing what everyone else will be discussing next. Unfortunately, these conversations have also attracted countless scoundrels. They join the chat with wild promises and heavy doses of AI snake oil. But behind their breathless hype, remarkable innovations are emerging. Don’t believe me? Well, just take a look at this week’s Nobel Prize winners.  The The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!On Tuesday, a Nobel was awarded to AI pioneers for the first time. Just a day later, a Nobel was awarded to AI pioneers for the second time. These scientific achievements are a taste of what’s to come. AI is rapidly approaching an inflection point. “This goes beyond just the latest gadgets or GenAI breakthroughs,” says Chris Duffey, GenAI Lead at software giant Adobe. “It’s about a fundamental shift in how we think, create, and work.” Duffey has a unique perspective on these development. Alongside his work at Adobe, he’s written an award-winning book about AI and become a renowned futurist. He’s also a member of TNW’s advisory board. The board have been having their own debates about artificial intelligence. Their discussions led AI and Deeptech to become one of six themes for TNW Conference 2025. A gateway to the future of AI Over two jam-packed days in Amsterdam next June, we’ll explore the innovations set to shake up the world. Tech luminaries will be dissecting and demoing breakthroughs in AI, quantum, robotics, and so much more. Expect a mix of mind-bending panels, keynotes from digital leaders, and exclusive tips. Debates about AI will permeate the event — and we want you to join them. “The innovators who gather here are poised to challenge the status quo, to push boundaries in ways that ripple far beyond technology itself,” Duffey says. “What happens next isn’t inevitable, it’s the result of deliberate key moments, decisions, and ideas that will change everything.” To keep you on the right track, the AI and Deeptech theme is underpinned by four pillars: AI Revolution: Explore how AI is transforming different industries Leaping into Quantum: Discover how businesses can tap the power of quantum and why investors should pay close attention Rise of the Machines: Find out which cutting-edge robotics trends you should keep on your radar The Cyber Arms Race: What are the latest cybersecurity technologies you should know about? And what are the ethical dilemmas when it comes to securing your business’ systems against threats? Duffey has big expectations for the programme. “We’re not just predicting the future,” he says. “We’re inventing it, one groundbreaking idea at a time.” If you want to hear all about these ideas, you can grab a ticket forTNW Conference now.
