  "text": "Layoffs, wildfires and deportations. Why is the jobs report still positive? Katherine Watt is a CNET Money writer focusing on mortgages, home equity and banking. She previously wrote about personal finance for NextAdvisor. Based in New York, Katherine graduated summa cum laude from Colgate University with a bachelor's degree in English literature. Over the last few weeks, there's been massive disruption in the labor market with President Donald Trump's administration moving to freeze federal aid and lay off tens of thousands of federal workers. That's on top of a flurry of executive orders, threats of trade wars, the start of mass deportations and stock market volatility. But on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released what investors and market watchers considered a \"positive\" jobs report for January. That disconnect has me scratching my head. One explanation is that economic data is backward-looking: Friday's report reflects the state of the labor market in January, before the relative chaos began. Even so, I expected there would at least be some impact from the destructive LA wildfires, which saw hundreds of thousands of Californians apply for unemployment benefits.  Instead, the most recent labor data shows unemployment low and steady, clocking in at 4%. Plus, job growth is still apparently moving at a healthy pace.Maybe official labor data isn't a reliable narrator of what's really happening, nor what's to come. Lisa Countryman-Quiroz, CEO of JVS Bay Area, a workforce development nonprofit, said there's no question that the new administration's actions will cause instability for both workers and employers, with consequences that will ripple across industries in 2025. A potentially volatile job marketJob market indicators paint a broad picture and reflect past trends, but they don't accurately reflect the economic realities of different areas, populations or industries. As someone who writes about the relationship between labor data, the housing market and the Federal Reserve, I wasn't surprised to see economists positively spin Friday's labor report. News reports decreed that the economy is \"resilient\" and \"strong\" and that the job market \"could not be better.\" Yet ask your average person about finding stable and well-paid employment, and you'll likely get a very different answer. In 2024, Pathrise Job Market data shows it took jobseekers an average of eight months and 294 applications to land a job. It's not an exaggeration to say the economy feels like it's in freefall. The State Department's order for an immediate 90-day pause on foreign aid, championed by Elon Musk, has left many government contractors and global agencies struggling to operate or even pay their workers. Meanwhile, some 65,000 federal workers have accepted an offer to resign in exchange for pay until Sept. 30. The White House has said it hopes for as many as 200,000 workers to participate in the buyout, which was recently temporarily suspended by a federal judge.Moreover, Trump is taking aggressive action to ramp up the deportation of undocumented immigrants, who comprise nearly 1 in 20 workers, with even greater representation in construction, agriculture and hospitality. The forced removal of masses of workers, who contribute billions of dollars in state and federal taxes, could result in low-wage job vacancies, higher labor costs, supply chain disruptions and increased inflation.\"The President has shifted policy directions several times,\" said Gene Ludwig, former comptroller of the currency and founder of the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.\"It's too soon to gauge the net effect of his policies on employment,\" Ludwig told me in an email. Interest rate cuts won't come until laterEconomic data, like Friday's job report, also affects major monetary decisions, like adjusting interest rates. The Federal Reserve needs to strike a balance between inflation and unemployment, and it examines official statistics to determine its next move.First, the central bank wants to see inflation slow down before cutting interest rates again. But that doesn't seem likely anytime soon, given the threat of tariffs, which are expected to drive up prices. Second, the Fed is looking for signs of weakness in the labor market. Though the Fed doesn't want unemployment levels to dive to recession levels, a \"healthy\" labor market tells the central bank that the economy can afford high borrowing rates.Odds were already low for the Fed to cut interest rates at its next meeting in March. But now it's even clearer that the central bank will delay rate cuts until May or June at the earliest. It could take months to get a clear picture of how the administration's policies will affect the jobs market, consumer prices and the cost of borrowing. \"Any indicator that shows a slowing economy would raise the chances of a rate cut, especially rising unemployment,\" said Greg Heym, chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens. In the meantime, we'll just have to settle for different definitions of what constitutes a positive jobs report. \"A strong labor market relies on expanding opportunities for jobseekers, not restricting them,\" said Countryman-Quiroz.",
