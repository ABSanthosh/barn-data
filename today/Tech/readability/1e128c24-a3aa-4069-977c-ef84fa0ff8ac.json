  "text": "Here’s how to sweep your Valentine off their feet and into their favorite fandom world at Disney Parks. From out-of-this-world trips to Galaxy’s Edge, to animation adoration at Epcot’s Festival of the Arts, to fairytale fantasy—and even the after-hours Disneyland After Dark: Sweet Hearts Night if you managed to snag a ticket. Grab some Lego flowers and chart a course to your nearest Disney experience. Star Wars Valentine at Galaxy’s Edge © Lucasfilm Romance your rebel royal on the Millennium Falcon ride Smugglers Run at the Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World’s Hollywood Studios. The inside queue for the Galaxy’s Edge attraction takes you aboard our favorite scoundrel’s ship; you can find a very similar wall to the one seen above to pose your own Valentine’s Day smooch before hopping on a high-stakes mission. Be warned, though: younglings who don’t appreciate your PDA may get their revenge if they pilot the Falcon and crash into everything for the ride’s duration. Food and drinks suggestion: Oga’s Cantina for Fuzzy Tauntauns and a Brub Berry Muffin from Kat Saka’s Kettle (Disneyland only); at Galaxy’s Edge East you can order a Spiked Cold Brew Black Caf (trust us). Fandom Art Walk at Epcot’s International Festival of the Arts Take a romantic stroll at one of our favorite Epcot festivals, the International Festival of the Arts. Here you can look for the perfect Disney-inspired art print and maybe get it signed by the artist. There are quite a few releases that we’re loving this year, including Disney Princess love stories, Star Wars, and even Kingdom Hearts. There’s also live Broadway musical performances of favorite Disney love songs, art photo ops, and crafts you can take part in. Food and drinks suggestion: Sushi donuts at the Goshiki booth in Japan. Pro-tip: the best margaritas are inside the Mexico Pavilion’s La Cava del Tequila, the best place to start drinking around the world. A New Orleans Fairytale Romance with Tiana’s Bayou Adventure Tiana’s Bayou Adventure is now open at both Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom and Disneyland. Fall in love (and down a couple drops) on the ride that takes you into the bayou to see The Princess and the Frog‘s Princess Tiana in her next chapter, alongside Prince Naveen and friends. The attraction is especially gorgeous at night with the twinkling lights of fireflies and the sight of Ray and Evangeline hidden on the ride. Food and drinks suggestion: beignets! At Magic Kingdom find Tiana’s Famous Beignets at the Golden Oak Outpost as well at Disney’s Port Orleans Resort French Quarter Scat Cat Club Cafe (there’s gluten-free ones here, too). Drinks and live jazz are a must-do at at this hotel as well as a stay for that NOLA ambiance during a Florida vacation. At Disneyland, you can experience Tiana’s Palace for Southern cooking including her family recipe gumbo and specialty beignets. However, for classic beignets we recommend the window at the Mint Julep Bar, right around the corner from Tiana’s. Take a walk on the Avatar Side in Animal Kingdom’s Pandora © Twentieth Century Pictures Tell your loved one “I see you” in Pandora: The World of Avatar at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom. On Flight of Passage you’ll be able to connect to your own Na’vi rider for one of the best rides from Disney Imagineering and the mind of James Cameron. The environment around the land lends itself for an immersive experience like no other. Food and drinks suggestion: This is a bit of a cheat but the most romantic spot for bites and drinks is the Nomad Lounge, which is on the way to Pandora. There’s delicious churros and a good view of the river where characters will come by on a boat float. Indiana Jones Adventure © Disney Experiences For those with an adventurous spirit wanting a day filled with thrills and action, there’s a few options to theme a date around an Indiana Jones-style quest for the heart of your beloved. Walt Disney World’s Hollywood Studios has an Indiana Jones Stunt show that recreates Indy and Marion’s thrilling escape from the bad guys. Meanwhile, at Disneyland you can ride the Indiana Jones Adventure attraction, which has one of the best queues in the park, recreating iconic set pieces from the film’s traps. Food and drinks suggestion: Disney Springs at Walt Disney World has an underrated Indiana Jones universe themed bar. Jock Lindsay’s is the sort of watering hole Indy’s trusty pilot would open that feels like a hub for traveling tomb raiders. There’s drinks inspired by the films (such as the Fountain of Youth) and food served with meta references, like Club Obi-Wan wings. At Disneyland we advise to a trek to the Disneyland Hotel for Trader Sam’s tiki bar for interactive drinks that unlock special effects at the bar. You didn’t hear it from us, but there might even be a secret drink called the Temple of the Forbidden Rye inspired by Professor Jones’ archeological side hustles. “Come and Get Your Love” with Guardians of the Galaxy © Marvel Studios Prep a mixtape—er, playlist and spend an awesome day with your Valentine at attractions inspired by Marvel Studios’ Guardians of the Galaxy. If you’re on the East Coast take a spin on Epcot’s Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and make whatever song you get one of your songs. At Disney’s California Adventure, fall for one another on Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout.  Food and drinks suggestion: At Epcot try to get standby reservations for Space 220’s bar, which shoots you into “orbit” for libations and bites. At Disney California Adventure there’s Pym’s Tasting Lab Lounge for fun MCU-themed drinks, but we also highly recommend trying out the Lunar New Year offerings and desserts, like the Chocolate Firecracker mousse cake at the Lucky 8 Lantern booth.
