General summary Google is launching three new initiatives to protect and restore nature using AI. First, they're starting an accelerator program for startups using technology to protect nature. Second, Google.org is providing $3 million to support AI-enabled solutions from Brazilian nonprofits. Finally, they're releasing SpeciesNet, an open-source AI model for identifying animal species from camera trap photos. These initiatives aim to address the urgent need to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Bullet points Google's using AI to protect and restore nature. They're launching an accelerator for startups using AI for nature and climate. Google.org is giving $3 million to nonprofits using AI to protect biodiversity. SpeciesNet, an AI model for wildlife conservation, is now open source. These efforts aim to accelerate the protection and restoration of nature. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: Since 1970, the world has seen an average loss of 73% of mammal, bird, fish, reptile and amphibian populations. Climate change, water stress and resource depletion are only accelerating the stress on our natural environment. Fifty-five percent of the world’s GDP — equivalent to $58 trillion — is exposed to extensive risk from this environmental decline without immediate action.For more than two decades, we’ve been building tools and technology that enable partners, NGOs, governments and academics around the world to help address nature and biodiversity loss. And today we’re announcing three new efforts to accelerate the protection and restoration of nature in regions home to some of the most critical habitats, ecosystems and communities.Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Nature and ClimateWe're launching our first accelerator focused on startups using technology to protect, manage and restore nature. The World Economic Forum has identified biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as top global risks over the next 10 years. Mitigating this risk requires advancements in data collection, insights and modeling and decision-making capabilities — which is why we’re supporting the best startups in the world to target this issue. Google for Startups Accelerator: AI for Nature and Climate welcomes startups in the Americas and offers 10 weeks of virtual programming, including mentoring and technical support from Google engineers and experts through a mix of one-on-one and group learning sessions. Applications are open from March 3, 2025 to March 31, 2025 and the program will start in May 2025. For more information and details on how to apply, visit our website.AI for Nature and Climate: A new grant fund for nonprofitsGoogle.org has provided $3M to iCS to launch an open call for grant submissions to support AI-enabled solutions from Brazilian nonprofit organizations and research centers selected by iCS. The $3M in Google.org funding will support organizations leveraging AI in three areas:Reversing biodiversity loss: This includes solutions supporting the \"30x30\" global effort to protect 30% of the Earth's land and ocean by 2030 for biodiversity protection and the creation of protected areas, Indigenous territories (present day and traditional) in compliance with the Global Biodiversity Framework.Bioeconomy: This includes technologies that support the value chains of timber and non-timber forest products, as well as services associated with Brazilian socio-biodiversity.Regenerative agriculture: This includes activities that support regenerative and resilient agriculture, especially for small farmers.You can find more information about the funding and these areas of interest on this website.SpeciesNet: A new open source AI model for wildlife conservationWe’re also announcing the open source release of SpeciesNet, an AI model designed to identify animal species by analyzing photos from camera traps. Since 2019, thousands of wildlife biologists have used SpeciesNet through a Google Cloud-based tool called Wildlife Insights to streamline biodiversity monitoring and inform conservation decision-making. The SpeciesNet AI model release will enable tool developers, academics and biodiversity-related startups to scale monitoring of biodiversity in natural areas.Protecting nature and biodiversity is critical to tackling climate change, and we look forward to supporting the startups focused on this challenge.",
