It's that time again, trainers: Grab your Pokedex and get ready to catch some new pocket monsters, because we're about to hear everything about the latest developments in the world of Pokemon.The Pokemon Presents July 2025 stream is the first one since Pokemon Day in February. That stream ended up being pretty massive, featuring game announcements and content updates that we heard whispers about from GameFreak's infamous 2024 data breach.Read more: The Top 25 Best Pokemon Games of All Time, RankedWhile we don't know what to expect this time around, we can pretty safely assume that tomorrow's Pokemon Direct will delve into more content than usual, thanks to its rumored 24-minute runtime. Keep your eyes peeled for potential information about the next mainline games, mobile titles, live service updates and more.Here's how you can watch the upcoming Pokemon Direct -- and what you can expect to see once you tune into the stream. We've seen an official trailer for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, but the upcoming Pokemon Presents stream could divulge more information about the game. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNETHow to watch July 2025's Pokemon Presents streamThe upcoming Pokemon Presents stream will take place on Tuesday, July 22 at 6 a.m. PT (9 a.m. ET, 2 p.m. BST, 11 p.m. AEST). The stream will go live on the official Pokemon YouTube channel. If you tune in before the announcements start, you'll be treated to a DJ Pikachu live show, which seems like a lot of effort for a Pokemon Presents stream -- unless some truly special reveals are planned.According to My Nintendo News, the new Pokemon Direct will have a 24-minute runtime. That's a pretty substantial Pokemon Presents stream -- previous presentations have ranged from 10 to 20 minutes long, so we can expect that July's stream will be packed to the gills with pocket monster announcements. Pokemon Go just celebrated its ninth anniversary. We can expect to hear more about this mobile game (among others) during the upcoming Pokemon Direct. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNETWhat can you expect from Pokemon Presents July 2025?This Pokemon Presents stream is positioned at a strange time -- Pokemon Legends: Z-A for the Nintendo Switch 2 has already been announced and we have plenty of info and gameplay footage available for that game. We might still get a segment that expands on new gameplay mechanics and Pokemon that players will be able to find in this version of the Kalos region, especially Mega forms that we haven't yet seen.Pokemon rhythm gameThe official Pokemon Company Japan X account teased this Pokemon Direct with a rather foreboding photo of Pikachu standing in front of some DJ equipment, though we later found out that this was to tease the stream's \"Everyone Gather! DJ Pikachu Live\" show.Even still, I think it's possible that this will tease a new Pokemon rhythm game -- a Pokemon Presents preshow seems like far too much effort if it isn't leading into an announcement of its own. We don't have much info on what this game could be, but I'd imagine it's more likely to be a light-hearted party game like Rhythm Heaven rather than anything like DJ Hero.Between this potential new rhythm game, New Pokemon Snap and the return of Mystery Dungeon, I'm loving the reintroduction of bizarre offshoot games. It's wonderful to engage with the wider world of Pokemon without battling all of the time.Pokemon Generation 10: The first mainline Pokemon games for the Switch 2?It's also possible that generation 10 will be announced during the presentation. There are usually three years between mainline Pokemon titles, and Pokemon Scarlet and Violet released in 2022. Unless GameFreak is looking to polish the next big games with some extra development time, we're probably due to hear about the next generation of Pokemon games extremely soon.Pokemon ChampionsPokemon Day 2025 featured an announcement for Pokemon Champions, a dedicated Pokemon battling game, but we haven't heard much about the game since. We could very well get an update about that game during this stream, explaining more about how the game will integrate the series' long list of battle mechanics and giving us a better idea of when we'll see a full release.Mobile games and live service updates: Pokemon TCG Pocket, Pokemon Go and moreOtherwise, the backbone of this presentation will very likely be composed of routine updates and new features for Pokemon mobile and live service games. We can expect to hear about new Pokemon coming to Pokemon Cafe Mix, Pokemon Masters Ex and Pokemon Sleep, with the potential for new playable Pokemon to be revealed for Pokemon Unite.With Pokemon Go changing hands from Niantic to Scopely, it's possible that the extremely popular AR game will have announcements that shake up core gameplay features for Pokemon trainers worldwide. The recent addition of the Gold Bottle Cap was already a massive change for the status quo.I'd be willing to bet that the next Pokemon TCG Pocket set will be revealed during this Pokemon Presents as well. New expansions are usually teased at the end of each month, which lines up with this stream. The last Pokemon Presents included info about a massive set expansion, too, so the precedent is already set for this reveal.Netflix's Pokemon ConciergeIf you're excited for non-gaming Pokemon content, there's also a chance we'll see some Pokemon Concierge during the Pokemon Presents July stream. The second season for this slice-of-life Pokemon hotel series is set to release on Netflix in September, so we might catch a scene or two teasing the show and get an official release date.Regardless of whether or not my speculations prove true, one thing is certain: Tomorrow's Pokemon Direct will be jam-packed full of announcements for everyone's favorite monster-catching series. Whether you're a mobile gamer or you just got a Switch 2, July's Pokemon Presents will almost certainly include exciting announcements for you.",
