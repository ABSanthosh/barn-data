  "description": "Newly restored pages on the websites of government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) now include a disclaimer rejecting \"gender ideology,\" as spotted by 404 Media. The move allows agencies to comply with a recent court order to restore missing webpages, while continuing to push the Trump administration anti-trans executive order that led them to delete those pages in the first place. You can see the disclaimer — which lifts language directly from President Trump's order — on the FDA's guidance document on the \"Study of Sex Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Medical Products\" and a page linking to results from SAHMSA's report on \"Behavioral Health of Adolescents across Sexual Identities.\" Like a lot of the current administration's slapdash attempts to crack down on diversity, equity and inclusion, the disclaimer doesn't appear everywhere. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention page on \"Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines\" doesn't include it, for example. The contents of the disclaimer are reproduced below: Per a court order, HHS is required to restore this website as of 11:59 PM on February 11, 2025. Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female. The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department reject it. Government agencies were first directed to \"end all agency programs that use taxpayer money to promote or reflect gender ideology\" by the Office of Personal Management (OPM) in January, which prompted the webpage takedowns, The Washington Post writes. Doctors of America, represented by Public Citizen, sued OPM and other agencies that took down pages over safety concerns, leading to the order to restore the websites to their original form this month.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/trump-administration-adds-note-rejecting-gender-ideology-to-government-websites-220253562.html?src=rss",
