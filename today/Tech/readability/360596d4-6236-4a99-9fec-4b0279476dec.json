  "text": "This week Disney Cruises revealed more looks at its new Disney Destiny and just how big Marvel’s presence will be for MCU fans of all ages once sailings start later this year. Fan favorites Black Panther and Spider-Man will be making appearances alongside a trickster villain variant Loki. And as far as Marvel experiences go we’re looking forward to the Sanctum, a lounge bar inspired by the offices of one Doctor Strange. Also this week: Universal Studios Hollywood’s Fan Fest Nights outlined how cosplay will work at the event for fans of Star Trek, Wicked, One Piece, and Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, among the fandoms represented. As more Pop Mart and Robo Shop locations spring up, Labubu is set to debut a new colorful drop with “Big Into Energy” nationwide. Plus Sinners hits theaters and we have a guide to finding venues screening Ryan Coogler’s latest as it’s meant to be seen. Black Panther leads the Avengers aboard the Disney Destiny Disney Imagineering gave a look at the process for the incredible Black Panther statue being built for the atrium of Disney Cruise Line’s latest ship, the Disney Destiny. It’s themed to heroes and villains, so it makes sense to have Black Panther front and center to greet cruisers. It also features Spider-Man on the stern. There will be a huge MCU presence aboard this ship for kids and adult superhero fanatics. Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum… as a bar © Disney Experiences Here’s a look at some of the libations that will be featured in the Disney Destiny‘s Sanctum lounge, which like the themed bars on other Disney ships inspired by Star Wars and The Haunted Mansion will include deep immersive elements as part of the experience. The space will resemble Strange’s office and we wonder if there will be a bar top effect where your beer gets refilled just like Thor’s did in the movies. Meet superhero Minnie alongside Marvel faves Can we talk about how this is a really fierce look for Superhero Minnie? It’s almost like she’s a part of the Marvels line up and a picture with her, Carol, Kamala, and Monica would be amazing. As far as actual MCU characters confirmed to be on the Disney Destiny, expect to meet Spider-Man and Black Panther with more announcements to come. Heroic Bites with Edna Á La Mode Sweets and Marvel Dining © Disney Experiences The Incredibles get a perfectly named treat stop inspired by the iconic Edna Mode, and there better be ice cream á la mode with no capes because it’s what Edna would want. And it appears that’s a high possibility with a menu that boasts handmade gelato, ice cream, and more along with specialty treats prepped from Edna Mode’s lab.  We see those suited up Incredibles cupcakes and look forward to a ton of Jack-Jack Cookie Num Nums. And as previously featured aboard other cruises, the Worlds of Marvel dining experience will also be offered aboard the Disney Destiny, with a Groot and Rocket takeover. Guests can expect an awesome mix of food and superhero antics courtesy of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Coachella gets geeky with Rock Opera Gaga, L.A. Phil, and Yo Gabba Gabba! If you’re venturing out to the desert and happen to also be a nerd, we hope to see you via livestream at Yo Gabba Gabba!‘s set, which will feature Paul Williams and Weird Al for an encore of their “Rainbow Connection” remix with Portugal the Man. Cinema fans will also enjoy Gustavo Dudamel and the LA Phil performing Star Wars scores. And as probably the most gothic horror camp headliner ever, Lady Gaga is going to unleash more rock opera goods. If you’re going to be in that crowd or really any be sure to keep your ear drums safe with plugs like Loop, which kept ours safe when we went a couple years ago. This year we’ll be tuned in to Coachella live on YouTube. Cosplay dos and don’ts for Universal Studios Fan Fest Nights Universal Studios Fan Fest Nights are quickly approaching for its highly anticipated fandonm mash-up featuring One Piece, Wicked, Star Trek, Back to the Future, Dungeons \u0026 Dragons, and so much more. The event is allowing cosplay and just released some key points to remember if you’re getting tickets and planning on themed attire. Highlights from the official guide include: Guests may not create a false impression that they work for Universal or any emergency personnel. Guests may not wear any covering that fully or partially obscures a person’s face, including costume masks and facial coverings, except for religious or medical reasons. Face painting, both full and partial, is permitted, provided that to facilitate identification at any Universal Studios Hollywood or Universal CityWalk Hollywood owned venue, alcoholic beverages will not be served to guests if face painting covers more than one-half of the face, applied vertically. Prosthetic makeup that conceals any part of the face, other than the forehead, is not permitted. No weapons of any kind or items that could be used as a weapon are permitted. Costume accessories, weapons and props may be permitted if they are made of soft, lightweight material, do not have any sharp edges, are nonfunctional and otherwise adhere to the Cosplay Costume Guidelines. No special or atmospheric effects, including but not limited to balloons, smoke, fog, sound effects. No oversized costumes, veils, long trains or stilts. Costumes may not interfere with security screenings and cannot measure more than 25” in width and/or 80” in height. Service animals may not wear or be part of a costume. Guests must be fully clothed, including shirts and shoes. For safety reasons, some costumes may not be permitted on certain rides, shows or attractions. Costumes and capes must fit within the interior of a ride vehicle. Costume accessories which are not permitted on rides, shows and attractions can be secured in lockers. Even if you don’t go dressed up, there will also be cosplay-inspired attire available at Fan Fest Nights which runs from Friday, April 25 on select nights through Sunday, May 18. More Pop Mart locations means more chances to score a Labubu The Monsters’ latest collection “Big Into Energy” is set to drop on April 25 through Pop Mart online and in stores. Since now we all know how hard they are to find online, be sure to look up your closest official Pop Mart location or Robo Shop here. Recent and upcoming openings include: Murray, Utah (Storefront) Columbia, Maryland (Storefront) 4/19 The Galleria in Dallas, TX (Storefront now open) Westfield Culver City, CA (Storefront now open) Christiana Mall Newark, Delaware (Storefront) 4/19 The Northridge Mall, CA Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, CA Sinners needs to be seen on 70mm and here’s where: Sinners 70mm (non-IMAX): California: Vista Theater Hollywood in Los Angeles, CA Grand Lake Theater in Oakland, CA New York: Alamo Drafthouse Downtown Brooklyn, NY Village East by Angelika New York, NY New Orleans: Prytania Theater New Orleans, LA Sinners in IMAX 70mm: United States Arizona: Tempe, AZ – Harkins Arizona Mills 18 \u0026 IMAX California: Irvine, CA – Regal Irvine Spectrum \u0026 IMAX Los Angeles, CA – Universal Cinema AMC at CityWalk Hollywood \u0026 IMAX San Francisco, CA – AMC Metreon 16 \u0026 IMAX Florida Fort Lauderdale, FL – Autonation IMAX Theater Indiana Indianapolis, IN – Indiana State Museum IMAX Theatre New York New York, NY – AMC Lincoln Square 13 \u0026 IMAX Texas Dallas, TX – Cinemark Dallas \u0026 IMAX Canada Ontario Woodbridge, ON – Cineplex Cinemas Vaughan United Kingdom London, UK – BFI IMAX More format IMAX locations not in 70mm here. Hong Kong Disneyland turns 20 This June Hong Kong Disneyland celebrates 20 years with more Pixar and Marvel fun alongside Disney classics. New parades will feature the Familia Madrigal, Panda Mei from Turning Red, and more in “Friendtastic!”,  which boasts 11 floats with more than 30 Disney friends. There will be more to come with announcements relating to Pixar and Marvel expansions too. Meet The Wizard of Oz’s Dorothy Gale and Glinda in Abu Dhabi From April 5 through May 11 you can meet The Wizard of Oz‘s Glinda and Dorothy at WB World at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi. It’s a truly unique experience as we do not have a Warner Bros. park in the states that can use its version of the Oz witches in parks unless Six Flags pulls a bold move. Nevertheless this show includes Dorothy performing “Over the Rainbow” which is really neat. Want more io9 news?
