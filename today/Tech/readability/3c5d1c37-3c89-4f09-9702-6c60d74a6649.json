  "description": "Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige \"isn't interested in your theories of superhero fatigue, which he doesn't buy as real,\" writes The Hollywood Reporter. Feige points to the $400 million worldwide box office for Superman (which another article notes in only its second weekend \"has already passed up the entire lifetime run of Marvel's Thunderbolts*.\") So how is Marvel moving forward? Yes, Feige knows Marvel made too many movies and shows (and the other things they did wrong). From the first Iron Man in 2008 through Avengers: Endgame in 2019, Marvel produced around 50 hours of screen storytelling. In the six years since Endgame, the number jumps to an astounding 102 hours of movies and television. 127 hours if you include animation. \"That's too much,\" Feige said. He characterized the time period after Endgame as an era of experimentation, evolution and, unfortunately, expansion. And while he's proud of the experimentation — he points to WandaVision and Loki as some of the best stories they've made — he admits \"It's the expansion that is certainly what devalued\" that output. Being high on success also may have pushed them to readily agree to try to deliver more programming at a time when Disney and the rest of Hollywood were engaged in the streaming wars. \"It was a big company push... [T]here was a mandate that we were put in the middle of, but we also thought it'd be fun to bring these to life.\" Marvel has already pulled back the amount of movies and shows it will make. Some years may even only have one movie. Certainly there will be years with only one show released. Also, Marvel has started \"grinding down\" on budgets, with movies costing up to a third cheaper than the films from 2022 or 2023. Feige also explains why Thunderbolts* struggled at the box office (even though he's called it a \"very, very good movie\"). The massive expansion into television and focus on Disney+ led to the feeling that watching Marvel was becoming a type of homework. \"It's that expansion that I think led people to say, 'Do I have to see all of these? It used to be fun, but now do I have to know everything about all of these?' And I think The Marvels hit it hardest where people are like, 'Okay, I recognize her from a billion dollar movie. But who are those other two? I guess they were in some TV show. I'll skip it.'\" Which had an effect on Thunderbolts*, which featured characters that were seen on various platforms, including some only on shows. The article notes Friday's release of Fantastic Four: First Steps is Marvel Studios' first crack at the characters after \"a trio of movies of various quality and box office made by Twentieth Century Fox before its 2019 acquisition by Disney.\" And the article also acknowledges \"the never-released, 1994 feature produced low-budget king Roger Corman. (Fun fact: the four stars of that movie cameo in Fantastic Four: First Steps.)\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",
