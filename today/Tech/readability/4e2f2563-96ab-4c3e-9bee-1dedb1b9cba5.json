If you’ve been building out a new gaming PC or hoping to play even more games on your PlayStation 5, storage capacity is going to be of high concern. It’s something most of us would be very happy of which to have no upper limit. Unfortunately, that will not ever be the case in our lifetime. Though you can boost your storage quite a bit without breaking the bank. Amazon has the WD_Black SN850X NVMe Internal Gaming SSD for up to 56% off. That brings the price down to just $310. See at Amazon You’ll get read and write speeds of up to 7,300 MB/s on this fourth generation SSD — perfect for high-end computing and heavy duty workstations and, of course, your elite gaming setup. Gamers will find themselves with ridiculously short load times and top-tier performance. And at 4TB,  you can say goodbye to having to keep uninstalling older games just to make room for the new ones. Install the WD_Black Dashboard on your Windows PC and you’ll be able to monitor your drive’s health as well as mess around the the RGB lighting customization.

All of these work together to keep your SSD performance high for fast load times and file transfer. See at Amazon Compatible With PlayStation 5 (With a Catch) For the console players out there, the version with a heatsink is also on discounted. A heatsink is crucial for SSD use on a console. It’s basically a piece of metal that can dissipate the heat from the device. This stabilizes its temperature and can help eliminate performance issues. Crucially, this means you can use it with your PlayStation 5. A standard PlayStation 5 only has a 825GB drive. And on top of that, a some of that space is used toward the core system files. That leaves the player with roughly 667.2GB of usable storage for game installations. But, you can expand that with an SSD with a heatsink. Unfortunately, the 4TB WD_BLACK with heatsink is still listed at its full price. However, the 1TB SSD is seeing a 31% discount right now, coming in at $90.
