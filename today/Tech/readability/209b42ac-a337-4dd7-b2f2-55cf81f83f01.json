Adult Swim has finally revealed a first look at Lazarus, its upcoming anime from Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichiro Watanabe and Jujutsu Kaisen animation studio Mappa. Lazarus‘ first-look trailer (which actually debuted at San Diego Comic-Con behind closed doors, but released wide today thanks to New York Comic Con), shows protagonist Axel Gilberto on the run from authorities. In so doing, he flip kicks police officers, runs on a railroad tracks, and parkours through the skyline of the anime’s futuristic cityscape. All cool guy things you’d expect out of a character who looks like a new-age Spike Spiegel. I’ll spare you the play by play and let you bask in its smooth animation with the trailer below. Now that you’ve seen the trailer, here’s what the anime is actually about. Lazarus is a sci-fi action series set in the year 2052. It’s set in a world that appears to be on the precipice of actual peace thanks to the development of a cutting age painkiller called “Hapna” from a neuroscientist named Dr. Skinner. Although the drug was sold as having no side effects, it turns out Hapna has the worst three-year delayed side effect in that kills its user. Now, all of humanity is expected to die off in 30 days unless a special taskforce called Lazarus uncovers the cure Skinner developed before going AWOL. Good thing this anime didn’t drop in 2020, otherwise folks would’ve had some questions. Here’s a look at its official poster. © Adult Swim / Mappa Lazarus was first announced back at last year’s San Diego Comic-Con. Aside from seeing the collaboration between Watanabe and Mappa, the series also has the distinction of having John Wick director Chad Stahelski serve as the action choreographer and saxophonist Kamasi Washington producing its soundtrack. If you’re amped to tune into Lazarus for the sole purpose of its ostensive tie to Cowboy Bebop, you’ll be pleased to know that its Japanese voice cast will have two familiar voices from the anime join its cast. Here’s a run through of its Japanese voice cast and where you might’ve heard them before: Koichi Yamadera (Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop) as Dr. Skinner Megumi Hayashibara (Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop) as Hersch Mamoru Miyano (Chrollo Lucilfer from Hunter x Hunter) as Axel Maaya Uchida (Alluka Zoldyck from Hunter x Hunter) as Chris Yuma Uchida (Megumi Fushiguro from Jujutsu Kaisen) as Leland Makoto Furukawa (Saitama from One Punch Man) as Doug Manaka Iwami (Akane Kurokawa from Oshi no Ko) as Eleina Akio Otsuka (Yujiro Hanma from Baki Hanma) as Abel “As I embark on this creative journey, I can’t help but feel that this project will serve as a culmination of my career so far,” Watanabe wrote in a 2023 press release. “I hope you enjoy it.” Lazarus will reportedly have 13 episodes and is slated to premiere on Adult Swim in 2025.
