  "text": "Predator: Killer of Killers ended with a tease of where the franchise could go next, and as it turns out, that’s not the full ending. After Torres and Kenji escape from the Grendel King, we see Yautja cart a cryogenically frozen Ursa away into a collection of prisoners. One of them is is Naru, the protagonist of 2022’s Prey played by Amber Midthunder. During the Predator: Badlands panel for San Diego Comic-Con, the Killers ending was shown, further revealing that Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), the leads of the first two films, were also captured. And that extra snippet will be added to Killer of Killers later tonight. It’s not over yet. Stream a new extended ending of Predator: Killer of Killers tonight at 7pm PT on Hulu. pic.twitter.com/sPQrr66HCS — Predator (@Predator) July 25, 2025 Ahead of Killers’ release, Trachtenberg confirmed to io9 that “people who defeat the Predator get captured and are frozen,” which helps laid the groundwork for the Dutch and Harrigan reveals. He also said at the time he planned to get back to Naru when he had the chance. Now that we know those three are in the picture, those plans could start to take some more shape as he steers the franchise towards wherever it’s going. Until we learn more about those plans, you can watch Predator: Killer of Killers on Hulu, and Predator: Badlands when it hits theaters November 7. Want more io9 news? Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what’s next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.",
