But the next two iterations — Mira-II and Mira-III — had better luck. These 5-meter-long vehicles, each weighing 240kg, have completed over 100 successful test flights since they first launched in September last year. The Mira prototype series relies on jet engines for takeoff, cruise, and landing, while incorporating an aerospike rocket engine for high-speed propulsion tests. First conceived in the 1960s, aerospike engines adjust to air pressure changes at all altitudes, making them more efficient than traditional designs. However, aerospikes never entered the mainstream because they are hard to cool and difficult to build. Polaris’ work on advanced cooling technologies and materials may just overcome past engineering challenges.  Polaris made history in October last year when it conducted the first-ever flight powered by an aerospike engine. The AS-1 engine was ignited in flight for three seconds aboard the Mira-II over the Baltic Sea, delivering a thrust of 900 Newtons and accelerating the 229kg vehicle to 864km/h.   The Mira’s future big sister Aurora, however, will be designed to reach hypersonic speeds above Mach 5 (over 6,125km/h) and beyond.  Spaceplanes like Aurora could prove a more cost-effective way to access space than rockets because they can take off from a conventional runway and be reused time and time again — just like a plane, but with more juice.   Polaris’ announcement comes days after Germany’s incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz cast doubts over whether NATO would remain in its “current form,” urging Europe to increase defence spending.",
