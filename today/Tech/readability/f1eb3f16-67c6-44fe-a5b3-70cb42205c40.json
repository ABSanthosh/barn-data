Technology aids, in this noble quest, Empowering students, with tools the best. Teachers inspire, with a human touch, Igniting dreams, so very much. Summaries were generated by Google AI. Generative AI is experimental. Explore other styles: Being a teacher today requires many qualities: from creativity (to engage with students in new ways) and energy (to keep going, even on slow days) to resilience (even when they’re frustrated). As our letter of tribute for educators for this World Teachers’ Day, we partnered with the Otis Redding Foundation and Sony Music Publishing to produce an original recording of Otis Redding’s “Respect,” in addition to a monetary donation to the Foundation’s student music education program to extend our support. We’d also like to take a moment to spotlight teachers around the world and hear from them about what it means to be a teacher today. Here are just a few of their stories. Bruno Reis: History teacher, Belo Horizonte, Brazil “Being a teacher today is more than just teaching content; it’s a mission guided by four pillars: passion, empowerment, partnership and belief. From the moment I enter the classroom, I bring with me the passion for education, that desire to make a difference in the lives of each student — all of which drives me to look beyond the textbooks and see the true potential in every young person.But I also know I can't do everything alone. Partnership with colleagues, families and the community is essential to create transformative projects that broaden horizons and offer real opportunities for growth.” Arianna Pisapia: English teacher, Cava de' Tirreni, Italy “One of the biggest challenges I face as a Social Emotional Learning teacher is fostering a vivid dialogue and meaningful communication with my students. Engaging teenagers can be difficult, but I’ve learned that creating a space where they feel comfortable expressing themselves is key to unlocking their potential.When students are engaged in meaningful dialogue and activities, they develop not only language skills but also empathy, self awareness and a greater understanding of the world around them. This approach is what drives me every day, knowing that I’m not just teaching English, but also helping to shape compassionate and open-minded individuals.” Isao Wachi: Supervisor, Kofu City Board of Education, Japan “The teaching profession is one of the few jobs with the opportunity to interact with young minds who are growing daily, so I feel honored to be part of their learning journey. And being in a role to listen to teachers’ concerns, guide them and think together about how best to support students, I’m reassured daily that teachers always care about their students and want to help them.As education is currently in a period of innovation, thanks to technology, I believe students will be able to make even greater progress with support from both helpful digital tools and teachers who are deeply passionate about their students’ positive future.” Darma Kusumah: Special Education teacher, Jakarta, Indonesia “Many of my students face challenges like hearing difficulties, intellectual disability, and autism. So seeing them empowered by technology and overcoming these obstacles means the world to me. It’s inspiring to witness what may seem like simple acts of turning on their Chromebooks, logging in, and engaging with learning materials are huge milestones for both them and me.” Miguel Ujeda Gálvez: Innovation Director, Madrid, Spain “More than ever, the value of a teacher lies in the human factor — the bond and the inspirational element — as students need role models to internalize the belief that they can become the best versions of themselves.One of the aspects I enjoy most is helping students develop computational thinking skills in an exploratory and playful environment. I’m continually amazed and inspired by their creative abilities and commitment when presented with cognitively demanding tasks, discovering that technology is not just for consumption, but also for creation.” World Teachers’ Day 2024 This World Teachers’ Day, we’re spotlighting teacher stories around the world and showing how Google continues to support learning and education.",
