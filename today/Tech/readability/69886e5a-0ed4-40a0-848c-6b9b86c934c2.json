The Google Flight data shows that travelers can save 25% by booking a flight with a layover instead of a nonstop flight.What day of the week is the cheapest for booking flights?There are certainly cheaper days to fly, there aren't really cheaper days to book. \"There's not much benefit to buying your tickets on a certain day of the week,\" according to the Google report.Google Flights does state that Tuesdays are typically the cheapest day of the week to book, according to the data, but Tuesday bookings are only 1.3% cheaper than the most expensive day, Sunday.Is it cheaper to book flights far in advance?To wait or not to wait? According to Google, it's better to book your travel far in advance, especially if you need to fly on a specific day or time.

According to Google, \"Average prices don't meaningfully drop anytime before departure, but they usually do start to rise within 50 days of the flight itself\" when it comes to international travel from the US.  Never miss out on the cheapest airfare again.
