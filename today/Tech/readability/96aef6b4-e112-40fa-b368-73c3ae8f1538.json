  "text": "Garmin doesn’t actually have a direct competitor out there with a wide range of models that cater to professionals and amateurs. For Prime Day Amazon is offering a whopping 43% discount on the Forerunner 255, bringing its price down to just $199 from its regular price of $349. This is the company’s best-selling product, and it has a 4.7 out of 5 rating and it can be purchased as a limited time offer that does not require a Prime membership. See at Amazon Quality and Tracking Its slender profile and always-visible, full-color face make it comfortable to wear all day and the screen remains easy to view in bright sunlight. Coming in two sizes (46 mm and 41 mm), the watch is sure to fit most wrists and fashion styles. Battery life is great at up to 14 days of smartwatch mode and up to 30 hours of GPS mode, so you can track your fitness and workouts without having to constantly reach for a charger. This watch has an entire suite of features far beyond simple step tracking: Morning Report feature gives you a snapshot of your sleep, HRV, recovery, and workout suggestions as soon as you wake up so you can start each morning knowing exactly what you need to do. Forerunner 255 also has more in-depth information about your training and recovery including monitoring heart rate variability, recovery time, and daily workouts that are suggested based on your performance and rest. If you are preparing to run a race, the adaptive training plans and estimated race finish times keep you motivated and on target, taking into account course data, weather, and your current performance. The watch assesses your current training level in order to inform you whether you’re undertraining or working too hard, and the integrated sports apps accommodate a broad spectrum of activities, from running and cycling to triathlon and multisport profiles. With running dynamics and power in the wrist, you can monitor your stride, ground contact time and effort in real-time. Forerunner 255 also features advanced safety and navigation capabilities: GPS tracking is fast and accurate, no matter what city street or new trail you’re on. The watch pairs with Bluetooth and USB and effortlessly transfers your data to the Garmin Connect app for deeper analysis and sharing with others or coaches. 4 GB of storage gives you room to store your training plans and workout history. If you’re looking for a feature-rich GPS running smartwatch, the Garmin Forerunner 255 at $199 is an unbeatable deal. See at Amazon",
