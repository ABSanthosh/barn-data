Oscar Gonzalez is a Texas native who covered video games, conspiracy theories, misinformation and cryptocurrency. Expertise Video Games | Misinformation | Conspiracy Theories | Cryptocurrency | NFTs | Movies | TV | Economy | Stocks After a successful first season of the Fallout series, Amazon MGM Studios will adapt another video game. Interestingly enough, this franchise has a story that's similar to the one in Amazon's first popular TV series, The Man in the High Castle.Amazon will begin work on adapting the video game Wolfenstein, according to a report from Variety on Friday. There are few details about the show's plot available other than the tagline \"The story of killing Nazis is evergreen.\"The showrunner of the series will be Patrick Somerville, who created Maniac for Netflix and Station Eleven for HBO Max. Jerk Gustafsson -- an executive producer at MachineGames, which develops the Wolfenstein games -- will also be part of the production, as an executive producer.Wolfenstein is one of the oldest video game franchises. The series started back in 1981 with Castle Wolfenstein, a stealth game that was ahead of its time. Most people are familiar with the reboot of the series, Wolfenstein 3D, which was developed by id Software, the company that later acquired the rights to the franchise.In 2010, publisher Bethesda acquired id Software, and a new Wolfenstein game went into production with development handled by MachineGames. That game, Wolfenstein: The New Order, shifted the franchise's setting from World War II to an alternate timeline where the Nazis won the war. This reboot starred William \"B.J.\" Blazkowicz, the same American soldier from the original Wolfenstein 3D, although this time, instead of killing Hitler, he ends up in a coma. Blazkowicz awakens in 1960 and begins fighting to defeat the Nazis once again.Multiple games were released in this new Wolfenstein timeline, including Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot.There are no details on when the new Wolfenstein series will premiere or who will star in it. Amazon MGM Studios didn't immediately respond to a request for additional info about the show.",
