We love getting deals on big-ticket items like this, but some of the best discounts are actually on more affordable products.Case in point: For the final day of the sale, Amazon busted out an offer that lets shoppers score a free CD, Blu-Ray disc, or book. When you buy three of the eligible items from the sale, you can get one of the items free of charge. Typically, Amazon selects the lowest-priced item in your cart as the free item. In addition to physical media like books and DVDs, select toys and craft supplies are also eligible.
