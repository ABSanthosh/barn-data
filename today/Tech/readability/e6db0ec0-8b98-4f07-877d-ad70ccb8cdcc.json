  "text": "We speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education... We must reject the coercive use of public research funding... American institutions of higher learning have in common the essential freedom to determine, on academic grounds, whom to admit and what is taught, how, and by whom... In their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation. This is fine, as far as it goes. But what are all these institutions going to do about the funding cuts, attempts to revoke their nonprofit status, threats not to hire their graduates, and student speech-based deportations? They are going to ask the Trump administration for \"constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\" This sounds lovely, if naive, and I hope it works out well for every one of them as they seek good-faith dialogue with a vice president who has called universities the \"enemy\" and an administration that demanded Harvard submit to the vetting of every department for unspecified \"viewpoint diversity.\" As a first step to finding common ground and speaking with a common voice, the statement is a start. But statements, like all words, can be cheap. We'll see what steps schools actually take—and how much they can speak and act in concert—as Trump's pressure campaign continues to ratchet.",
