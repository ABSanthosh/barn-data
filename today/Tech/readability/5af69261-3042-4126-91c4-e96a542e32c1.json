That’s why we launched Lab Sessions, hands-on collaborations that explore how technology can support creative endeavors. For our latest Lab Session, we teamed up with a true powerhouse in the music industry, Grammy-nominated songwriter Justin Tranter. Together, our goal was to help shape Music AI Sandbox — a suite of generative music tools designed to amplify the creativity of songwriters and musicians everywhere.Embracing the potential of AI in music“As a songwriter, of course I was apprehensive at first — I’m very protective of my community,” Justin says. Songwriters are, after all, the heart and soul of the music ecosystem, shaping culture through their artistry.As Justin began experimenting with the tools, their perspective shifted. “Through working with Google and YouTube, it became evident that Music AI Sandbox empowers songwriters,” says Justin. Using these tools inspired new ideas and opened up new creative avenues, enhancing Justin’s craft.We spent 36 hours with Justin over six weeks, working side-by-side to explore the possibilities of Music AI Sandbox. Together, we examined everything from creating and transforming new sounds to structuring songs and crafting lyrics that fit specific melodies. Justin shared their insights into the songwriting process, and our team used that feedback to build and test prototypes in real-time, constantly refining our concepts and approach. The culmination of this collaboration was \"Silent Tension,” a song created by Justin, vocalist and songwriter Blush, and producer Shawn Wasabi at the legendary Village Studios in Los Angeles. It was important to Justin that this final track showcased the fusion of human and AI collaboration.Exploring the intersection of music and AIMusic AI Sandbox offers a glimpse into a future where technology complements and amplifies human creativity, enabling artists to push boundaries while staying true to their unique artistic visions. We hope this Lab Session with Justin Tranter inspires other musicians and songwriters to explore the limitless possibilities at the intersection of music and AI.Visit us at Labs.google to discover more innovative tools, connect with us on social media (@labsdotgoogle), or join our Discord community at discord.gg/googlelabs.
