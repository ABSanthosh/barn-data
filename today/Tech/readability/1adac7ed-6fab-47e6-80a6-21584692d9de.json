Credit: Nvidia Nvidia has announced that its 5060 line of GeForce RTX GPUs will be available for purchase beginning on April 16. The line includes two models: The RTX 5060 Ti, which comes in 8GB and 16GB VRAM variants, and the RTX 5060, which will only come in an 8GB VRAM option. The former GPU releases on April 16 for $379 and $429, respectively, with the latter coming sometime in May for $299. With the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti, Nvidia is making high-tech features more accessible for gamers who can't afford a $2,000 GPU. In particular, the new 5060 GPUs offer DLSS 4 support and full ray tracing capabilities for enhanced visuals and higher frame rates. “The RTX 5060 family offers gamers next-generation performance and AI-enhanced visuals starting at $299,” said Vice President of GeForce Marketing Matt Wuebbling in an Nvidia press release. “Powered by the advanced NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and featuring DLSS 4 technology in over 100 games, this new class of GPUs elevates gaming with stunning visuals, high frame rates and quick responsiveness.” DLSS 4's AI-enhanced capabilities like Multi Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Nvidia Reflex can all be found in the RTX 5060 GPU family. The company says these features will reduce latency times during gameplay in addition to those speedier frame rates and higher resolution. Mashable Top Stories Better yet, over 100 games will support DLSS 4 when the new GPUs launch, including Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Black Myth: Wukong. Nvidia says that on the GPU's maximum settings, users can enjoy \"stunning ray-traced visuals at over 100 frames per second\" on some titles.If you're planning on buying one to upgrade your current setup, we recommend making your decision as soon as humanly possible, because new Nvidia GPUs tend to go out of stock quickly. (The Nvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 GPUs can be particularly hard to find.) We all remember the RTX 3080 dilemma back in 2020, and with the addition of the volatile U.S. tariff policy situation, we aren't exactly sure how this launch is going to unfold. Product pages for the RTX 5060 Ti aren't even posted yet, so you'll probably want to keep your credit card at the ready. In addition to the GPU announcements, Nvidia revealed that RTX-5060-equipped laptops from every big-name manufacturer will also be available this May starting at $1,099. The new laptops are said to have lower latency and are able to double the frame rates of previous iterations. They'll also come in a range of configurations and sizes starting at 14.9 millimeters.For updates on the RTX 5060 launch, visit the Nvidia website.
