  "text": "Player 456 is back in the game, but this time he’s got a plan. That seems to be what’s teased in the new trailer for Squid Game 2, the highly anticipated, seven-episode second season of Netflix’s biggest show of all time. When last we saw 456 (The Acolyte‘s Lee Jung-jae) he was the last one standing from the games but vowed to bring them down. This season, we see that—somehow— he does get back in and now is using his prior knowledge for good. But will the others trust him? Let’s watch the new trailer and figure it out. What stands out most about this second trailer is that we finally see a few of the new games. We see the standard Red Light, Green Light from season one, but also something with rainbow circles on the ground as well as a giant merry-go-round surrounded by doors. Any ideas? It’s probably bad for 456 that he doesn’t know these new games but that’s to be expected. The trailer also shows him being escorted somewhere by the game masters and a showdown with the man in charge himself. They were waiting and ready for him. In addition, we see shots of the players fighting each other—always a terrifying notion—as well as 456 playing possum when one of the guards comes to check on him. Is he alone? Are others with him? We know that Squid Game 2 is just the second act of the full story, so we’re guessing the seven episodes that drop on December 26 will only solve part of the mystery. But it’s a continuation we have been patiently waiting for for a long time now and we can’t wait to go back. What are your thoughts on the new trailer for Squid Game 2? Are you going to binge the new episodes immediately? Let us know below. Want more io9 news?
