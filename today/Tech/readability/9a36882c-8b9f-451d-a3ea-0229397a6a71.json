  "text": "The author joins the exodus from Elon Musk's X. See ya later, Muskie. Credit: Olivia Wong/Getty Images A day after putting rumors of his X ban to bed, author Stephen King has announced his official exit from the app formerly known as Twitter. \"I'm leaving Twitter,\" he posted on Nov. 14. \"Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic. Follow me on Threads, if you like.\" Tweet may have been deleted The move doesn't come as too much of a surprise if you've been paying attention to the App Store charts. In recent days, X competitors Bluesky and Threads have skyrocketed in popularity, leaving billionaire Elon Musk's app in the dust. For X users, the exodus is a direct response to the U.S. election results and Musk's new role in President-elect Donald Trump incoming administration. Mashable Top Stories Earlier this week, Bluesky reported over 700,000 new sign-ups with the app reaching No. 1 on the Apple App Store charts. Over on Threads, King's new home, Meta reports its X alternative has reached 275 million active users. There's no doubt the horror maestro's move to Threads will inspire some of his 7 million followers on X to do the same. King has been a vocal critic of Musk's since the tech billionaire bought the platform in late 2022, publicly lambasting Musk's decisions and occasionally using his platform for trolling purposes. So it should come as no surprise that King's first post on Threads is a critical assessment of Trump's \"ludicrous\" cabinet picks. He writes, \"The Klown Kar isn’t absolutely full, but it’s getting there.\" Crystal Bell is the culture editor at Mashable, overseeing the site's coverage of content creators, digital trends, and internet culture with a focus on how young people engage with others and themselves online.
