  "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from KrebsOnSecurity: The financial technology firm Finastra is investigating the alleged large-scale theft of information from its internal file transfer platform, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world's top 50 banks, notified customers of the security incident after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company. London-based Finastra has offices in 42 countries and reported $1.9 billion in revenues last year. The company employs more than 7,000 people and serves approximately 8,100 financial institutions around the world. A major part of Finastra's day-to-day business involves processing huge volumes of digital files containing instructions for wire and bank transfers on behalf of its clients. On November 8, 2024, Finastra notified financial institution customers that on Nov. 7 its security team detected suspicious activity on Finastra's internally hosted file transfer platform. Finastra also told customers that someone had begun selling large volumes of files allegedly stolen from its systems. \"On November 8, a threat actor communicated on the dark web claiming to have data exfiltrated from this platform,\" reads Finastra's disclosure, a copy of which was shared by a source at one of the customer firms. \"There is no direct impact on customer operations, our customers' systems, or Finastra's ability to serve our customers currently,\" the notice continued. \"We have implemented an alternative secure file sharing platform to ensure continuity, and investigations are ongoing.\" But its notice to customers does indicate the intruder managed to extract or \"exfiltrate\" an unspecified volume of customer data.
