  "description": "In the last few years, Western symbolism has been infiltrating pop culture. Country music has never been more mainstream, cowboy boots seem here to stay, and now we’ve noticed a similar trend in the art world: horses are the new ‘it’ motif. Don’t believe us? Here are 20 excellent equestrian paintings by Australian artists that have caught our eye, and before you know it, you’ll be seeing horses everywhere.",

  "text": "Artists have been depicting horses throughout almost all of history. In fact, some of the most famous pieces of all time feature these animals in one way or another; as a mode of transport back in ancient Rome; in warfare paintings like Pablo Picasso’s Guernica; and as an iconic symbol of freedom in America’s western era. Now, equestrian art is making a bit of a comeback, following on the from the rise of country iconography in music, fashion, and even interiors. And we’re not the only ones picking up on this shift. Sydney-based artist Madelyn Bilsborough has been painting horses since early in her practice, but in the last year, she’s had more buyers interested in her abstract horse-inspired works, or asking for commissions that incorporate western themes. ‘I think certain symbols, like the horse, start to re-emerge when people crave grounding, nostalgia or a sense of wide-open space,’ Madelyn says. ‘And perhaps in contrast to how digital and fast-paced so much of life has become, particularly in a time where many are craving deeper connection and meaning, these symbols feel more relevant than ever.’ Growing up as a ‘country kid’ in Western Australia, artist Jessie Hartwig-Boutkan creates art from her personal connection to horses and the stories they evoke about Australia’s bush, like Banjo Paterson’s romantic depictions of life on the land. Her beautiful pieces play with contrasting pastel and earthy hues, and her recent collections of horse paintings have all sold out. ‘Western themes have definitely surged in visibility — partly driven by pop culture, but also by a deeper cultural shift. There’s a yearning for simplicity and authenticity, and the cowboy aesthetic taps into that,’ Jessie adds. This might explain the allure behind Gary Abkin’s cowboy figures, or Mt Isa-based artist Kiara Bruce’s soothing depictions of horses and life in outback Queensland, and the loveable, whimsical energy of Ngukurr Arts artist (and former ranger!) Jill Daniels’ colourful artworks. It seems horse paintings are officially ‘in’, and we’re on board for the ride!",
