What a fun first week of spring surprise, my new striped couch (loveseat) arrived two months early! I was a bit nervous the day it was scheduled to arrive, buying a couch is a such a big decision. This one will be right in the center of our home for years to come so I really wanted to love it. It can be so hard to imagine what a piece of furniture will look and feel like until it’s actually in place. There are so many factors than need to be right from how it feels in the room, to the fabric to comfort to style. I had a fabric sample, but I was going a little out on a limb with a bolder pattern in blue stripe, versus a plain fabric. We had to use our imagination and mood boards to picture it! Well, turns out I don’t love it as much as I thought I would. Much to my delight, I love this striped couch so much MORE than I ever imagined! It’s true. It is more adorable than I even pictured and so cozy and comfy. We’re very pleased! I haven’t set up the whole room yet, but I wanted to show you right away since I know you were as excited as I was to see it (but I will definitely take better pics and share more once we get it styled)! This rug is our dining room rug which is just here temporarily. We have a new rug on order (the new rug isn’t blue, but this does look so cozy!) and a few other pieces, which I’ll share more about soon. When you walk in the room and see this couch sitting there, it really feels like it was made for this house. The size is just perfect for this spot, too. It comes it longer lengths, but we chose the 61 inch. Our living room is quite compact so before looking for couches I measured the spot where it would go and decided 61 inches was the ideal length. Our other couch was actually longer overall but mostly because the arms were so much bigger. That length limited our options considerably, but I wanted to leave some breathing room on either side to make it easier for everyone to walk around as well as so we have a little room to set other chairs around the room when we have family over. I was very careful and thorough in my research before we bought this, so I made a list of what was important to us including length and other features I ideally wanted (and assumed I would probably have to compromise on some of them!). I really didn’t want to have to settle for a couch I wouldn’t love, though, since it would be such an important piece in our home. Here is the striped couch we chose (in the mist performance double stripe fabric). Much to my surprise, I didn’t have to compromise on anything on my list with this one. It checked all of the boxes. My ideal list: Loveseat (61 inches)Fabric durability (pet friendly)Greenguard certifiedColor and patternEnglish roll arm styleBench seatDown filledCaster legsTight back (no cushions) It really seemed like it might be a nearly impossible list for our price range but all the research paid off and now, here she is! I love the scalloped back, too. That was not on my “must have list” but it really makes it feel special and adds a bit of extra charm. The couch is really comfortable too. I love this style with the tight back, not only because it never looks disheveled (which was important to me given it’s in view throughout the whole main floor and from the front door), but for how comfortable it is for all shapes and sizes of people! It comes with two super cozy down pillows so you can use them if you want a little extra support behind you or remove them and just sit all the way back. I think most people would find this couch very comfortable to sit on, but of course what matters most is the people who will use it every day! l am only 5’2 and if I am going to all the way back sit back I would grab a pillow, but it’s very easy to get comfortable because the couch itself is very comfy! I like that it has enough depth for a taller or larger person to feel comfortable but by grabbing a pillow the more height challenged people like me :) don’t have to feel like a little kid in a grown up chair. The optional pillows allow it to be roomy when you need more space and comfortable for everyone. The seat itself is not too deep to sit and have a conversation, and not too shallow for a taller person, and there’s room for curling up, taking a nap or feeling cozy! Here is the couch we chose (in the mist performance double stripe fabric). We chose the bench style seat because it’s such a short length, that way you can have two people sitting on the couch and a little grand babe or pup in the middle! No one has to sit on the crack between cushions. If you’ve been looking for a couch, we LOVE this one! I also made a decision on chairs (!) and expect they will arrive sometime in the next couple of months. If you missed the chair inspiration post you can see that here (but I actually ended up going in a different direction than I originally thought, so I’m REALLY glad I took the time to think the chairs through, too. I’m confident I made the right choice for us!). More to share soon, friends!",
