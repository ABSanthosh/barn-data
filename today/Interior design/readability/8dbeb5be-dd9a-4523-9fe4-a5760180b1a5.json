  "text": "Called Yngsjö, this serene holiday retreat in Southern Sweden is designed by Johan Sundberg Arkitektur. This single-story haven, built for a London-based Swedish family, replaces a deteriorating summer cottage that once occupied the wooded plot near the Baltic Sea coastline. The architects chose a palette of natural materials to harmonize with the surrounding landscape. The structure features a timber frame wrapped in Siberian larch cladding, with vertical pilasters. Material selection and light coloration were used to create a delicate balance in the building, establishing a contemporary architectural statement, while allowing it to blend with the natural surroundings. The home is named after its location in the Scania country, and it serves as the family’s tranquil escape from urban life, offering a seamless connection to Sweden’s coastal wilderness. Designer: Johan Sundberg Arkitektur Studio founder Johan Sundberg used horizontal lines and simplicity in his design approach, carefully avoiding what he calls “veering into minimalism.” His inspiration draws from what he considers the “golden era” of Scandinavian and early British modernism, creating a space that feels both contemporary and timeless.  “I aimed to reduce complexity but avoid reductionism, creating a house that stands out while still adapting to its surroundings,” he said. The Yngsjö house is positioned on a small mound and stretches northward, rising above the ground on slim steel pillars that give the structure a floating appearance. This clever elevation ensures the home sits delicately on the natural terrain. The underside features triple-layered larch panels that help the building blend seamlessly with the surrounding forest environment. This architectural approach creates a harmonious relationship between the man-made structure and its wooded setting. The northern elevated section of the Yngsjö house accommodates the more private areas, featuring bedrooms with expansive windows that offer stunning views across the treetops. The southern portion houses the entrance, kitchen, and communal spaces, creating a natural flow between social and personal zones. In the central section of the home is a cleverly recessed section that creates space for a west-facing outdoor dining terrace that captures the sunset. This allows residents to enjoy their meals while sitting in the warm sunset glow. Inside, the interior showcases oak floors, trimmings, doors, and custom carpentry work. The ceiling and its overhanging elements are connected through the use of larch, which serves a dual purpose – creating visual continuity while providing sound-absorbing properties throughout the home. These carefully selected natural materials contribute to the warm, inviting atmosphere of this lovely retreat. “The kitchen, entirely in oak, adds a warm, mysterious quality to the interior – it became delightful, darker, and a bit more mysterious than I first imagined,” said Sundberg. Strategically placed skylights illuminate the corridor leading to the bedrooms and bathrooms, covering the space with natural light and creating a better connection to the outdoor environment. Wooden blinds offer some privacy, enabling the residents to create a snug and bunk-like atmosphere when they feel like it. Sundberg states that the corridor skylights are one of the home’s most successful design elements. The raised section of the home creates outdoor space beneath the structure, including a sheltered area that houses a ping-pong table. This elevated design serves a dual purpose – offering additional space while protecting against potential future storms that could elevate water levels by up to three meters along Scania’s coastlines. Sundberg also says that the completed residence “embodies the Scandinavian mindset” of its London-based Swedish owners. The home achieves a delicate balance, as it feels both airy and cozy, and serves as a year-round retreat, where residents can relax and reconnect with nature.",
