  "text": "Douglas Bridge and Alison Jacob came across this sandstone cottage in Oatlands purely by accident, on ‘a random road trip’. It was little more than a crumbling relic, but they fell in love with its enduring charm: ‘We thought that it was a gorgeous, significant little piece of Tasmanian history, near ruin, and in need of saving,’ Douglas says. Originally built by convicts in 1842, the home’s north-eastern elevation had collapsed, patched over with asbestos sheeting. Inside, rising damp and decades of neglect had taken its toll. But rather than extending or modernising beyond recognition, the couple engaged renowned local firm Taylor and Hinds Architects to undertake a respectful and refined restoration Most renovation projects include an extension element, but this cottage was actually reduced in size over the course of its restorations. ‘More an alteration and subtraction, than an addition,’ is how Mat Hinds described the project when it last featured on The Design Files in 2020. It took about 18 months to transform the ‘little pile of Georgian rubble’ into the charming residence it is today. Inside, the floors have been peeled back to reveal pit-sawn floorboards as new Tasmanian oak joinery lines the walls, enhancing the rustic charms of the sandstone exterior. The library is especially cosy, and large-format windows with built-in seating maximise sunshine and expansive garden views. Since its completion, the cottage has won a number of awards — including the 2020 Lachlan Macquarie Award for Heritage Architecture. And for the past seven years, it’s been a cherished second home for Douglas and Alison, who have recently made the bittersweet decision to offer Bozen’s Cottage to a new owner. The cottage is located on a hectare of land in the growing township of Oatlands, which is famous for having the largest concentration of Georgian sandstone buildings in Australia. But it’s also home to beautiful heritage streetscapes, boutique cafes and shops, and the renown Callington Mill Distillery. Expressions of interest are now open through the vendor’s advocate, Shepherd\u0026Co. Buyers can register their interest online here before 30 April 2025.",
