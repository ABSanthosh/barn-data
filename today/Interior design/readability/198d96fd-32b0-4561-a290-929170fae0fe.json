  "description": "Here's a wonderful piece of physical design from industrial design studio DesignWright. The London-based firm created this Flip Alarm Clock, which has no pesky \"off\" button to fumble for. Instead you simply flip it over. (The display flips too, obviously.) The large letters leave no ambiguity as to whether you remembered to set the alarm or not. The Flip is in production by Paris-based design brand Lexon. They offer the Flip in three flavors: Mini, Classic (both rubberized) and Premium (with an aluminum finish).",
