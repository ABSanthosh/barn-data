  "text": "I’ve heard of ‘sit-down cocktail parties’ but this one takes it too literally. Meet the Cocktail Chair from the mind of zany furniture designer Muddycap. It comes with a Martini-shaped design, complete from the chair looking like a martini glass to its backrest looking like a row of olives. Perfect for an eclectic bachelor pad, the Cocktail Chair would work wonderfully in a large space like a studio apartment, or in a quirky interior that’s filled with strange bits and bobs. Either way, this chair is bound to become the center of attention no matter where you place it. Surprisingly, this isn’t the first time Muddycap’s enchanted us with a weird chair. In fact, their entire Instagram profile is filled with precisely this creativity. Is this chair the quirkiest of the lot? Not by far, but it does have a certain Warholian panache that would fit well in an artist’s residence, maybe in the mid-70s. Designer: Muddycap The resemblance to the martini glass is honestly uncanny. Sure, martini glasses usually have longer stems (and this one could too), but the shape and proportions are unmistakable. The ‘glass’ gets ditched for metal, there’s a cocktail-colored cushion that looks like liquid inside the glass, and three olives for you to rest back on, skewered together by a metal toothpick that sits precariously on the rim of a glass. While conceptual, it’s easy to look at the glass and say that the thing is absolutely feasible. The chair’s base is highly achievable, as is the cushion. The olives are made of molded plastic, with a cushion mounted on the front for comfort. However, the illusion of the martini glass carries over to the back too, where you can see the olive’s indent, where the fruit’s stem would have originally grown out of. Olives mostly get de-stemmed and de-stoned before being served in cocktails. Sometimes, they get stuffed with pimento peppers, but these look like the normal plain ones. Muddycap’s designs are ALL made using 3D software. There’s no AI trickery anywhere, although I do wish the designer actually manufactured some of these chairs rather than simply sharing the designs for free on social media. I’m assuming it’s just a matter of time before ‘cocktail chair’ actually yields you results on AliExpress…",
