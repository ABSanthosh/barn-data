Bulova marks an extraordinary milestone this year with 150 years of uninterrupted watchmaking excellence originating from New York City. The iconic American brand commemorates this sesquicentennial achievement with the release of two exceptional limited-edition timepieces that resurrect the brand’s Art Deco heritage. These anniversary pieces don’t merely replicate historical designs; they reimagine them for contemporary collectors while preserving the essence that made them revolutionary in their time. Designer: Bulova The Limited-Edition 150 Art Deco Collection features two distinct timepieces: the elegant Miss America ladies’ watch and a meticulously crafted pocket watch. Each piece carries individual numbering and features case backs adorned with the 150th Anniversary logo, presented in custom-designed cases accompanied by detailed storybooks chronicling Bulova’s rich Art Deco legacy. Art Deco represented a transformative period for Bulova. This artistic movement of the 1920s and 1930s coincided with the brand’s expansion and cemented design principles that continue to influence its aesthetic approach today. “With these limited-edition timepieces, we’re bringing the past into the present, reimagining timeless design for the modern collector,” explains Michael Benavente, Bulova’s brand managing director. This philosophy guides the entire collection, balancing historical authenticity with contemporary craftsmanship. Miss America: Feminine Elegance Reimagined The 150 Art Deco Miss America watch revives one of Bulova’s most celebrated feminine designs. The original Miss America collection, launched in 1930, captured the evolving role of women during a pivotal era of social transformation. Its influence spanned four decades, establishing Bulova as a creator of timepieces that complemented the changing fashion sensibilities of modern women. The contemporary interpretation maintains the delicate proportions and ornate detailing of its predecessor. A slender silver-tone stainless steel case measuring just 18.3mm creates a refined presence on the wrist. Six deep blue synthetic sapphires adorn the case, creating striking visual contrast against the metallic surfaces. Perhaps the most distinctive element of the Miss America is its intricately filigreed expansion bracelet. This elaborate metalwork exemplifies the attention to detail characteristic of Art Deco jewelry, featuring a seamless buckle closure that maintains the bracelet’s visual continuity. The craftsmanship evident in these small details demonstrates Bulova’s commitment to authentic period design. The silver-tone dial, with its brushed surface and blue hands inspired by vintage watches, continues the vintage aesthetic. A domed sapphire crystal protects the dial while adding visual depth to the overall design. Together, these elements create a timepiece that functions as wearable art rather than merely a timekeeping instrument. Despite its ornate appearance, the Miss America incorporates modern functionality. The reliable 5Y20 quartz movement ensures accurate timekeeping, while 30-meter water resistance makes the watch suitable for everyday wear. The distinctive tonneau case shape, a hallmark of Art Deco design, features an anti-reflective curved sapphire crystal that enhances legibility. Production of the Miss America is limited to 600 pieces worldwide, with each watch individually numbered. Available at $1,950, this collector’s piece launched in late March 2025, offering enthusiasts immediate access to this celebration of Bulova’s design heritage. The Art Deco Pocket Watch: Mechanical Mastery While wristwatches dominate contemporary timekeeping, the pocket watch represents an essential chapter in horological history. Bulova’s 150 Art Deco Pocket Watch pays homage to this tradition, drawing inspiration from the company’s iconic 1920s designs when pocket watches represented the pinnacle of portable timekeeping technology. The substantial 45.5mm case provides an impressive canvas for showcasing Bulova’s mechanical expertise. Coin-edge texturing adorns the silver-tone stainless steel case, complemented by a textured bow that connects to a 15.8-inch custom link chain. This chain features a specially designed lobster claw and spring ring closure system that balances security with period-appropriate aesthetics. Technical excellence defines this commemorative piece. A self-winding Swiss mechanical movement featuring 21 jewels powers the timepiece, offering an impressive 62-hour power reserve. This sophisticated mechanism represents a significant achievement in mechanical watchmaking, providing extended autonomy between windings. The sterling silver dial showcases intricate central engravings that pay tribute to early Bulova craftsmen. Bold numerals set against a brushed hour ring create excellent legibility, while elegant blued minute and hour hands provide striking contrast against the silver background. These design elements recreate the sophisticated aesthetic of the Art Deco period while maintaining practical functionality. Limited to just 350 pieces worldwide and priced at $2,950, the pocket watch became available in early April 2025. This exceptional timepiece connects Bulova’s mechanical watchmaking heritage with contemporary craftsmanship, offering collectors a rare opportunity to own a piece of horological history. Cultural Legacy and Heritage Preserved The Limited-Edition 150 Art Deco Collection transcends mere corporate celebration, acknowledging Bulova’s profound influence on American watch design during a transformative cultural period. Jeffrey Cohen, President of Citizen Watch America, captures this significance perfectly: “The Art Deco era was a defining moment for Bulova, marked by cutting-edge technology, bold design, and pioneering marketing strategies. With these limited-edition timepieces, we are reimagining that legacy for the modern era, honoring our past while continuing to push the boundaries of craftsmanship and innovation in our 150th year.” By selecting Art Deco as the focal point for this anniversary, Bulova highlights an era when its design language achieved peak distinctiveness. Founded by Joseph Bulova in 1875, the company has consistently pioneered innovations that transformed watchmaking while maintaining its position at the forefront of design and technology. The thoughtful presentation enhances each timepiece’s significance. Luxurious custom cases contain the watches alongside detailed storybooks providing historical context about Bulova’s Art Deco heritage. This approach transforms the watches from products into cultural artifacts with rich narratives. Limited production numbers (600 Miss America watches and 350 pocket watches) ensure exclusivity and collectible status. For enthusiasts, these pieces represent an opportunity to own functional art objects embodying 150 years of continuous innovation. They serve as wearable connections to an influential design movement that shaped American aesthetic sensibilities during a pivotal historical period. The collection demonstrates how historical designs can successfully adapt to contemporary expectations while connecting generations of watch enthusiasts through timeless design principles. Through these meticulously crafted timepieces, Bulova affirms Art Deco’s lasting influence and ensures this distinctive aesthetic approach will continue inspiring future generations of watchmakers and collectors alike.",
