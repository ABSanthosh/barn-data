  "text": "At Orgatec 2024, the contract furniture manufacturer presents a number of product innovations that combine sustainable design with functional solutions. The new developments primarily promote communication and collaboration in modern working environments.At Orgatec 2024, Brunner showcases a range of product innovations for the workplace of the future, presented at a stand designed in collaboration with the Ippolito Fleitz Group‘The future works with shared visions’ is the motto of Brunner, a family-owned company from Baden, which has been creating new possibilities with its innovative furniture since 1977. Visitors to Orgatec 2024 had the opportunity to experience how Brunner‘s product world helps to realise the promising idea of New Work. To demonstrate this, Brunner collaborated with the Ippolito Fleitz Group to create an interactive and immersive trade fair stand: a house made of recycled paper that impressively presents modern solutions for different work situations – sustainable and creative with new colours and materials.At Brunner’s inviting stand, which brought a sense of calm and harmony to the hustle and bustle of the trade fair, visitors experienced how adaptable furniture can create seamless transitions to meet the demands of modern working environments. Whether for open-plan offices, conference rooms, cafeterias, reception or seminar areas, Brunner’s multifunctional products adapt to any space situation, improving communication, concentration, contemplation or collaboration accordingly.Brunner introduces its new collections of flexible furniture that fosters harmonious transitions in modern work environments, enhancing communication and collaborationCustomiZed diversityArchitects and planners were particularly impressed by the impressions of the upcoming Brunner Design System, which was developed together with the material experts of the Ippolito Fleitz Group – a sophisticated colour and material lexicon that simplifies project planning. A prime example of Brunner’s design diversity is the new wave table range. With its memorable aesthetics and extensive customisation options, wave is equally at home as the centrepiece of a conference room or in workspaces and, with its central base, can also be used effectively in hospitality areas. The blend of visual lightness, elegance and stability provided by a robust steel construction – even in large dimensions – offers exciting possibilities across different environments.With its memorable aesthetics and extensive customization options, wave is equally at home as the centrepiece of a conference room or in workspacesAs with all Brunner products, it is not just the outer features of wave that are attractive. The wooden or metal covers on the table legs are magnetically fixed, ensuring that the cable management system running through the base remains easily accessible at all times. The cover can be upholstered in leather, stained or powder coated in a range of colours. The distinctive wave shape of the table legs and the high quality are consistent across all versions.The elegant tables from the wave series stand out with their distinctive wave shape, offering numerous customisation options that perfectly complement the ray executive office chairComfortable solutions for every areaAnother new Brunner innovation is the ergonomic high-end office chair ray executive, which has a timeless aesthetic and can be combined with different table designs and styles. With three backrest heights and matching upholstered cushions, it not only looks great at the desk, but also ensures maximum seating and postural comfort in meeting and conference rooms. The finish and colour scheme can be customised, allowing ray executive to blend seamlessly into existing interiors while still demonstrating its executive qualities.Timeless aesthetics and ergonomic comfort define the ray executive office chair, which features three different back heights to adapt to individual needsThe tables in the wave light series continue the wave concept. With its lightweight and resource-saving plastic frame, available in a range of sizes and colours, wave light proves to be the ideal bistro and standing table. It can be used flexibly in dining areas, conference rooms and communal areas. Alongside it at Orgatec, Brunner also presented scoop, which quickly became a crowd favourite, and emphasised: ‘These new products have primarily been developed over the last 1-2 years to meet the growing demands of the workplace – agile, comfortable and timeless.’ The delicate look of the chair, with its open backrest, makes it versatile for different styles without losing any of its character.‘These new products have primarily been developed over the last 1-2 years to meet the growing demands of the workplace – agile, comfortable and timeless’In addition, scoop itself offers an impressive range of options. The chair can be ordered with or without armrests, with different upholstery styles or completely bare, in four frame types and eight colours. Thanks to the high-quality materials, scoop is robust and can even be stacked depending on the model. Another plus is the seating comfort, which was extensively tested at Orgatec and found to be very good.Designed for versatility, the wave light is an ideal bistro and standing table, crafted with a lightweight, resource-saving plastic frame that pairs perfectly with the delicate scoop chair featuring an open backrestMobility with comfortWith the new advance table series and the further development of boards and pads, Brunner brings mobility to the point. The stackable advance folding table makes it easy to organise even spontaneous meetings. These simple models have a T-shaped frame that is not only quick to set up, but also includes a folding mechanism with a fallback safety device and cable management concealed in the table leg. Even impromptu events look clearly structured and tidy with advance. The die-cast aluminium frame also ensures stability while remaining visually appealing.Brunner makes no compromises when it comes to convenient mobility – in terms of style and quality, the new developments are in no way inferior to their predecessorsTo complement this, Brunner presents a new media trolley from the boards series, with a sturdy steel construction and a matching screen holder for large screens up to 85 inches. Flexibility is also the keyword to describe the expansion of pads. Whether on glides or castors, the stylish stools are always in the right place at the right time. Of course, Brunner makes no compromises when it comes to convenient mobility. In terms of style and quality, the new developments are in no way inferior to their predecessors.Brunner offers adaptable furniture solutions for flexible conference spaces, such as the advance folding table series, boards media trolley and pads mobile stools.Rethinking ergonomicsThese two new products are also dedicated to maximum seating comfort. With ray work, Brunner has succeeded in bringing comfortable design to the workplace, making this stylish swivel chair an enhancement to any home office. Whether fully upholstered with elegant wave quilting or with a simple seat upholstery, ray work is a comfortable office chair that keeps the user in balance thanks to its innovative synchronous mechanism with automatic weight adjustment. The wait bench system proves that even waiting can be an enjoyable experience – expandable from a two-seater to a five-seater, with a wide selection of shells from the entire hero collection as well as the scoop series. The various design options available make it possible to customise the benches perfectly for waiting areas, lounges or reception areas.Visitors to Orgatec 2024 were not only impressed by Brunner’s new world of products, but also by the flexibility of the design options and the wide range of materials and colours showcased. No two projects are the same for Brunner. Technically skilled and passionate about collaboration, they embrace every new challenge to find perfectly tailored solutions for individual customer needs. Production takes place in the company’s own halls: ‘made in Germany’ with a high level of craftsmanship.With ray work and wait, Brunner presents innovations that ensure the highest seating comfort, whether in a home office, a traditional office or while waitingGuest Feature by Mareile Morawietz / Architonic",
