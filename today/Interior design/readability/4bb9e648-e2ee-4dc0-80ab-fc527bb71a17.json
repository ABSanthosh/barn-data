  "text": "Murase Kabanko’s samurai armor randoseru backpackMurase Kabanko introduces a made-to-order Japanese randoseru backpack that recreates the style of a samurai armor using recycled scraps from school bags production. From the flaps to the colors, the samurai armor randoseru backpack modernizes the traditional gauntlets and protection gears of a warrior. One of the first indications is the use of black, red, and brown colors, each of which draw from the Japanese battle clothing.The brand Murase Kabanko says that parts of the samurai armor randoseru backpack come from mass production and discarded parts of school bags. Instead of bringing them back as their same purpose or design, these recycled items take on a new form. The flap section uses tensile parts, designed to resemble armor by joining each piece together. The large gusset is made of different leathers combined together to create a pattern. To complete the samurai ensemble, the brand adds ‘glaring faces’ of warriors on both sides of the backpack.all images courtesy of Murase KabankoBrass for the zipper pulls, hooks, and claspsFor the samurai armor randoseru backpack, Murase Kabanko cuts up leather into rectangular plates and places them on top of each other to create the pattern of a Japanese-style armor. The brand also designs the bag with brass buttons, appearing throughout the accessory, to replicate the similar visual elements found in the traditional armor. For the warriors’ glaring faces, the black stitches highlight their features, and brass is the main material used for the zipper pulls, hooks, and clasps. So far, the samurai armor randoseru backpack by Murase Kabanko is made to order.This means that while the accessory is available, it can take up to six months of production before it gets delivered. The brand notes that the design is handmade, and due to the number of thorough pieces assembled, the backpack may not be suitable for children or to be used as a daily accessory at school or work. Occasional use can be ideal, but the owner has to be careful so as not to wear it off easily. In this case, the brand’s randoseru backpack fits more as a collector’s edition, and for fans of the previous eras, this may just be a sought-after item for them.Murase Kabanko introduces a made-to-order Japanese armore randoseru backpackteh red-colored exterior is made of cut-up leather partsbrass is used for the zipper pulls, hooks, and claspsbrass buttons appear throughout the accessorythere are stitching of warriors’ glaring faces on the sides of the bag",
