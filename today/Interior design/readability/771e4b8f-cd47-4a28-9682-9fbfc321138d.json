Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Sources: Scalloped Shade Lamp // Console Table // Bunny Pitcher and Realistic Faux Tulips (both colors shown are linked) // Rug // Blue and White Ornaments Under Table Can you believe spring is only about 56 days from now? But why does January feel like it’s about 9 weeks long? Ha! It just keeps going and going. Now that we finally just have just one week left in the month, I feel like I’m getting ready to emerge from my long winter’s nap :) so I can get my home ready to welcome a new season. Here are a few little decorating updates I’ve made in our home this month: Bunny Pitcher and Realistic Faux Tulips (both colors shown are linked) Spring tulips and bunnies This week I put my spring tulips in my bunny pitcher! This vase is in my home every season, but I think the tulips and bunnies are a perfect combination for spring. Source: Bistro Table // Planters // Faux cedar topiaries // Bunny Planter (+ more) Winter greenery and spring flowers A couple of months ago I decided to try these faux plants (cedar topiaries) in the planters on our bedroom deck — and I love them! I really should have put away my planters for the season but didn’t . I will for future years for sure :). (See more about why I LOVE these plant stands and other ways to use them in my post here) Faux cedar topiaries At first I just thought these faux cedar topiaries would bring some life and green to my deck for late fall and early winter, but now I think I will use them all year! They really look good and will be so much more economical than trying to keep a lot of plants or flowers alive up here. Plus if we bring them down to the front porch they are deer proof! Bunny Planter (+ more) I also saw this sweet little spring plant when my mom and I stopped in a garden center this week, so I pulled out my bunny planter to add a little color to the deck! Spring joys. Sources: Beaded Light // Blue and White Check Curtains (chambray) // Gingham Sheets // Quilt // Rug // Blue and White Lamp //Bird art, pillow, similar chairs and more January bedroom refresh I always try to give our bedroom a little refresh every January so this month I swapped two pieces of furniture and made a few other little updates I’ll share soon. I had an opportunity to do a project for a brand a couple of weeks ago and I was gifted these sheets and a quilt. It was a fun surprise to get to work with them because I order from this brand often (I love both their clothes and home items) so it was like a birthday gift to try these gingham linen sheets! They definitely make our room feel more spring-like. Gingham Linen Sheets (color options) Linen Quilt Doesn’t my grandbaby Forrest look adorable on my bed? He’s the best winter mood booster! He didn’t want to take a nap one of the days so we let him join us for a photoshoot and he loved it! I love having my two new grandbabies. It could make me feel old, but somehow at the same time it’s like getting to relive one of the best chapters of my life as a young mom! He’s a mini-Courtney and I see her baby face every time I look at him. A place for everything I shared my new wicker trunk last week in this post. I’ve been motivated in making these kinds of changes by the phrase “a place for everything and everything in it’s place, so I made it my “theme” for this year! I shared more about my theme of the year in this post. Stair basket I also got this new basket for our stairs. We keep a baby gate (this one) at the bottom of the stairs to keep our puppy Finnegan from wandering the house when we aren’t there to supervise. We’ve always had a strict safety rule that nothing is allowed to be put on the steps, even temporarily. But ever since we got the puppy, rather than opening the gate all the time, we started tossing things over the gate to protect him from grabbing it or slipping upstairs when we weren’t looking, Stair basket Stair basket Since we started putting stuff on the stairs more regularly, I decided we might as well try to make it look better and be less dangerous, so we got a basket that is tucked over to the side on the landing where we don’t walk. Our stairway is narrow and the landing curves, but the shape and size of this basket fits perfectly! Refreshing the living room I still find it a bit unsettling to not have a couch in our living room, so I’ve been eager to work on ideas for how to solve this couch situation (if you missed that post click here). I did lots of research and over thought everything :) but I’ve finally narrowed down the best options for our home and family. I will share what i’m considering for this room soon. What’s next at my house for February and March? Besides my living room refresh, I’ve got several other spaces and rooms I’m excited to work on. After a few years of getting settled and renovating, now we finally get to work on the fun spaces and smaller projects I love the most. Also, I realized I still haven’t officially shared our mudroom makeover on the blog since the renovation, so I’ll for sure do a full post on that whole makeover next week.",
