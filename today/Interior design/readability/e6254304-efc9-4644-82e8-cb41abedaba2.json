We want the people we love to feel welcome in our homes, and that can be hard without a dedicated guest bed. Not everyone has the space for a dedicated guest room though, so where are some smaller spots beds in which beds can be hidden? Can any of these work in your home? 1. A Bed in the Wall A Murphy bed is one of the simplest ways to hide a bed in plain sight. When you’re not using it, the bed folds neatly into the wall, leaving a smooth surface behind. Depending on your style and needs, the wall could feature a bookshelf, a desk, some mounted art, or even just a clean panel that blends with the rest of the room. This option is especially helpful in studio apartments or multi-purpose rooms where space is more limited. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 2. Tucked Under the Stairs The space under a staircase often goes unused, but it has great potential for a hidden bed. With a pull-out mechanism, you can install a compact bed that slides in and out of the area as needed. It’s perfect for creating a guest sleeping spot in a small home, or even for a cozy reading nook that doubles as a place to rest. Designing this kind of space is a great way to turn an overlooked corner into something both practical and inviting. 3. Hidden in the Closet A spare bed doesn’t always need its own room. Even a smaller closet can hold a fold-down or roll-out bed, transforming an otherwise unused storage space into something functional and hidden. When the bed isn’t needed, it can disappear completely, leaving the room free for other activities. This is a great option for a spare room you might want to use for another purpose, like a home office, but have it able to become a guest room when needed. 4. Stylish Daybed Daybeds are versatile pieces of furniture that can serve as seating during the day and transform into a larger bed at night. They often come with a trundle or pull-out section, which makes them an ideal choice for guest rooms, kids’ rooms, or even living rooms. The design is meant to be compact and stylish, fitting well into almost any decor. This means you always have a bed when you need one, but you also have a functional piece of furniture outside of that, doubling the pieces’ worth immediately.

This approach works especially well in modern or minimalist homes, where clean lines and uncluttered spaces are a core component. The bed can fold into a slim frame behind the panel, or exist in a small side room the panel is covering, so when hidden, the space looks like part of a stylish built-in unit. This is a flexible idea that can be customized to fit your decor so it fits seamlessly into whatever space you need. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / adpephoto These are just a few ideas regarding where you can hide a full bed, but there are plenty of other unused corners in every home that could fit a bed with just a bit of creative thinking. Your home is mostly for you, but it’s also for the people you invite inside it, so make sure not to leave them behind when plotting out the details!
