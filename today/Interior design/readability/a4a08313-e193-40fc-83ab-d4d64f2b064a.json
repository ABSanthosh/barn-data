Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Plaid Chair // Spindle Leg Accent Table // Jute and Cotton Rug // Mugs // Brass Finish Candlestick Set // Blue Taper Candles This post is in partnership with Wayfair I know it helps when you’re shopping online to see what items look like in an actual home, so today I’m sharing 9 of my favorite cozy decor pieces from Wayfair. Some of these I’ve had for awhile now and a few are new! I will share four rugs from Wayfair, some furnishings, lamps and accessories. They are all very pretty and affordable cozy cottage style pieces. Click here for above sources 1. Plaid Chair I love this adorable plaid chair–it’s perfectly scaled for a smaller space or corner of a room. 2. Spindle Leg Accent Table I just got this new accent table which is an ideal size for this spot. I adore the spindle legs. The table is solid wood and has a “raw” finish which feels like a lovely worn coastal look. The chair and table mix nicely with vintage pieces! 3. Lamp with Scalloped Shade This little lamp with a scalloped shade is the perfect accent lamp and the woven shade makes it SO cozy! It comes in many colors and two sizes. I love it so much I’ve purchased it 3 times now for different spaces—I have both sizes of the white and the smaller size of the dark blue. 4. Jute and Cotton Rug This rug is a cozy winner! It’s a cotton jute so it is very soft, not scratchy. It’s so inviting, it’s like a knit sweater! We’ve had it for over a year with pups and it still looks great! The color and texture is wonderful, it reminds us of a sandy beach. 5. Brass Finish Candlestick Set I was delighted to find these candlesticks in a brass finish. They come in a set of 10 and include a variety of sizes and styles. You could use them around the house or even as a centerpiece on a dining table. They are a classic and timeless decor piece! I love these blue taper candles in them. Blue Ticking Stripe Ruffle Accent Pillow on Chair 6. Botanical Rug I fell in love with this rug, it’s so charming! It sparks joy every day. I adore the colors and pattern with the botanicals and herons. Entry Table // Rug // Rattan Boxes // Lamp (color and size options) // Wreath 7. Demilune Table This demilune table is a gorgeous shade of teal. The shape is ideal for our tiny entry, plus it has a drawer (where we keep dog treats, doggie bags and a flashlight). 8. Floral Rug If you want a pretty patterned rug with a bit of color, this rug is a beauty! I love the color palette, plus the pattern hides any debris. I would love this one in any room! It’s also SO soft and cozy under foot. 9. Vintage Style Rug This vintage style rug is a favorite. It gets a lot of foot traffic and is under a dining table but it just doesn’t get worn! We tipped a dog water bowl over on it the other day and the liquid just beaded up, so easy to clean. It’s a beautiful rug that’s still good for family and pets. Let me know if you have any questions, I’m happy to answer. More Wayfair Finds (click images below for details):",
