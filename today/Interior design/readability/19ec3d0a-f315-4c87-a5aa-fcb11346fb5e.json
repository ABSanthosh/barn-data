  "text": "Digital audio players have historically occupied a distinct niche in the audio ecosystem, excelling at delivering high-quality sound on the go but typically returning to your pocket or drawer when you arrive home. This separation between portable and home audio equipment has long been accepted as a natural limitation, with different devices serving different purposes in the audio chain. Astell\u0026Kern’s new PS10 challenges this conventional wisdom by creating a single device that seamlessly transitions between portable player and home streaming component, potentially eliminating the need for separate equipment in both contexts. Designer: Astell\u0026Kern The Korean audio specialists have built their reputation on premium portable players that push the boundaries of what’s possible in mobile audio. Their latest creation represents more than just another iterative improvement—it fundamentally rethinks what a digital audio player can accomplish. The PS10 arrives at a time when many audiophiles maintain separate ecosystems for mobile and home listening, often resulting in redundant purchases and complicated setups. The Revolutionary Docking System The PS10’s most significant innovation comes in the form of its included docking cradle, a component that instantly converts the portable player into a full-featured high-resolution network streamer for home audio systems. Unlike basic charging stands or afterthought accessories, this cradle represents a thoroughly considered extension of the player’s capabilities, featuring professional-grade XLR balanced outputs on its rear panel that enable direct connection to powered speakers or integration with existing two-channel systems. These balanced connections provide the purest possible signal path, minimizing interference and noise that can degrade sound quality in less sophisticated implementations. When docked and connected to a home network, the PS10 supports resolutions up to an astonishing 32-bit/768kHz PCM and DSD512, specifications that exceed what most commercial recordings currently offer. For those invested in the Roon ecosystem, the PS10 functions as a certified Roon Ready endpoint, integrating seamlessly with that sophisticated library management platform without requiring additional hardware or complex configuration. The cradle effectively eliminates the need for a separate network streamer—a category that typically starts around $1,000 for quality components—creating a compelling value proposition for audiophiles who demand consistent quality across all listening scenarios. Engineering Excellence Within The PS10 incorporates Astell\u0026Kern’s HEXA audio circuit design first developed for their flagship SP3000 player. This architecture physically separates digital and analog signal processing paths, a crucial distinction from conventional approaches that dramatically impacts sound quality. Four AKM AK4498EX DACs handle the conversion process, making the PS10 the world’s first DAP to utilize this specific chip, while two separate AK4191EQ chips are dedicated to digital signal modulation. Most digital players process both digital and analog signals together inside the DAC, but the PS10 takes a different approach. Its advanced HEXA structure reduces digital noise by using the AK4191EQ as a separate digital delta-sigma modulator, allowing the AK4498EX DACs to focus exclusively on analog conversion. This separation matters tremendously because digital processing generates electrical noise that can bleed into analog stages, creating subtle distortions that degrade the listening experience. By physically isolating these circuits, the PS10 achieves remarkably clean sound reproduction that would be impossible in more conventional designs. The player also features dual independent amplifier circuits, each supporting normal and high gain modes, allowing precise matching with various headphone impedances and sensitivities—from power-hungry over-ears to delicate in-ear monitors. For less technically inclined listeners, the Smart Gain feature automatically detects connected headphone impedance and adjusts settings accordingly, ensuring optimal performance without requiring deep technical knowledge from the user. Comprehensive Connectivity Options Practicality hasn’t been sacrificed in pursuit of sound quality, as the PS10 comes equipped with 256GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card up to an additional 2TB. This generous capacity accommodates extensive high-resolution music libraries without constant management or compression compromises. Dual-band Wi-Fi ensures stable streaming even in crowded wireless environments, while Bluetooth 5.3 with support for high-resolution codecs including aptX HD, LDAC, and LHDC enables wireless listening without severe quality compromises when paired with compatible headphones. The PS10 also functions as a Bluetooth DAC, allowing users to stream audio from external sources like smartphones through the player to a home audio system. This versatility means your phone’s streaming services can benefit from the PS10’s superior conversion capabilities without requiring direct physical connections. DLNA support and USB-C connectivity round out the package, providing multiple pathways for getting music onto and out of the device depending on user preferences and existing equipment. Design Evolution and Physical Characteristics Visually, the PS10 represents a significant departure from previous Astell\u0026Kern players, abandoning the company’s signature volume wheel—a defining characteristic of their design language for years—in favor of physical buttons that enable intuitive one-handed operation. Astell\u0026Kern describes the PS10 as inspired by the “Contrast Cube” concept, combining stainless steel and glass for a sleek, minimalist aesthetic that stands apart from their previous offerings while maintaining premium material quality throughout. Despite its substantial capabilities, the PS10 remains genuinely portable at just 104 x 66.5 x 14.8 mm and weighing only 165g, ensuring it remains practical for on-the-go use rather than becoming a home component that technically can travel but rarely does. The 6-inch touchscreen display dominates the front panel, providing an intuitive interface for navigating music libraries and adjusting settings without requiring external controllers or complicated menu systems. Battery Performance and Software Enhancements A device that bridges portable and home use requires power management to match, and the PS10 incorporates a 5,770mAh battery delivering up to 15 hours of playback—sufficient for extended listening sessions without constant recharging. When power does run low, fast charging via Power Delivery 3.0 quickly replenishes the battery, a practical consideration that ensures the PS10 remains ready for use whether at home or on the move. Astell\u0026Kern has incorporated several software features that enhance the user experience beyond basic playback functions. ReplayGain provides volume normalization across tracks with varying recording levels, preventing jarring volume changes when moving between different albums or artists. Crossfeed settings improve headphone listening by creating a more speaker-like presentation, reducing the extreme channel separation that can sometimes make headphone listening fatiguing over long periods. AK File Drop enables wireless file transfers without requiring physical connections, streamlining the process of adding new music to the device from computers or other storage sources. Market Position and Product Focus The PS10 is priced at $2,500, positioning it below Astell\u0026Kern’s flagship offerings while still representing a significant investment for audio enthusiasts. This price includes the crucial docking cradle, making it a complete solution for both portable and home listening scenarios. According to Astell\u0026Kern, the PS10 will debut at CanJam Singapore on April 5-6, 2025, with global availability beginning in May 2025 through authorized dealers. The device’s dual-purpose functionality addresses a specific need in the market: high-quality audio that maintains consistency whether you’re on the move or at home. The comprehensive technical specifications—including four AKM AK4498EX DACs, dual AK4191EQ chips for digital signal handling, and professional-grade XLR outputs on the docking cradle—demonstrate Astell\u0026Kern’s commitment to performance in both use cases. With support for audio up to 32-bit/768kHz and DSD512, plus certification as a Roon Ready endpoint, the PS10 offers capabilities that match or exceed dedicated home streamers while maintaining the portability expected from a premium DAP. The PS10’s thoughtful design choices extend to practical considerations like the 5,770mAh battery delivering up to 15 hours of playback, fast charging via Power Delivery 3.0, and 256GB of internal storage expandable to 2TB via microSD. These specifications ensure the device remains functional and convenient in daily use, not just impressive on a technical level. Additional features like Smart Gain for automatic headphone impedance matching, ReplayGain for volume normalization, and AK File Drop for wireless transfers further enhance the user experience beyond basic playback functions.",
