  "text": "New York studio Parts and Labor Design and Brad Guidi of Boston real estate company Blue Flag Capital have renovated the Beachside Hotel on Nantucket to reflect the local craft and design scene of the 1960s. Located outside of Boston on Nantucket island, the 45,000 square-foot (4,180 square metres) Beachside Hotel encompasses a motel-style property originally built in the 1960s, with five low-lying buildings encircling a central pool deck. Parts and Labor Design and Blue Flag Capital have completed a hotel renovation on NantucketParts and Labor Design and Blue Flag Capital largely focused on the renovation of the property's interiors, as its grey shingle facade is historically relevant and typical to Nantucket. The hotel includes guestrooms, an adult and children's pool, a gym, a restaurant and bar and other public spaces, such as a meeting space and game room that branches off a central lobby. The project encompasses five motel-style buildings that encircle a pool deckThe design involved creating a family-friendly hotel that could accommodate children while being design-forward, according to the team. \"It's somewhere that we feel like families would feel confident and comfortable and that was really our main goal,\" Parts and Labor Design partner Danu Kennedy told Dezeen. The project pulls from the craft movement on the island from the 1960s and 70s\"It's very approachable, it's very fun. It's full of energy – but it's chic.\" The team outfitted the interiors in a palette of terracotta, cream, dark greens and natural wood to achieve a \"nostalgic\" feeling, with custom furniture and fixtures largely designed by Parts and Labor Design and manufactured by Jay Edward Group, Light Annex, and Majestic Mirror \u0026 Frame. These details also play into a hand-crafted feel – a nod to the artists and craft movement of 1960s and 1970s Nantucket. \"There's this real crafted, hand-built, hand-touched, feel to it,\" said Kennedy. Terracotta, wood, creams and dark greens were used for the palette\"We chose furniture, fabrics, and materials that are reminiscent of our childhood, even pulling from movies like the Sandlot for inspiration,\" said Blue Flag Capital co-founder Brad Guidi. \"There is something comforting and nostalgic when watching Sandlot so we asked ourselves, how do we evoke this feeling at our hotel?\" The hotel's lobby features a collection of deeply cushioned lounge sofas and woven chairs centred around a tiled fireplace. Plinths by Parts and Labor off-shoot Known Work and vessells by Maxine Metbo and Diego Olivero Studio fill the space. Pieces by artists Sean Spellman and Gayle Fitzpatrick are among the works that hang on the walls. The hotel is designed to be family-friendlyThe space is clad with wooden trim and a tiled floor and expands outwards from the bar area, which features light-green tiling and a wooden counter. It is also directly connected to the pool deck, which makes for a connected indoor-outdoor interior conducive to families. A quilt was placed on each bed\"If you're looking to be in the lobby, or if you're lounging by the pool, you're in this space where it's contained and that's really important, because kids will just run and go crazy, so that the layout is great for that,\" Kennedy told Dezeen. The guestrooms also cater to families with sofas large enough for children to sleep on, and an \"approachable\" feeling brought in by details like an individual quilt on each bed. The interior branches outwards from the poolThe hotel is now open, although some areas are still undergoing construction according to the team. Other projects by Parts and Labor design include a \"nautical\" hotel in Washington DC and a Chicago restaurant with a coastal California feel.
