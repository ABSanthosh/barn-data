  "text": "Japanese start-up Yukai Engineering is popular for creating robots that spark joy and amusement within you – with some great products such as a headless robotic companion cat called Qoobo, and a therapeutic pillow for companionship, and now they’re back in the game with a furry new bot called Mirumi. Being a cat lover myself (and an owner of 2), having an adorable plush robot that actually is coy rather than brushing things off my desk like my cats usually do will be a refreshing change. Picture this: a cuddly, plush-like creature that’s more than just a toy. Meet Mirumi, your new best friend, who’s bursting with personality and charm. Designed to embody the wide-eyed wonder of an infant, Mirumi is equipped with state-of-the-art sensors that allow it to detect people nearby. It turns its head with delightful curiosity, its googly eyes locking onto you with an innocence that’s impossible to resist. Designer: Yukai Engineering Although Mirumi is curious, it is also quite shy. If you move towards the bot or try to touch it, it will instantly shy away, ducking away from your attention. Mirumi has been unveiled at CES 2025, and has turned quite a few heads already. Mirumi can’t move around by itself, all it can do is turn its head but it has been equipped with emotional interactions such as curiosity, inquisitiveness, bashfulness and even nods a no to convey a reaction no being approached. To top it all, it comes equipped with long arms that will cling to the strap of your bag or backpack, allowing you to carry your furry companion with you wherever you like. Mirumi is equipped with a distance sensor and an inertial measurement unit to detect movement. If someone taps the robot or a bag begins to move, Mirumi will focus on the person or object detected close by. It will woo that person over with its adorable eyes and furry persona! However, if someone appears out of nowhere or tries to touch it, it will turn its head away, feigning the shyness of an infant. If you jiggle Mirumi, it will shake its head to say no, showcasing dislike. If no one engages with the robot for some time, it will begin its adorable head movements again to capture your attention. The furry bot is designed to be a comforting companion robot, designed to soothe its people. It hugs your arm or bag, making you feel comforted and less alone. It almost looks like a little grey chick is clinging to you! “People often find great joy in sharing their own happiness with others. Mirumi is a robot that enables you to do just that, said Yukai Engineering CEO Shunsuke Aoki. “Whether you’re riding a crowded train or standing in line at the cashier, your Mirumi will always find a way to reach into people’s hearts with its innocent gaze, prompting the person to wave at the robot or make a funny face in response.” Mirumi aims to be your moment of calm, to soothe you when you feel anxious or just be your companion in arms through life. Knowing the world and its reach, with notifications pinging us every second and the urgency culture amplifying things, Mirumi is a gentle nudge to feel that peace within – something I know will help meet my goals to connect and gather more glimmers every day.",
