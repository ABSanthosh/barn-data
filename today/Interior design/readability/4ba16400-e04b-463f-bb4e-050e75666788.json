  "text": "Elizabeth Rees comes from a tradition of printing, and knows that the right graphics can have a lasting impact. The family business specialized in large-format projects like billboards and advertisements found on buses. When Rees lived in Manhattan, she helped a friend who needed to update her office, and came up with a peel-and-stick wallpaper. Not only was it easy to use, it could also be changed to suit a range of interiors. Her wallpaper was the perfect product for design-obsessed clients who wanted to experiment with color and pattern without having to commit to an expensive renovation. Rees co-founded Chasing Paper with her brother Mike Rees in 2013. Today Rees and the company are based in her hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she lives with her husband and two daughters. Chasing Paper now offers a complete line of solutions and products produced in collaboration with noted designers and influencers, from murals to tile decals. Elizabeth Rees of Chasing Paper \\\\\\ Photo: Courtesy of Chasing Paper Surrounded by motifs and hues from every end of the spectrum, it’s no surprise that Rees is a visual learner. She hopes her own tale will be in print too, in the form of a book that bibliophiles will cherish. “I love to tell stories and find the right words to convey a certain feeling or moment in time,” she says. “It would be a dream to write a novel one day.” Rees has plenty of projects on tap, and her days include different facets of leadership. Never afraid to speak in front of an audience, Rees has discovered that she enjoys being a facilitator. She moderated two panels last year, and the role came naturally to her. It was also a fun break from her routine, and she’s looking forward to more opportunities to engage in this way. Balance isn’t always easy to achieve, but one habit ensures that Rees stays centered no matter what is happening. “I think getting outside or on the treadmill allows me to transition from work to home life,” she notes. “Walking helps me to clear my mind and reduce the stress I have been carrying in my body during the day.” Today, Elizabeth Rees joins us for Friday Five!

The Charmspring Springboard is one of my favorite ways to give my family a sense of routine and control in a fun, visual, and design-forward way. 2. A Stack of Books (Always!) There’s something about a stack of well-loved books that instantly makes a space feel lived-in and layered. Right now, I’m deep into The Creative Act by Rick Rubin – a must-read for anyone in the design world. I also love novels and just finished All the Colors of the Dark, which was so immersive and well written. Photo: Elizabeth Rees 3. The Brick Device I’m always looking for ways to be more present, and the Brick device is such a smart take on digital detoxing. It’s a minimalist block that restricts what you can access on your smartphone, allowing you to be in the moment without the distractions of social media and endless notifications. Whether I’m brainstorming new wallpaper designs or coloring with my daughters – this device has helped me get some healthy distance from the pull of being always connected to technology. Photo: Courtesy of Marimekko 4. Marimekko Green Green Tea Towels Marimekko has mastered the art of bold, graphic prints, and their Green Green Tea Towels pattern will never go out of style. I recently added a set to my kitchen, and they instantly make everyday moments feel more joyful. It’s a reminder that great design isn’t just for big statement pieces – small touches can be just as impactful. Photo: Courtesy of Chasing Paper 5. Vintage Wicker I’m always on the hunt for unique vintage finds, and lately, I can’t get enough of vintage wicker. It adds just the right amount of texture and warmth to a space, balancing out more modern pieces with a bit of character. Whether styled with a throw pillow or left bare for a sculptural moment, it brings effortless charm to any room.
