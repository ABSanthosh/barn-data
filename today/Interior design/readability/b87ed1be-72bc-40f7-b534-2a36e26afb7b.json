  "text": "Remember when we all agreed that GenAI tools were going to be used to scam people with fake images of unreal scenarios or fake products? Well, this isn’t one of those times. Images of a Porsche 911 backpack began circulating on the internet, and although sure, the image is absolutely 100% AI generated, turns out that there are actually prototypers and manufacturers working on a real version of the product. Remember the Gorilla Couch phenomenon? If you’re hearing it for the first time, try searching the words “Gorilla Couch” and seeing what the internet throws up. The story goes like this – someone generated images of a gorilla-shaped couch and it instantly picked up online with people wanting to buy it. However, rather than it being a fake scam, manufacturers (some in China) actually reverse-engineered the images and MADE the couch, selling it online. The internet basically WILLED an AI product into existence, and now gorilla couches are even available on Amazon. The Porsche 911 Backpack’s story is somewhat similar. The lifestyle image above is clearly AI-generated, but hey, sometimes the AI generates some pretty neat images, right? So someone just decided to turn the images into a real product. You can see the prototyping below in action, from someone who clearly works in the vacuum-molded luggage space. It makes sense to vacuum-mold the outer -facade, giving the backpack a hard outer shell, although where one would put the zip is still anyone’s guess. Maybe the backpack opens like the car’s boot?! The backpack’s design is a great example of form NOT following function, though. A car like the Porsche 911 is truly iconic, but its shape applies to automotives, not necessarily to fashion. The result is an odd backpack that has tremendous visual appeal, but I honestly don’t know what its shape would hold. It won’t fit any tech like a laptop for sure, but maybe you could carry a lunchbox, a book or two, and maybe a few clothes in it. The backpack does, however, fulfill its need to look fashionable. It’s gorgeous (even if it isn’t practical), and the spoiler mounted on top literally feels like a cherry on the cake! It isn’t entirely clear where the product will be sold (I found these images on Instagram), but it sure as hell won’t be available at your nearest Porsche dealership. I see the Porsche logo molded into the back too, so that’s definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen. Try AliExpress or Temu, maybe? I’d say for $120, chances are the backpack will either be of dubious quality, or probably won’t ship at all. Does it still look cool? Oh yes, for sure.",
