This past week Ed, my sister and I went to Hilton Head to enjoy the beach in the off-season. It rained almost every day, but we still managed to relax, bike and hit the beach. Even though it wasn’t quite the week of sunny weather we hoped for, I came home relaxed and full of new ideas. I always find that getting away and exploring a new area, stylish shops, restaurants and more always inspire me and have me excited at the end of a vacation to get back home with new passion and energy. How about you, do you find getting away is one of the best ways to find life and style inspiration? Now onto the links I found for you this week. Fashion \u0026 Beauty I love this top so much I bought it in 3 colors. (open in same tab) I have used this drugstore serum off and on since my dermatologist recommended it. It really does soften the look of facial fine lines and wrinkles. It has become a staple for me. (open in same tab) If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
