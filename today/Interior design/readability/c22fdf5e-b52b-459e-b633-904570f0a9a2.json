The rest of us colloquially refer to the fifth pocket in a pair of jeans as the coin pocket, and in an age of declining cash transactions, the pocket no longer has much of a use.Candy company Werther's Originals is running a promo where they're raffling off these pairs of jeans. From the front and back they look normal… …but they're stitched with no less than 30 coin pockets, running up and down the legs. The idea being that, in advance of Halloween, they're the perfect stash size for the company's candies. As silly as the idea is, I can't help but think someone with some specialty job could actually come up with a good use for these.",
