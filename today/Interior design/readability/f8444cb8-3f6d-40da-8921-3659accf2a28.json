  "description": "At the end of a no-through road just before the Merri Creek is one of Coburg North’s best and most surprising homes. Situated on a huge 1828 square metre block, this architecturally designed 1980s house has been enjoyed and thoughtfully updated by the one family for close to 20 years, who are now handing the property to a new owner. The generosity of the four-bedroom, four-bathroom property is enhanced by the natural landscape surrounding the backyard pool, and stretching to the creek banks below.",

  "text": "You wouldn’t guess it from the street, but the facade of 8 Bakers Road hides one of Coburg North’s most generous homes for sale. The vendor recalls his surprise discovering the Melbourne house 18 years ago. ‘We stumbled across the property quite by chance, and it immediately struck a chord. It felt like discovering a hidden sanctuary,  the lush gardens, the birdsong, and the way the light filtered through the trees gave it a magical, retreat-like quality. ‘Set on over 1800 square metres, it offered a rare opportunity: a feeling of complete escape, yet right in the middle of suburbia.’ The home was architecturally designed and built in 1987 with a vision of blending strong, enduring design with the natural beauty of its site situated just before Merri Creek. The vendor has completed their own renovations over the years to modernise the kitchen and bathrooms, and invite more warmth into the home via blackbutt timber floors. Landscaping the backyard was a major project, introducing a pool surrounded by mature native plantings, automated systems, a 30,000-litre rainwater tank, bluestone boulders, and a layered lighting design. The backyard meets established trees, flowing seamlessly into crown land along the banks of the Merri Creek. Floor-to-ceiling windows to the east bring this landscape into the home’s sprawling floor plan. In addition to three bedrooms, one study, and three bathrooms in the main house, the property hosts a self-contained unit complete with a theatre and cellar area, ideal for entertaining overnight guests. Additional property features include a sauna, EV charger, solar system, and a billiards room on the lower ground level. The vendors hope the new owners will appreciate and enjoy the house that has been the backbone of their family for almost two decades. The vendor says, ‘This isn’t just a home, it’s a feeling. It’s where design meets soul, and every space invites you to slow down, breathe deeper, and just be. ‘Over the years, friends, family, and overseas guests have all said the same thing: waking up here feels like waking up in a secluded resort…It’s a rare kind of magic, and we have no doubt the next owners will feel it too, every single day.’ 8 Bakers Road, Coburg North VIC is listed for sale by expressions of interest closing Thursday June 5 at 3pm with Colin Abbas and Nicholas Corby at Jellis Craig",
