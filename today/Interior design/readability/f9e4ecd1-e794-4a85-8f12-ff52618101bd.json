  "text": "tokyu birdhouse creates urban habitats for biodiversityThe Tokyu Bird House is a small-scale architectural intervention aimed at supporting biodiversity by creating suitable habitats for the Japanese tit. The project has been conceived by Ryusuke Nanki in collaboration with Tokyu Land Corporation, an urban developer known for its commitment to ecological projects in central Tokyo, and Tendo Mokko, a renowned Japanese furniture maker.Bridging their sensibilities, the birdhouse integrates human housing concepts with natural considerations to foster nesting in densely populated urban settings, with a simple wooden design. In February 2024, the design teams installed a series of Tokyu Bird Houses across commercial spaces in Tokyo and Yokohama.birdhouses placed on building rooftop gardens | all images courtesy of Ryusuke Nankiryusuke nanki bridges furniture design and urban planningThe Tokyu Bird House incorporates high-performance, habitat-focused design features influenced by Tokyu Land’s extensive experience in real estate and ecology. Along with input from avian researchers and Tendo Mokko’s expertise, architect Ryusuke Nanki employs local, sustainable materials like sterilized cedar and cypress thinned from surrounding forests to achieve successful nesting and egg-laying. Consideration was also given to livability with oval rooms and maisonettes tailored to the shape of eggs and the needs of parent birds without space to step in conventional nests.To withstand Tokyo’s bustling urban environment, the birdhouse is equipped with a seamless, one-piece molded roof produced by Mokko. This feature enhances protection from rain and wind, offering birds more resilient shelter than traditional, two-part roofing structures. Additionally, the use of highly water-resistant cypress wood, typically reserved for wooden baths, enhances the durability and longevity of each birdhouse, ensuring it remains a viable habitat over the long term.an oval Tokyu Bird House set in a treeTokyu Land’s commitment to biodiversity is reflected in its ongoing ecological initiatives, including the installation of birdhouses across commercial developments in Tokyo to draw attention to local wildlife. The company leverages its expertise to expand biodiversity-focused projects in the urban landscape, integrating principles of conservation into its large-scale developments, particularly in the Shibuya area. This collaboration with Tendo Mokko emphasizes environmental stewardship by incorporating eco-friendly, surplus timber materials that support sustainable forestry.The Tokyu Bird House project also offers a unique platform for scientific research. Researchers have been involved in the birdhouse development process from the outset, providing insights on optimal nesting environments. The project will serve as a valuable research resource in studying the impacts of urbanization on bird populations, with findings expected to shape future conservation efforts.conceived by Ryusuke Nanki in collaboration with Tokyu Land Corporation and Tendo Mokkobuilt with input from avian researchersthe plywood ceilings of the Birdhouse can be easily opened for observationmodeled after the cross-sectional shape of a tree, with no cornersintegrating human housing concepts with natural considerations to foster nesting in densely populated urban settings",
