Designed by Phineas Harper, Rosa Nussbaum, and Jos Geczy, the coop integrates a combination of UK-grown timber shingles arranged in overlapping layers to create a feather-like texture.The structure is elevated on a powder-coated steel frame and incorporates a curved shingled roof. Two primary doors, fitted with pivoting polycarbonate vents, allow for daylight and ventilation, while a letterbox hatch at the rear provides access to four cork-insulated nesting boxes for egg collection. A ceramic finial, glazed in red, crowns the top of the enclosure, referencing the shape of a chicken’s comb.all images courtesy of Phineas Harper, Rosa Nussbaum, and Jos Geczymobile Heir and a Spare chicken coop includes a large wheelThe creative team of Phineas Harper, Rosa Nussbaum, and Jos Geczy has won the design competition to build the new chicken coop at Grizedale Arts in the Lake District.
