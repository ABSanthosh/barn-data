Their favourite haunts include a 300-year-old restaurant, Scandinavia's biggest rum collection and the atelier of 20th-century sculptor Carl Eldh. For our full city guide, pick up Dezeen Dispatch – a dedicated magazine we've produced for Stockholm Design Week 2025 – in participating locations across the city. Bak Södermalm has interiors designed by Contem. Photo by Mikael OlssonBars \u0026 cafes Bak, picked by Matsson Marnell co-founder Katarina Matsson  \"Let's venture out into the suburbs. My local bakery Bak in Hökarängen is worth the trip. They also have a cafe closer to Södermalm (above) with amazing interiors designed by Contem and made out of a beautiful salvaged elm tree.\" Balue, picked by designer Simon Skinner \"Balue is a coffee and tea room run by David You, who's all about crafting amazing drinks and pastries with an East Asian touch.\" Indigo, picked by Note Design Studio co-founder Johannes Karlström  \"A bar located on Götgatsbacken designed by an unknown talent 30 years ago with interiors intact – a must-visit.\" Bar Central serves central European fare. Photo by Idha LindhagLucy's Flower Shop, picked by designer Luca Nichetto \"A speakeasy bar hidden behind an unmarked door. The drink list is short but impeccably curated. Every cocktail is a surprise.\" Crum Heaven, picked by Färg \u0026 Blanche co-founder Emma Marga Blanche \"One bar/café that I would absolutely recommend is Crum Heaven. One of the owners designed and handcrafted all the furniture himself, and every month a new exhibition takes place in the main room.\" Bar Central, picked by Folkform designer Anna Holmquist \"A cafe and bar (above) with dishes from central Europe – like Hungarian Pörkölt, Polish Pierogi and Austrian Apfelstrudel – and interiors designed by Uglycute.\" Bar Montan is housed in buzzy Meatpacking. Photo by Johan DehlinRestaurants Den Gyldene Freden, picked by Folkform designer Anna Holmquist \"The restaurant opened in 1722 at its current address and is thus one of the world's oldest continuously existing restaurants in the same location, as well as Stockholm's oldest preserved city tavern – now with a contemporary crowd.\" Cane Rum Society, picked by designer Simon Skinner \"The name says it all – Caribbean cuisine, Scandinavia's biggest rum collection and a relaxed, soothing vibe. The staff really know their stuff, too.\" Bord, picked by Bolon owner Annica Eklund \"A restaurant I'm always happy to return to.\" Restaurang Springrolls, picked by Form Us With Love co-founder Jonas Pettersson \"Our favourite lunch place. The austere interior speaks of their ambition: it's all about nutritious well-made food and a friendly welcome.\" Bar Montan, picked by ASKA Architects founder Polina Sandström \"Not to miss is Bar Montan (above) in the Meatpacking District – an interesting area currently undergoing development with old factory buildings and exposed brick facades. Make sure to book in advance and you can grab a pre-drink at nearby Solen or Hosoi.\" Indio, picked by Note Design Studio co-founder Johannes Karlström  \"A great Peruvian restaurant that mixes the best of Japanese and South American tastes.\" Carl Eldhs's former atelier is now a museum. Photo by Nikodem CalczynskiCultural spots Hallwyl Museum, picked by Bolon owner Annica Eklund \"As a photographer I like to keep an eye on the Fotografiska Museum, but a secret gem is the Hallwyl Museum – an original home and palace in the middle of the city!\" Millesgården Museum, picked by Matsson Marnell co-founder Katarina Matsson  \"Millesgården (top image) is definitely worth the trip.\"Aspen Bio, picked by designer Luca Nichetto \"A small independent cinema run by volunteers, showing arthouse films and rare gems. The nostalgic and intimate vibe is unmatched.\" Carl Eldhs Ateljémuseum, picked by ASKA Architects founder Polina Sandström \"Carl Eldh's studio museum (above) is a nice place to visit if you have some time off during the day. The charming atelier served as the studio of Carl Eldh, one of Sweden's most prominent sculptors of the 20th century. Built in 1919, it was designed by renowned Swedish architect Ragnar Östberg, who also designed Stockholm City Hall.\" Form Us With Love's studio has a roof terrace. Photo by Jonas Lindström StudioBest kept secrets FUWL rooftop terrace, picked by Form Us With Love co-founder Jonas Pettersson \"Our rooftop terrace with views of Riddarfjärden is open only by appointment and definitely recommended in early spring rather than winter. But anyone is always welcome to knock on the door and ask for the guided tour!\" Konstnärernas Kollektivverkstad, picked by designer Luca Nichetto \"A shared workshop for artists, rarely open to the public, showcasing unique machinery and artisanal techniques.\" Skinnarviksberget, picked by Note Design Studio co-founder Johannes Karlström  \"It is not a secret to the locals but Skinnarviksberget has one of the best views of Stockholm.\" Myrorna Götgatan basement, picked by designer Luca Nichetto \"A secret corner in one of Stockholm's iconic vintage stores, ideal for discovering vinyl treasures and hidden gems.\" The top photo of Millesgården Museum is by Elisabeth Toll.
