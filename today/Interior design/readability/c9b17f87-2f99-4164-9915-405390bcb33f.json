  "description": "Wallabies Watch by Studio MODA proves that sometimes, simplicity is key. The newly built farm stay in the Northern Rivers of NSW was designed as a modest getaway, with no conventional glazed windows, decking, or awnings — instead opting for timber panels that swing open to frame the surrounding landscape. But when closed down, the subdued house recedes into the calming backdrop of its hillside location.",

  "text": "The ethos behind this newly built farm stay was all about getting back to basics — which is beautifully reflected in the home’s pared-back architecture. A family from Sydney engaged Studio MODA founder Tyler Gwyther to create the home as a modest two-bedroom retreat they could both rent out and use as their personal getaway in Myocum in the Northern Rivers region. The land was completely empty before the project, with a clear spot on the hillside property the perfect location to bring their vision to life. Tyler says the brief was to create a ‘simplified, reductive house in all aspects of the design’. This included everything from the material selection to the floor plan, the form, joinery, and even the windows. ‘They strictly wanted the form of the house to be standalone. They did not want any other awnings or roofs over the decks or outdoor areas. And they loved the idea of having timber flaps instead of glazed windows,’ he adds. ‘Simplicity was central to both the design and the clients’ vision because it aligns with their desire to live more intentionally and connect with the natural environment.’ From this minimalistic concept, Tyler came up with a contemporary, barn-like cabin with a gabled roof that nods to the architecture of its rural location — nestled into a tapestry of green fields and the Myocum hills. The two-bedroom home is clad almost entirely in dark brown spotted gum timber, except for a stretch of brick along the northern edge, connecting with the masonry chimney. In place of traditional windows, solid timber hatches in the same moody finish swing open to frame views of the landscape. And when closed, these timber panels blend into a unified form with the rest of the structure. ‘I love how it rests on top of the hill as a small dark timber box,’ Tyler says. ‘The project recedes into the hilltop and surrounding vegetation.’ Inside, a clean palette of white walls and pale timber floors meet warm timber furniture and a sleek stainless-steel kitchen for a modern edge. Sustainability also played a part in the project. Two large underground water tanks were installed to service the home without interrupting the building’s singular appearance, alongside an 11kW solar array on the roof. Plus, spanning just 98 square metres of the idyllic 11-acre-property, the house is a true no-frills sanctuary, allowing nature to take centre stage.",
