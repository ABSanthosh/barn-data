Now, Casio brings that design from your wrist to your desk with the DQD-851J-8JF desk clock. Scheduled for release on October 25 in Japan, this desk clock channels the aesthetics of the A158 with modern updates. Designer: Casio The DQD-851J-8JF borrows design elements from the A158W, including the silver-toned casing and familiar digital display. The clock’s body echoes the classic curves and rectangular silhouette of the A158 watch, giving it a nostalgic appeal reminiscent of the 1980s. Introduced in the 1980s, the Casio A158W became popular for its utility, affordability, and retro aesthetic. It offered a digital display, LED backlight, and water resistance, making it versatile for all lifestyles. Even today, it remains a favorite among minimalists and retro watch enthusiasts. The DQD-851J-8JF desk clock pays homage to the A158W while incorporating modern features. One key addition is Wave Ceptor automatic time adjustment, which synchronizes the clock to the Japan Standard Time radio signal (JJY) broadcasted from transmitters within Japan. Note that this feature is exclusive to Japan, and it will not function with radio signals in other regions. The clock also includes a thermometer and hygrometer, providing insight into indoor comfort. Additional features include a snooze alarm, 12/24-hour format, full auto-calendar, and an amber LED backlight. The desk clock captures the iconic look of the A158W. From the rectangular digital screen framed by the brushed silver-tone bezel to the tactile buttons, every detail evokes a retro vibe. The clock features a larger, easy-to-read LCD screen with bold black digits for readability. It is compact yet stable, measuring 102 x 117 x 48 millimeters and weighing 185 grams. The amber LED backlight offers a warm glow, reminiscent of the original wristwatch’s light. The buttons for adjusting settings are placed intuitively, similar to the wristwatch, for easy interaction. The brushed finish of the casing and slightly raised bezel add to its retro charm. The DQD-851J-8JF is powered by two AA batteries, offering about one year of battery life—convenient and low-maintenance, much like the original A158W. Casio’s decision to create a desk clock inspired by the A158W honors the enduring appeal of a product that has outlasted tech trends. The A158W’s straightforward nature makes it timeless. With the DQD-851J-8JF, that appeal now lives in a new form factor, ideal for any desk or nightstand. For those who cherish the A158, the DQD-851J-8JF brings that classic vibe into other parts of life. Whether you’re a longtime fan or discovering Casio’s digital nostalgia for the first time, this desk clock is an excellent way to celebrate a design that has stood the test of time. Pre-orders are available in Japan.",
