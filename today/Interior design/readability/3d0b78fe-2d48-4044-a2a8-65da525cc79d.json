  "description": "Located in Barwon Heads, Victoria, this new family residence by Megowan Architectural has been billed as the ‘millennial dream house’. It’s a modern play on the old-school ‘great Australian dream’ of having a homestead on a quarter-acre block, but this time combining elements of mid-century architecture, the owner’s coastal lifestyle, and sustainable living.",

  "text": "For decades, the ‘great Australian dream’ was to own a quarter-acre block with a standalone home and a backyard. But today — with a housing crisis, rising cost of living, and climate change in the mix — this dream is no longer a reality for many Australians. This social and cultural context was at the forefront of one of Megowan Architectural’s recent projects: a new build for a young family in Victoria’s coastal town of Barwon Heads. Having been lucky enough to actually secure an empty quarter-acre block, the owners seized the chance to create a contemporary version of this old-school dream, in a way that would reflect their lifestyle, balancing practicality with sustainable living. ‘They did not want unnecessary extravagance, but rather a functional, simple, yet thoughtful design that aligned with their environmental values,’ architect Christopher Megowan says. ‘They also wanted a family-friendly home that connected to the outdoors, while maintaining a strong sense of harmony with the coastal landscape.’ Christopher looked both to the past and present for design inspiration. The resulting dwelling, built from recycled cream bricks, almost appears as an authentic mid-century build, channelling the typography of a retro beach house with its clean lines, a low-slung skillion roof and use of natural materials. But what you can’t see at a glance, is the home’s commitment to sustainability. Passive design principals influenced the use of thermally broken windows and rigid insulation. The skillion roof maximises northern sun, and on the southern side, reverse brick veneer walls stabilise the home’s internal temperatures throughout the year. ‘These elements work together to reduce the home’s ecological impact and ensure it remains energy-efficient,’ Christopher says. There’s also a rainwater collection system, and a permaculture setup featuring a veggie patch of wicking beds and chickens. Inside, Tasmanian oak timber lines the floor and ceiling, enhancing the building’s warmth and nostalgic character. There’s a certain understated elegance to the project, which Christopher dubbed the ‘Millennial Dream House’. It’s equal parts aspirational and relatively achievable, ticking the boxes of what a well-design, modern-day family home can be. ‘It may be presumptive, but I think this house would resonate with many in our generation,’ he says. ‘Millennials have lived through immense technological and social change, and many long for the digital disconnection of their childhood. This home scratches that itch. It’s modest, cost-efficient, yet architecturally ambitious — a quiet rebellion against McMansions.’ ‘Put simply, what millennial wouldn’t want a light-filled home near the beach with a veggie patch and chickens?’",
