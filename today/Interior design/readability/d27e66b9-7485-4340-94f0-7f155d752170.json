All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Mark Roger Bailey/ShutterstockLiving in a big city often means living in a small space. My first apartment in New York City, which I shared with a roommate, couldn’t have been more than 600 square feet. As I’ve gotten older, my living spaces have gotten bigger, but not by much. While many people would, understandably, feel frustrated in such a small apartment, I’ve never minded it. In fact, I’ve always relished the challenge of trying to make tight quarters functional and comfortable. That’s why I was so excited to find IKEA’s new limited-edition sleeper sofa, LINDÅKRA, which happens to be among the most versatile pieces of furniture I’ve ever seen.The LINDÅKRA is IKEA’s latest sofa bed, and it looks unlike any other. It’s made of multiple pieces — a loveseat with a standard arm on one side and a detachable, rounded ottoman on the other. The seat lifts up to reveal lots of storage underneath, and the ottoman offers even more — a game-changer for people who need more closet space. It can hold towels, extra sheets, pillows, clothes, and more — think of it as a closet you can also sit on.Better still, it truly does it all. Have a guest visiting from out of town? No problem. Leave the ottoman attached, remove the back cushions, and you’ve got yourself a sleeper sofa for one. Want to put your feet up? Easy-peasy — just detach the ottoman and you’re good to go. Need a place to set your morning coffee? Don’t worry — the ottoman also doubles as a coffee table.Couches in small spaces see a lot more traffic than in larger homes, so it’s important to choose one that’s easy to clean. Fortunately, the LINDÅKRA’s cushions are designed to resist spills — all you need to do is wipe it down with a dry cloth. Cleaning your couch seriously doesn’t get much easier than that.The LINDÅKRA comes in two colors: a classic charcoal gray and the limited-edition bright orange (which is certainly bold, but also so fun). Better still, it’s only $499 — a steal when you consider how much purpose it serves. If I were starting fresh in a brand-new apartment, this would be the first piece I’d buy.",
