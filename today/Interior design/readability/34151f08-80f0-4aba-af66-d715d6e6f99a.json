  "text": "The EARTH to SPACE Festival at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., features the innovative lunar habitats by Foster + Partners and a mesmerizing fireworks display by Cai Guo-Qiang. Running from March 28th to April 20th, 2025, the festival is a gathering of musicians, astronauts, poets, physicists, visual artists, and engineers. It offers visitors an opportunity to delve into various perspectives on the natural world, including architectural concepts for Mars and the Moon. Foster + Partners showcases their architectural exhibition, while Cai Guo-Qiang presents engaging interactive installations. In addition to these highlights, the festival hosts the U.S. premiere of “The Moonwalkers: A Journey with Tom Hanks,” a film that explores the Apollo moon missions and future crewed missions to the lunar surface. Accompanied by a 360-degree projection, the film will be shown in Studio K at the center until April 20th. The festival also serves as a platform for experts from diverse fields to come together and share ideas and insights that reach beyond the confines of the Kennedy Center. Designer: Foster + Partners \u0026 Cai Guo-Qiang Norman Foster and Foster + Partners present the U.S. premiere of their exhibition “From Earth to Space and Back,” opening on March 28th at the EARTH to SPACE Festival. The exhibition features scale models, 3D-printed lunar structures, and films exploring Mars construction possibilities. Visitors can view the Spaceport America model in New Mexico, designed for space tourism. The studio’s research on 3D-printed habitats for the Moon and Mars highlights innovative construction methods using advanced metal and concrete printing, also applicable on Earth. The exhibition includes works by Brendan Murphy, Jitish Kallat, and Cecilie Waagner Falkenstrøm, alongside the “Wave: From Space to Ocean” installation. Elsewhere in the center, other artists like Cai Guo-Qiang showcase their installations and performances. During the EARTH to SPACE Festival at the John F. Kennedy Center, artist Cai Guo-Qiang showcases his “Interspecies Love Letter” in the Skylight Pavilion. This interactive exhibition, created in collaboration with his custom AI model, cAITM, features a glass and mirror gunpowder painting that evokes the look of fireworks. The exhibition delves into the creative process behind “Interspecies Love Letter: Sky Painting for EARTH to SPACE festival,” including an animation by cAITM and a documentary video of the sky painting. Visitors can explore Cai’s creative sketches and gunpowder painting studies, crafted by a cAITM-powered robotic arm. The exhibit also includes a self-introduction video, a participatory fireworks co-creation installation, and documentary videos of cAITM’s past projects. EARTH to SPACE is the third installment of the Kennedy Center’s decade-long initiative celebrating the intersection of arts and nature, inspired by President Kennedy’s legacy in leading the first moon landing in 1969. The festival merges artistic and scientific exploration at the Center.",
