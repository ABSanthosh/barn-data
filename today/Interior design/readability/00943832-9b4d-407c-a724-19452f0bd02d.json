After years of renting, my husband and I (along with our son) have just moved into a new-to-us house with my parents-in-law! A few years ago my parents-in-law brought up the idea of us living together and it immediately felt right to us. We continued renting our townhouse and took our time house hunting until we found just the right house for sharing. Enter….The Lake House. This is just the type of home we were looking for and even better than we hoped. There’s a basement apartment with a separate entrance my parents-in-law are living in, and my husband and son and I are living in the main house. Such a special gift to have 3 generations under one roof! This view was such an unexpected blessing. My husband and I used to drive around imagining how fun it would be to live near a lake, but we never imagined we’d end up with such a beautiful view. Every rental I’ve lived in has looked right into parking lots or big buildings…so the sight of a lake, mountains, beautiful trees and wide open sky out our windows is such a peaceful delight. We are very grateful. We are so excited to be beginning this new chapter of home ownership. We plan to be in this home for a very long time–a family home we can really settle into and slowly make our own for years to come! We don’t expect to be doing major renovations (thankfully we like so much of the home to begin with) but we definitely have long term visions and lots of little projects ahead. And of course, just making a home cozy and personalized is one of my very favorite things to do. The thought of being able to do that in a home we own and expect to STAY in is thrilling! Pinching myself every day at our bedroom view! The apartment for my parents-in-law — they have their own kitchen, bathroom, living space, bedroom, separate entrance and patio area! This is a first look at our lake home…just a peek! There is so much more to share, and I can’t wait to take you along as we make this house feel like us. I’ll be sharing so much more behind the scenes as we discover our “lake house style” inside HomeBody Gathering Place! It would be so fun to have you join us in the HomeBody community. You’ll get access to cozy decorating guides (the Room Recipe decorating method is so helpful whether you’re just starting out in a home like me and have a lot of decisions to make, or you’re ready to settle in and enjoy your home or make progress in pulling your style together). There are also other signature HomeBody Methods, plus a whole community of kindred spirits who are all creating sanctuaries of their own. I’ve already started sharing some extra peeks of our home in HGP (plus some design mockups and even a few design dilemmas!). I will be so appreciating all the input from fellow HomeBodies as we begin the journey of turning this house into our home! You can follow along on my Instagram as I share my simple joys and bits of our life. Subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop! Thanks for following along! :)",
