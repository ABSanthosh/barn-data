  "text": "Unless you own a gym, or have a huge family and a large space for all your members, you’ve probably never really thought about cloakroom furniture since it’s not something you need or maybe even want. What we’ve seen in real life and in movies and TV shows are mostly also not that appealing or are purely functional. But what if these items are designed in a way that would attract even those that don’t really want or need them? I may want to make space in my house just to have these pieces. Designer: Dalform Scandinavian design aesthetics have become staples in a lot of homes even outside the region tanks to brands like IKEA, ASPLUNS, and H\u0026M Home. Dalform is another Swedish brand that may not be as popular since they have a niche market: those who need cloakroom or locker room furniture. So this means they sell to schools, hospitals, sport venues, gyms, and other businesses. But instead of the usual ones we see, their items come in colorful and aesthetic designs. Their cloakroom solutions include clothes compartments, hat shelves, benches, and shoe shelves. The powder-coated finishes are available in a wide range of colors so you don’t get stuck with the usual white, grays, or blacks. The doors are made from extra-strong steel plate or compact laminate fitted with durable piano hinges. The storage cabinets are manufactured in Dalarna from Swedish quality steel from SSAB. Their standard designs have lacquered steel with birch melamine on wood surfaces, giving off a natural aesthetic. There are also options for different spaces like freestanding furniture or wall-mounted pieces. Since the ones who would buy their cloakroom furniture are institutions, the products are meant to last for a long time. Dalform says that they offer “very low life cycle costs through high quality”. Dalform’s approach highlights a broader trend: the infusion of thoughtful design into everyday, often overlooked, spaces. By prioritizing both aesthetics and longevity, they’re demonstrating that even the most practical furniture can contribute to a positive and inspiring environment. This blend of form and function, characteristic of Scandinavian design, suggests that even if you don’t think you need cloakroom furniture, you might just want it – a testament to the power of well-crafted, visually appealing solutions. Dalform shows us that even the most institutional of spaces can be elevated with a touch of color, quality, and considered design.",
