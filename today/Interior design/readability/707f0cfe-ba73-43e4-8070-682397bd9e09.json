  "text": "This truly exciting and ambitious project is an initiative to repurpose an abandoned brutalist water tower. Over four years, a dedicated family collaborated to transform the 1960s relic into an sophisticated vacation getaway. The interior is artfully crafted to fit the tower’s circular architecture while offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. It stands at a maximum height of 75 feet (23 meters) and was originally designed by Edmund Percey in 1964. It was built to store 50,000 gallons (almost 230,000 liters) of fresh water for the nearby villages of Tonwell and Sacombe Park in Hertfordshire, England. Designer: Matthew Grey The transformation was handled by industrial designer Matthew Grey, with the support of his wife Ali and their children. The project was selected for Airbnb’s OMG! Fund. The family put together 10,500 lb of windows, 7.38 US tons of plasterboard, and 1.1 miles of metal framing to convert the reinforced concrete structure into a home, not to mention a whole bunch of blood, sweat, and tears. “First we cut concrete,” said Grey. “Then we scaffolded to the first story and built the floors above, off the floors below. We purchased a 21-m [68-ft] scissor lift. We fixed the roof and renovated the superstructure. We installed [structural] steels, cut more holes and demolished. We ran the services. We built a 20-m [65-ft] staircase, by hand, step by step; then we built another. We lifted everything, first on ladders, then on ropes, then on a hoist, and finally on the scissor lift; loading everything we could, as soon as we could, and then we closed up.” The interior of the water tower is thoughtfully arranged to make the most of its distinctive structure. The lower floors function as practical living spaces, including a home office, storage area, laundry room, reception area, and bedrooms, all designed to utilize the available space efficiently. As you move up the tower, you reach the star attraction of the conversion – an expansive open-plan living area that combines the kitchen, dining, and living spaces on the fourth floor, where the old water tank once resided. This level features generous floor-to-ceiling glazing, which elegantly frames the panoramic 360-degree views of the surrounding landscape. The decor throughout the tower is tasteful and sophisticated, skillfully blending original period Danish and British furniture with modern conveniences such as a projector TV and a high-quality stereo system. The tower includes energy-efficient features like triple glazing to enhance insulation, a Daikin air filter, a heat pump, underfloor heating, and a robust “weapons-grade” fire system that prioritizes safety. These modern amenities combined with the aesthetic charm of classic furnishings, create a unique living experience that offers some history with contemporary luxury. One glaring issue we can notice in the building is that the spiral stairs aren’t suitable for someone with disabilities. However, the designer is exploring a custom elevator system to address this issue in the future.",
