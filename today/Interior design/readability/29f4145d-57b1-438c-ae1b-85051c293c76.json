  "description": "Most EDC stuff looks and feels like it was designed by an engineer or machinist. In contrast these objects by the James Brand, which was notably founded by an industrial designer (Ryan Coulter), were clearly created by folks with ID backgrounds.The anodized aluminum Warrick as a bit-holding screwdriver. Its sleek shape was designed both to slide into a coin pocket and to provide leverage. And the included bits aren't throwaway filler; those are Wiha bits. The Mehlville is a two-compartment carabiner. They're milled out of single blocks of aluminum or titanium and feature stainless steel fittings. The Palmer is a simple, minimalist aluminum utility knife. There's a hole for a lanyard and, like the Warrick, it will also fit into a coin pocket. The Palmer's elegantly-designed blade changing process is particularly brilliant, and features a patented mechanism. Here's how it works:I'm not much of an EDC guy, but all of these caught my eye. You can really tell when an industrial designer or team has spent a lot of time sweating every radii, chamfer and transition. And while it might seem like a small detail, the UX of the blade changes on the Palmer reminds me of the good that can come when industrial designers give a damn.",
