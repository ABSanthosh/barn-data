  "text": "The vision for this new house in Mornington — about an hour’s drive from Melbourne — was unwavering from the very start. The owners had already worked with interior designer Jessica Enander Dunne on a project a few years earlier, so when the opportunity came to build their own family home, they reached out to her again. ‘In our initial conversations, we discussed using micro cement in the bathrooms to achieve a seamless finish, paired with vein cut travertine stone throughout the home to introduce a warm, natural feel,’ Jessica says. ‘These early choices helped shape the overall design direction, guiding us toward an earthy, yet minimal and luxurious aesthetic.’ Despite being located in a coveted pocket of the coastal suburb, just one street back from the beach, the clients wanted something more contemporary, grounded and earthy. ‘We intentionally moved away from the classic coastal aesthetic,’ Jessica adds. Instead, their love of luxurious materials prompted them towards a more modern Mediterranean feel, anchored by oversized arched windows with steel frames and sandy white hues. The exterior in particular sets the tone for the soothing palette inside. Crazy paving tiles appear alongside timber battens at the home’s entrance, a pairing that’s repeated on the detailing at the serene poolside area at the rear, complete with an outdoor shower. Attention to detail was also paramount in the refined interiors. With the kitchen’s dramatic island bench destined to be the key centrepiece, the joinery was selected to match the mid-tones of Kustom Timber’s Canvas floorboards. All the stone slabs were hand-selected from Gladstones Granite, including the burgundy Calacatta Viola marble that adds an additional touch of hotel-like drama to the ensuite bathrooms. There’s a lot to love about the resulting house, but Jessica says the study is one of the standout spaces. ‘It’s such a beautiful room overlooking the pool area, yet so connected to the house with the large steel doors,’ she adds. ‘What a dream to work from home from there!’ Want more from The Design Files?
