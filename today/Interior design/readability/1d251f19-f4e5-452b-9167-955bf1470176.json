You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts.Â What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself.Â During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items:Â The case (I think I got it from HomeGoods) has a glass lid, so the items are protected against debris and dust, but I can easily see them when I go to turn my lamp on and off every day.Â It makes me smile every single time! The items probably wouldn't make sense to anyone else, but each one represents a memory or place that I love. Some are items I've picked up, a few are gifts from my husband's travels and a couple are just goofy inside jokes and gifts that make me happy when I see them.Â The case is very unassuming, but I love that it holds so many of my favorite little mementos:Â At first I used this huge DIY upholstered pin board for work items like paint samples, pages from magazines I've been published in, inspiration pics -- stuff like that:But over the past few months I've filled it even more with little trinkets from friends, our travels and my childhood:Â I hung handwritten notes and cards from friends and family, photos that I love to see everyday, whatever makes me happy. (I even hung the back of my folding chair from the La-Z-Boy Design Dash event that I won years ago. ðŸ˜€)If it makes me feel good, I put it up there. Anywhere else, this might feel overwhelming to me, but in my office it feels just right:The method of grouping items together works well here -- having the items contained to only the bulletin board keeps it meaningful but collected.Â If you have a lot of similar small items, my DIY picture ledges are a great way to display them!Â I've grouped plenty of framed photos on these of course, but we also use them to display my son's Funko Pop collection:Â It worked so well! They are the perfect size for these little figurines. You could also do thinner ledges for Lego minifigures collections.Â If you have ton of similar artwork, photos or plaques, I recommend using these ledges. My husband's office is a work in progress, but I shared a peek into this room and the ledges that corral all of his plaques:Â He has a TON and we've tried hanging them all on the wall...but it gets overwhelming and cluttered VERY fast. These ledges make them into a cool collection, and they stay nice and secure because of the lip on the front.Â I recently picked up a shadowbox from Micheal's to create a memorial for our dog Peanut. I got the 6 x 14 size shadowbox and it was perfect to hold some of his things as well as a few precious gifts we've received:We all cried when I finished it. :)It's something little that we'll see every time we walk into our laundry/mud room:Â His harness and leash always hung on those hooks, so this spot seemed fitting.Â A shadowbox is such a sweet way to memorialize a loved one, pet, or a special trip or event. This would be a make a lovely gift after a wedding or birth as well. I wish I had thought of this sooner! :)Â My family implements one more idea that I wanted to mention, but I don't have a photo because they are packed away with our holiday decor.Â I have many clear, glass ornaments with pieces of fabric tucked inside from loved ones who have passed away. Sometimes it's from a favorite piece of clothing, or a blanket, a handkerchief...anything will do! It's a sweet way to remember people we love during the holidays.Â Have you added any special displays of memories around your home? So many of these would make greatÂ DIY gifts to celebrate life's milestones -- a new baby, graduation or marriage.Â Or just to show someone you love how much they mean to you. ðŸ’—",
