  "description": "The owners of this art deco apartment purchased the Bondi property with a mission to update the space and add character, whilst preserving the period charm of the building. The three-bedroom apartment still had most of its original features, but the layout was pokey, and more recent updates has stripped the interiors of personality. A largely cosmetic renovation by Studio Pulp has addressed these issues and more, creating a ‘practically quirky’ base where the Sydney family happily reside, relax, and entertain.",

  "text": "The brief provided to Studio Pulp for this art deco apartment renovation in Bondi was relatively familiar: align the original architecture with the client’s distinct taste and practical needs. The clients loved the retained art deco features of the Sydney apartment (ornamental cornices, curved steel-framed glass windows, skirting, and stained glass windows among them), but less so the uninspiring stark white walls and drab brown carpet. It was Studio Pulp’s job to remove these latter elements while creating a more interesting look and feel desired by the owners, Amalia and Barnaby, who are both designers. ‘[An] essential aspect of the brief was to introduce pops of colour, yet warmth, creating a sense of cohesion throughout the apartment and to provide a backdrop to the clients curated art and handmade objects,’ says Benjamin Selke, architect Studio Pulp director. The layout of the apartment also required attention. ‘A key priority was to enhance the usability of the combined kitchen and dining area, transforming it into a functional space for gathering and entertaining,’ Benjamin says. The renovation comprises new joinery, styling, and contemporary finishes throughout — starting with the kitchen. ‘We introduced an L-shaped kitchen island with a tiled kick that subtly delineates the dining and kitchen areas… The bench feels playful yet functional, introducing a practical quirkiness to the joinery,’ says Benjamin. ‘Additionally, we incorporated a built-in bench seat with custom cushions and storage above and below, adding both character and practicality, while creating a sense of openness and allowing the dining/kitchen space to flow better.’ The kitchen benchtops are a cream terrazzo featuring blue stone accents, paired with a subtly matching blue-tiled kickboard on the island for ‘a touch of fun.’ High-gloss, burl-like timber laminate on the dining seat ties in with original features, such as the building’s heritage balustrade. The bathroom has had the biggest transformation of all, incorporating new matte Japanese mosaic tiles for texture and detail, and large-format gloss tiles alongside the original stained glass bathroom window. ‘We are absolutely obsessed with the bathroom — it feels like a tranquil spa with the curated charm of an Aesop shop,’ says Benjamin. ‘The interplay of tonal textures from the contrasting tiles creates a rich, layered aesthetic, while the soft curve of the vanity adds an organic elegance.’ The ‘base’ of the wider apartment interior is still neutral, but with a warmer, more modern edge. Benjamin explains, ‘We deliberately moved away from the stereotypical white, Bondi Beach aesthetic. Instead, we painted the walls in Porter’s Paints Icelandic Stone — a soft warm tone that offered depth, cosiness, and character, distinguishing the apartment from more conventional designs.’ The furniture and styling balances these earthy tones with more playful shades of pink and red to elevate the apartment’s neutral base and the client’s existing items. The build took approximately three months from start to finish, and the impact has been profound. It’s now a cohesive, unique home that embraces its art deco heritage and young family living in the heart of Bondi.",
