  "text": "Pink walls, carpet and upholstery define this intimate restaurant and cocktail bar in Richmond, Virginia, designed by locally based Studio Tarea. Pink Room was created in a former studio apartment, transformed into what Studio Tarea describes as \"a 90s fever dream where you can have a cocktail made from concrete\". A studio apartment was transformed to create the compact Pink RoomThe team renovated the space for chef Brittanny Anderson, creating an 18-seat restaurant in which she can cook a weekly updated menu while conversing with her guests. \"Between the short timeline, the tiny footprint, and the client's vision of bright colors and funky textures, it was a test for us,\" said studio co-founder Nolan Beck Rivera. The restaurant's large windows are veiled with silver-bead curtainsWith partner Cameron Billinghurst, the studio looked to girls' bedrooms in the 1990s that featured Spice Girls posters and fluffy bedding as primary references. The aim was to elevate this nostalgic aesthetic with materials including glass and polished metal to offset the bright colours and plush textures. \"We found a nice balance between our modernist tastes and Brittanny's maximalist vision,\" Beck Rivera said. Glass and metal tables were chosen to offset the all-pink paletteThick-piled carpet with colour-blocked patterning forms a soft covering across the floor, helping to dampen acoustic echoes Across the ceiling, a collage created by artist Monsieur Zohore depicts women in pop culture with food. Food is plated and served from a small open kitchen, from which the chef can converse with her guestsFrom the compact kitchen, food is plated and passed to a peninsula with bar seats for four, or served to the five glass and metal tables. Two four-tops are positioned in the centre of the room, while three two-tops share a cushioned and upholstered banquette along the wall. Several pop-culture references are sprinkled throughout the interiorLarge windows are veiled in silver-bead curtains that partially conceal the view from the street. Smoked polycarbonate sliding doors disguise the powder room, in the apartment's former bathroom past the kitchen, where a vintage mirror hangs above basin. A trio of polished nickel sconces are mounted on the dining room wall, while three glossy ceramic pendants hang above the peninsula. Additional cove and under-shelf lighting glow orange and pink as the evening service draws later, adding to the experience. The mood is set by lighting that includes nickel-plated sconces\"Part of the experience of eating there is looking around at the unique light fixtures, trying to find the hidden Miss Piggies, spotting pop-culture references,\" said Beck Rivera. \"Obviously Brittanny's food is the centrepiece, but the interiors really complement it.\" The apartment bathroom was upgraded to a powder room, which includes a vintage mirrorPink in its many shades is a popular choice for restaurant decor, from Ken Fulk's pastel-hued Swan in Miami to the bold monochrome JAM Record Bar in Sydney by Akin Atelier. Meanwhile, other eateries that have taken a different monochromatic approach include the all-blue Only Love Strangers in Manhattan's Lower East Side, and the buttery yellow San Sabino the West Village.
