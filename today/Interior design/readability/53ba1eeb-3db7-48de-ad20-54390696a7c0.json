  "description": "From 1960 to the 2010s, the population of Mexico City's Ecatepec de Morelos neighborhood grew from a mere 4,600 residents to a staggering 1.6 million. Formerly farmland, this outlying area was remote, hilly and undesirable; its residents lived there because it was all they could afford. Public transportation was terrible, consisting of spotty bus service that took up to 85 minutes—each way—for residents to reach the city center. It was also dangerous, with bus passengers regularly robbed at gunpoint.The Mexican government decided to do something about it in the mid-2010s. A subway line was out of the question; the hillside terrain would make the cost unfathomable. Instead they struck upon the brilliant and economic solution of installing cable cars. The support poles minimize the footprint of the system and can be erected far faster than excavating for subway lines. Cable car stations are also much more compact than subway stations—there are no long platforms required—and building the cable car system cost 80-90% less than a metro line.Image: Tbhotch - CC BY-SA 2.5 mx The Mexicable system opened in 2016. Nearly 30,000 riders per day began using the system, which cost just 7 pesos (USD $0.36) to ride; in contrast, the buses cost 12-15 pesos. The commuting time was cut to as little as 17 minutes. Unlike buses, the electric-powered Mexicable emits no fumes. And perhaps most importantly, the system and its well-lit stations are CCTV-monitored and thus far safer than riding the bus.Image: Tbhotch - CC BY-SA 2.5 mx Image: Presidencia de la República Mexicana - CC BY 2.0 Both the government and the private sector subsequently began improving public spaces along the cable car's route, paving roads to provide better access to the stations and improving streetlighting.
