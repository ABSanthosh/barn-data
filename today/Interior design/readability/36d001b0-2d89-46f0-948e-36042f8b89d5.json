  "text": "AirPods wearable backpack by Bravest with removable pouchesBravest designs a wearable backpack that’s shaped like Apple AirPods with removable ‘earbuds’ interior pouches. The streetwear brand is set to release the accessory on its website on July 25th, 2025, but before that, the team showcases it in a pop-up show at 302 Mott Street in Soho, New York City, on July 19th, 2025. Called AIRPACK, the accessory follows Bravest’s Rock Shoes with Canyon, which is a pair of wearable, cushiony boulders for the feet. The style of the premade accessory remains faithful to the original design by Apple. The shape of the white AirPods wearable backpack by Bravest is just a bigger size of its counterpart, and instead of having a magnetic lock when the earbuds’ case opens and closes, the accessory has a zipper that circles around the bag. When the user unzips it, the backpack’s top unfolds, revealing the two removable interior pouches inside that are shaped like earbuds.all images courtesy of BravestDome-shaped mini bags inside AIRPACKThe AirPods wearable backpack by Bravest is a 44-liter accessory. Aside from the two removable earbuds pouches, the streetwear brand also adds a dedicated laptop sleeve for those who want to carry their device. Just like any other bag, this one has adjustable straps and a handle, too. The pouches have a dome shape as well, which allows for bulky objects to fit inside. They are hollow, so the wearer can cram their items until they’re filled.Fans of the company’s devices, including its earbuds, may enjoy the AirPods wearable backpack by Bravest. On the brand’s Instagram page, some users like the idea of making the famed earbuds functional as a bag instead of just audio devices. Others also appreciate that there are removable pouches inside the AirPods wearable backpack by Bravest. When users remove them, they can put as many objects as they can within the accessory since the space vacated by the pouches is deep.
