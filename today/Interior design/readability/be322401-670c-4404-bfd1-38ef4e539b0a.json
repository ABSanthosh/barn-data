  "text": "Despite being more than 60 years old, this mid-century modern home hasn’t lost any of its retro character. The vendors say this is a testament to both the timeless design of the era, and the structure itself being ‘incredibly well built’. Stylist Sara Wieslander and helicopter pilot Richard Park moved into 152 Mountain View Parade a few years ago, after falling in love with the nostalgic property on first inspection. With its charming brick exterior and stairs that lead up to the front door, the elevated house was inspired by the work of John Hipwell — a renowned local architect who designed several homes of this era, primarily throughout Warrandyte. ‘The open floor plan was very appealing to us,’ Sara says of the split-level living spaces that maximise views of the lush gardens surrounding the 906-square-metre block. ‘We also saw the potential to transform the garden spaces into a style more in keeping with the architecture of the house,’ she adds. They worked with Bespoke Landscaping to renew the expansive outdoor areas, in addition to replacing the old roof last year, whilst being careful not to disrupt the home’s mid-century personality. Inside, each of the three bedrooms also enjoys leafy vistas, while the huge undercroft features a two-car port, laundry, and ground-floor workshop with direct access to the backyard. Original timber-lined wall panels and flooring adds warmth throughout, while oversized windows frame calming views out towards the Dandenong Ranges. ‘It feels like you’re living amongst the trees, especially when relaxing in the retreat just off the dining area,’ Sara says. Having listed the home for sale to move back to her homeland of Sweden, Sara notes they’re sad to leave Rosanna’s ‘gorgeous community’. ‘We’re so close to nature and great parklands, yet it’s only 20 minutes from the city. But we’ll mostly miss the feeling of coming home as you pull into the winding driveway.’ 152 Mountain View Parade, Rosanna, VIC is listed for sale with Liz Walker and James Labiris from Nelson Alexander Ivanhoe and will go to auction on Saturday June 14 at 1:30pm.",
