Ahhhh… that crisp fall air has arrived and it felt so nice until sadly it didn’t. :-( We turned the AC in the house off a few days ago and opened up the windows to let the crisp fall air in, but this year after the hurricane damage and so many trees down and tree debris around the area, many homeowners are burning it which I find an awful practice since I suffer from nasal allergies. The smoke in the air is even impacting my daily walk. Double sad face. :-( :-( I have to keep the windows closed which makes me feel anxious as I just want the fresh air through the house. Do any of you have nasal allergies to burning wood? I will be a happy camper once the area gets past hurricane cleanup mode. On a positive note, repairs on the house are moving in the right direction. If you missed what Hurricane Helene did to my house, you can read about it, here. The first thing will be getting a whole new roof all over the house, not just repaired. We found a great roofer who can start work in a few weeks instead of months as some of the roofer estimates we got were going to take to start. Lots to do and plan, so many choices. So Ed and I don’t get overwhelmed, we are taking it all one step at a time. Now onto the links and ideas I found this week. Something to Think About How to put your phone down and get back into habit of reading books.
