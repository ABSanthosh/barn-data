  "description": "This Algol TV was designed by Italian architect/designer Marco Zanuso and German industrial designer Richard Sapper. Released by Italian electronics brand Brionvega in 1964, the ABS-clad TV was described by Zanuso as \"a little dog that looks up at its master.\"The design was popular, landing in both the MoMA and the V\u0026A Museum in London, and was reissued multiple times—all the way until 1998! A 34-year lifespan for a television set—an 11\" model, no less—seems insane today.A '90s marketing image It admittedly doesn't look fantastic with the handle deployed, though you wouldn't see that during ordinary use. Handle aside, Zanuso and Sapper really pulled off the canted form while retaining a pleasing proportion and gesture. To see how this effect can go really wrong, have a look at the back end of the unloved 1985 Alfa Romeo Milano. See Also:Two Fun 1960s/'70s Television Sets Designed by Rodolfo Bonetto",
