Built with breakthrough Sound Motion technology, Arc Ultra brings your entertainment to life with deep bass, immersive spatial audio with Dolby Atmos, and a refined look that complements large TVs without overpowering your space. It is the sleekest and most powerful soundbar Sonos has ever created. Available for $999. Designer: Sonos Sonos Arc Ultra brings sound and crafts an expansive sound stage that fills every inch of the room. Featuring an all-new architecture powered by 14 Sonos-engineered drivers, including the Sound Motion woofer and advanced tweeters, it delivers a 9.1.4 spatial audio experience that feels out of this world. Trueplay, now available for iOS and Android, allows you to fine-tune the sound for your specific space, transforming any room into a personal movie theater. Sound Motion technology enhances the immersive experience by packing impressive performance into a compact design. This innovation provides greater clarity, depth, and balance, allowing you to hear every frequency with accuracy. It also delivers double the bass output compared to the previous Arc model. With Dolby Atmos, Arc Ultra brings sound to life with sensational definition, enveloping you in a 9.1.4 spatial audio experience that places you right in the middle of the action. To elevate the experience further, pair Arc Ultra with Sonos Sub 4 and Era 300 rear speakers for a fully immersive Dolby Atmos setup that delivers incredible detail from every direction. For personal listening, you can even integrate Sonos Ace headphones for private surround sound and sensational spatial audio. Never strain to hear dialogue again. The new center channel architecture in the Sonos Arc Ultra ensures every word, whisper, and subtle vocal cue is crystal clear. The advanced Speech Enhancement feature, adjustable via the Sonos app, allows you to customize dialogue clarity further to suit your preference, ensuring that conversations and vocals are always easy to follow. Sonos partnered with industry veterans like Chris Jenkins and Onnalee Blank to fine-tune Arc Ultra for Dolby Atmos content, achieving a sound profile that rivals professional studio systems. This collaboration ensures you get an audio experience as rich and immersive as the creators intended, giving you a true theater-like atmosphere at home. Arc Ultra is thoughtfully crafted with a distinctive curved shape, low-profile design, and matte finish, making it a stylish addition to your home while keeping the focus on your entertainment. The wrap-around grille extends sound in every direction, ensuring you’re completely surrounded, while the slimmer design prevents obstructing the TV screen whether it’s mounted or placed on a credenza. Setting up the Arc Ultra is straightforward—connect it via HDMI eARC for a seamless experience. Once connected, it can be effortlessly controlled using your TV remote, the Sonos app, Sonos Voice Control, or Amazon Alexa. Touch controls are cleverly positioned on a hidden ledge to minimize visual distractions, and Bluetooth line-in adds even more streaming flexibility. Additionally, with Apple AirPlay 2 compatibility, the Arc Ultra integrates smoothly into your home ecosystem. Sonos has also prioritized sustainability with Arc Ultra. Improved serviceability, reduced adhesive usage, lower idle power consumption, and smaller packaging volume all contribute to an environmentally friendly product without compromising on performance. The packaging is fully recyclable, and the product is designed to ship more efficiently with a lighter weight and reduced materials. Pair the Arc Ultra with Sonos’ new Sub 4 for an extraordinary home theater experience. Sub 4 features dual custom woofers that generate deep, dynamic low frequencies, enhancing your entertainment without distortion. Its sculptural design allows it to fit seamlessly into your home—whether standing upright, lying on its side, or tucked under furniture. The next-generation Sub 4 includes increased processing power, memory, and new WiFi radios for better connectivity. Alongside Arc Ultra and Sub 4, Sonos is rolling out an improved version of its app. This new software enhances the user experience by improving system identification, simplifying device setup, and offering better grouping capabilities. It also includes new features like improved queue management, music library indexing, and enhanced accessibility options, such as TalkBack improvements on Android. With Sonos Arc Ultra and Sub 4, I’m excited to bring the next-level sound system into the comfort of my own home—experiencing exceptional sound quality, advanced features, and a sophisticated design that transforms my living room into a true cinematic space.",
