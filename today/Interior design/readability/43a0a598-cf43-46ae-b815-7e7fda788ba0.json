  "text": "A poignant drawback of space-saving tiny homes is that we often need to use stairs or a ladder to access the bed or sleeping area. Many people often don’t want to go through this process, and hence many designers are now creating tiny homes with all the rooms positioned on one floor. The Moulinsart is one such example, and it features an open layout that is suitable for around two people. It is designed by Baluchon and features a length of 23 feet, and is based on a double-axle trailer. It features a red cedar finish, topped with a metal roof, and powered by a standard RV-style hookup. Designer: Baluchon Since the tiny home features only a single story and not two floors, there is not much space to work with. To ensure space is maximized, Baluchon designed a simple and compact layout that provides sufficient space. However, the layout does make the home more of a vacation house than a full-time residence. As you enter the front door, you are welcomed by a pretty simple kitchen. It includes an oven, a sink, storage space, cabinetry, a propane-powered two-burner stove, and a ventilated section for fruits and vegetables. There isn’t any fridge visible, but they may have tucked it away in some cabinetry. A dining table that can seat two people is added as well. The living room and the bedroom form one central section. This space is equipped with a small wood-burning stove to offer warmth. A desk area and shelving have been incorporated as well. The space also includes a sofa bed with integrated storage, and this is the only bed in the entire home. Generous glazing marks this living area, and hence light flows in throughout the day. The other end of the home holds the bathroom, which contains a shower and a toilet. The Moulinsart is a cozy and well-furnished home for anyone who wants easy access to their beds. It also seems like a safe and comfortable space for kids and the elderly, as there is no risk of them tripping on the stairs/ladder and hurting themselves. The home is quite compact for a tiny house, but the layout is well-designed albeit simple, and does have all the essential amenities one could need for a comfortable stay. We are unsure of the home’s pricing, but Baluchon’s tiny homes are usually priced at US$95,000.",
