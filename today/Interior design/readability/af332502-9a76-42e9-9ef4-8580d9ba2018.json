  "text": "A project by NK Interior, the Ethereal Escape is where elegance meets tranquility. From the soft curves to the interplay of natural light, every detail plays its part in redefining modern luxury. This space blends minimalist aesthetics with organic elements, creating a personal retreat that gives residents a break from the chaos of the world. The thoughtfully designed living area uses oversized, modular sofas. These take up a good portion of visual estate but remain low to the floor to maintain the sleek vibe. The coffee table uses both stone and metal, forming a sculptural central piece. Finally, a modern linear fireplace is seamlessly integrated into the wall. The dining area uses a sleek—but statement—marble dining table. The sculptural dining chairs are modern yet sophisticated. Together, the curved silhouettes of the table as well as the chairs add warmth to the space. A minimalist pendant light, hanging in quite an organic manner, keeps the ambiance visually interesting. The kitchen uses an elongated island, with three barstools placed at one end. The minimalist artwork brings the otherwise neutral space to life. We see large floor-to-ceiling windows giving outdoor views. But that’s not it! The outdoor space can be enjoyed just like the living room—with a mug of coffee on a sectional—too. Next comes the elegant outdoor terrace. It is covered—for protection from weather elements—but the glass ceiling panels still create an airy vibe. A plush, oversized sofa dominates the terrace. A black coffee table forms the focal point, while individual modular lounge chairs offer some more seating space. We especially love the large potted plants making the ambiance all the more outdoorsy. The bedroom is as cozy as a minimalist space gets. The bed, with a plush, minimalist frame, looks lived-in. A sleek C-shaped table offers functionality, while the modern marble nightstands add luxury to the interior. Simultaneously, the wooden flooring factor in warmth. The bathroom in the Ethereal Escape is spacious and sleek. A double marble vanity adds the luxe factor, while the freestanding bathtub creates a spa-like ambiance. The modern shower cubicle uses black hardware, instantly drawing the eye.",
