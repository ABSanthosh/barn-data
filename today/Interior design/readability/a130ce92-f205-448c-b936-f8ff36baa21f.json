  "text": "From an early age Amanda Leigh had an affinity for art, and she was intrigued by residences of various styles. She was also a volunteer for the Appalachia Service Project, which provides home repairs and replacements for income-eligible families. Yet no matter what other interests captured her attention, she always found her way back to A\u0026D. A New York native, Leigh once owned a restaurant in the city, but soon realized that she had a greater connection to the design aspect of owning a restaurant than she did to the industry as a whole. It was when she completed a project from start to finish that Leigh realized what her true calling was. “From the point where I did my first restoration and remodel, independent from any clients’ decisions or outside bias, I knew it was something I wanted to do forever,” she says. Taylor Hahn + Amanda Leigh of House of Rolison \\\\\\ Photo: Jenna Burke In 2022, Leigh founded the Los Angeles-based House of Rolison with Taylor Hahn, her partner in business and life. A design and development firm, the duo finds forgotten houses and restores each one to its intended beauty. They are known for creating spaces that push the boundaries of innovation and capture the essence of upscale living. Leigh celebrates her love of unexpected and bespoke living, and some of her favorites are decommissioned firehouses – like the one owned by Spike Lee. As managing partners, Leigh and Hahn mix vintage elements with contemporary pieces that feel curated and sophisticated. They constantly strive to impart a signature luxury aesthetic that cannot be recreated elsewhere. Whether Leigh is reimagining a Spanish Colonial property or a bungalow, she credits Hahn with providing unparalleled support that has shaped how she approaches her work. “Taylor inspires me, and has changed my outlook creatively,” Leigh notes. “Our company would not be what it is if it wasn’t for our collaborative differences and our love as a whole.” Today, Amanda Leigh joins us for Friday Five! Fuller Building The Flatiron, New York, 1910 by Irving Underhill \\\\\\ Retrieved from the Library of Congress 1. The Flatiron Building The Flatiron building is an incredible piece of New York City architecture. I have spent most of my adult life in New York City, and couldn’t help but be drawn to the history of this beauty. Veronica Mainetti of Sorgente group has bought back the building in pieces to restore it to residential use and I couldn’t be happier about this endeavor! Photo: Courtesy of Addison 2. Addison in San Diego Last January we took a trip to the Grand Del Mar in San Diego, to celebrate Taylor’s birthday, where we made a point to check out the beautiful restaurant, Addison. I was blown away by the flavors, thoughtful choreography and their chef William Bradley is fantastic. He is a designer in his own right, and his canvas just happens to be edible. He invited us to tour us through his newly renovated kitchen and who knew Dekton could look so gorgeous. Ross Farm \\\\\\ Photo: Lachlan Moore, courtesy of Studio Moore 3. Staircases I have always been fascinated by staircases. They can have such a whimsical presence and the dance between engineering and design is so beautiful and diverse. Even something so industrial with such rigid materials like the one in this photo can have such a delicate nature. 4. Framing Framing is an art, and master framers and carpenters are undervalued. How captivating are the details of this groin vault? The amount of time it takes to block through all those details is such a strong reminder to look around and take more in. 5. 427 Cobra I grew up tinkering with cars and motorcycles and have developed a strong fascination with how they work. The 427 Cobra is one of the most recognizable and iconic cars in American history. I have such an affinity for this vehicle, although an original will run you between 1 to 2 million dollars, if you could even find one. Projects by House of Rolison: We love the family room at our Roscomare property. We used the color “Cottage White” from Dunn Edwards, which really brought the space to life and the large sliding doors add in beautiful natural sunlight. Brands shown include: Dunn Edwards Paint, VESTAK, Olive Ateliers The kitchen at Lloydcrest is one of our favorite kitchens. We used a crema marfil marble with a curved fluted edge to give movement to the rook. Mixing paint and stain grade cabinetry helps the room feel grounded and warm. We used an Ilve stove, a bold light fixture, and Lo and Co’s Viola Hardware to bring fresh energy to this space. Brands shown include: Plank Hardware, Ilve Stone, Lo and Co. Our primary suite at our Bluebird property. We repurposed the space to the right of the fireplace as a lounge/den for a relaxed feel. We curated pieces from The Expert, Olive Ateliers, Soho Home, and other sourced antiques, which helped us juxtapose old with new. The combination of cedar wood ceilings mirrored to hardwood white oak flooring makes you feel like you’re enveloped in warmth. Brands include: The Expert, Olive Ateliers, Soho Home Our “blue bathroom” at Bluebird. This bathroom exudes an old-world European feel. We started with the vision of the arched bathtub. We wanted to bring in not only color, but shape and texture. We have so many moving elements in one room creating a monochromatic space that’s filled with soul and dynamic. Brands include: Restoration Hardware, Zia Tile, Portola Paints Our beautiful Coldwater kitchen. This home is surrounded by the scenery and beauty of a Los Angeles canyon. We wanted to capture the essence of nature and art in this space. We used two tones of stone to make the back counters stand out and the warmth of wood cabinetry to make the room feel soulful.
