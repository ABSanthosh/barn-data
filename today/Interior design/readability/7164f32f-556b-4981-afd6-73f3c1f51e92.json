All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Kenishirotie/ShutterstockGallery walls are a great way to fill up a bare wall with a collection of artwork, photos, and ephemera that makes your home feel more like you. But these areas can also be a bit of a challenge to pull together if you’re starting from scratch. Thankfully, there’s a shortcut: Costco has brought back its best-selling kit, which makes creating a gallery wall so easy that you can start and finish the entire thing in a single afternoon.What Is the Umbra Gallery Picture Frame Set at Costco?The Umbra Picture Frame Set is a kit that includes seven frames in various sizes, each with removable mat boards. You can choose to grab the kit that comes with either black or brown frames and hang them in the best configuration that fits your space. Having a set of matching frames eliminates the pressure and time required to source similar options. Each set comes with one large 11-inch by 14-inch frame, two 7-inch by 9-inch frames, and three 6-inch by 8-inch frames, all of which fit neatly together in seemingly endless layout designs. You can find the kit in Costco warehouses for just under $32 or purchase one on Costco’s website for just under $35.It’s no surprise that people love the frame set. “This is a beautiful set of frames! I bought the black set at our local Costco, but when I got home I realized I liked them so much I needed brown too,” one shopper wrote in their review on Costco’s website. “Got the brown set at Costco.com because the store sold out of all!!! Great quality, easy to insert pictures and hang.”“Really happy with this 7-piece picture frame set from Costco,” another person wrote. “The quality is better than I expected for the price — sturdy frames, clean lines, and the matting gives it a nice polished look. Everything was packaged well and easy to hang. The different sizes make it super simple to build a gallery wall that doesn’t look too uniform or boring. For under $30, you really can’t beat the value. Would definitely buy again.”You can display the set as it is, mash two sets together, or use the set as a jumping-off point for a larger gallery wall you have planned. These simple frames make the artwork or photos inside them stand out, allowing you to get creative with the way you display them.
