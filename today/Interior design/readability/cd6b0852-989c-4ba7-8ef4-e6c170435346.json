  "description": "The owners’ travels to Brazil and Palm Springs served as inspiration behind this new build in Sydney’s Northern Beaches. These trips gave them a greater appreciation of mid-century architecture, which in turn became the aesthetic they wanted for their own family home. Aatos Design shaped the resulting Narrabeen abode to capture uninterrupted views of the lake and coastline, using natural materials to create fresh interiors that still feel a little bit nostalgic.",
