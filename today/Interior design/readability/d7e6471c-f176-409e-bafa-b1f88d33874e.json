  "text": "There’s something uniquely satisfying about a tool that manages to condense an entire toolbox into a single, beautifully crafted object. The PryMax 2.0 from EDC MONSTER does exactly that, and yet, it’s more than just a multi-function gadget—it’s a design refined through time, blending technical innovation with understated elegance. The PryMax 2.0 comes from the folks at EDC MONSTER, who saw a great deal of success with the first-generation PryBar from 2023. Over the past year, the team’s worked towards refining the design, building not just on their own personal experience with the device but also on consumer feedback from the nearly 900 people who bought the EDC multitool. Retaining the Grade 5 titanium construction, this redesigned tool combines toughness with a refined sense of minimalism, measuring just 13.7 cm (5.4 inches) and weighing 95 grams (3.3 ounces). It’s not trying to impress with bulk; instead, it’s a masterclass in efficiency and restraint, ready to handle everything from everyday tasks to unexpected challenges. Designer: EDC MONSTER Click Here to Buy Now: $159 $239 ($80 off) Hurry, only 67 of 100 pieces left! Within its compact frame (which is a hallmark of its design) lie 10 features, ranging from general to specific tools. The prybar gets first mention (thanks to the tool’s name), following the CNC-machined wrench that also doubles as a bottle-opener and a caliper. The caliper’s measurements are courtesy a set of etched markings on the side, which can also be used to measure items normally like a regular scale. Other features include a ratchet screwdriver, regular bit driver, everlasting pen, emergency glass breaker, and other non-essential EDC details like a pocket clip and tritium-slots. Tucked into this sleek titanium body is an adjustable wrench that takes versatility to another level. Need to tighten a loose bolt on your bike or a leaky faucet? The PryMax 2.0’s wrench is ready to adapt. It handles a wide range of nut sizes with a smooth adjustment mechanism that feels far more robust than you’d expect from something this compact. And when precision is key, the integrated caliper comes into play, offering quick, on-the-go measurements. No need to lug around bulky measuring tools—this one stays quietly at your side, ready when you are. These features don’t scream for attention; they simply work, making your day just that bit easier. The dual-direction ratchet screwdriver integrated into the PryMax 2.0 is designed for serious work. Unlike the typical multi-tool, where screwdrivers are often an afterthought, this one delivers precision and ease. The magnetic bit driver, which comes pre-installed with two S2 alloy steel bits, allows for quick changes and ensures a smooth, frustration-free experience—no more fumbling with tiny parts. For tighter spaces, the fixed-position bit holder steps in, offering a controlled grip when the situation calls for more delicate maneuvering. It’s not just a screwdriver; it’s the tool you didn’t know you needed. At the tip of the PryMax 2.0 lies its most prominent feature (and where it gets its name from too), the prybar. The wedge-shaped prying tool, combined with the EDC’s titanium construction, is perfect for prying out nails, shimmying open lids, and even cutting through boxes. The blunt edge tucks perfectly into crevasses, and the titanium body takes on pretty much any sort of stress, allowing you to wedge open even the tightest of lids or the rustiest of screws. The box-opener feature is neat too, because it’s just sharp enough to cut tape without posing a safety threat to humans. With practical, the PryMax 2.0 packs tactical features too – in the form of a strategically placed glass-breaker that can shatter even reinforced/laminated glass with a single strike. Compact but powerful, this feature is designed to break through glass with minimal effort, potentially saving your life in an emergency if you’re trapped in a vehicle or in another critical situation. These are the kinds of details that don’t just make the PryMax 2.0 a tool for tinkering—they make it a tool for everyday survival. While functionality is clearly at the core of this tool, there’s a certain pleasure in the quieter, more thoughtful additions. The everlasting pen, for instance, tucks neatly along the side, always there when you need to jot something down. It’s not just any pen, either—it writes on nearly any surface, wet or dry, and never runs out of ink. Designed using a special alloy that mimics the effect of pencil on paper, this everlasting pen can write for years without needing sharpening or generating waste – that offsets the 8 million trees cut each year to make pencils. Pair that with the ruler etched discreetly into the side of the tool, and you’ve got everything you need for small-scale precision work, whether it’s marking wood for a DIY project or quickly measuring something on the go. It’s these subtle touches that make the PryMax 2.0 not just a practical tool, but a pleasure to use. The PryMax 2.0 measures 13.7cm (5.4 inches) and weighs just 95 grams (3.3 ounces) A true everyday carry wouldn’t be complete without a few features that make it worth carrying everywhere you go. The PryMax 2.0’s bottle opening feature fits that bill perfectly, because you never know when you’ll need to crack open a brewski. The bottle opener’s cleverly (and rather discreetly) built right into the wrench, giving you a 3-in-one feature that opens bottles, tightens bolts, and even measures objects! The integrated phone stand is a nice touch too, allowing you to instantly dock/mount your phone in either landscape or portrait and watch a video while sipping on said brewski. Even the finer details of this tool are tailored for those who value both function and form. Five tritium slots line the tool, allowing for personal customization with glowing inserts. Whether for practical low-light visibility or just a touch of aesthetic flair, these tritium tubes offer a level of personalization that’s rare in such a compact device. It’s the kind of thoughtful design element that resonates with those who appreciate a tool that’s both personal and functional—more than just an accessory, it’s an extension of its owner’s style. The PryMax 2.0 comes in a single color – after all what’s classier than bare, machined titanium?! It starts at $159, which is a steal considering the 10-in-1 nature of the multitool, and the fact that it’s literally designed to outlast you. The deep pocket clip and lanyard hole make the EDC perfect to carry around with you everywhere you go, and the lack of a blade or sharp edge immediately makes the PryMax 2.0 TSA-approved for carrying on flights too. The PryMax 2.0 ships globally for free starting January 2025. Click Here to Buy Now: $159 $239 ($80 off) Hurry, only 67 of 100 pieces left!",

The everlasting pen, for instance, tucks neatly along the side, always there when you need to jot something down. It’s not just any pen, either—it writes on nearly any surface, wet or dry, and never runs out of ink. Designed using a special alloy that mimics the effect of pencil on paper, this everlasting pen can write for years without needing sharpening or generating waste – that offsets the 8 million trees cut each year to make pencils. Pair that with the ruler etched discreetly into the side of the tool, and you’ve got everything you need for small-scale precision work, whether it’s marking wood for a DIY project or quickly measuring something on the go.

The bottle opener’s cleverly (and rather discreetly) built right into the wrench, giving you a 3-in-one feature that opens bottles, tightens bolts, and even measures objects! The integrated phone stand is a nice touch too, allowing you to instantly dock/mount your phone in either landscape or portrait and watch a video while sipping on said brewski. Even the finer details of this tool are tailored for those who value both function and form. Five tritium slots line the tool, allowing for personal customization with glowing inserts. Whether for practical low-light visibility or just a touch of aesthetic flair, these tritium tubes offer a level of personalization that’s rare in such a compact device. It’s the kind of thoughtful design element that resonates with those who appreciate a tool that’s both personal and functional—more than just an accessory, it’s an extension of its owner’s style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://shanxiyimadianzishangwuyouxiangongsi.kckb.me/c47cec16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_10.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/10/11/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Titanium 10-in-1 EDC Tool PryMax 2.0 Packs a Ratchet Screwdriver, Wrench, and Survival Gear\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_10.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://shanxiyimadianzishangwuyouxiangongsi.kckb.me/c47cec16\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e \u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_11.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/10/11/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Titanium 10-in-1 EDC Tool PryMax 2.0 Packs a Ratchet Screwdriver, Wrench, and Survival Gear\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/10/titanium-10-in-1-edc-tool-prymax-2-0-packs-a-ratchet-screwdriver-wrench-and-survival-gear/prymax_2_edc_multitool_11.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe PryMax 2.0 comes in a single color – after all what’s classier than bare, machined titanium?!
