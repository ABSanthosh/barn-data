  "description": "How to replace a recessed can light with a chandelier or ceiling fan!Â Did you know you can hang any light fixture from a recessed light fixture, as long as it's 35 pounds or under?Â There are a few easy ways to update or change out your recessed lights. I've shared a couple of them here...if you have old, yellowed cans with halogen bulbs, it's super easy to replace your old recessed lights with beautiful LED versions.You can also add character and detail where a recessed light is installed by using a simple kit that screws into the to change it to a hanging pendant light. For this method you need to have the a canned light that has a screw in light bulb.I did this in our little blue and white floral wallpapered hallway:Â And in our foyer vestibule when I added (you guessed it)...wallpaper there as well:Â Both of those options are SUPER simple and take no electrical knowledge at all!I do have some electrical experience, so I thought this next one would be especially easy. Although it turns out you don't need to know much other than how to wire a light fixture to do this one.Â So I thought...easy! ðŸ˜£You know how sometimes what you think will be super difficult turn out to be a breeze, and projects you think will be easy turn out to be much harder than you thought?Â This was one of those harder than I thought ones.Shortly after finishingÂ my closet makeover over the past couple of weeks, I thought about some updates I'd like to make to the little hallway outside the closet as well.It's a small space, but as you can see above, I love treating spots like that as tiny rooms I can decorate. :)Â We have a recessed light in this area that I knew would look great with a hanging light:Â Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I got mine at Lowe's, but hang in there till the end of the post for a much better option and links to how-to videos.Â Do you sense the foreboding? :)I found this Parker light fixtureÂ that I LOVED, and it was on sale when I grabbed it. Perfect timing!:Â I love the brass and white combo and it's a decent sized light. I like to go bigger than you'd think in small spaces like this.Â This smaller one was on sale and I got an additional discount, so it was $60 off the regular price. I was so excited to get it up -- I knew it was going to look so good in our little hallway!Â This is where the project, that should take an hour, turned intoÂ four. FOUR. HOURS.Â The can converter isn't that difficult to install really...it's basically just a bracket that you install inside the can so a heavier light can be hung.Â But the directions in the kit I used were abysmal. So bad that I eventually stopped trying to use them and decided to figure out the install on my own.Â It just wasn't working for me...the bracket would not stay secure. Also, the converter kit has a metal medallion that you have to use to cover the large recessed hole. But I could not figure out how to install the light I was using with that medallion.Â Then...this gorgeous light gave me some fits as well. The cord is covered with fabric, which looks great. But if you have to shorten your chain, you'll need to cut this as well.Â Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but the fabric around the cord instantly started unraveling. I tried leaving it alone but every time I moved the cord the fabric would fray even more:Â It was a HUGE mess, so I had to carefully cut all of that off of the cord, which took forever because I was trying not to nip the actual cord.Â Between the light fixture giving me fits and the kit not working, this project took way longer than I planned.Â But I don't give up! Or I'm just ridiculously stubborn. Either way, I finally figured out a solution.Â It was as simple as running back to the hardware store for a flat medallion for the ceiling instead of the dome shaped option they provided in the converter kit.Â Once I figured that out, the light went up in about 15 minutes...as it should.Â Thankfully, I love it as much as I thought I would! It's a really lovely light:Â I plan to go pretty dramatic in this space and this gorgeous light is my inspiration.Â NOW I think it was worth all the work. During the cussing, not so much.Â Just adding a pretty light fixture adds so much to this small space!:So here's the thing -- this project doesn't need to be as hard as it was for me. It really should only be an hour from start to finish, tops.Â I did some research and it turns out THIS can light converter is MUCH easier to install and has better instructions as well. It's also half the price of the one I got...I ordered two more for less than what I paid for the one I used.Â I plan to change out mine with that mounting bracket/converter kit instead. Mine sucked. :)If you purchase that option, this YouTube video will walk you through the installation.Â No matter what kit you use, a flat ceiling medallion is a must.Â That's my tale of the lighting project I thought was going to be easy...but wasn't. Have you tried converting your recessed can lights with one of this kits? How did it work for you?Â Stay tuned for more updates in this little hallway! Share this",
