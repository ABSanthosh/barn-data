  "text": "LEGO’s Botanical Collection has always had a knack for transforming nature’s beauty into something delightfully brick-built, and the 10340 Wreath doesn’t miss a beat. It’s a blend of creativity and festive spirit, delivering an experience that’s as much about the build as it is about the final product. While everyone’s decking the halls with boughs of holly that will wilt or brown in a week’s worth of time, this LEGO wreath stays intact for years, keeping that holiday charm going even after the holidays are over. This isn’t LEGO’s first foray into wreath-making—2020’s Christmas Wreath 2-in-1 was charming, but it pales in comparison to the grandeur of this release. With twice the piece count and a design rich in detail, the 10340 Wreath is nothing short of a holiday masterpiece. It’s adorned with cleverly crafted pinecones, printed orange slices, and cinnamon sticks that are so realistic they might make you crave mulled wine. From the box art alone, you can almost smell the festivities. Designer: LEGO The build itself is a thoughtful blend of simplicity and depth. The base structure, assembled from four sub-units, provides a sturdy foundation for the magic to come. Once the groundwork is laid, the real fun begins—layering foliage in a way that’s both repetitive and rewarding. Using palm tree elements, new sand-green recolors, and a variety of leaf pieces, the design mimics the textures of a real wreath with surprising accuracy. Each layer adds depth, transforming a pile of bricks into something that looks alive. Moments of surprise are scattered throughout the build. What looks at first glance like a clever assembly turns out to be a stroke of brilliance—minifigure flat caps stacked to mimic the scales of a real pinecone. These little moments of surprise are what LEGO does best, rewarding builders not just with a finished model but with a sense of discovery along the way. It’s a feeling that keeps you reaching for the next piece, eager to see what other secrets are hidden in the build. The flexibility of the design ensures it fits into more than one tradition. Whether you’re hanging it on a door or laying it out as a table centerpiece, the wreath adapts effortlessly. Swapping between the two configurations is quick, adding to its charm as a versatile seasonal piece. It’s a model that seems determined to give you options, making it feel like an even greater value. There are challenges, of course, but nothing that takes away from the fun. As the layers stack up, visibility becomes tricky, and placing pieces can feel like solving a puzzle in dim light. But there’s something satisfying about the small effort it demands. Adjusting the foliage, tweaking the positioning—it’s a process that invites you to slow down and engage, offering a meditative rhythm amidst the holiday bustle. Once complete, the wreath’s presence is undeniable. Its lush, textured form radiates festive warmth, whether hanging in the hallway or gracing the dinner table. From the matte finish of the leaves to the vibrant pops of color in the berries and citrus, every detail feels meticulously considered. It doesn’t just decorate a space; it transforms it, wrapping your home in holiday cheer. At $99.99, this set sits at the premium end of LEGO’s holiday offerings. For some, the lack of a licensed theme might make the cost harder to swallow. Yet when you step back and consider what you’re really paying for—a decoration that lasts, a joyful building experience, and a touch of holiday magic—it starts to feel less like a splurge and more like an investment. Unlike real wreaths that shed needles and fade, this one stays vibrant year after year.",
