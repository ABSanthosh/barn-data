  "text": "The Bunkie Cabin was introduced around ten years ago, and it definitely captured many hearts. The cabin was quaint, compact, and wholly adorable. Ten years later, the Bunkie Co. has expanded its offerings, providing us with a wholesome range of tiny homes and simple plug-and-play cabins that don’t require any permits. One of their larger homes is the Premier, and it has a cozy house with a faux-chimney design. Designer: The Bunkie Co. The Premier is one of their popular models, and it features clean lines, a wide-open floor plan, and an enchanting faux chimney. Owners can customize the home as they please, creating a safe sanctuary that feels wholly their own. It features exterior dimensions of 12′-6″W x 8′-6″D x 11′-6″H, hence boasting a form that is small and portable, making it an ideal fit to take out to the woods for a weekend. Since the Bunkie doesn’t need a permit, moving the tiny home around isn’t an issue. It makes living on the go much easier and efficiemore nt. The Premier is a premium home, and it starts at around USD 54,900. It is equipped with unique space-saving designs like a Murphy bed, built-in shelving, and other nifty features. The home is built in Canada using precision-engineered materials, showcasing premium quality. The house can only sleep two people, so it isn’t the biggest home on the market and not the most suitable option for large families. It does seem like a good fit for couples and solo residents. The Premier is equipped with a double glass wall in the front and back with a door holder and standard awning. There is also an option for a front door screen, rear door with holder, rear door screen, and rear awning. The home is integrated with R22 insulated walls and floor with 6mil poly barrier and R22 rigid insulation in the roof.",
