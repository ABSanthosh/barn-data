  "text": "This former North Melbourne factory isn’t a converted apartment building, it’s a three-bedroom house with pretty incredible proportions. After spending more than 60 years as a factory, warehouse, and automobile workshop, the building at 58 Harcourt Street has been transformed into a residence by Six Degrees Architects — who were early pioneers of warehouse conversions back in the 1990s. ‘It was built in the late 1960’s as simple brick factory, with steel frames windows and security screens,’ Six Degrees Architects director Mark Healy says of the building. ‘It had a great palette to start with, in a quiet super convenient pocket of North Melbourne.’ These days, Mark says Six Degrees rarely does ‘small scale’ residential projects, making this urban home especially rare. ‘The process was all about working with the original building and keeping additions sympathetic to the industrial heritage,’ he adds. ‘All the brickwork and structural steel has been recycled into the house. Even the old roof timbers have been milled to become the front door.’ They took a formal approach to the floor plan, reserving the ground level with its frosted windows for utilitarian spaces like the study, laundry, workshop, and double garage. On the first floor, the indoor-outdoor connection becomes more impactful, with almost Roman-style arches that give the bedrooms a glimpse into the leafy surrounds. Meanwhile, the living spaces on the top floor were designed to feel completely open, thanks to expansive glazing and a giant tilt door that opens to a lush balcony — allowing the lucky residents to feel like they’re living among the treetops. Plus upstairs, there’s a rooftop deck where you can watch the sun set across the city. It’s not short on space or natural light, which Mark notes is especially hard to find in Melbourne’s inner suburbs. Better yet, the home is all-electric, with a car charger, heat-pump hot water, and rooftop solar system for sustainability. Talk about the ultimate city sanctuary! 58 Harcourt Street, North Melbourne, VIC 3051 is listed for private sale with Peter Stephens from Nelson Alexander Carlton North.",
