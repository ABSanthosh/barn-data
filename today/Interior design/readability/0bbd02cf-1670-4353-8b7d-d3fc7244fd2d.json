The Dezeen Awards master jury took place at the One Hundred Shoreditch hotel in London and included architect Keiji Ashizawa and designers Patricia Urquiola and Lee Broom. Designers Peter Mabeo and Pilar Zeta, as well as interior designer Claudia Afshar and architect Alexandra Hagen also joined to finalise the 46 award winners.

The interiors master jury panel deciding this year's winners\"Design is a powerful tool to achieve change and it's clear much of the creativity in architecture today is directed towards building more sustainable societies,\" said Hagen. \"It gives me hope for the future.\" Hagen was joined by Japanese architect Keiji AshizawaUrquiola and Afshar were joined by Carolina Maluhy + Partners founder Carolina Maluhy, and Bentley head of design collaborations Chris Cooke. On judging the interiors winners, Urquiola remarked \"we were all connected to interior design but with very different perspectives\". \"Yet, in the end, there was a shared sensitivity\", she continued, \"it confirmed that we are a community with diverse ways of exploring, driven by a shared vision, even where our approaches differ.\" Lee Broom discussing a design project with Pilar ZetaBritish industrial designer Tej Chauhan, who was part of the panel to decide the winners of the design categories, concurred. \"Evaluating the unique sensitivities of each was incredibly interesting,\" he said. \"While our perspectives differed at times, we all came to a joint decision on very deserving winners.\" \"A really enjoyable day of judging\" Chauhan continued, \"we had to wrap our minds around some exceptional projects across a wide range of sectors. It was a really enjoyable day of judging projects that ultimately left us feeling nourished and inspired.\" Deliberating alongside Chauhan to decide the winners of the design categories were Broom, Mabeo and Zeta and Parisian designer Inga Sempé. Botswana-based designer Peter Mabeo joined the design master jury panelHenrik Taudorf Lorensen, founder and CEO of Copenhagen-based furniture design studio Takt, and Malin Orebäck, design strategist and senior advisor at the Research Institutes of Sweden's (RISE) Circular Business Lab, were on the sustainability panel alongside Hasman and Desai. \"The imagination this year's entries embody is truly an inspiration,\" said Desai. \"It is exactly what we need to put our society back on a track to build a better world for us all.\" Dezeen Awards judge Alessio Nardi and Human Nature chief impact officer Joanna Yarrow, joined for dinnerFollowing the day of judging, an exclusive drinks reception and dinner took place on the night of the master jury day in the One Hundred Room at One Hundred Shoreditch, where the master jury was joined by the Dezeen Awards community including judges past and present.
