  "text": "Unexpected partnerships are reshaping the skyline, but Chelsea Football Club’s collaboration with Damac Properties takes the trend in a bold new direction. This upcoming Dubai development isn’t just another luxury tower—it’s the world’s first soccer-themed residential project, complete with a rooftop pitch for residents to enjoy the game above the city. Planned for Dubai’s Maritime City port area, this project will feature six striking towers, each soaring 130 meters (426 feet) high, according to the developer, though the latest renderings hint at four. Unlike other branded towers, these residences are designed to immerse fans and residents in Chelsea’s iconic blue, blending sports passion with high-end urban living. It’s a fresh fusion of athletic culture and architectural ambition, offering an experience you won’t find anywhere else. Designer: Chelsea Football Club x Damac Properties The development will feature 1,400 apartments, each offering one to three bedrooms and expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that frame impressive sea views. Developers describe the interiors as a blend of London’s refined elegance and Dubai’s lively, modern spirit, creating spaces that feel both sophisticated and vibrant. Each apartment is finished to a high standard, with sleek materials and contemporary design details throughout. Residents will also have access to a range of high-end amenities, ensuring comfort and convenience in every aspect of daily life. With its thoughtful design and premium features, this project offers a distinctive take on luxury urban living in Dubai. “Chelsea Residences also offers thoughtfully crafted health and fitness experiences rarely seen in residential developments,” said Damac Properties. “These include a cryotherapy center, forest relaxation pods, a Kneipp parkour therapy path, and a starlit wellness center. The project also features an infinity pool, aerial yoga studio, Chelsea Sports Bar, and even a powerhouse lounge – a resort-style mancave with live football screenings, boxing, darts, and more. Dining takes a wellness-first and experience-rich approach.” Chelsea F.C. branding will be a central feature of the development, with the club’s colors and logo integrated throughout the buildings and common areas. Residents will also enjoy exclusive access to events hosted by Chelsea F.C. “legends”—likely including appearances by former players and managers, which adds a unique, personal touch for fans. This project is an exciting targeted venture, appealing primarily to affluent supporters of Chelsea F.C. who are seeking a luxury lifestyle in Dubai. For those who fit this niche, apartments are set to begin at AED 2.17 million (approximately £445,000 or US$600,000). While a completion date has yet to be announced, the anticipation is already building. The developer Damac Properties is also known for collaborating with top architects, such as their work with Zaha Hadid Architects on Miami’s striking 8777 Collins Avenue. This experience further showcases the ambitious and high-profile nature of the Chelsea-branded Dubai towers.",
