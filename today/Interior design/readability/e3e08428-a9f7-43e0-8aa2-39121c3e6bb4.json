  "text": "A full ten years since its initial unveiling, London’s ambitious “super sewer” project has reached completion. This colossal endeavor, with a budget of £5 billion (approximately US$6.3 billion), is set to transform the way human waste is managed in the bustling British capital. Known as the Thames Tideway Tunnel, this engineering marvel seamlessly integrates with London’s pre-existing Victorian-era sewer system at 21 distinct locations, improving its capacity. Originally constructed 150 years ago, the old sewer infrastructure was designed to accommodate a population of up to four million people. But, over the years, the city’s population has more than doubled, placing a massive strain on the system. This overburdened network often resulted in the discharge of untreated human waste and stormwater runoff into the Thames, one of the region’s major rivers. The completion of the Thames Tideway Tunnel marks a critical step forward in addressing these environmental challenges, promising to significantly reduce pollution in the river and improve the overall sanitation and environmental health of London. Designer: Tideaway The “super sewer” stretches an impressive 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) in length, highlighting its vast scale and importance. At the heart of this monumental infrastructure is the main tunnel, boasting a diameter of 7.2 meters (23.7 feet), which is equivalent to the width of three iconic London double-decker buses placed side by side. In addition to the main tunnel, the project features connection tunnels with diameters of either 5 meters (16.4 feet) or 2 meters (6.6 feet), depending on their specific functions within the system. This network has an astounding capacity of 1.6 million cubic meters (roughly 56.5 million cubic feet), capable of managing an enormous volume of sewage. The construction of this ambitious project commenced in 2016, with work being carried out at 24 different sites across London. A key component of the construction involved the creation of over 20 deep shafts, some with widths rivaling that of the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral, scattered throughout the city. To accomplish the tunneling tasks, six powerful machines were employed. These machines were named after inspirational women from the local area, including figures such as women’s rights campaigners, a charitable doctor, and a female scientist. With the introduction of the new system, an impressive volume of sewage, equivalent to 2,200 Olympic-sized swimming pools, has so far been prevented from entering the river. The task is not yet complete, and the team remains vigilant, closely monitoring the system’s performance, especially during periods of heavy rainfall. “This is another significant step forward – with this final connection complete, the super sewer is fully up and running and protecting the Thames,” Tideway CEO Andy Mitchell said. “Our next step is to test it in storm conditions – which is why we are keeping a close eye on the weather – and we will do this over the coming months. We are at the start of a new chapter for London and its river. Our mission has always been about creating not just a tunnel, but a healthier, thriving environment for the river and its inhabitants. We look forward to seeing a real impact in the years to come and sharing everything we learn about the positive changes.”",
