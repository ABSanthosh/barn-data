Named CRW-001-1JR, it has an LCD screen and can display hours, minutes, seconds, and even dates, times of two different cities, and a stopwatch. The watch brand also adds a flashing light function, so when the user sets a time, they know it’s up when the display starts faintly pulsing. The arrival of the fully functional Casio smart watch ring is a precedent for its toy version in 2023. To top it off, it marks the 50th anniversary of the watch business. It’s a fun way to celebrate, and the watchmaker doubles down by crafting the watch ring from metal. They downsize one of their wristwatches to 1/10 of its original size and turn it into an accessory that can fit the user’s fingers.all images courtesy of CasioSize adjustment spaces to fit the watch around fingersSo far, the fully functional Casio watch ring is size 22, but the watchmaker adds size adjustment spacers. In the packaging, a size 19 and 16 spacers are included, which resemble silicone add-ons on the interior surface of the timepiece to make sure the accessory fits snugly around fingers. Casio describes their watch ring as having a complex shape, so to produce it in real life, they have to use the metalworking process called Metal Injection Molding. In this way, the case, back cover, and ring are molded as one piece. The watchmaker focuses on the details so that even the band holes are reproduced just like its wristwatch sibling. The LCD display is topped with glass, and because of the glass bonding technology Casio uses, the functional watch ring is waterproof and allows for easy battery replacement. The screen can also project up to six digits, which makes it handy when displaying two times from different cities. The fully functional Casio watch ring is scheduled to arrive in December 2024.Casio finally debuts a fully functional watch ring that fits around fingersnamed CRW-001-1JR, it has an LCD screen and can display time up to six digitsit also has a stopwatch featurethe timepiece comes with size adjustment spacers to make sure it fits around fingersview of the electronic components inside the timepiece",
