From terrazzo-inspired countertops to floor tiling, the kitchens featured in this lookbook go beyond traditional uses of the colour blue. Whether it's paired with gold accents, timber details or other colours, here are eight kitchens that redefine how shades of blue can be used to bring personality and character to the home. This is the latest in our lookbooks series, which provides visual inspiration from Dezeen's archive. For more inspiration, see previous lookbooks featuring earthy finishes, listening bars and bathrooms with sculptural stone sinks.
