This year I decided a word isn’t enough, I need an entire phrase. “A place for everything and everything in its place” is a very motivating and inspiring phrase for me right now! It’s not just motivating me to simplify or organize (although it certainly does that!) but to thoughtfully consider how each place in my home could be intentionally designed to contribute to a more peaceful rhythm and experience in my day.  An inspiring place to get dressed for the day. An peaceful spot to put on makeup. A lovely place for my jewelry.  On Sunday I repeated the phrase of the year as I began making some adjustments to the arrangement of our our bedroom, bathroom and closet. While I still have a ways to go to bring it all together together, without buying a single thing, I’ve already improved our bedroom and how I feel in it. I’m always delighted with how rewarding it is to slow down long enough to put your mind and heart into creating a sanctuary.
