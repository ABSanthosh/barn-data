The right textures, shapes, and materials can instantly make a space feel more intentional, stylish, and inviting. If you want to refresh your home, these simple yet impactful pieces can elevate any room. Textile Art Instead of traditional framed prints, try textile art. This could mean needlework art, a woven banket hung like a tapestry, garlands made of scrap fabric, tiny artistic rugs mounted on a wall, there are loads of possibilities! Adding some textile art to a wall of otherwise traditional prints or canvases helps break things up and adds a lot of visual interest. Be it neutral or bold, textiles bring a handmade, organic feel to a space. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / ShintarTatsiana Sculptural Vases A vase doesn’t have to hold flowers to make a statement. Sculptural vases, especially those with organic or asymmetrical shapes, add an artistic touch to any space. Ceramic, stone, porcelain, or glass options work beautifully on shelves, tables, and countertops. You definitely can put flowers or other plants in them, but don’t cover up the beauty of the vase itself. Keep it minimal. If you have a colorful glass piece, place it near some lighting so it can shine a bit of color throughout the room. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / willmilne Oversized Floor Mirrors A large mirror leaning against a wall can transform a space more than you might think. Like all mirrors, it makes a room feel bigger, adds depth, and reflects light in a way that makes everything look more open, but it being placed on the floor creates a chic and stylish feel (not to mention you can check your outfit even easier at that angle). Instead of a basic rectangular mirror, try one with a curved, textured, or raw-edged frame for a more designed look. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Decorative Bowls Though it seems like a basic item, a well-placed, artisan-crafted bowl can make a space feel instantly more styled. Large, shallow bowls in ceramic, wood, or stone work as centerpieces or as a way to organize smaller items without looking messy. Even empty, a unique bowl with a textured or natural finish adds character to a table or shelf. Like the vase, give the bowl room to breathe on its own first, then add things to it if you feel it needs it or it will help with organization. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Picsuite Statement Rugs A good rug can completely change the look and feel of a room. Instead of a plain or neutral one, try something with a vintage-inspired pattern, a geometric design, an unexpected color, a less traditional shape, or one that’s a piece of art all on its own. Rugs are often what ties a room together, so choosing one that stands out means it can serve as a centerpiece too. Get creative with it and don’t be afraid to go for something a little off the wall. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / iheartcreative High-End Coffee Table Books Books aren’t just for reading, they’re also a simple way to elevate a space. Large, visually striking books on design, art, or fashion add personality and sophistication to a well-crafted living room space. Stack a few on a coffee table, console, or even a windowsill to create an effortlessly styled vignette. Don’t just get one that you think looks nice, though. You still want these books to reflect your personality, so choose ones that pertain to your interests or that you’ll use for inspiration on your own time. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / vikialis Sometimes, the smallest decor choices have the biggest impact. Instead of relying on predictable decor, think about adding sculptural, textural, and high-end elements that instantly elevate your space. A well-placed mirror, a stack of design books, or a striking ceramic piece can transform a room without requiring a major overhaul. By choosing pieces that feel intentional and unique, your home will look more stylish, curated, and effortlessly put together.

Get creative with it and don’t be afraid to go for something a little off the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266905\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266905\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A colorful geometric rug beneath the feet of some chairs.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-240x180.jpg 240w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-820x615.jpg 820w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-2025-01-08-10-15-27-utc-14859-385x289.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266905\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/dining-room-chairs-on-a-colorful-geometric-pattern-HB29XVL\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / iheartcreative\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-start=\"1122\" data-end=\"1159\"\u003e\u003cstrong data-start=\"1126\" data-end=\"1157\"\u003eHigh-End Coffee Table Books\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"1161\" data-end=\"1540\"\u003eBooks aren’t just for reading, they’re also a simple way to elevate a space.
