Whether hosting a big family dinner or enjoying a cozy, intimate gathering, your dÃ©cor sets the tone for the celebration. From rustic charm to modern elegance, here are 15 Thanksgiving dÃ©cor ideas that inspire you to create a beautiful, welcoming space. Each idea comes with suggestions of where to shop for similar items, with links to some great stores offering seasonal dÃ©cor. These stores, including Amazon, Wayfair, CB2, and others, are perfect for finding everything you need to bring your Thanksgiving vision to life. 1. Rustic Fall Wreath for a Welcoming Entryway Source: Wayfair Nothing says “Welcome” like a beautiful wreath on the front door. Choose a more natural and rustic wreath of wheat, dried leaves, or pinecones to catch the feeling of fall.  To bring in just a little more light and warmth for autumn, throwing in small pumpkins, acorns, or cranberries will add warmth with flair. You can easily match the color scheme of your home or fit your style by making a wreath to suit.  For a home with neutral tones, consider a wreath with muted greens and soft oranges rather than one with bright, traditional colors. You might also be tempted to print your banner or monogram for extra individuality and uniqueness. Where To Shop: Check out Etsyâ€™s handmade wreaths for unique, artisanal options, or browse Wayfairâ€™s selection for a variety of autumn-inspired wreaths. 2. Thanksgiving-Themed Table Runner Source: Macy Add a Thanksgiving table runner to your dining room. Choose a runner with beautiful autumn colors such as burgundy, deep oranges, and mustard yellows. Look for a pattern with Thanksgiving symbols like leaves, turkeys, or pumpkins to add a festive touch. Opt for a runner in one deep color such as burnt orange or gold, making your dinnerware stand out and providing an air of sophistication. Aside from being a unique type of decoration, this specific element works to keep your table clean and free from stains or scratches during the feast. Layer the runner over a neutral or solid-colored tablecloth for an added touch of elegance. Where To Shop: At Weston Table, they have plenty of designs to take your fancy, or opt for an affordable yet fashionable alternative from Macy’s for all your Thanksgiving decorating needs. 3. Pumpkin Centerpieces with a Twist Source: Balsamhill Pumpkins are synonymous with Thanksgiving, but you can take this traditional symbol to new levels by painting or decorating them. If you want an elegant appearance that is a bit classier, paint pumpkins in silver, gold, or metallic copper and it turns your table into the set of Downtown Abbey. You can paint them to match or use glitter, lace appliques, and even stencils for a color that pops with your overall theme. Group several of these pumpkins to the center on a table in various sizes and colors especially other styles. Combine with little gourds, leaves, or candles for a more natural feel in the middle. It’s a great way to put a contemporary twist on traditional Thanksgiving dÃ©cor. Where To Shop: Balsam Hill offers stunning pumpkin dÃ©cor, or find a wide range of sizes and colors at Amazon. 4. Cozy Thanksgiving Napkins and Napkin Rings Source: Wood Tailors Club No Thanksgiving dinner table is complete without the right napkins. Whether you prefer festive Thanksgiving napkins featuring turkeys and autumn leaves or more elegant cloth napkins in deep fall hues, they add a thoughtful touch to your table setting.  Elevate the look today, and pair your napkins with a unique new kind of accessory, i.e. customized Wooden Napkin Rings. Yes, goldâ€“wood napkin rings can fit perfectly into the rustic or modern theme that you go with. If you prefer a more personalized touch, monogrammed cloth napkins are a perfect takeaway offering for your guests. You can even match the napkins to your table runner or centerpiece for a cohesive and polished look. Where To Shop: For gorgeously embroidered Thanksgiving napkin sets, head over to Coral \u0026 Tusk, and Weston Table for napkin rings. 5. Elegant Candle Holders for Warm Ambiance Source: Wayfair Candles bring warmth and beauty to any Thanksgiving table setting. Opt for tall and skinny candlesticks to give height (and drama) to your table with a more refined sensibility. Gather clusters of votive candles in glass holders or wooden lanterns to create a warm and intimate ambiance. Choose candles with cinnamon, pumpkin spice, or apple scents for a seasonal touch. Not only do candle holders serve as decorative pieces, but they also create a soothing ambiance, helping to set the mood for a memorable Thanksgiving dinner.
