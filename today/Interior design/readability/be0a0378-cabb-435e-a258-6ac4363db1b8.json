A light blue palette fills the 200-square-meter space, characterized by its white walls and tiled flooring. A whimsical circular pool filled with balls, sleek fitting rooms, and cozy seating areas that double as photo zones encourage the customers to capture moments of the store for their social media accounts. The showroom reflects the brand’s values of self-expression and individuality, designed to provide an immersive shopping experience.‘This project was a personal reception of the opposing emotions I’ve been feeling due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.’ explains Victoria Karieva, lead designer at Between the Walls.‘Through the concept of the interactive pool and playful design elements, we wanted to offer an escape—a place where people could experience joy, ease, and a sense of distraction, even if just for a short while.’all images by Dmytro Dychek and Pavlo Lutov, courtesy of Between the WallsOne by One showroom adDresses the emotional needs of visitorsKyiv-based studio Between the Walls invites visitors to feel transported away from the bustling city for a moment, introducing the central feature of the showroom, an interactive ball pit.
