Developed in Poland by Jetson One creator Tomasz Patan, this single-seat jet-powered flyer skips gimmicks and lands directly in the realm of raw mechanical design. It doesn’t mimic sci-fi. It strips the illusion away and builds a flying machine from reductionist logic. Designer: Tomasz Patan At first glance, it looks unfinished. A floating core with no wings, no propellers, and no excess surface. Just a dense structural pod that contains propulsion, balance control, and rider support. The undercarriage reads like a reinforced sketch. Angular struts act as landing gear, formed from what looks like bent composite tubing. There’s no visible suspension or modular attachment points. Everything serves weight, stability, and flight. The posture tells the rest of the story. The rider leans in, legs tight around the midframe, arms down and forward. It recalls a superbike in stance but floats instead of rolling. No enclosure surrounds the pilot. There’s no canopy or side fairings to interrupt the view. Every horizon remains visible. The 360-degree sightline is intentional, designed to orient the pilot in real time while preserving the sense of motion. At night, the design sharpens. Thin vertical light strips trace down the rear struts, glowing red like guide rails in motion. These aren’t for show. They assist tracking in flight footage and situational awareness for other observers. When parked, the bike stays low. There are no tall verticals or extended fins. It looks like it’s ready to launch again at any moment. In flight, it doesn’t hover like a drone. It punches into the air. Dust erupts from underneath, flung out by directional jet propulsion. There are no blades rotating at high speed. The lift and thrust come from an enclosed jet system that Volonaut has yet to fully detail. That absence of external rotors gives it a tactical advantage. It can thread through denser terrain, move closer to vertical surfaces, and operate with reduced safety buffer zones. A proprietary stabilization system runs the show in the background. Inputs are filtered and managed by the flight computer, allowing the rider to steer, bank, and hover with fewer corrections. The machine reads fast and reactive in test footage, more akin to a powered exoskeleton than an autonomous platform. The structure weighs a fraction of what you’d expect. According to Volonaut, it’s seven times lighter than a motorcycle. Carbon fiber forms the outer surfaces, while key structural elements are 3D printed. No fairings. No design bulk. It’s all driven by utility. That minimalism not only reduces mass but also exposes more airflow paths, keeping the system cooler and more stable under sustained thrust. There’s no seatback or cockpit interface. The rider wears a helmet with telemetry gear mounted on top. The head is the highest point. Everything else falls away into a clean center of gravity. There’s no tail to balance or front fairing to catch drag. It’s symmetrical in function, not in form. This isn’t a future concept dressed up in renderings. It’s flying now. Video clips from test runs show the Airbike moving across forest ridgelines and dry lakebeds, lifting and landing without assistance. Unlike the many vaporware prototypes of the last decade, this machine doesn’t talk about possibility. It shows it. Jet. Frame. Pilot. The rest is vapor and terrain.",
