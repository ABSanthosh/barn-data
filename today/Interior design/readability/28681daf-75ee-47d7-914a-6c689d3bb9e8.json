  "text": "When Alfa Romeo got the call to create a showstopper for Expo 67, they didn’t panic at the nine-month deadline – they just dialed up Marcello Gandini and told him to work his magic. The resulting Montreal concept became the stuff of legend: those seductive louvered headlight covers, the sci-fi C-pillar vents, and a silhouette that made other sports cars look instantly outdated. When it finally hit production in 1970, Alfa added a race-derived 2.6L V8 that transformed this beauty queen into a legitimate performer. This LEGO Ideas submission nails what makes the Montreal special. The builder clearly gets it – capturing those impossible proportions and distinctive details that separate this car from the usual suspects in the classic sports car world. The yellow brick work is particularly inspired, channeling that perfect 70s Italian optimism that makes you want to throw on some aviators and blast through the Alps. Designer: Musstrafaccatrator The color choice is a true chef’s kiss, channeling the fun, energetic vibe that Gandini brought to the Miura too. That vibrant yellow captures the Montreal’s space-age personality perfectly, making it pop in a way that the more common darker colors never could. Even the license plate feels period-correct, like something you’d spot on a preserved example at Villa d’Este. I count roughly 1,400 pieces based on the complexity, putting it right in that sweet spot between casual weekend build and serious collector’s piece. The way this is built is quite different from how LEGO usually builds out its cars. Most cars fall under LEGO’s Technic line, which involves a lot of bespoke parts that impart a distinct Technic ‘vibe’ to the build. Designer Musstrafaccatrator goes down a different route, only using existing pieces. Is it ideal? Not to LEGO, but it’s definitely creative, showing how the designer works around constraints to maintain a distinct aesthetic. Rather than fighting against the brick system, they’ve embraced it, using the medium’s geometric nature to enhance the Montreal’s sharp lines and distinctive profile. From the side, this build truly captures the Montreal’s distinctive silhouette – that perfect balance between aggression and elegance that defined Gandini’s best work. The long hood flows into a rakish windshield, while the rear quarter features those signature C-pillar vents that give the car its unmistakable profile. Notice how the builder has managed to recreate the Montreal’s subtle haunches over the rear wheels using clever brick placement. Even the slight upward kick of the rear deck is faithfully reproduced, creating that tension in the design that makes the original car so visually dynamic. Look at those opening doors! The functional hood! That surprisingly accurate interior! This MOC has all the features you’d expect from a premium LEGO Icons set. Pop open the hood and you’ll see a V8 underneath. The designer even built a working steering to give the MOC a little more fun than your average static model. The boot opens too, revealing spacious storage for your luggage as you cruise down the streets of Milan. “I think this car would be a great addition to the Lego Icons car series,” LEGO builder Musstrafaccatrator says. The MOC (My Own Creation) currently has over 1,000 votes on the LEGO Ideas forum, but it has ways to go if it has to hit the 10k vote mark in order to be considered by LEGO to be turned into a box set. If you’re a car-lover, a Gandini fanboy, or just another LEGO enthusiast who loves a good build, go ahead and cast your vote for the Alfa Romeo Montreal on the LEGO Ideas website!",
