Like chameleons, we seamlessly shift to meet the needs of every project, yet always with the intention of crafting interiors that are deeply personal and distinct. Whether working with existing collections or building from the ground up, our design philosophy is rooted in balance: a harmony between past and present, curated precision and expressive creativity. Here are our tops tips for re-creating this look at home. Rugs as the Foundation. Think of rugs as more than floor coverings—they’re artwork that grounds the room. Investing in a statement rug provides both a visual anchor and a layer of texture, elevating the entire room. Rethink Traditional Material Use. Break away from the expected. Try timber on ceilings or walls, or use tiles outside of the kitchen or bathroom. These unconventional applications bring depth and tactile interest to a room. Contrast in Colour and Tone. Play with contrast. Juxtaposing light against dark, or muted tones against bold accents, creates energy or calm within a room. Whether subtle or striking, the interplay of colour can transform not only the room’s mood but also how people feel within it. Allow the Room to Breathe. Don’t underestimate the power of negative space. Allowing room for a design to breathe enhances each element, making the room feel lighter and more intentional. Layer with History. Incorporating our client’s existing collections into new designs creates an interior that feels lived-in and authentic. It’s more eclectic, less wasteful, and results in a home rich with stories and history. Extend the Home Outdoors. The outdoors is no longer an afterthought—it’s an extension of your living. With so many thoughtfully designed outdoor products available, embrace the opportunity to create a seamless flow between inside and out.
