  "text": "Claire Hickey and Daniel Oliver moved to the Northern Rivers ‘on a whim’ in 2017. They quickly fell in love with the NSW region’s small town charm (complete with Saturday morning produce markets, an annual billycart derby, and Christmas fair!) and decided to establish their lives in the area, purchasing a 1920s Bangalow cottage. Already with one child, Claire and Daniel just needed to rework the house to suit young family life and feel more ‘them.’ ‘Although some not so great renovations had previously been done on the house, she still held her original charm,’ says Claire. ‘My hope for our home was to create a space that felt warm and inviting.’ Renovations focused on both reinstating original home features lost in previous updates, as well as modernising the kitchen and bathrooms to Claire and Daniel’s taste. They didn’t have the budget for a fully architect-managed project, but were able to engage Those Architects for the initial design phase. ‘I would definitely do an architect-managed build next time!’ says Claire. The original exterior weatherboards (painted Dulux Berkshire White) and 100-year-old blackbutt flooring now look at home again alongside an extended verandah and timber windows. Claire explains, ‘Sadly the previous owners had ripped out all the old original windows and doors and put in some pretty ghastly aluminium ones.’ The new kitchen created with cabinetmaker Martin Johnson replaces the previously all-white scheme, with warm timber joinery and inviting curves. Redoing the landscaping was also a big element of the renovation for Claire, Daniel and their children River (9) and Anouk (5) who love spending time outdoors. ‘River, our son, is always kicking a ball in the garden, or our daughter Anouk is building a little fairy house somewhere in a flower patch, so I really think the layout of our home is focused on this aspect of our lives,’ says Claire. Record breaking rainfall saw delays and red mud trudged through the house for months on end during the building works, but the addition of a pool and levels on the sloping site has transformed the usability of the entire home. ‘All the rooms open out from french doors into the garden now, allowing us to always have easy access to our favourite area,’ says Claire. Altogether, the family home is airy, light and happy, balancing Claire’s more eclectic taste with Daniel’s fondness for minimalism. ‘I feel we have combined both our wants for our space into something we both love and are proud of,’ says Claire. ‘All my most cherished memories are within these walls.’",
