Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio proved, as a safety warning, that you can use a pair of Meta's Ray-Ban 2 sunglasses to instantly access the personal data of anyone you see.

They call the project I-XRAY.As a frightening example from the demonstration, they encounter a young woman they don't know, and instantly have her home address and her parents' names.
