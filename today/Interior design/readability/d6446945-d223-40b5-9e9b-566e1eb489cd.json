However, the right plants can help shape the feel of a room entirely, with some fitting into certain styles better than others. For example, if you’re looking to the summer ahead or shivering in the winter cold and wishing you could go on a tropical retreat, these plants will help you get there, turning your home into an indoor oasis. Bird’s Nest Fern This fern is nothing like the delicate, feathery types you’re used to. It has bold, wavy leaves that look almost sculptural. Unlike other ferns, it doesn’t need constant misting, making it a great choice for people who love greenery but don’t want high-maintenance plants. It thrives in indirect light and adapts well to different humidity levels. Place it on a shelf or in a hanging planter to let its leaves drape beautifully.

Its broad leaves create a lush, full look, making it an instant statement piece. This plant is also known for something rare, it moves! Its leaves shift throughout the day, following the light as it moves. It thrives in low to medium light and prefers consistent moisture, making it a great fit for bedrooms or living spaces where direct sunlight isn’t always available. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Monstera Adansonii This plant, sometimes called the “Swiss cheese vine,” has eye-catching leaves with natural holes that give it a wild, jungle-like appearance. It grows quickly and can climb or trail, depending on how you train it. Unlike its larger cousin, the Monstera Deliciosa, this one is much smaller, making it a great fit for smaller spaces (or for anyone who doesn’t want a giant plant). It thrives in moderate light and doesn’t need constant watering, making it easy to care for. Hanging it in a planter or placing it on a shelf lets its vines spill over for a dramatic effect. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / ellinnur String of Dolphins If you want something completely different, the String of Dolphins is a great choice. Its trailing vines are covered in plump, springy leaves that truly do resemble tiny jumping dolphins. It’s a rare plant that adds an unexpected, whimsical touch to any space. It thrives in bright, indirect light and needs minimal watering, making it an easy, low-maintenance option. Because it grows in long, trailing strands, it looks best in a hanging planter or placed on a high shelf where its vines can cascade down. It adds a fun, coastal feel to a space, even if you live miles from the ocean! Photo Credit: Canva Pro Rattlesnake Plant The rattlesnake plant stands out with its long, wavy leaves covered in bold patterns of deep green and purple, and burgundy underneath. Like the Calathea, it moves throughout the day, responding to light as it travels. It thrives in low-light conditions, making it ideal for rooms that don’t get much direct sunlight. The Rattlesnake Plant brings a lot of both texture and color to a space, making it a great choice for those who want something that’s vibrant year-round and a great addition to any decor set. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Staghorn Fern The Staghorn Fern is unlike any other plant. Instead of sitting in a pot, it thrives when mounted on a wall, looking more like an art piece than a traditional houseplant. Its fronds often resemble antlers in their shape, giving it a dramatic, sculptural look. It doesn’t need soil and absorbs moisture from the air, making it surprisingly easy to care for. Staghorn ferns adds a bold, natural element to your wall decor, fitting right in among a gallery of photos or on its own as a standout piece. Photo Credit: Pinterest Turning your home into an indoor oasis doesn’t mean filling it with just any plants. Choosing unique, visually interesting, and easy-to-care-for varieties will transform your space into something truly special. With the right mix, your home can feel like a personal sanctuary, lush, calming, and full of life.
