  "description": "A company called FlyFrames makes sunglasses with no arms, or temples, as they're formally called. To seat the glasses on your face, they've gone back into the past to the pince-nez design, which essentially puts a butterfly clamp between the lenses. The company claims they're comfortable to wear for long periods, won't fall off even if you have oily skin or a small nose, and that they'll stay in place \"even during intense activities like tennis.\"That said, I believe the design will induce a UX hassle: Constantly smudged lenses. Maybe I'm clumsy, but I don't think I could grasp that clamp without bumping my fingertips into the lenses. One of my ongoing hassles is ridding my reading glasses of smudges from fingertip oil.The glasses run $154, and the company says they're also working on a prescription version.",
