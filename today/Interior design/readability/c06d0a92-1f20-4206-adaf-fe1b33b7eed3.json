  "description": "When interior designer Andrew Waller first came across this 1930s Sydney apartment, it was un-renovated, with beautiful high ceilings, a ’90s laminate kitchen and orange-stained floorboards. But since he moved in about six years ago, Andrew has brought a calming, muted colour palette and a collection of space-saving custom furniture to transform the heritage home.",

  "text": "For interior designer Andrew Waller, getting to renovate this Woollahra apartment for himself was a welcome departure from his client work. ‘Without a formal client brief or deadlines, I enjoyed a different approach to the design, with a freedom that allowed it to evolve organically over time,’ the founder and designer behind Mr Waller says. Built in the 1930s, the two-bedroom home within the interwar complex was exactly the kind of project Andrew was looking for: mostly original, with treetop views, beautiful high ceilings, period cornices, and full of potential. So after moving in mid-2019, he got to work reconfiguring the original floor plan to improve spatial flow and maximise natural light. A series of structural interventions made way for a new fluid, L-shaped living zone, while the kitchen was designed to feel more like a ‘second living space’ with freestanding joinery. A custom-designed banquette lounge was created opposite for more casual seating with a round table in-front, giving Andrew an additional place to work with his laptop on hand. These bespoke and built-in pieces also helped maximise space inside the 79-square-metre abode. ‘Importance was placed on more “open” spaces,’ he adds. ‘Due to the nature of my work, I wanted more structured clarity at home. A calming relaxed materials palette which wouldn’t overstimulate.’ ‘In the bathroom, a playful nod to old gym changing rooms is evident in the oversized shower cubicle, terrazzo floor, subway tiles and vertical storage cabinets — a contemporary take on utilitarian elegance.’ He also drew from modernism and the considered aesthetics of Japanese design to curate the clean, pared-back interiors. Original heritage elements like refinished cypress pine floors and picture rails are now refreshed in ‘restrained’ hues like chalky whites, muted greys, nude tones and soft oak, punctuated by black detailing and a captivating charcoal artwork by Craig Ruddy. The finished apartment not only serves as a functional sanctuary for Andrew’s life, but as a an experimental zone for his work, where he often tests out different spatial ideas. ‘The space has continually shifted as I’ve lived in it, shaped as much by instinct and exploration, as by intention,’ he says.
