  "description": "It was only a matter of time before the revival of western flair — seen foremost in the rise of country music and cowboy boots — made its way into interiors. Enter, California ranch style. Combining the unlikely pairing of mid-century modernism and ornate detailing, this easy-going style soaks up a sun-kissed palette and effortlessly mixes vintage finds with modern pieces, and of course, plenty of texture. Discover how to get this modern, laid-back look at home with pieces from our Design Directory.",
