  "description": "This peculiar tool may not make sense to a tradesperson who always has a cordless tool on their hip. The Trio, by Japanese hand tool manufacturer Star-M, is an unpowered object with three functions: It can pre-drill holes, drive a screw, and install hooks. The tool caught my eye because I live on a rural property. Sheds and outbuildings often need plenty of hooks and screws for hanging things, and for small jobs, it'd be easier to have one of these handy than even a cordless drill. It comes in two sizes: An \"S\" for #1 screws and an \"M\" for #2 screws. Anything bigger than that, yeah, you're trekking back to the house for the drill.",
