You know the images and magazine covers that are filled with dried hydrangeas, baskets of mums and pumpkins everywhere. While these images are beautiful and evoke the fall feeling we all love, the abundance can be over the top and too much work or expense to attain the look ourselves. Over the last few years, I have taken a step away from too much, except maybe throw pillows on my sofa. :-) (I like the cozy snuggly appeal they add.) I have given most of the bins stored in my attic that were filled with fall themed decor to thrift store. Do you know what? I don’t miss any of it. That is not to say, I don’t love fall and want to make my house comfy-cozy for the season. I have just learned to edit, edit and edit more until I was left with only the things I truly love and nothing else.  I was reminded of using blue again for fall when I found this set of dishtowels while waiting in the line at HomeGoods. Not only did the colors sing to me, but the textured leaves on the cloths had me doing a happy dance in the line. Before coming across the dishtowels I wasn’t feeling very inspired on how to decorate my living room or any room in my house for the season. Driving home from the store, my mind went into fall decorating mode. Once I got home, I started searching for stuff I already owned to see what would fulfill my fall vision for my living room. While searching I knew I wanted to keep the decor simple, but feel cozy at the same time. I wanted a place to get under a fur throw and snuggle with a good book or while watching a movie. I like to keep abreast of decor trends. Right now dark and moody is popular. For me, it is nice to look at in a decorating magazine or on blogs, but I could never live in a room with dark moody colors on all the walls. I found what I could live with was dark color decor accents against the white walls and sofa. And that is what I did, I added darker moody color accents for fall. I had the large area rug stored in my attic decor stash since the spring and brought it back out for the fall and winter to visually warm up the room. I have been on a search to find just the right art to hang above the mantel, but so far I haven’t found the right piece. So just like I did in the summer when I painted my own summer art over an art canvas I already owned, I DIY’ed another one for fall. I don’t strive to be a fine artist, but until I find the right piece of art to hang, I am having fun painting over the canvases I have and no longer use. For this one I painted over 2 smaller canvases that I had painted in an abstract way a few years ago. The canvases are now filled with yellow flowers made with simple brush strokes on a blue background to fit my vision for the room. I didn’t want a landscape, anything traditional or fall theme related. I painted the flowers so when I placed the side of the canvases next to each other on the mantel, the flower petals would continue like it was one canvas. I bought the green velvet pillow covers to add a little lux to the mix. I made the leopard pillow cover back in 2015 and have kept it since it is a classic print and can be used with many color schemes. In the summer months I move the sofa in front of the fireplace when we don’t use it. The two recliners go on the main wall so we can view the lake. I am not ready to make the seating switch in the room yet. When I do, I will remove the white panels covering the fireplace. Seeing the fireplace filled with stacked wood again will add to the fall vibe I am creating in the room. On the main wall with mirrors that reflect the lake, I kept the branches in the black planter and hot glued faux fall leaves to the branches to add a bit of fall color. I found the little blue vase at my local furniture store. On the console table seeing a touch of blue helps to create color balance in the room. Now I am looking forward to the first fall chill when I can enjoy a hot cup of tea or coffee all snuggled up with my favorite faux fur throw all alone or with fall loving family and friends. Have you started to decorate any of the rooms in your home yet for fall? What colors are you using, classic fall colors or are you going to use a unique to your style color scheme? Post navigation",
