It closes again when the driver sits.It might seem silly or frivolous, but the company points out a potentially massive time-savings. \"One thing is particularly important in the courier and parcel service industry: Saving time. Time is money and therefors a major competitive advantage.\"This automation will save around 10 seconds at each delivery stop, which will result in a daily volume of 200 stops. Gain 30 minutes of time.\"",
