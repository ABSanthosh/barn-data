Heritage textiles refer to textiles that are deeply rooted in the cultural and historical traditions of a particular region or community. They are often associated with traditional craftsmanship, techniques, and designs that have been passed down through generations. Heritage textiles can include a wide range of fabrics and materials such as handwoven textiles, embroideries, tapestries, and garments. These textiles are typically produced using traditional methods that involve manual labor and craftsmanship, rather than industrial production processes. They often incorporate unique weaving patterns, dyeing techniques, and intricate embellishments that are specific to the cultural or ethnic group creating them. Photo: Holly Becker Heritage textiles may also carry symbolic meanings or represent important aspects of a community's identity, history, or religious and ceremonial practices.Preserving and promoting heritage textiles is essential for safeguarding cultural heritage and supporting local communities. Many organizations and artisans are working to document, revive, and sustain traditional textile practices, ensuring their continuation for future generations. These textiles are valued not only for their aesthetic appeal but also for their cultural significance and the stories they tell about a community's past. So what then, is Heritage Style when it comes to interior design?Heritage decor style, also known as heritage interior design or traditional decor style, refers to an interior design approach that draws inspiration from the past and embraces historical elements, craftsmanship, and traditional aesthetics. It seeks to create a sense of timeless elegance and sophistication while honoring the heritage and cultural roots of a particular region or era. Heritage decor style seeks to create an atmosphere of timeless beauty and pays homage to the cultural heritage and design traditions of the past. It is a style that exudes elegance, craftsmanship, and a sense of history. To illustrate further, one only needs to pick up one of my favorite new books by British Stylist Selina Lake (published by Ryland, Peters and Small) called “Heritage Style” where her best ideas around period decor is wrapped into one gorgeously styled and photographed volume. It celebrates what she calls the, “new nostalgic mood” in interiors, where she displays a bevy of homes (which she styled) decorated with vintage and inherited furniture and other accessories alongside of modern, new pieces and teaches you how to achieve the look. The results can be a very personal and stylish home that you’ll love for years to come.Since I live in a historical property, I enjoyed reading this book very much and even picked up a few tips I’d not thought of before (just when you think you know it all, you realize there is so much left to discover!). Selina allowed me to pick the photos from the book that I’d like to share here which were styled by her, which photography by Rachel Whiting. Have a look at this lovely book and be sure to pick up HERITAGE STYLE if interiors that take inspiration from the past and embrace historical elements, craftsmanship, and traditional aesthetics sounds like your vibe, too.(Photography: With permission from Ryland, Peters and Small by Rachel Whiting) Holly Becker Holly Becker is the Founder and Author of design and lifestyle site, decor8.
