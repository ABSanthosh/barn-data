  "text": "Despite its modest length of 5.2 meters (17 feet), the Beau River Tiny House is expertly designed to maximize sleeping accommodations. This compact model features an “upside-down” layout, allowing it to sleep up to six people, albeit snugly. Designed by Havenwood Tiny Homes in Australia, who also developed the Joely, the Beau River Tiny House is built on a double-axle trailer. It boasts a metal exterior with wooden accents and receives power via a standard RV-style hookup. Although smaller than European models like the Cardabelle, it is certainly not the smallest tiny house we’ve encountered. Designer: Havenwood Tiny Homes As anticipated, the home’s interior is quite compact and efficiently designed. Entry is through sliding glass doors, and to the right is the living room. This area is elevated and accessible via a few steps. It provides room for a sofa and features a large window that beautifully frames the outside view. Adjacent to the living room is the kitchen, which is simple yet functional. It includes a sink, a two-burner propane-powered stove, and cabinetry for storage. The bathroom is located at the opposite end of the home from the living room. It consists of a toilet and a shower; however, it’s unclear if a sink is included in the bathroom setup. How does the Beau River Tiny House accommodate six people? The clever design provides multiple sleeping arrangements to maximize space. In the living room, substituting the usual sofa with a sofa bed introduces additional sleeping capacity. Directly beneath the living room is a cleverly concealed bedroom featuring a low ceiling and a double bed. This space-efficient design element adds to the sleeping possibilities. The house includes a more conventional loft bedroom, accessible by a ladder, which comfortably sleeps two more people. Although fitting six people would make for a snug environment, it’s unlikely that the designer intended for a family of six to reside in the house full-time. Instead, the space is probably best suited for use as a vacation getaway or a weekend retreat, offering a cozy and intimate setting for short stays. The design’s emphasis on multifunctionality and efficient use of space makes it ideal for temporary accommodations, allowing occupants to enjoy the charm of tiny house living without the long-term commitment. The home is tiny but quite mighty, accommodating six people comfortably for some time, if not full-time. The house is currently priced at roughly US$63,000, making it a viable option for small families that are seeking holiday homes. The “upside-down” interior layout gives the home a unique element, allowing it to stand out from other tiny homes on the market.",
