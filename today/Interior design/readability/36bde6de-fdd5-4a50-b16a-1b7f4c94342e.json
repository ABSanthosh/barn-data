  "description": "Anna Mansfield describes her home as the ‘perfect art deco apartment’ (and we’d have to agree) complete with charming original features, great floorboards, and one seriously spectacular view. She’s hosted numerous friends in the surprisingly spacious Potts Point apartment, which looks out to a jacaranda tree, before the Botanic Gardens and iconic Sydney Harbour beyond.",

  "text": "Anna Mansfield, founder and director of communications agency Leisure Practice, wouldn’t want to live anywhere other than her Potts Point apartment. Located in a 1927 art deco building, the apartment has beautiful original features, and incredible views of Sydney Harbour. Anna has lived here since 2019, not quite believing her luck when her rental application was successful. ‘I turned up to the inspection and there were a million people trawling through it, so I never actually expected to get it,’ she says. ‘The location in a very quiet, leafy cul-de-sac, and the view overlooking a park directly across to the city was a real showstopper when I first walked in the door… [‘It was] the best rental blank canvas I could’ve ever imagined for me to make my home.’ This apartment marks Anna’s first time living solo, and she’s relished the opportunity to make the space her own, with sentimental furniture (including the dining table passed down from her family) and a growing collection of works by local artists. ‘People always walk in and say it just feels like me. I love that,’ Anna says. ‘The big Sally Anderson painting I bought for myself when I made a significant life decision. When I look at it, I’ll always be reminded of that choice, which I love.’ Anna’s art collection injects colour and character into the space, against an otherwise neutral palette of white walls, timber accents, and earthy-toned rugs. ‘I like colour, but I also want my space to feel calm and be a haven to return to, which is why my furniture and rugs are predominantly pared back and neutral,’ Anna explains. The ‘feel’ of her home is very important for Anna, as she loves to host friends in the space. ‘I’m a big acts of service person, which mainly translates to feeding people!’ she says. ‘My fridge and pantry are always stocked with delicious things for a snack plate, or to pull a full meal out of the bag at the last minute. So, I’d say the atmosphere is always a welcoming and hospitable one.’ No doubt her visitors are also struck by the apartment’s breathtaking views that capture the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. There’s an even more expansive view from the building’s rooftop, where Anna heads whenever she needs a moment of calm, but her favourite spot is the kitchen, overlooking a jacaranda tree outside in full bloom. ‘I love nothing more than cooking dinner with the kitchen window open as the sun is setting and looking out over that,’ she says. ‘I would happily spend all day in my kitchen, cooking away at any time of year!’",
