  "text": "Nestled within the dramatic landscape of the Greek islands, a bold new architectural project is taking shape, crafted by Mykonos Architects. Known as N’arrow House, this unique wedge-shaped residence is being built into a hillside in Crete, designed to integrate harmoniously with its rugged surroundings while reimagining traditional Mediterranean architecture. Currently under construction with completion expected between 2025 and 2027, the project is a collaborative effort led by architects Aude Mazelin, Nikolas Alysandratos, and Xara Karatzali. N’arrow House is characterized by its minimalist design approach and strong environmental focus, artfully combining concrete and stone to create a seamless interplay between modern geometry and the island’s natural geology. Designer: Mykonos Architects N’arrow House derives its name from its unique shape – a long, tapering structure that comes to a precise point, evoking the image of an arrow lodged in the earth. This intentional, directional design imparts a sense of movement to the residence, drawing the viewer’s gaze along the horizon and through the home’s interior spaces. Partially embedded within the hillside, the design nods to the ancient cave dwellings found throughout Greece, yet reinterprets them with a contemporary, angular aesthetic. Constructed from exposed concrete, steel framing, and expansive floor-to-ceiling glass panels, the home’s materials create a bold contrast with the surrounding landscape, yet are thoughtfully integrated to respect the natural terrain. The semi-subterranean layout offers an eco-friendly response to Crete’s warm Mediterranean climate, as being partially underground helps regulate interior temperatures and minimizes the need for artificial cooling, blending innovative design with sustainability. Inside, the layout follows the home’s elongated, linear shape, fostering a seamless flow from one space to the next. While specific interior details have yet to be revealed, the architects hint at a minimalist yet inviting aesthetic, likely featuring custom lighting, rich textures, and sleek furnishings that reflect the residence’s angular geometry. One of the most fascinating elements of the design is the dramatic infinity pool, which extends boldly from the pointed end of the house, reminiscent of a spear’s tip. Suspended above the landscape, the pool provides breathtaking, unobstructed vistas of the valley and sea beyond, serving as a stunning focal point for the property. While praised for its design and landscape integration, the project also raises environmental concerns due to its use of concrete and the associated embodied carbon. Balancing luxury with sustainability remains a challenge. But the house’s partial subterranean placement offers passive cooling and reduces its visual impact, addressing some environmental issues. The design reflects a growing architectural trend of working with existing terrain rather than altering it extensively. For Mykonos Architects, known for their expertise in architecture, interiors, and lighting, N’arrow House is both a technical and creative milestone. Upon completion, it is expected to serve as a reference for how contemporary architecture can harmonize with historic and natural settings.",
