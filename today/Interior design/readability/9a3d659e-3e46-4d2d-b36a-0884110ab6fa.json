  "text": "The Elouera tiny house, measuring 9 meters (nearly 30 feet) in length, features a spacious covered porch that promotes indoor/outdoor living, making it ideal for a small family on the move. It boasts a bright, open interior design and operates off the grid using solar power. Designed by Australia’s Tiny Solar Homes, the Elouera is built on a triple-axle trailer with an aluminum frame and exterior, ensuring durability. Designer: Tiny Solar Homes Access to the home is provided through an optional outdoor porch, which enhances the living space. The sliding glass doors seamlessly connect the interior with the outdoors, allowing for an open, airy atmosphere. The living room is designed to be light-filled, thanks to its ample glazing and high ceiling. It features a sofa bed that can accommodate two people, along with built-in wall speakers that are part of a surround sound system, and a TV for entertainment. Adjacent to the living area is the well-appointed kitchen. This space is thoughtfully designed with stone countertops and includes a breakfast bar that seats two. The kitchen is equipped with an oven, a four-burner propane stove, and a fridge/freezer. It also houses a small dishwasher and an integrated air-conditioning unit, ensuring comfort and convenience for residents. The Elouera’s bathroom is well-equipped with a vanity sink, a shower, and a standard flushing toilet. For those interested in eco-friendly options, the toilet can be upgraded to either a composting toilet or an incinerating toilet for an additional cost. The bathroom also serves as a washroom, featuring a convenient washer/dryer unit. To enhance ventilation and maintain a fresh atmosphere, louver-style windows are installed. The Elouera contains two bedrooms, both designed as loft-style spaces with low ceilings that add a cozy touch. These lofts are accessible via a staircase that cleverly incorporates storage, providing practicality without sacrificing space. The staircase leads to a hallway, with each bedroom situated on opposite ends of the tiny house, ensuring privacy. Despite their compact size, each bedroom is adequately spacious to accommodate a queen-sized bed, offering a comfortable sleeping area for residents. As previously noted, the Elouera tiny house derives its power from an array of solar panels mounted on the roof. This solar setup is connected to an inverter and a battery storage system, ensuring that the home remains powered even during nighttime or adverse weather conditions. The system can also be upgraded with additional batteries. The Elouera also offers customization options to better suit the needs and preferences of its occupants. Prospective buyers can add another bedroom or choose from a selection of different materials available. Currently, there is no available information regarding the price of the tiny home.",
