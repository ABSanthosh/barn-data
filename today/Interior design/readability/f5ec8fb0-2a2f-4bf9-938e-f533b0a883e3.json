  "text": "Watch faces deserve their own design thesis. There are so many ways of going about a watch face that I could probably write a series of books on them. You’ve got luxury-driven designs, functionality-driven designs, art-driven, minimalism-driven, material-driven. Every single approach results in a watch face that’s unique and is directly inspired by the visions of the person who created them. The Azazel (at least to me), feels like a gorgeous minimalist reinterpretation of crop circles, but for designer Danilo Villanueva, it’s a display of restraint – something only a few minimalist designers do well. Danilo Villanueva’s creation is what happens when you strip watchmaking down to its bare essentials, then rebuild it with an architect’s eye. The Azazel (named after a fallen angel, which feels appropriately rebellious) rejects conventional watch wisdom with almost defiant confidence. Designer: Danilo Villanueva for Makina Watches The first thing that strikes you is what isn’t there. The dial exists as negative space – a void punctuated only by two needle-like hands and twelve understated hour markers. No date window. No subdials. No brand name plastered across the face. The absence of these elements creates a visual tension that draws you in rather than pushing information at you. At 38mm in diameter with a 11.55mm thickness, the Azazel hits the contemporary sweet spot – substantial enough to make a statement without dominating smaller wrists. The 316L stainless steel case features an architectural quality rarely seen at this price point (hovering around $650, depending on the variant). The lugs deserve special mention – they’re integrated into the case with a geometric precision that would make Bauhaus designers nod in approval. This isn’t accidental; Villanueva’s background in architecture informs every angle of the Azazel. The 20mm lug width accepts standard straps, though swapping out the included leather feels almost sacrilegious given how perfectly it complements the case. What fascinates me technically is Villanueva’s decision to power this minimalist marvel with the Miyota 9039 movement. With a 42-hour power reserve and reliable 28,800 bph beat rate, it’s a workhorse caliber that doesn’t require constant attention. The movement choice reflects the watch’s philosophy: sophisticated functionality without unnecessary flourishes. The sapphire crystal features an anti-reflective coating, ensuring the minimalist dial remains legible in varied lighting conditions. The exhibition caseback reveals the movement – a conventional choice that feels refreshingly honest in a watch that otherwise breaks conventions. Water resistance is rated at 100 meters – adequate for everyday wear but not suitable for serious aquatic adventures. This limitation feels appropriate; the Azazel belongs in environments where its design can be appreciated, not hidden beneath waves. Makina remains a relatively obscure brand outside horological circles, which adds to the appeal. Wearing an Azazel signals membership in a quiet club of design enthusiasts who value thoughtful execution over heritage marketing. The Azazel represents watchmaking at its most essential – time-telling distilled to its purest form, then elevated through meticulous design This approach reminds me of Dieter Rams’ famous principle: “Good design is as little design as possible.” Villanueva seems to have internalized this, creating a timepiece that doesn’t scream for attention but rather rewards those who take the time to notice its clever use of (and sometimes lack of) elements.",
