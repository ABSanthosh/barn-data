Over the past years, the designer and Italian furniture manufacturer have developed numerous collections for hospitality, workspaces, outdoor, and residential environments. During Orgatec 2024, Plural Soft, an extension of their previous collaboration first introduced in 2014, and functional side table Diego, were revealed. In an exclusive interview with designboom, Jorge Pensi reveals insights into the development of these pieces and their impact on modern public spaces.‘Plural was our third project with Pedrali, following Ypsilon and Ara. From the first moment we began to work together, the design and development of all the products was an enriching and gratifying experience. Plural appeared as a joint challenge: to develop a new product for a new market segment for Pedrali,’ begins Jorge Pensi.(above) Pedrali reveals Jorge Pensi’s Plural Soft seating system during Orgatec 2024 | image © Omar Sartor, art direction Studio FM Milano; set design \u0026 styling Studio Salaris(banner) together with Plural Soft, the launch of the designer’s Diego side table completed the setting | image © Omar Sartor, art direction Studio FM Milano; set design \u0026 styling Studio Salarisall images courtesy of Pedrali THE EVOLUTION OF PLURAL INTO PLURAL SOFT  The decision to revisit the original Plural seating system, developed in collaboration with Pedrali in 2014, was driven by Jorge Pensi’s desire to offer a warmer, more colorful option. Known as an established Italian manufacturer of contemporary design furniture, Pedrali supported the designer’s vision, building upon the foundation to adapt the seating solution with refined upholstery. The integration of textiles not only elevates the aesthetic appeal but also adds warmth and comfort, making it ideal for waiting rooms, lounges, and collaborative spaces.‘We feel fortunate that fabric producing companies are constantly researching new materials that can withstand intense users traffic. The fabrics used in Plural Soft offer the guarantee of continuous use and easy cleaning. It is important to note that if necessary, it is very easy to disassemble and replace the damaged module’Plural Soft, the evolution of the Plural seating system | image © Omar Sartor, art direction Studio FM Milano; set design \u0026 styling Studio SalarisCreating furniture for public spaces comes with its own set of challenges, particularly the need to balance functional demands and structural integrity with a fitting visual appeal. Therefore, color choices play a significant role in setting the tone for these environments. The Plural Soft collection offers a curated palette of warm tones, carefully selected to harmonize with various architectural styles and interior designs, and intentionally letting go of grey, white and black.‘After 10 years in the market, we thought we could offer to the end user a warmer option, with all the possibilities of a wide color range and with all the new fabrics that allow intense and long-lasting use, and at the same time provide the system with greater comfort. For the launch of Plural Soft at Orgatec, we left behind grey, white and black and combined the colors of the aluminum structure with the colors of the upholstery. This will offer architects and interior designers so many chromatic possibilities of combination. When we design products, our interlocutor is the architect or interior designer, to whom we want to give a tool that will be useful in their work,’ explains the designer. the multiple upholstered seats of Plural Soft provide enhanced comfort while maintaining a minimalist design | image © Frank JankowskiThe modularity of the seating system also allows for versatility in configuring different layouts, making it adaptable for various spaces. Pensi explains that his goal was to create a product that could maintain its integrity and appeal over time, even as public spaces evolve.‘In all our designs we are aware that they must last, not only for their image but also for their manufacture, which must be perfect. We are proud that all our products made with Pedrali are absolutely resistant to the passage of time,’ the designer states, highlighting the importance of creating minimal yet robust designs that stand up to the rigors of high-traffic environments.designed for dynamic waiting areas, Plural Soft add warmth and comfort to public spaces with its refined upholsteryTHE DIEGO SIDE TABLE FOR MULTIFUNCTIONAL SPACESIn addition to Plural Soft, Jorge Pensi and Pedrali introduced the Diego side table at Orgatec 2024, a furniture piece that perfectly complements the seating system while standing out with its own distinct design. Featuring an asymmetrical base and an adjustable knob that allows for different height settings, the table was designed with ergonomics in mind. ‘This side table was born as a small multifunctional piece but with precise, non-invasive identity features, which thanks to its extensive color range, allows its use in all types of architectural spaces,’ highlights Pensi.featuring an asymmetrical base and an adjustable knob, Diego allows for different height settingsThe minimal yet flexible design makes it a natural fit for both public and private environments. One of the key design decisions was the use of die-cast aluminum for the legs, a material that not only adds to the table’s durability but also aligns with Pedrali’s focus on sustainability.‘If we consider the Ypsilon collection, especially Ypsilon Connect, we can clearly see that Diego is the continuation of our design philosophy in which injected aluminum and extruded aluminum are naturally combined,’ he states.",
