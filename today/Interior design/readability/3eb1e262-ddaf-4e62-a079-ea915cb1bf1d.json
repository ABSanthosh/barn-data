  "text": "Before I share the links for this week’s Style Scouting. I wanted to share what happened at my house. How do you like how Hurricane Helene decided to re-decorate one of the guest rooms in my house? If you are wondering what punched through the roof of the house and into this bedroom…. that would be a very large tree. What amazes me is that the glass globe on the ceiling fan in the room didn’t shatter. This and more happened on Friday morning as our day was starting and Hurricane Helene whipped into town with 35-40 mph sustained winds and 80 mph gusts. She created devastation in her path in the way of trees down and power outages everywhere. We are still without power and most likely will be for days as one of our neighbor’s trees fell over the road to the cul-de-sac on which I live. It pulled down the wires and brought down the electrical transformer on it that services the cul-de-sac. Ed and my brother-in-law have spent the last two days cleaning up the mess on the ground. Once done, we will help neighbors with similar scenarios like us until a tree service can come and remove the tree. I was able to write this post at my sister’s house where they just got their power back, but they just found out that they will be losing the use of water. When destruction like this happens and we lose electrical power and the ability to use our phones, get online, wash dishes, shower and have the use of water at our fingertips, it makes you realize just how much we take having them so readily available in our homes for granted. Insurance has been called and we are waiting for the adjuster and tree removal service to come out. We were told it could be 4-5 days before they can get here. For now, all we can do is wait for the insurance adjuster, tree service and the lineman to bring a new pole and transformer. God bless them for working so hard around the clock to help us get our lives back to normal. Ed and I are trying to stay positive as we were not injured. If you live where Helene came through, I hope you were not impacted too severely. I will try my best to get a new post up this week, but with no electricity and internet at home, I know if I don’t you will understand. :-). Now onto the inspiring links I found for you this week.
