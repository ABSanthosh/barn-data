All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Jonathan Weiss / ShutterstockSadly, Thanksgiving isn’t a holiday best known for its decor. The best you can often do is keep your pumpkins around from Halloween, add in a few fall-themed wreaths and some nice taper candles and call it a day. The star of Thanksgiving is the food, after all. But the tides are seemingly changing because designer John Derian created a Thanksgiving decoration for his Target collection that is catching so much attention, it’s nearly impossible to get your hands on. Derian designed a beaded plush turkey pillow that is eye-catching enough to be the centerpiece of your Thanksgiving table year after year after year. It’s intricately beaded with a variety of different glass beads and sequins that really bring this bird to life, and at 16 inches long and 15 inches tall, this guy demands attention.And at just $40, you’ll feel like you’re stealing him. That is … if you can find a store that still has this Tom turkey in stock.The turkey pillow is already sold out online and is only available in Target stores, though you can add yourself to the waitlist to see if it comes back in stock for online ordering. And if you’re thinking “Oh, I’ll just pick one up from a reseller,” good luck. He’s an immediate fan favorite and selling for more than double his original $40 price on eBay, as one TikTok user found out.But if your local Target does still have these turkeys in stock, they’re definitely worth the investment. “Absolutely gorgeous detail on this pillow,” one Target reviewer wrote about their turkey. “So excited to show it off every Thanksgiving day.”Another person added, “Love my turkey. It has the best detail work, and I can have it out year-round.” If you’re too impatient to wait for the turkey to come back, there’s a similar beaded chicken in the John Derian collab that’s equally unique and lovable.This turkey is the “it” guy of fall this year, so pick one up if you can find one and finally make Thanksgiving a holiday worth decorating for!",
