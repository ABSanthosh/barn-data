  "description": "A banquette seating area is the ultimate space saver – a design solution for homes lacking space for a traditional dining table. Typically featuring an upholstered bench along a wall (replacing dining chairs on at least one side of a dining table), a banquette seating area suits small home and apartment dwellers, or those in larger houses seeking a second dining area for casual meals. It can also be a great way to sneak some extra storage into your home. Interior designer Jono Fleming is a big fan of this clever design hack, so we asked him everything you need to know about creating one of your own!",

Below, interior designer Jono Fleming answers all your questions about the required space, materials, and trades to create a DIY or custom-built banquette seating area of your own. What kind of space does a banquette seating area suit? A banquette seating area or ‘nook’ works for so many different types of homes, but is especially great for anyone who wants to maximise space, while creating a cozy, inviting dining area. ‘If you love entertaining, a banquette has that effortless “stay awhile” feeling,’ says Jono. ‘There’s something about sitting in a banquette that makes people settle in, it’s why restaurants use them so often.’ Jono says, ‘Getting in and out does take a little more manoeuvring, but if space is your main concern, it’s one of the best ways to create a functional, stylish dining area without taking up extra room.’ Banquette seats are typically tucked into a corner of a room, but they can also suit more open spaces. ‘It can just as easily run along a single wall and still be just as functional. The key to making it work is getting the proportions right,’ says Jono. ‘The seat needs to be deep enough to sit comfortably, but not so deep that you feel too far from the table. ‘Making sure there’s enough space to slide in and out easily is important too — you don’t want to feel boxed in or have to shuffle awkwardly to get up.’ More info on nailing those dimensions below… How do I design and build the banquette seating? You can either DIY the banquette seat (the upholstered bench against the wall element) or engage a professional to build this from scratch. To DIY, you’ll need to purchase a pre-made bench or other structure for the seating, have cushions cut to size by a foam supplier, and wrap them in fabric using a staple gun. ‘This is an easy way to get a clean finish,’ says Jono. Jono used a staple gun himself in a recent project, but instead of wrapping foam for the seat backing, he used pool noodles! (Scroll to the bottom of this story to see the result!) ‘It sounds ridiculous, but pool noodles are a great hack for creating that structured, rounded backrest without spending a fortune on custom upholstery,’ Jono says. ‘By wrapping them in wadding and fabric, you can get a really polished result for a fraction of the cost of a professionally upholstered backrest.’ The other option is to hire a joiner or cabinetmaker to custom design and construct the seating structure, then have an upholsterer create the cushions and backrest to fit. ‘If you’re after something completely bespoke, working with a professional is the way to go, especially if you want the upholstery to have a tailored, built-in feel,’ says Jono. Fabric choice is also important. Jono suggests stain-resistant linen blends, leather or vinyl, which all hold up well over time. The cost of a DIY setup with a pre-made base and cushions can be done for a few hundred dollars, while a fully built-in banquette with professional upholstery can easily run into the thousands. What shape and size should my banquette seating area be? As a general guide, a banquette seating area requires a minimum of 80cm of wall space per person. A small or open area (1-3 seats, including dining chairs) is best suited to a round table, while larger L-shaped areas (4 seats +) are generally paired with a rectangular or oval-shaped table. Always measure and thoroughly map out your space with tape beforehand, as every home and user is different. To give you a concrete example, Jono has outlined the exact dimensions of a banquette seating area he’s designed, pictured at the bottom of this story. This banquette seating area below sits in the corner of an open-plan kitchen and dining room approximately 2.5 x 3.5 metres in size. It’s a relatively generous area that comfortably seats five people: two across the long 200cm side, and one on the shorter 120cm side, and two on the dining chairs. The depth of the seat is 45cm, creating enough depth for users to slide in, without being too far away from the table. The backrest — created using Jono’s ingenious upholstered pool noodle hack — adds an additional 10cm of depth. The oval-shaped dining table is perfectly proportioned to space at 90cm x 180cm, which is just shorter than the parallel bench This seating also incorporates storage, which is a great place to hide laptop cords, kid’s textbooks, tablecloths, toys, cleaning supplies… you name it! Jono engaged a builder (Tim Clark) to create the actual bench, and he made the cushions himself using foam, a base board, fabric, and of course the pool noodles for the backing. The space is styled with a gallery wall above, that works to visually define the area, and a task light. ‘The right lighting makes a huge difference,’ says Jono. ‘A pendant or wall sconce helps define the nook, and makes it feel like its own little dining spot rather than just an extension of the kitchen. ‘With the right details, a banquette becomes more than just a practical space saver — it feels like a destination in your home.’",
