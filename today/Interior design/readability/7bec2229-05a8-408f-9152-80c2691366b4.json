  "text": "My friends often joke that i have a supplies store at home and in the office because of the number of stationery items that I have. I cannot resist adding to my collection every time I see a new design or a new item that I don’t have yet. When I went to Japan a few years ago, I felt like I was in stationery heaven because of all the cute and unusual stuff that they have. You can always trust the Japanese to come up with something new that is not just kawaii but also highly functional. For example, the trusty old binder clip is something that we’ve been using for years. But Japanese brand Kokuya noticed some issues that users have had with the ones currently in the market. And so they came up with the Smart Double Clip, a different take on that thing we use to bind papers together. Its innovative triangular shape is inspired by the corner of a turning page, making it both intuitive and elegant. Designer: Kokuya Most of the binder clips we have are a bit bulky and get in the way when we try to flip through the papers. They also leave marks on the papers especially if they’re used for a long time. The Smart Double Clip hugs your papers in a way that’s practically invisible and lets you flip through those pages smoothly and easily. It opens from both the top and bottom so you can clamp it on both sides. The triangular “page corner” design guides your hand naturally as you slide the clip onto the documents, making the process quick and maybe even slightly addictive. The smooth edges of the clip and the gentle pressure it exerts makes sure you don’t have to worry about torn corners or unsightly marks. The clip is crafted from durable, lightweight metal with a sleek matte finish which makes it fit into any of your workspaces. And because it’s very slim, it fits easily into pen cases, pouches, or even your wallet so you can always carry one with you. Kokuyo is known for products that blend thoughtful design with everyday usefulness. The Smart Double Clip is a perfect example: it looks great, feels satisfying to use, and solves real-life paper woes. Whether you’re a seasoned stationery collector or just someone who enjoys a tidy desk, this one is a fresh, functional addition to any workspace. It’s proof that something as simple as a paper clip can make your day a little smoother and a lot more stylish.",
