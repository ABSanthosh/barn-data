  "text": "Limewashed walls are all the rage right now, offering a rich matte finish and depth of texture that is unmatched in other paints or finishes. The Color Atelier is proud to partner with AD100 and designer Sarah Sherman Samuel to bring us seven distinct shades, each more inviting than the next. Environmentally friendly, artisianally crafted, and luxuriously opaque, the mineral-based paints are made in small batches in their California warehouse, ensuring meticulous attention to detail and exceptional quality. The Sarah Sherman Samuel for Color Atelier shades include White Sands, Buttercup Yellow, Sweet Berry, Desert Red, Olive You, Summer Sky, and Warm Night. Modern, reserved, and functional, letting the texture of the limewash shine, this collection elevates any space. The seven hues span the breadth of the color wheel, offering muted options with White Sands and Warm Night, while also including natural tones such as Buttercup Yellow, Desert Red, or Summer Sky. Sophisticated yet approachable, the limewashed hues offer a muted texture at first glance, but the subtle variations of the limewash application are where the beauty lies. No application exactly the same, the texture is built through layers of paint, achieving either an opaque look or going completely solid. Desert Red: Earthy orange-brown tones reminiscent of brick and clay. Limewash paint has multiple sustainability benefits, having been used for over two thousand years. As Joe Wooten, head of product at Domingue Architectural Finishes in Houston, puts it, “It is not just a product, but a philosophy.” As designers must consider the life cycle of the products they use, limewash paint is a beautiful response to the usually toxic nature of most wall finishes. By nature, the paint is naturally-derived and contains no chemicals, making it a great choice for those with children or anyone that wants to create a healthy home. Limewash paint is exactly as described: limestone dust, water, and pigment are all that is needed to create a durable and beautiful wall covering. Olive You: A grounding olive green. Summer Sky: A cool blue with a touch of lavender, evoking clear skies. Buttercup Yellow: A soft, creamy yellow that feels inviting. Sweet Berry: A deep, rich berry hue for a bold, sophisticated ambiance. Color Atelier was founded by the wife-and-husband team Burcu K. and Olivier Garnier, and is renowned for its commitment to quality and sustainability. “We are incredibly excited to collaborate with Sarah Sherman Samuel, whose design philosophy perfectly aligns with our commitment to quality, sustainability and artistry,” shares Burcu Garnier. “This collection captures the essence of both our brands.” Warm Night: A warm black with subtle brown undertones for a refined finish. White Sands: A warm ivory that creates a soothing, airy feel. Sarah Sherman Samuel is a AD 100 designer, bringing her unique eye to interiors, product, and styling with ease. The mind behind the SSS Edit, she started her journey in 2012 to chronicle her favorite brands, design tips, DIY projects, travel guides, and fashion go-to’s. The SSS Edit can be categorized as a design reference library, featuring peeks into her client projects, as well as her picks for decor, fashion, and travel.
