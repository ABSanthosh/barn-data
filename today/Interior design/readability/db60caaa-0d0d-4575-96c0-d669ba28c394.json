  "text": "Final Decade of Eames Design Uncovered at Transamerica PyramidThe Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity, in collaboration with SHVO, launches its first major public exhibition, Past as Prologue: The Last Decade of Furniture Design by Charles and Ray Eames, at the Transamerica Pyramid Center in San Francisco. Opening during San Francisco Design Week 2025, the exhibition brings rarely seen furniture and archival materials into public view, highlighting a lesser-known but deeply significant chapter in the Eameses’ legacy. Spanning the years 1968 to 1978, Past as Prologue explores how the iconic duo refined and adapted their designs in response to rapid social and technological shifts. Rather than reinventing their work, Charles and Ray Eames focused on thoughtful iteration—embracing new materials like polyurethane and injection-molded plastics, and addressing the rising demand for modularity and workplace ergonomics in a changing office culture.all images courtesy of the Eames Institute‘Past as Prologue’ Reconnects Design Legacy with PlaceCurated by Llisa Demetrios, Chief Curator of the Eames Institute and granddaughter of Charles and Ray Eames, Past as Prologue features original furniture prototypes, design documents, and ephemera from the Eames Archives. ‘This era is often overlooked,’ says Demetrios. ‘It was exciting to bring forward work that was created within my lifetime and give it new visibility.’ Many of the featured pieces reflect the needs of a growing white-collar workforce, as companies like Herman Miller and Vitra transitioned into the contract office market.The exhibition is staged at the newly renovated Transamerica Pyramid—an architectural icon that, fittingly, debuted in 1972 with original Eames furniture in its interiors. A companion Time Capsule Exhibition runs alongside Past as Prologue, featuring archival footage and original video that connect the Eameses’ work directly to the building’s history. Together, the exhibitions underscore how Bay Area design heritage continues to shape its creative present. In addition to the gallery, the Institute is opening two retail footprints within the Transamerica Pyramid. One features curated items from William Stout Architectural Books and Eames merchandise in the main lobby, while the other, inside the exhibition, serves as a gift shop for catalogs and design-related products. An online companion exhibition ensures broader access, aligning with the Institute’s mission to share the Eames legacy with a global audience.Past as Prologue brings rarely seen furniture and archival materials into public viewinstallation view of Past as Prologue: The Last Decade of Furniture Designthe exhibition is staged at the newly renovated Transamerica Pyramidspanning the years 1968 to 1978, the show explores how the duo adapted their designs to social and technological shiftsthe show highlights a lesser-known chapter in the Eameses’ legacythe exhibition features original furniture prototypes, design documents, and ephemerapromotional photograph from 1971 shows an Eames Chaise, EC176 Loose Cushion Armchairs, and Walnut Stools in an office composed of freestanding AO2 panelsphotograph of EC127 Pull-Up Chairs taken at the Eames Office in June 1970.the EA219 Tilt-Swivel High Back Desk Armchair on set of the film Soft Pad at the Eames Office, May 1970early version of the ES108 Eames Sofa featuring soft pads suspended from a Compact Sofa frame, as opposed to the final version which utilizes teak panelsEC178 Loose Cushion Office Seating PrototypeLoose Cushion Armchair cushion prototypesEC176 Loose Cushion Armchair (Casters)",
