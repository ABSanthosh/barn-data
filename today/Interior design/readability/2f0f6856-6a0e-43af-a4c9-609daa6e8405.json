  "text": "The Opal Residence—designed by Artpartner Architects—is downright luxurious. Sleek lines, luminous textures, and thoughtfully curated spaces bring the space to life. This residence is inspired by the iridescent beauty of its namesake gemstone. Every detail in this interior tells a story of refined living. We see sunlit open spaces and natural materials. So, this isn’t just a residence, it’s an experience. Let’s explore the allure of this architectural gem… The living room of the Opal Residence is where contemporary design and timeless elegance converge. Bathed in natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, this space is an ode to open and airy living. The expansive layout provides breathtaking views of the surrounding cityscape. This creates a seamless connection between the indoors and outdoors. The seating arrangement features neutral-hued bubble furniture. We love how the ribbed and sculptural forms add dynamism to the space. The design simply invites moments of quiet reflection. Anchoring the seating area are abstract, organic-shaped coffee tables made from marble. One is ivory, while the other is black, creating a beautiful contrast. A textured area rug ties the room together. Strategically placed floor lamps make sure there’s ample artificial lighting when the sun’s down. And the massive potted plant picks up nature and adds it to the space (quite literally). The staircase is an architectural element in itself. The railing features reflective glass—adding visual intrigue. The area underneath houses pebbles and a large statement stone. A great way to bring some more natural materials indoors (and give them the attention they deserve!). The kitchen in the Opal Residence features a massive ivory island. This is paired with four sleek bar stools, the metallic legs of which factor in luxury. The cabinetry is nice and sleek, while the dark marble backsplash adds a unique element. We also see wooden cabinetry with built-in appliances. On the other end of the kitchen island is a sleek, shiny sink and faucet as well as a small built-in minibar. The dining area in the Opal Residence is as grand as it gets! A large, round dining table takes center stage, with its marble top adding opulence. This is paired with curved ivory chairs and a round rug. Overhead, irregularly shaped pendant lights illuminate the space. We also see natural textures in the artwork adorning the wall. And, by the way, the city views from the large windows also double as art. This sleek corridor in the Opal Residence features dark, wooden accents. We’d like to call it the most luxe part of the home! A marble slab is built into the wall and houses a sleek vase. This is strategically highlighted with accent lighting. We also see a bench with curved seating as well as textured artwork—both are architectural elements that create a statement. If you’re looking to relax, this nook of the Opal Residence is the perfect spot. A modern massage chair is placed next to a large window. So, you can enjoy beautiful outdoor views as you get in a much-needed massage. And, if you’re looking to read your favorite book as you relax, there’s wooden shelving nearby! This houses books, vases, candles, and an aromatherapy diffuser. Together, these decorative elements add dimension to the decor. The bookshelves are strategically illuminated—so the setup forms the focal point of the space. The workstation in the Opal Residence is futuristic. We see a chunky, sleek black table and ergonomic chair. The double monitor gives you optimal functionality—and the large window behind the setting is a great place to rest your eyes as you take a break from work! Last but definitely not the least is the bathroom. This features a fluted pedestal sink standing freely in front of an illuminated mirror. The organically shaped toilet also doubles as a decorative element!  The shower cubicle in this bathroom features porcelain tiles for an understated vibe that’s also luxurious. A special mention for the curved wooden towel holder—which looks quite like a branch from a tree holding your towel.",
