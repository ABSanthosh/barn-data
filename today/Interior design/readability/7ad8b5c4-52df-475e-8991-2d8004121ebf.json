  "text": "Noise-canceling headphones have long been synonymous with premium pricing, where features like ANC are reserved for those willing to part with a significant chunk of their paycheck. But Belkin, a brand better known for practical chargers and laptop accessories, has decided to disrupt this norm. They’ve entered the audio scene with the Soundform Isolate, a pair of headphones that challenge the idea that quality must always come at a cost. We met Belkin at IFA where they showcased the Soundform Isolate – the company spoke about how entering a new industry as an established brand was difficult – so the best way to disrupt the space was to disrupt pricing. Belkin has been a trusted name in tech accessories for years, but with the Soundform Isolate, they’re stepping into the competitive world of noise-canceling headphones. Priced at just $60, these headphones aim to provide the essentials of active noise cancellation (ANC) without the sticker shock of high-end models. What’s the catch? Well, there really isn’t one, given that Belkin’s primary aim is to establish its name in the audio space. The headphones are well-designed, work exactly as advertised, have an impressive battery, and a price tag that should really make you wonder why the hell Apple charges upwards of $400 for a pair of ANC headphones. Designer: Belkin Right away, the Soundform Isolate stands out for its clean, no-frills vibe. Offered in understated shades of sand or black, it folds up neatly—a traveler’s delight. The CloudCushion earcups, aptly named, feel like a soft retreat for your ears, especially if you’ve endured stiff or uncomfortable headsets in the past. Comfort here is an integral part of the design DNA, making long hours of wear remarkably pleasant. Battery life? Let’s just say it goes the distance. Flip on ANC, and you’re set for 40 hours—ample time for marathon workdays or that endless backlog of podcasts. Turn off ANC, and the battery stretches to an astonishing 60 hours. That’s endurance that punches well above its price. A handy transparency mode is also in the mix, keeping you connected to your surroundings without fumbling to take the headphones off. Whether you’re fielding work calls or jumping into a Netflix binge, it’s all handled with ease thanks to Bluetooth 5.4, which ensuring smooth pairing and Multipoint letting you toggle between two devices seamlessly. Controls include a smart balance of touch gestures and good old physical buttons, giving you the flexibility to choose what works best. For those who still enjoy the occasional wired experience, the Soundform Isolate has a few tricks (or wires) up its sleeve. It ships with both a USB-C to USB-C cable for digital audio and charging, and a trusty 3.5mm analog cable. If that wasn’t enough of a pleasant surprise for a $60 headphone, the device also comes with a built-in relaxation track of ocean waves. It’s an unexpected but delightful feature, perfect for a quick mental escape in the middle of a chaotic day. With the Soundform Isolate, it’s clear that Belkin’s goal was to strike a balance between affordability and functionality. These headphones won’t wow hardcore audiophiles, but that’s not the point. Instead, they provide a straightforward, comfortable, and feature-rich experience that caters to everyday users. Whether you’re diving into your favorite playlist, catching up on podcasts, or simply enjoying some peace and quiet, the Soundform Isolate delivers a solid performance without overcomplicating things. And at the same price as an Uber to the airport, this headphone is definitely a no-nonsense recommendation.",
