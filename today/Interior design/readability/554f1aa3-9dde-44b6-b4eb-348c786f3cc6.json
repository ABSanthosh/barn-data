Even before I started blogging, I had decorated quite a lot of Christmas trees… literally hundreds and have even shared all my Christmas tree lighting tips and tricks that make decorating a Christmas tree an easier job. Here are a few trees I have decorated over the years using a variety of color schemes, ornaments and more. Christmas Tree Decorating Schemes I Have Used Over the Years Every year I like to come up with a different color scheme to decorate the tree using a variety of my family’s favorite ornaments. The Red Plaid Tree I have liked how I decorated all my Christmas trees over the years, but if I had to choose a favorite this red plaid tree would be it. How to Make a Snowball Garland Tiny white pom-pom garland is yarn bought at the craft store. Red pom-pom garland and wide red plaid ribbon are from Michaels Ho Ho Ho Ribbon is from Target. I bought the gold bead garland at a yard sale. The Turquoise Tree I decorated this tree for the dining room in my previous home. I made everything for it myself. Here are the How to posts: How to make paper ornaments DIY Pipe Cleaner Garland How to Make a Photo Frame Tree Stand Cover The Dead Tree I truly enjoyed bringing this dead tree back to life with white spray paint and shiny glass ornaments purchased at Michaels and Walmart. The Pink Ball \u0026 Snowflake Tree When I worked in the visual department at a department store I got a bin full of large fuchsia balls that were being thrown away – one of the perks of the job.  The foam snowflakes are from the dollar store. The Red Star Tree I was feeling very traditional the year I decorated the tree in a red and white color scheme with plaid accents. The Paper Doily Snowflake Tree When I couldn’t find white snowflake ornaments in the size I wanted, I decided to make them myself. The Blue \u0026 White Snowball Tree The color scheme for this tree I created to coordinate with the bedroom it is in. The snowball garland is from Hobby Lobby. The smaller snowball and bead garland I made The Only Lights Tree I decided after adding a few strands of twinkle lights (not blinking) to this tree that it didn’t need anything else. The Green \u0026 Pine Cone Tree The year I did this tree l wanted a serene Christmas and only added lights and pinecones from my yard from the tree that I hung with velvet ribbon. To make the pinecones feel a bit more festive, I spray glued each pinecone and sprinkled glitter over them. The Black, White \u0026 Silver Tree Instead of placing every ornament and handmade ornament I had on the tree, I went through all my ornaments and picked out all the silver and Mercury glass ornaments. They add a little bit of a vintage touch that I love to see at Christmas. The Mercury glass ornaments really come alive at night when they reflect the glow of the white twinkle lights I adore. Christmas without twinkle lights on the tree is just not Christmas for me. The Multi-Colored Vertical Ribbon Tree And lastly… I created this tree for a sponsored post when I first started blogging. I used ribbons and made garlands of shapes to hang. It was colorful, but the ribbons did hide a lot of the tree and lights. How are you decorating your Christmas tree this year?
