  "description": "This MN Series eFoil is a personal electric hydrofoil, produced by Australian company Flite and designed by Marc Newson. The rider controls it using a wireless hand controller, also designed by Newson.Driven by the necessary technical constraints of eFoil technology, Marc's design focuses on streamlining the functionality and manufacturing processes to create a product with increased strength and stiffness, and reduced drag. Weighing less than 20 kg, the MN Series is the world's lightest eFoil. The monobloc construction of the high-modulus, pre-preg carbon fibre board, together with the mast and fuselage system, reduces assembly and joins, in turn making the board lighter. The board is reduced in size from Flite's other offerings, further decreasing weight. The eFoil features titanium accents on its front wing and board, another lightweight, hardwearing, and anti-corrosive material to safeguard the board from salt water. Voronoi patternThis naturally forming pattern is found everywhere from turtle shells and spotted eagle rays. Newson borrowed the pattern from nature to create the functional and distinctive deck grip. Clean linesFlush mount silicone handles are sleek and discreet. There when you need them and integrated when you're flying. Stunning simplificationA singular battery-release mechanism is simple, durable and striking. Like every Fliteboard, battery levels, board health, connection and pairing status are displayed on the minimalist Flitecell lightbar.",
