  "description": "There isn't much design in your average bike pump: It's a plunger, a hose and a couple of wimpy feet you step on to stabilize the base. And the hose has no place to dock when the pump isn't in use.In contrast this Zilch pump, by a startup called Radian, was designed with a heavy emphasis on UX. The designers started with the typically fiddly process of getting the nozzle onto the valve stem. Rather than going with a friction arrangement, where you jam the nozzle onto the valve, the Zilch uses an elegant clamping mechanism. You slide the nozzle over the valve with no friction at all, then press a lever to activate an internal clamp, forming a secure connection. You do the same in reverse to disconnect, meaning there isn't that annoying little blast of air as you remove the nozzle.When you're done pumping, the hose can be hung from the plunger for storage. The plunger handle is self-centering, so the hose handle's dock is always in place.The base of the pump features three feet rather than two, splayed for stability. Lastly, the pump has been designed for serviceability; the user can easily disassemble it and replace parts as necessary.The Zilch pump has been successfully Kickstarted, with 24 days left to pledge at press time. It starts at $95.",
