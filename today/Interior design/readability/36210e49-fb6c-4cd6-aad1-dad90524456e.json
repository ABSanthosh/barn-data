  "text": "Footwear icon Nike and the creators of the classic Monopoly game set, Hasbro, have come into a special collaboration to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the board game on November 19 with a limited-edition Monopoly game set themed after the basketball legend LeBron James. Dubbed LeBron 22, the game set is fine memorabilia for both sports and Monopoly fans across all age groups. The board game, with a fresh twist, is not a solitary-themed item born out of this collaboration that no one saw coming. Anyway, comes along with exclusive LeBron sneakers inspired by the Monopoly’s design elements. The game set on the other hand comes with LeBron-themed playing pieces including rings, basketballs, sneakers, and jerseys that take the gameplay to the next level of fandom. Designer: Nike x Hasbro Hasbro x Nike Monopoly-themed speakers come in two distinct designs. The Currency and Token. While the first is inspired by the graphic approach of the money in the game of Monopoly, the latter is envisioned after the game tokens in luxurious blue and gold floral print. Both have their own journey and style but live up to the common goal of celebrating LeBron’s admirable gameplay and lifestyle, and Monopoly’s iconic status. The Currency colorway is ready to drop on November 15 with Token arriving on the 19th. Aside from the release of the game of Monopoly and the thematic sneakers, Nike and Hasbro plan on bringing the LeBron 22 Monopoly Game Set to LeBron James’ House Three Thirty community center in Akron, OH, to celebrate Monopoly Day on November 19. Along with a life-size version of the game being hosted at LeBron’s I Promise School where sixth to eighth-grade students will have a chance to experience Monopoly in a brand-new avatar. The idea of the large game board is to promote financial literacy with interactive gameplay.",
