  "text": "The lucky buyers of this Sunshine Coast estate won’t have to pick between living by the beach or on a country acreage, because the impressive hinterland property offers the best of both worlds. Tucked behind a gated entry, the tree-lined block is located on 2.43 acres in one of Doonan’s most tightly held pockets, which is a short drive from Noosa’s popular coastal enclave. Owners Rachel Smeeton and Trent Little were immediately enchanted by 49 Meadow Court’s complete privacy and incredible location when they first inspected it as a ‘blank canvas’ years ago. ‘It was expansive, open, and full of potential. It had a quiet presence to it,’ Rachel says. ‘The setting felt special, and we could instantly see ourselves building something meaningful here.’ Designing and building the residence themselves, Rachel and Trent were ‘obsessive’ about perfecting all the details. The couple first created the barn-style, three-bedroom guesthouse, where their family lived while they constructed the larger home, containing six bedrooms. To do the math, that’s nine bedrooms spread across the two dwellings! ‘The guesthouse has been a huge highlight, it offers so much flexibility, and guests always comment on how peaceful it feels,’ Rachel adds. The main house has a ‘modern farmhouse feel’, thanks to an expansive wrap around veranda, polished concrete floors, a classic country kitchen with a walk-in pantry, an impressive mudroom and even a laundry chute. ‘Every detail was deliberate, from the orientation of the home to capture light and breezes, to the layout that flows around a central living zone,’ she says. Upstairs, the main bedroom reveals black-stained timber floors, French barn doors and a romantic Juliette balcony overlooking the outdoor entertaining area beside an inviting swimming pool. And it’s all set to a backdrop of abundant greenery. Established trees and flourishing landscaped gardens give the property an ‘incredibly calming’ atmosphere. ‘It’s only 15 minutes from Noosa, but it feels like a retreat,’ Rachel explains. ‘You really are immersed in nature.’ 49 Meadow Court, Doonan, QLD 4562 is for private sale with Krause Property Group.",
