All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Every room in the house serves a purpose: The bedroom’s for snoozin’, the living room is for schmoozin’, and the kitchen is undeniably the heart of the home. But what about the dining room? While it’s historically been where you enjoy all your regular meals, these spaces are now often reserved only for more “formal” (and less frequent) things like brunch with the besties and holiday feasts. This once-revered room is now more likely collecting dust bunnies, heaps of mail, and stacks of packages, leading to a phenomenon some are calling “disappearing dining rooms.” Why Are Dining Rooms Disappearing? According to a 2024 article in The Atlantic, 86% of households prefer a combined dining and kitchen area, though only 75% of homes actually have an area for this. The same article cites changes in gender and class norms that led to a massive change in how homes are built and used. Sservants became a luxury instead of a standard, and while domestic work fell to women at first, nowadays everyone in the household has begun to contribute to labor, leading to a blurring of spaces like the kitchen and the living room. There’s also another factor: the rise in single-person households. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, over a quarter of all households in the U.S. now have only a single person, the amount having tripled from 1940 to 2020. With many people eating alone, a grand dining room becomes unnecessary. The Atlantic also cites zoning codes as well as a lack of space when it comes to building new houses as part of the problem. Designers also have opinions on this shift. For New York-based designer Phillip Thomas, it’s a matter of space. “Dining rooms occupy square footage, and that space has value, so if it isn’t utilized on a daily basis, you lose the value of that space,” he says. Square footage was at a particularly high premium as people sheltered in place in 2020 when the pandemic hit. Since most people stopped hosting and started doing everything else from home, the space that was once reserved for a dining room was suddenly up for grabs. So, these areas became classrooms, offices, gyms — and sometimes stayed that way even four years later. “Having an entire room in your home dedicated to guests and formal seating just doesn’t make sense for most people anymore,” Denver-based designer Nadia Watts adds. “Clients want casual gathering spaces.” Dining rooms (and using them for their intended purpose) may be becoming less common, but doesn’t mean you need to nix the whole table and chairs setup for good. After all: You do need somewhere to sit and enjoy your yummy meal. Instead of dedicating an entire meal to your next feast, many designers and dwellers are incorporating dining rooms into larger, multipurpose spaces.How to Create a Dining AreaAccording to designer Allison Babcock, based in Long Island, New York, a formal versus open dining layout depends on both style and square feet. “In smaller homes or more casual homes, an open format allows the living spaces to feel larger and more communal,” she says. “You can visually separate the space in a number of ways, such as having overhead lighting define the area above a dining table.”If you want to turn your traditional dining room into an open, less-defined format, you’ll want to consider that careful balance between style and space efficiency. “Start by picking a specific area of the room, such as the nook or along the wall side, where the smallest possible dining table can fit,” Wisconsin-based designer Margaret Kemmeter recommends. “A round or foldable table is best since it doesn’t use too much space and can always be rearranged according to the needs and requirements of your family.” Pair extendable tables with a bench with hidden storage to maximize space. But just because a dining area is confined to a corner doesn’t mean it should look like an afterthought. Accessorizing your tables and chairs with an area rug or light pendant will create the illusion of an intentional, sectioned-off space — one that’s packed with design chops. “You can divide the space by floating a sofa and placing a console behind it, which can double as a serving space,” Babcock adds. The disappearing dining room might feel like the end of an era — one of fabulous dining parties and lavish meals — but it doesn’t have to be this way. Watts argues that the formal dining room isn’t officially “out,” though the rules for decorating one have certainly changed. “Today’s dining rooms have personality: No more fancy china closets and beautiful heavy draperies,” she says. “I love to do a dining room with large scale wallpaper that boasts a bold pattern.” No matter which way you spin it, dining rooms are here to stay — though how they look may always be in flux.",
