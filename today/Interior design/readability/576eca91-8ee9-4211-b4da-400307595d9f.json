  "description": "Homes like this 1970s gem in Victoria’s Dandenong Ranges don’t come on the market every day. Designed by the famous Alistair Knox, the enchanting house has only been owned by two families in its lifetime — who’ve both carefully preserved its red brick walls, Oregon wood accents, and soulful character across some light renovations. Who will be the lucky third custodian?",

  "text": "If you’ve been reading TDF for a while, you’ll know Alistair Knox was one of Victoria’s most lauded building designers who rose to prominence across the mid-century era. His work is instantly recognisable and highly coveted, which is why Tia Paterson and her family were counting their lucky stars when they came across this Knox-designed home nestled in the peaceful hills of Kallista, about an hour from Melbourne. ‘We had always dreamt of one day owning a legacy home designed by an Australian architect,’ Tia says. After almost two years of searching, Tia and her husband David Byrne purchased the 1970s gem at 51 Ridge Road from the original owners in 2022. Not only had the vendors taken great care of the home, but they were able to pass on the original floorplans and handwritten books detailing the building’s materials. The house is filled with recycled and natural materials, including handcrafted red bricks, rustic Oregon wood beams and slate floors, while the four-bedroom floorplan beautifully frames uninterrupted views of Mount Donna Buang and the Yarra Ranges’ rolling hills. Expansive windows run the length of the home, bringing the outdoors into the bedroom, kitchen, dining, and the living room. ‘True to Knox’s philosophy of “living in the environment,” this home is a masterful blend of form and function: it’s unpretentious, soulful, and deeply connected to its surroundings,’ Tia says. With much admiration for the house’s character, Tia and David took a ‘gentle’ approach in their recent renovations, refreshing the interiors with small changes like wool carpets, wall sconces by Pasquale Cook, and updated bathroom vanities. ‘We also updated the garden to include sophisticated varieties of trees and native plants which lead into natural hillscape and bushland of the area,’ Tia says. The couple and their two kids have cherished the home over the last few years, but are ‘regrettably selling’ to relocate for work commitments. And there’s a lot they’ll miss: from ‘the natural feeling of the home’, to entertaining friends in the sunken living space in front of the fireplace, or simply being outside taking in the spectacular vistas! 51 Ridge Road, Kallista, VIC 3791 is for private sale with Ryan Bell of Bell Real Estate.",
