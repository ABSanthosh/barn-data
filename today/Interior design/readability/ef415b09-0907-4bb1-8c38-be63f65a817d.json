  "description": "As we saw with his Smoke Glass, Italian industrial designer Joe Colombo loved smoking and drinking. And, apparently, poker; he designed this Poker Table in 1968. A precursor to the gaming tables of today, the table featured four flip-out wings that allowed players to stack an additional vice on top of gambling. The legs are stainless steel, and the table surfaces are laminated plastic. The ashtrays simply sit in an open hole. Here you can see that you remove them for cleaning by pushing up on the bottom. The wings were reportedly designed to hold both ashtrays and tumblers (Colombo being fond of booze), but in every photo I can find, it's always staged with only the ashtrays.The table originally came with a removable playing surface made of baize, a felt-like fabric, trimmed in leather. With many of the tables you'll see for sale secondhand, the playing surface did not survive. The Poker Table went into production by Italian furniture company Zanotta in 1968. They still feature the table on their website and have it in CAD, so apparently you can still order it.",
