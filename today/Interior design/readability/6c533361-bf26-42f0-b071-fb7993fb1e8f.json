  "text": "The universe is an endless source of inspiration, filled with wonders that ignite our imaginations. Among these celestial dreams is the idea of floating effortlessly on a cloud. Miniforms captures this whimsical vision with its Nebula collection, crafting furniture that embodies the softness and serenity of the skies. With the introduction of the Nebulona Armchair and the Nebulone Sofa, the collection expands its cosmic-inspired aesthetic, offering pieces that invite you to experience a sense of weightlessness and supreme comfort right in your own space. At the heart of the Nebula collection lies a defining feature: the distinctive teardrop-shaped armrests. This signature design element, present in every piece, creates a cohesive language that runs through the entire collection. Even the Pouf mirrors this curvaceous form, ensuring that each element resonates with the same soft, sculptural identity. Designer: Miniforms The Nebulona Armchair exemplifies this aesthetic with its rounded, organic shape. The gracefully curved seat and backrest provide an inviting, cocoon-like embrace, making it an ideal statement piece for both intimate nooks and expansive, open-plan settings. Its sleek yet plush form effortlessly blends modern sophistication with a timeless appeal, ensuring that it remains a standout in any environment. The armchair’s enveloping structure offers a unique visual presence and also provides exceptional ergonomic support, making it a delightful addition to any home or commercial space. The latest addition to the Nebula collection, the Nebulone Sofa, takes the concept of cosmic relaxation even further. Measuring an expansive 240cm in length, this piece extends the collection’s signature design language while prioritizing supreme comfort. Its elongated seat and oversized teardrop-shaped armrests create a luxurious lounging experience, whether you’re stretching out solo or sharing the space with company. Crafted entirely from high-density polyurethane foam, the Nebulone Sofa offers an unparalleled balance of softness and support. Its structural integrity ensures lasting comfort, making it an inviting retreat for everyday relaxation. Furthermore, with over 30 fabric options, including outdoor-friendly materials, the Nebulone adapts effortlessly to diverse settings, from poolside havens to cozy indoor retreats. The wide range of upholstery choices allows users to customize their sofa to fit seamlessly within their existing décor, reinforcing its versatility across various interior styles. Though sitting on an actual cloud may remain an impossible dream, the Nebulona Armchair and Nebulone Sofa offer the next best thing. With their voluminous forms, plush textures, and dreamy silhouettes, they transform any space into a sanctuary of comfort and elegance. Miniforms’ Nebula collection is an invitation to pause, unwind, and embrace the beauty of stillness. As if weary from its cosmic travels, the Nebulona Armchair has decided to linger on Earth, its drop-shaped armrests cradling a plush seat that beckons you to take a well-earned siesta. Whether you choose to daydream or simply sink into its embrace, one thing is certain: the Nebula collection redefines relaxation, merging artful design with celestial comfort. With nearly 30 finishes available, each piece can be customized to suit individual tastes, ensuring that this cosmic comfort finds its perfect place in your world. Designed for those who appreciate both aesthetics and functionality, the Nebula collection brings a touch of the cosmos into everyday life, offering a soothing escape from the ordinary.",
