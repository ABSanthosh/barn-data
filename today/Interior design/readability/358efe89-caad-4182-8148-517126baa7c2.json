  "text": "The vibrant city of Barcelona has welcomed a fresh addition to their streets – the latest location of the celebrated Ukrainian beauty brand, GxBar – thanks to Kyiv-based architectural firm, HVYLYA design. Located at 21 Av. de Sarrià, near the busy Diagonal street, this 1,055-square-foot space gives nod to Mediterranean charm. At first glance, GxBar’s interior speaks the language of Barcelona itself – an interplay of warm Mediterranean hues, subtle sandy tones, and bold blue accents. This design sensibility not only honors the city’s architectural charm but also amplifies the brand’s distinct identity. HVYLYA design has drawn from the local context to create a space that feels both contemporary and rooted in its surroundings. The interior layout has been thoughtfully divided into zones that reflect the diverse services GxBar offers. The front-facing area, visible from the street, serves as a dynamic and engaging introduction to the salon. It features a reception area and stations for manicures, makeup, and hairstyling, blending openness with an inviting sense of privacy. Partially covered display windows ensure that clients enjoy discretion while still showcasing the salon’s sophisticated interior to passersby. In the more secluded sections of the space, attention shifts to tranquility and personalization. A soundproof skincare room, designed with muted colors and tactile finishes, provides a serene retreat for clients. Pedicure zones are equipped with luxurious recliner chairs, evoking the comfort and intimacy of a home theater. These areas embody HVYLYA design’s commitment to balancing functionality with a sense of comfort. Custom furniture and curated decor, including pieces like the Oito mirror by Vania Voitovych and Sled chairs by Vlad Tolochko made by 4 Corners furniture factory, enhance the salon’s visual narrative. The use of warm, sandy-toned plaster on the walls and ceilings lends a cozy backdrop, while rich cobalt blue and fresh pink accents inject a sense of modern sophistication. These elements, paired with metallic finishes, create a balance between luxury and approachability. Founded with a vision to create spaces that captivate and inspire, HVYLYA design has quickly made a name for itself in the world of architecture and interiors. The firm’s projects, including the vibrant GxBar salons, demonstrate a bold approach to design that prioritizes both emotional connection and functional excellence. With a foundation rooted in Kyiv and a growing international presence, HVYLYA design continues to push boundaries, one project at a time. Learn more about HVYLYA design and GxBar here.
