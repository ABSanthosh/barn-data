The series translates auditory expressions into visual and tactile designs, using CAD modeling to generate fluid, organic shapes.The pieces are produced through 3D printing with PLA and TPU on delicate fabric, allowing for a combination of structural rigidity and flexibility. This interaction between materials creates dynamic forms that respond to movement, reflecting the rhythm of sound.all images courtesy of Jiashi YingJiashi Ying’s 3d printed series models fluid, organic shapesBy integrating multiple sensory elements, Sensory Connection examines how wearable design can serve as a medium for emotional communication and self-reflection.
