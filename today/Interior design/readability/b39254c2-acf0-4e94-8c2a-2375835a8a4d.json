  "description": "A motorcyclist riding through rainy weather might coat their visor with a water repellent spray. However, they then have to travel fast enough for wind resistance to blow their visor clear. At slower speeds, their visibility remains compromised.This Bikerguard invention, created by two engineers in Slovenia, is a remote-controlled wiper blade for motorcycle helmet visors. You do have to drive two screws through the top of your visor to attach the mounting base, and you can then pop the Bikerguard on and off as needed. A wireless remote control attaches to your bike's handlebars. The POV demonstration does seem convincing:The developers claim that motorcycle police bodies in Slovenia, Hungary and Germany \"are in the process of evaluating BIKERGUARD for potential integration into their motorcycle fleet.\" In the meantime, they sell these online for €319 (USD $339) a pop. A three-pack of replacement wiper blades runs €25 (USD $27). I wouldn't be surprised if, in the future Oakley develops a visor for runners with one of these attached.",
