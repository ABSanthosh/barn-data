If you have been reading my posts the last few weeks you know that my daughter Mandy’s wedding was coming up. It was this weekend. I wrote this post before going so I could be totally offline all weekend long. The wedding was last night (Saturday)and today it was planned to just hang out at the venue and have a bagel buffet. Then the rest of the day is going to be spent with my family including my two grandkiddies. :-) Once I get home, I will write a post about the weekend. For now though, here are the inspiring links I found over the past week. If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
