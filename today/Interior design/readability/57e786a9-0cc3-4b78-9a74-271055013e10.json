Their flush-mounted House Hydrant is a damn sight better-looking than your standard spigot, and won't freeze. They offer a number of attractive debris cover options.The company has also developed this designey hose reel:The fittings are stainless steel and lead-free, and the 5/8\" hose is 65' long. The unit pivots 180 degrees. By the bye, Aquor's hoses are drinking water safe; they're made from an FDA-approved polyurethane and are phthalate-free.The price was unavailable at press time; though the reel has won a Good Design Award, it's not yet on the market.",
