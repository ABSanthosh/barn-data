  "text": "Architectural design studio Between the Walls took on the challenge of transforming a 721-square-foot apartment in Kyiv’s Comfort Town complex into a space where old-world nostalgia meets modern minimalism. Located on the 16th floor, the Old\u0026New apartment offers sweeping views of the Dnipro River and Kyiv’s urban landscape, perfectly capturing the mix of calm and bustle that defines the homeowner’s lifestyle. The apartment is designed for a client who embraces both a healthy lifestyle and a deep sense of individuality. An avid traveler and active participant in social causes, the homeowner’s vision went beyond typical aesthetic goals, focusing on practical elements that support her well-being. The resulting space reflects her values and personality, with clever design choices that blend functionality and visual appeal. The design of this one-bedroom apartment is both striking and intentional. The green kitchen cabinet, for instance, is not just a bold visual centerpiece but also a multifunctional unit that conceals appliances and storage spaces. Inspired by American minimalist Donald Judd, the kitchen table and shelving units maintain a clean, refined simplicity that contrasts with the more textured and nostalgic elements of the home. One of the standout features of the living room is a plush pale pink sofa that serves as the seating for movie watching via a projector. Suspended from the ceiling and a specially treated wall for optimal image projection, the apartment transforms into a personal cinema – reflecting the client’s desire for high-end amenities without unnecessary excess. The bedroom strikes a warm and familiar tone with vintage carpets, rounded lighting, and wooden details that evoke the comfort of a grandparent’s home, a request from the client. These design elements are thoughtfully juxtaposed with the industrial edge of exposed concrete ceilings. A striking wooden propeller doubling as a light fixture and ceiling fan offers a whimsical touch to the room, merging the traditional with the unconventional. In the primary bathroom, the aesthetic takes a vintage turn, with green tiles, stone countertops, and an antique-style mirror creating an atmosphere that feels both timeless and fresh. The bathtub, slightly elevated on a podium and shielded by a terracotta curtain, offers an oasis within the urban landscape – ideal for unwinding after a busy day in the city. Originally scheduled to begin in early 2022, the project faced significant delays due to the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Despite the unpredictable circumstances, the client decided to resume the renovation later, a testament to her determination to move forward and reclaim a sense of normalcy. While Kyiv struggled with power outages and the constant threat of air raids, the design team navigated supply chain issues, sourcing materials internationally. With chief designer Victoria Karieva temporarily residing in France, crucial items were imported to ensure the project’s completion. This resourcefulness gives nod to the studio’s resilience and commitment to delivering high-quality designs, even in the most challenging conditions.
