  "text": "Can we talk about that post-holiday feeling? You know the one – where the twinkling lights are packed away, and the house feels a bit empty? I’ve been there, sitting in my farmhouse, looking at the bare spots where all the Christmas magic once lived. But here’s what keeps me going: the promise of fresh starts and new seasons ahead. I just had to share something that’s bringing me so much joy right now – Target’s new spring collections from two of my absolute favorite collaborations: Hearth \u0026 Hand with Magnolia and Studio McGee. Walking through those aisles feels like stepping into a breath of fresh air after the heavy richness of holiday decor.For those of you feeling that post-holiday dip (I see you, and I get it), try this: grab your favorite warm drink, head to Target, and let yourself dream a little about the season ahead. Sometimes just touching those fresh linens or arranging a few new pieces on a shelf can lift our spirits in ways we didn’t expect. Remember, our homes are always evolving, just like we are. And there’s something beautiful about that journey, even in the quiet moments between seasons. Thank you so much for stopping by the blog today and everyother day it truly means a lot to us here on the farm. You can keep up with daily content, exclusive links, and more, here! As always Stay Cozy!xxLizMarie",
