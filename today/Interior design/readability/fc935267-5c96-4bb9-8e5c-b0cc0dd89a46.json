  "text": "MSCHF and mercedes-AMG team up in furniture exhibitionDuring its NYCxDesign Week 2025 exhibition, MSCHF recycles parts of a Mercedes-AMG sports car into furniture that’s not for automotive use. That’s actually the name of the show: Not for Automotive Use. For the first time since its founding, the art collective opens its garage door to the public. The spot becomes a three-day showroom, taking place in MSCHF’s Greenpoint, street-level workshop. When visitors stroll inside, it’s dark except for the rays of spotlight beaming onto the collection. There’s a chair made of seatbelt straps and a clothes rack made of such, too.Soon, visitors realize it’s a seatbelt fest, at least for the few pieces, including the lighting design shaped like a drawing compass, the ping-pong table, and the three-decked shelf. The Mercedes-AMG sports car tire? MSCHF turns it into an electric fan for the exhibition. The pedal? A trash can. The headrest remains a chair, while the headlights are embedded into a vehicle-looking couch designed as a Mercedes-AMG sports car. MSCHF also creates a grill with the recognizable star emblem of Mercedes-Benz, and the last in the exhibition is a hanger imprinted with the AMG logo.Casey Neistat for the Not for Automotive Use | all images courtesy of MSCHF; campaign photos by Kyle Bergerparts sourced directly from manufacturersThe MSCHF and Mercedes-AMG exhibition during NYCxDesign Week 2025 is a homage to Italy’s Radical Design counterculture movement of the 1960s. The art collective experiments with the materials they have at hand, all of which come from the engineered components of the car company’s vehicle. MSCHF likens its approach to Achille Castiglioni (1918-2002), the Milanese designer who integrated a tractor and bicycle seating into his chair design. That tribute comes through, starting with the seatbelt straps around the chair. MSCHF says that the exhibition pieces made with Mercedes-AMG parts are conceptual explorations, just like their other stunts in the past. Each work is custom-made using parts sourced directly from AMG manufacturers. MSCHF says that after the exhibition, the Mercedes-AMG collection is available on a made-to-order basis in limited quantities. There’s even a series of merchandise, including t-shirts, sweatshirts, caps, work jackets and trousers. They come with detailed scans of original AMG vehicle components. There are also accessories like a custom fragrance tree shaped like an apple tree. It’s a subtle nod to Affalterbach, AMG’s birthplace, whose name translates to apple tree on the brook in old German. The Mercedes-AMG collection and exhibition runs in MSCHF’s Brooklyn studio from May 14th and 17th.there’s a chair made of seatbelt straps from a Mercedes-AMG vehiclethere’s also a seat made of headreststhe art collective turns the car pedal into the foot of a trash binthe headlights become the face of a sports-car-looking couchdetailed view of the seat made of headrests",
