  "text": "A native of Denmark, Stine Find Osther embraced artistic pursuits at an early age. She explored a range of media, from painting to sculpture, even before her formal design education began. Drawn to color and tactility, Osther focused on the path ahead. “I have always known my way forward – and creativity has always been the driver,” she says. “That I ended up studying textile design was a bit of a coincidence, but I haven’t looked back since.” Osther earned her master’s degree in 2005, and just two years later she was working on the product development team at global textile brand Kvadrat. Now the vice president of design, she is responsible for the overall creative direction of the business, which includes all of the company’s brands. In her role, Osther collaborates with a diverse group of external designers, from rising stars to internationally renowned names. These individuals all bring in expertise from different fields, and Osther serves not only as a guide, but also as a translator. She makes sure to balance Kvadrat’s DNA with various influences to offer collections that meld past and present. Art uplifts Osther, particularly the canvases by fellow Dane, Erik A. Frandsen. She went to the artist’s 2002 exhibit, “In the Shadow of Light,” eight times, fascinated by his deft use of tints. The show set the tone for her professional endeavors, as she realized that someone could truly specialize in color. Even though Osther is surrounded by fabrics, the building blocks of language are another source of inspiration for her. “Alone, in pairs, sentences, or longer paragraphs, words are imperative in my creative process,” she notes. “I typically record ideas with words accompanied by a visual component – combining the two for creative mind mapping.” Today, Stine Find Osther joins us for Friday Five!

Frandsen exhibition mentioned above, I have dreamed about ‘a home’ with one of his paintings. I feel extremely fortunate to now own one of his pieces as it bridges a longtime inspiration with the present of my life today. I love that I’m able to share this with my family and to bring it with me into the future. 2. Alphabet Poetry by Inger Christensen Inger Christensen is one of Denmark’s most well-known poets and was one of Europe’s leading contemporary experimentalists of her generation, winning multiple awards. My visual brain explodes when I read or listen to her Alphabet collection, and I continue to return to it for inspiration. Photo: Stine Find Osther 3. Lucky Clover This ties back to my untapped talent of finding lucky clovers. They are a constant in my life grounding me and providing me with inspiration. Photos: Stine Find Osther 4. The view from my home I continue to be in awe of and inspired by the change of light and color compositions from the view in my living room. The view is different every day, yet familiar, and beautiful in its own way all year around. 5. Music – Eight Arms to Hold You by Jacob Bellens Music is as important to me as colors. This piece holds a special place in my heart, and I walked down the aisle to this song performed live by Jacob Bellens himself, when my husband and I were (re)married. We plan on getting re-married again and again as these moments are fueling our memories forever with joy.
