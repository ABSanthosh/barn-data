  "text": "The handheld gaming PC market just got a lot more colorful. Shenzhen-based One-Netbook has unveiled its upcoming OneXPlayer Youxia X1 Pro EVA Limited Edition, a striking collaboration that marries cutting-edge portable gaming technology with one of anime’s most iconic franchises. Designer: One-Netbook This isn’t just another gaming device with a fancy paint job. The new limited edition model features a globally exclusive “Unit-02 Asuka” color scheme inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion, the groundbreaking anime series that continues to influence popular culture decades after its debut. What immediately catches the eye is the bold red and orange chassis, instantly recognizable to fans of the series as Asuka Langley Soryu’s distinctive EVA unit. One-Netbook has gone beyond mere aesthetic homage, incorporating dynamic RGB light blade effects that recreate the anime’s tense “cockpit combat atmosphere” when gaming. The attention to detail extends throughout the design, with the CNC-machined aviation-grade aluminum alloy frame featuring numerous franchise-specific industrial design elements. But impressive visuals mean nothing without the hardware to back them up. Powerhouse Performance in Your Hands At the heart of this special edition device beats Intel’s latest Core Ultra 7 255H processor, part of the new Arrow Lake-H series. This 16-core chip can boost up to 5.1GHz, providing substantial computing power that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in a handheld form factor. Graphics processing comes courtesy of the integrated Intel Arc 140T GPU, which early benchmarks suggest performs comparably to the Radeon 890M found in the AMD variant of the X1 Pro. Interestingly, the Arc 140T appears to outperform its AMD counterpart in non-gaming benchmarks, suggesting superior general computing capabilities. The device comes loaded with 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM running at 8400MHz and a spacious 2TB PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD storage solution. This combination delivers considerable horsepower for both gaming and productivity tasks, ensuring the device can handle everything from AAA gaming titles to creative workloads. Visual fidelity is maintained through a 10.95-inch 2560×1600 (2.5K) fully laminated LTPS display running at a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. This high-quality touchscreen provides an immersive visual experience, whether you’re deep in a gaming session or consuming media. Versatility Redefined What truly sets the OneXPlayer X1 Pro apart from other gaming handhelds is its innovative modular design. The device features detachable controllers that support three distinct usage modes: Combined handheld configuration for traditional portable gaming Separated tablet/controller setup for a more comfortable experience External keyboard/mouse peripheral connectivity for productivity tasks This “3-in-1 PC hybrid” approach redefines portable gaming by allowing seamless transitions between handheld gaming, tablet productivity, and desktop workstation modes. The included magnetic keyboard attachment and controller stand further enhance this versatility. For serious gamers, the controllers feature Hall-effect linear triggers and dual customizable rear buttons in an Xbox-style layout, providing precise control and customization options. Connectivity and Expansion One notable hardware upgrade in this model is the shift from USB4 to Thunderbolt 4 ports, offering improved peripheral compatibility and data transfer speeds. The device also includes a USB-A 3.2 port and microSD card reader for additional connectivity options. An OCuLink port provides eGPU support, allowing users to connect external graphics cards for enhanced performance when docked. This feature essentially transforms the handheld into a capable gaming desktop when at home. Wireless connectivity hasn’t been overlooked either, with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 ensuring fast and reliable wireless connections for online gaming and peripheral pairing. Limited Availability and Pricing As with most limited edition collaborations, the OneXPlayer X1 Pro EVA Asuka Edition will be produced in restricted quantities, making it a potentially valuable collector’s item for both gaming enthusiasts and Evangelion fans. While official pricing hasn’t been announced, it’s expected to command a premium over the standard X1 Pro models. For reference, the 2023 Youxia X1 Pro model, equipped with AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, launched with configurations starting at 8,699 RMB (approximately $1,200 USD). Based on recent information, the EVA Limited Edition with its 64GB RAM and 2TB storage configuration is likely to be priced around $1,649.99, positioning it firmly in the high-end segment of the handheld gaming PC market. Final Thoughts The OneXPlayer X1 Pro EVA Asuka Limited Edition represents a significant advancement in portable gaming PC technology. By combining Intel’s powerful Arrow Lake-H processor with ample RAM and storage in a versatile 3-in-1 form factor, it offers genuine desktop-class performance in a device that can function as a handheld console, tablet, and laptop. The Evangelion-inspired design adds collecting appeal beyond pure technical specifications, though the premium price point positions it firmly in the high-end segment of the market. For enthusiasts seeking maximum performance in a portable form factor—particularly those with an appreciation for anime aesthetics—this limited edition represents a compelling, if expensive, option in the increasingly competitive handheld gaming PC landscape. One-Netbook’s collaboration with the Evangelion franchise demonstrates how gaming hardware is increasingly intersecting with pop culture, creating devices that serve as both functional tools and collectible expressions of fandom. Whether this trend continues will likely depend on the success of limited runs like this one. Pre-orders are expected to open soon, with shipping anticipated to begin between April 15 and April 30, 2025. Given the limited production run, interested buyers are encouraged to act quickly once sales begin.",
