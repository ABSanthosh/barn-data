Obviously, you’re going to need a set of dining chairs and a table of some kind, but picking out the right furniture really comes down to what the space looks like: is it casual and open-plan? Or more formal? If you live in an apartment, a circular table like Fenton \u0026 Fenton’s Soiree Dining Table is a great option to turn a compact corner into a cosy dining area for everyday breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. The Kin Dining Table by Eva crafted from solid American oak timber is another versatile piece, available as a four or six-seater, making it a perfect hub for homes both big and small. Our pick for one of the most timeless dining chairs of all time is the No. 811 Hoffman from Thonet. Designed in the 1920s, the elegant bentwood chair is handmade in Europe to feature a woven cane seat and back for extra comfort. We love seeing these styled with a timber table, but don’t be afraid to mix and match materials in your dining room. Something like the Nau Molloy Chair from Cult and the Wyrie Dining Table by New Volumes, made from slabs of Elba marble would create a striking and sculptural centrepiece fit for a dinner party. Perhaps the biggest mistake you can make when furnishing your dining room is picking uncomfortable chairs, just because they look nice! The Titus Dining Chair by Trit House has a luxurious upholstered boucle seat and matching armrests, so you don’t have to sacrifice on style or support. For those who love hosting their extended family on a weekly basis, you’ll need furniture that’s substantial and sturdy. King Living’s Quay Dining Table comes in a range of customisable finishes, so you can pair timber with a stone tabletop, or powder coated legs with ceramic. And there’s also an extendable design that can seat between six and eight guests, depending on who’s coming for dinner! Want to see more?
