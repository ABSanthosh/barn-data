  "text": "Nestled in the heart of Billund, Denmark, an exciting design story unfolds. CEBRA, a renowned architecture firm, is designing the LEGO Innovation Campus for LEGO – a workplace brimming with creativity, sustainability, and playfulness. With 50,000 sqm designated as a creative hub for over 1,700 staff, including more than 600 designers, this campus ensures the vibrant pulse of LEGO product innovation directly connects to its product-making reality, with easy access to the adjacent LEGO factories. Anchor elements of LEGO’s world-renowned building bricks permeate the Innovation Campus’s design through its modularity. The campus comprises six interlocking modules, each soaring to four stories high. Seamlessly woven within these innovative modules is the heart of the campus, a central artery coined the ‘PlayWay.’ Linking different regions within the campus, the PlayWay triggers a harmonious, flexible environment facilitating flowing communication, chance encounters, and sharing of ideas. It’s a seamless blend of architectural brilliance and LEGO’s modular principle. Designer: CEBRA A commitment to sustainable design is evident within the campus. Generous skylights maximize daylight, creating well-lit, inviting interiors. Incorporated green spaces offer employees areas for relaxation and informal discussions. The use of timber in the building’s construction resonates with LEGO’s dedication to environmental sustainability. A key part of the design process was employee involvement. Staff were invited to use LEGO bricks to model their ideal workspaces, turning the act of design into a team activity. These prototypes informed the final layout and features of the campus, ensuring that the building would truly serve the needs and desires of its users. This collaborative method echoes LEGO’s brand values of creativity, inclusivity, and hands-on problem-solving. The most impressive feature is the campus’s library of LEGO elements. Billed as the world’s largest, it contains around 20,000 different LEGO pieces in 70 colors. This vast collection serves as both a resource and an inspiration for designers and engineers working on new projects. By placing this library at the center of the building, the campus becomes a physical manifestation of the company’s creative spirit and a wellspring for future innovation – it truly embodies the LEGO spirit! The LEGO Innovation Campus represents a significant shift in workplace design that goes beyond the traditional confines of an office to create a dynamic, creative, and sustainable environment. The campus represents LEGO’s deeply ingrained principles and aspirations, designed to inspire employees each day. Beyond merely a physical structure, the campus is a groundbreaking symbol in design, aiming to set the stage for global architectural advancements.",
