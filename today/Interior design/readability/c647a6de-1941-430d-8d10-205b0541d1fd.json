  "text": "Products for cat owners have become such a hit these past years. Previously, it was just mostly for dogs but now cat parents also have a lot of options to choose from. Cat towers are popular in particular especially for those who live in areas where their fur babies don’t have outdoor areas to play around in. While you can buy those that are already assembled or can be easily assembled, it would also be nice to have something more flexible. Designer: Lin Seongmin This is the idea behind the Petterior stacking cat tower concept. It’s a modular design that can fit the personality of their cat and the owners’ design preferences as well. It also is able to become a space for your playful cat to enjoy their freedom even though your living area may be a bit limited. The set has different elements that can be put together including various flat surfaces, round, or rather oblong shaped beds, and various connectors and screws. You can assemble and disassemble these on your own according to your preference. It should also probably come in various colors to also match the color and aesthetic the cat owner is going for. The fact that it’s modular also means that in case some of the parts get lost or broken, you need to only replace those parts or you can buy other parts to make the cat tower different. It’s a concept that cat lovers will probably embrace especially the ones that want to have their pet accessories still match their space’s look while at the same time giving their pets the fun and freedom.",
