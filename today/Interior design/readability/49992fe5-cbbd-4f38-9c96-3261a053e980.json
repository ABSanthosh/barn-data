A revolutionary new furniture collection is challenging conventional design paradigms by harnessing neuroaesthetics and biophilic principles. Acclaimed industrial designer Von Robinson of Play Orbit Studio has partnered with healthcare furnishing leader Kwalu to create the Ellie Collection, a groundbreaking seating series that transforms patient care through emotional connection and nature-inspired design. Designer: Von Robinson of Play Orbit Studio Debuting at NeoCon 2025 in Chicago, the Ellie Collection represents a significant evolution in healthcare furniture, where form and function merge with therapeutic intention. This innovative series features a patient recliner and sleeper sofa, specifically engineered to promote healing, facilitate early mobility, and foster meaningful connections between patients, caregivers, and the built environment. The Science of Healing Spaces The Ellie Collection stands at the intersection of neuroscience and design, incorporating biophilic elements that research has shown can measurably impact human well-being. By combining natural forms, materials, and rhythms, these pieces are designed to soothe the brain’s amygdala, lower stress levels, boost mood, reduce heart rate, and inspire action. “Thoughtfully designed using natural forms, materials, and rhythms, Ellie humanizes the patient experience, softening cold, harsh clinical spaces by addressing holistic well-being,” explains Robinson. “With Ellie, we used a lot of curves. We are made of curves, nature is made of curves, and curves help healing. We sought to establish this nonverbal communication between the person and the object. Ellie reinforces the idea that beauty and form are not a luxury, but a therapeutic imperative.” This approach aligns with growing scientific evidence supporting the role of neuroaesthetics in healthcare design. Recent studies have shown that exposure to nature-inspired elements can significantly reduce recovery times, decrease the need for pain medication, and improve overall patient outcomes. The Ellie Collection translates these scientific insights into tangible design solutions that benefit both patients and healthcare providers. Beyond Conventional Healthcare Furniture Unlike traditional healthcare seating that often prioritizes function over aesthetics and comfort, the Ellie Collection features an emotionally attuned, non-medical aesthetic that reduces anxiety while supporting clinical needs. The collection’s graceful contours and innovative “embrace back” gently cradle users, providing non-stigmatizing passive lateral support that encourages upright posture. The recliner component includes specially integrated footrests that tuck under the seat for optimal sit-to-stand positioning, a feature that actively encourages patients to transition out of bed. This seemingly simple design element serves a crucial clinical purpose, as early mobility is directly linked to improved health outcomes and faster recovery times. Robinson brings deep expertise to this project, drawing on his experience as Principal Designer at Steelcase Health, where he specialized in sensing technologies and human-object interaction. This background informs the collection’s nuanced approach to supporting patient autonomy, caregiver ease, and meaningful interaction between care partners. Clinical Functionality Meets Aesthetic Excellence While the Ellie Collection’s biophilic inspiration creates a visually soothing presence, it does not compromise on clinical functionality. The recliner offers a comprehensive suite of features aligned with modern healthcare standards, including integrated push bars, IV pole holders, foley bag hooks, transfer arms, and optional heat and massage capabilities. The companion sleeper sofa extends the collection’s thoughtful design approach, providing visual continuity between family and patient zones. This multifunctional piece invites care partners into the healing space with options for rest, work, or simply being present. Additional features include integrated tables, storage compartments, power access, and smooth, mechanism-free recline options that enhance versatility while reducing noise. “Every detail of Ellie has been carefully considered to instill comfort, care, and performance,” says David Carlson, VP Product Development at Kwalu. “Von’s work is grounded in empathy. Using a human-centered, insight-driven process, he has created a dynamic collection that addresses the real-world needs of both patients and caregivers, reinforcing a sense of healing, purpose, and connection.” Durability Meets Sustainability The Ellie Collection is engineered for the demanding healthcare environment, where furniture must withstand continuous use and rigorous cleaning protocols. Kwalu’s proprietary Protea material provides a non-porous surface that resists scuffs while meeting healthcare-grade cleaning requirements, all while maintaining a refined aesthetic that feels more residential than institutional. This durability factor extends the furniture’s lifecycle, an important consideration for healthcare facilities seeking sustainable solutions. Backed by a 10-year warranty, the Ellie Collection offers lasting performance that reduces replacement frequency and associated environmental impacts. The Future of Healthcare Design The Ellie Collection represents a significant step forward in the evolution of healthcare environments. By integrating neuroaesthetic principles with clinical functionality, these pieces demonstrate how thoughtful design can contribute to the healing process itself. As healthcare facilities increasingly recognize the impact of the built environment on patient outcomes, collections like Ellie provide evidence-based solutions that benefit all stakeholders. Patients experience reduced anxiety and increased comfort, caregivers gain practical tools that support their work, and healthcare systems potentially see improved outcomes and patient satisfaction scores. The collection is particularly suited for inpatient settings, including acute care and med-surgical environments, where patient comfort and early mobility are critical factors in recovery. As healthcare continues to evolve toward more patient-centered approaches, the Ellie Collection offers a template for how furniture can actively contribute to therapeutic goals. Von Robinson’s collaboration with Kwalu highlights the growing importance of specialized design expertise in healthcare environments. By bringing his insight-driven approach to this collection, Robinson demonstrates how industrial design can address complex healthcare challenges through thoughtful, empathetic solutions. The Ellie Collection will be on display at NeoCon 2025 in the Kwalu Showroom at THE MART (#1199), where visitors can experience firsthand how these innovative pieces are poised to transform healthcare spaces through the power of neuroaesthetics and human-centered design.",
