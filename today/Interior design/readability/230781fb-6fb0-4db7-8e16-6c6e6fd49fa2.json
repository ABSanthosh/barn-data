  "description": "In a bid to reduce plastic bag use, Thailand-based company Tiptop Things Kickstarted this Nanobag back in 2018. It's made out of ripstop nylon, and the idea is that it folds down to pocket-sized, yet can expand to hold 50 lbs. It's an ultracompact alternative to tote bags. Demand was strong and in the years since, the company has held nearly a dozen successful Kickstarters featuring updated versions of the bag. Their latest is this Nanobag Daypack, which features a YKK zipper and can expand to hold 66 lbs, or 16 liters. It's a verified smash: At press time they had $272,000 in pledges, with 22 days left in the campaign. Buy-in starts at $21.",
