  "text": "There are some notable names in the watchmaking sphere that have a different take on the concept of timepieces with their larger-than-life dials. URWERK and MB\u0026F particularly have this idea of watchmaking that distinguishes their watches from the others at the first gawk. What really is stuck with them are darker hues, but this one particular time, URWREK is actually making a detour from that overpowering love for black and gray-toned cases. The Swiss watchmaker has unveiled the second iteration of its 230 series with the launch of this UR-230 Polaris, which in its white exuberating self, ventures on an unceasing quest to rethink the basics of the series’ design whilst preserving its aesthetics and strength. Following the success of the UR-230 Eagle constructed from a block of fiberglass-enhanced ceramic in white comes the UR-230 Polaris. Designer: URWERK The new white-colored model comes in a 44.81mm-sized ceramic-based composite case and brings a new perspective to URWERK’s interesting lineup. The radiant white encompassing an all-black UR-7.30 caliber movement gives the watch a nice panda effect. The dial is uniquely laid out with white numerals and satellite complication and it rests within a 53.55mm long and 18.38mm thick trapeze-shaped case elongating toward 6 o’clock. The new UR-230 Polaris provides a very legible and unobstructed view of time in its futuristic design overpowered by a three-armed carousel with four-hour numerals. The current hour is prominently displayed on a semicircular section running along the watch base spanning 4 to 8 o’clock. It is not only the façade marked by the white ceramic case that really stands out about the UR-230 Polaris, the watch is equally exciting on back reverse side as well. It features a contrasting black DLC titanium caseback and comes paired with a vulcanized rubber strap – again in a white hue with the black accent at the buckle. The UR-230 Polaris is strictly limited to only 35 examples that the interested can bag for 150,000 CHF (approximately $169,000).",
