  "text": "Lighting makes or breaks a space. And when it’s something as versatile as the DORESshop LED night light, you’re only making an incredibly intimate ambiance! Whether you need gentle illumination for the night or a soft glow to create a cozy atmosphere, this dimmable night light is just the right pick. Equipped with a dusk-to-dawn sensor, this night light automatically turns on as the sun sets and switches off when daylight returns. No more fumbling for switches or worrying about unnecessary power usage—it’s smart, efficient, and hassle-free. With its dimmable brightness ranging from 0lm to 60lm, you can customize the glow to suit your needs. Choose a subtle light for a nursery or kids’ room. Or increase the brightness for hallways and stairways to guide your way at night. This eco-friendly night light consumes just 1W of power. So, it’s kind to both the environment and your electricity bill. Its energy efficiency makes it an ideal choice for long-term use in spaces like bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and more. Last but not the least—the minimalist cube-like design in soft white adds a touch of understated sophistication to your home decor. And its compact design can fit neatly into outlets without obstructing the second socket.Find it now on Amazon.",
