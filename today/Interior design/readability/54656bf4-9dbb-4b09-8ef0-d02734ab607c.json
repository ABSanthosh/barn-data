After spending time with the Golden Black variant, I can confirm this device lives up to its ambitious claims. Designer: Huawei Unboxing the Pura 80 Ultra in Golden Black immediately sets expectations high. The device arrives in premium packaging with clean lines and minimal branding that lets the product speak for itself. The Golden Black finish catches light differently depending on the angle, creating subtle shifts between deep black and warm golden accents around the camera module. Despite the substantial 233.5-gram mass, weight distribution feels balanced in hand. The 8.3mm thickness makes it comfortable to hold during extended photography sessions. The triangular camera bump commands attention without feeling excessive, housing what Huawei claims is the most advanced telephoto system ever integrated into a smartphone. Build quality meets flagship standards, with the 2nd-Gen Crystal Armor Kunlun Glass providing confidence during daily handling. Setting up the Pura 80 Ultra proved remarkably straightforward when migrating from my Mate XT. The data transfer process took less than 20 minutes for a complete clone of apps, settings, and personal data. EMUI handled the migration seamlessly, maintaining app layouts and preserving notification preferences without requiring manual reconfiguration. Face unlock and fingerprint registration worked flawlessly on the first attempt, while network connectivity established automatically. For global users like myself, EMUI’s Android foundation enables complete app ecosystem access through sideloading. I successfully installed Google Play Services and the full suite of Google apps, creating an experience identical to using a Samsung device. This means access to Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Pay, and the entire Play Store ecosystem without the limitations that plagued earlier Huawei devices. Note: This represents my initial hands-on experience with the Pura 80 Ultra while working on the comprehensive review. The full review will follow shortly with detailed performance testing, battery life analysis, and extensive camera comparisons. The Included Case: A Premium Touch One pleasant surprise in the box is the included case, which immediately stands out as more than just a throwaway accessory. The case features a sophisticated design with embossed triangular patterns across the back surface, creating a subtle geometric texture that complements the phone’s triangular camera module design language. The case appears to be made from a premium TPU material with a matte finish that resists fingerprints while providing excellent grip. The embossed triangle pattern isn’t just aesthetic – it adds functional texture that prevents the phone from sliding on smooth surfaces. The pattern catches light subtly, creating visual interest without being overly flashy. What impressed me most is the attention to detail around the camera cutout. The case features a raised lip around the camera module that provides protection when placing the phone face-down, while the precise cutout ensures no interference with the advanced telephoto system. The camera ring appears to have a slightly different finish that coordinates with the Golden Black phone’s accents. The button covers feel responsive and maintain the tactile feedback of the original buttons, while the charging port cutout is generous enough to accommodate various cable types. The case adds minimal bulk to the already substantial device, maintaining the premium feel while providing practical protection. Factory-installed screen protector: Even better, Huawei includes a pre-applied screen protector that’s perfectly aligned and bubble-free straight from the factory. This isn’t just a basic plastic film – it feels like a quality tempered glass protector that maintains the display’s touch sensitivity and clarity. Having this professionally applied at the factory eliminates the frustration of trying to install screen protectors yourself, and it’s ready to protect your investment from day one. It’s refreshing to see Huawei include both a quality case and pre-installed screen protection rather than the basic accessories that many manufacturers bundle. These feel like accessories you’d actually want to use long-term, not just temporary solutions until you buy replacements. Dual Telephoto System: The Real Game Changer The switchable dual telephoto system delivers exactly what Huawei promised during the Dubai announcement. Transitioning between 3.7x and 10x optical zoom happens instantaneously through the camera interface, with no perceptible delay or quality degradation. To put this in perspective, the 3.7x zoom translates to roughly 90mm in traditional camera terms, which is perfect for portrait photography where you want to isolate subjects without getting uncomfortably close. The 10x zoom reaches approximately 240mm equivalent, bringing distant subjects close enough to capture details that would otherwise require physically moving much closer. This range covers everything from flattering headshots to architectural details on tall buildings, or capturing candid moments from across a room. The telephoto sensor features a 1/1.4-inch size with f/2.1 aperture at 3.7x and f/3.5 at 10x are significantly larger than competing telephoto implementations that typically use 1/2.3-inch sensors. This size advantage translates to better light gathering capability and improved image quality across the entire zoom range. Testing the 10x portrait mode produced results that rival dedicated cameras. I could photograph people from comfortable distances while achieving that compressed perspective that makes portraits look more flattering and professional than standard smartphone cameras. Spatial compression at maximum zoom creates dramatic perspective effects, making mountains appear closer to foreground subjects or creating that telephoto look where background elements stack together. The telephoto sensor captures fine details at distances that would challenge most smartphone cameras, maintaining color accuracy and sharpness across the entire zoom range. Testing various lighting conditions revealed consistent performance, with the larger sensor gathering sufficient light even when shooting handheld at maximum zoom. Video recording through the dual telephoto system opens creative possibilities I’ve never experienced on mobile devices. The ability to smoothly transition between focal lengths during recording creates cinematic effects without the jarring quality shifts typical of digital zoom systems. At 90mm equivalent, I captured intimate conversation scenes with natural perspective, while the 240mm equivalent let me film subjects from across large spaces without disturbing natural behavior. Stabilization remains effective at both zoom levels, compensating for hand movement that becomes magnified at longer focal lengths. The optical image stabilization system works with electronic stabilization to produce smooth footage even when walking or tracking moving subjects. Low-light performance through the telephoto system exceeded my expectations, with the larger sensor gathering sufficient light for usable footage even in challenging conditions. Testing the main camera’s 1-inch RYYB sensor revealed the advantages of increased light gathering capability over traditional smartphone sensors. RYYB (Red, Yellow, Yellow, Blue) is a sensor design that captures more light than traditional RGB sensors by replacing one green pixel with yellow. Night photography produces clean images with minimal noise, while daylight shots exhibit enhanced dynamic range and color depth approaching dedicated camera territory. Processing algorithms work efficiently to combine multiple exposures into single images that maintain natural appearance without the over-processed look common in computational photography. The Ultra Chroma Camera ensures color accuracy remains consistent across different lighting conditions, from tungsten indoor lighting to daylight outdoor scenes. Software Integration and Daily Usage EMUI feels mature and responsive throughout daily interactions, delivering performance that matches the hardware capabilities without unnecessary bloatware. App launching happens without delay, while multitasking between demanding applications maintains smooth performance even when switching between camera-intensive tasks and productivity applications. The AI Smart Controls Button configuration adds genuine utility once properly set up. I configured the double-tap gesture to launch Gemini, creating instant access to AI assistance without navigating through multiple screens. The button’s tactile feedback provides confirmation of successful activation, while fingerprint recognition adds security to sensitive functions without slowing down access times. Battery performance during intensive camera usage remains impressive throughout extended shooting sessions. The 5170mAh capacity supports hours of continuous photography and video recording without reaching critical levels. The 100W wired charging can restore 50% battery capacity in approximately 20 minutes, while the 80W wireless charging provides similar convenience without cable management. The camera interface integrates seamlessly with EMUI, providing intuitive controls for advanced functions without overwhelming casual users. Professional mode offers granular control over exposure settings, focus points, and color balance for users who want manual control. Automatic modes handle complex scenarios with minimal user intervention, using AI processing to optimize settings based on scene recognition and subject detection. Image processing happens efficiently in the background, with edited photos appearing in the gallery within seconds of capture. Night mode processing takes approximately 3-5 seconds depending on lighting conditions, while portrait mode processing completes nearly instantaneously thanks to the dedicated neural processing unit. Build Quality and Design Excellence Physical construction quality meets the standards expected from a flagship device. The Golden Black finish resists fingerprints better than glossy alternatives while maintaining visual appeal under various lighting conditions. Button placement feels natural during single-handed operation, with the power button and volume controls positioned for easy access without accidental activation. The camera module sits flush enough to prevent excessive rocking when placed on flat surfaces, while the protective glass maintains clarity without distortion. Material choices throughout the device reflect premium positioning, with metal frame construction providing structural integrity while maintaining comfortable ergonomics. The 2nd-Gen Crystal Armor Kunlun Glass provides confidence during daily handling, with drop protection improvements apparent through the solid feel and impact resistance. Screen clarity remains excellent under various lighting conditions, with the LTPO OLED panel adjusting refresh rates seamlessly based on content requirements. The 6.8-inch display features 2848 x 1276 resolution with 460 PPI pixel density, delivering sharp text and images across all viewing distances. Touch responsiveness feels precise across the entire display surface, with palm rejection working effectively during camera operation. The display coating resists smudges and fingerprints while maintaining smooth touch response, even when hands are slightly damp. Peak brightness reaches 1600 nits for outdoor visibility, while minimum brightness drops to 1 nit for comfortable nighttime use. Port placement and speaker configuration support practical usage patterns without compromising design aesthetics. The USB-C connector aligns properly with charging cables and accessories, while the speaker grilles produce clear audio for video playback and calls without distortion at high volumes. The device maintains comfortable ergonomics despite its substantial camera system, with weight distribution that prevents fatigue during extended use. Chinese vs Global Version: What You Need to Know Understanding the differences between versions helps potential buyers make informed decisions. The Chinese version runs HarmonyOS 5.1 with full AI features and native integration, while the global version uses EMUI based on Android. However, the global version’s Android foundation allows complete Google services integration through sideloading, creating functionality identical to mainstream Android devices. Battery capacity differs significantly between versions, with the Chinese variant featuring a 5700mAh battery compared to the global version’s 5170mAh capacity. This 530mAh difference translates to approximately 10% more battery life for the Chinese version, though both versions support the same 100W wired and 80W wireless charging speeds. Pricing reflects regional market positioning, with the Chinese version starting at ¥9,999 (approximately $1,380) for 16GB+512GB configuration, while the global version commands approximately €1,220 (about $1,320) for similar specifications. Both versions share identical hardware specifications including the 6.8-inch LTPO OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, Kirin 9020 chipset, 16GB RAM options, and the same camera system with dual telephoto setup. Water resistance remains consistent across both versions with IP69 rating, while the 2nd-Gen Crystal Armor Kunlun Glass protection applies to both variants. The key decision factors become software preference, regional availability, and whether the additional battery capacity in the Chinese version justifies the software trade-offs for international users.
