  "text": "The world’s largest wooden structure, the Grand Ring, has now been completed. This impressive architectural feat forms a huge circular loop, featuring a walkway that runs along its top. Measuring approximately 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) in circumference, the Grand Ring stands out as a remarkable new landmark. It was created specifically for the Osaka 2025 Expo, an event currently taking place in Japan. The design comes from Sou Fujimoto Architects, who are renowned for their innovative and creative approach to architecture. The Grand Ring serves as both an attraction and a functional space for visitors. Designer: Sou Fujimoto Architects The structure was built using a combination of modern construction techniques and traditional Nuki joints, a Japanese woodworking method that connects pieces without the use of nails or screws. The majority of the wood used is local cypress and cedar, with some Scots pine incorporated as well. This approach not only highlights regional materials but also traditional craftsmanship. Officially certified by Guinness World Records, the structure holds the title of the largest wooden structure in the world. It measures 30 meters in width and has an outer edge diameter of approximately 675 meters. The structure encircles the Expo site and features the Sky Walk, a walkway positioned 12 meters above ground level. The Sky Walk is lined with a variety of flowers, creating a scenic route for visitors. From the walkway, people can enjoy panoramic views of the many Expo pavilions as well as the surrounding landscape, making it both functional and visually appealing. “The Grand Ring is the symbol of Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan, and expresses the concept of Unity in Diversity,” stated the Expo’s press release. “It is constructed using a fusion of modern construction methods and traditional Nuki joints, such as those used in the construction of Japanese shrines and temples. It will serve as the main route of visitor traffic around the Expo site, enabling smooth movement around the site and offering visitors a comfortable space sheltered from the wind, rain, and sunlight.” The Grand Ring was initially designed to be easily dismantled after the event concludes on October 13. However, Japanese authorities are now considering keeping the structure in place beyond the Expo. To explore future possibilities, they are inviting suggestions from residents on potential uses for the Grand Ring. This approach reflects the story of Paris’ Eiffel Tower, which was also originally meant to be temporary for an exposition but became an enduring landmark. The final decision will depend on community input and the structure’s potential value, opening up the possibility for the Grand Ring to remain as a lasting feature in Osaka.",
