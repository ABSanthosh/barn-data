  "text": "There’s something mesmerizing about a space that balances warmth with boldness, softness with structure—and that’s exactly what The Velvet Ash Residence, designed by Shubochkini, does. This home blends plush textures, deep wood tones, and sculptural design elements. From the whisper-soft neutrals enveloping the bedroom to the sleek architectural details in the kitchen, every inch is designed with intentional contrast in mind. The Velvet Ash Residence is where muted palettes meet statement textures, and natural light plays beautifully against bold black accents. The foyer of the Velvet Ash Residence is a contrast of white and black. Visual interest is added with the two-toned floor. Walking a few steps in, the kitchen welcomes visitors. This features sleek cabinetry and wooden tones. Essential appliances—like the espresso coffee machine—are tucked into their places. As a part of the open floor plan, a cozy yet modern dining table provides room to enjoy meals. A central pedestal table—a space-savvy addition—is surrounded by plush chairs The large window, paired with blinds, filters in soft sunlight. In addition, the textured pendant lamp takes over during the darker hours. The living room sets a warm base with a wooden floor. A plush sectional sofa is paired with an organically shaped coffee table in tones of gold and black. The statement feature (and focal point) in this space is the zebra print rug. This softens the space underfoot and draws attention. While there’s not much room for an entertainment complex (this is swapped for a large glass sliding door), residents are allowed to enjoy their favorite shows on a projector screen. Between the living room and bedroom is a large glass sliding door. This gives a peek into the cozy reading nook in the bedroom. The bedroom in the Velvet Ash Residence features a minimalist bed with soft upholstery. This is paired with a black nightstand, light switch, and wall accent. A plush white rug underfoot instantly adds warmth. In one nook of the bedroom is a cozy reading area featuring a green accent chair. This is placed right next to the window so residents can read under natural light. Velvet Ash Residence’s bathroom is compact yet stylish. The tiled walls are divided into two patterns for optimal visual interest. A wooden wall-mounted vanity is topped with a vessel sink, while a wall-mounted toilet helps open up space. The bathtub is paired with a wooden caddy to hold your scented candle and books. Finally, stainless steel hardware provides functionality while adding a shiny finish.",
