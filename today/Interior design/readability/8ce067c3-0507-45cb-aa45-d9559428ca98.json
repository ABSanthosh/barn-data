  "description": "Building on a rocky coastal hillside might yield spectacular views, but it also requires heavy excavation and an environmental cost. Faced with a challenging plot of land on Albania's coast, JA Joubert Architecture of Holland and UNS Architects of Albania found a way to work with the land rather than against it. Here are the plans for the Zig-Zag Resort the two firms co-designed: \"Architecture should not dominate the land; it should respond to it,\" says Marc Joubert, of JA Joubert Architecture. \"At Zig-Zag, we created a design where nature dictates the structure—ensuring that every guest experiences this amazing landscape.\"The resort harmonizes with the natural terrain through its signature zig-zag layout, ensuring that each guest enjoys uninterrupted views of the breathtaking surroundings. The project prioritizes sustainability and seamless mobility, incorporating a funicular system, pedestrian pathways, and drop-off points for intuitive navigation. It is built with locally sourced Berat Stone, blending regional craftsmanship with modern luxury while optimizing passive cooling and solar energy efficiency. With minimal land disruption, rainwater management systems, and an indoor-outdoor architectural flow, Zig-Zag integrates ecological sensitivity into its design. The resort's sea-water infinity pool and private coastal access further enhance its connection to the Albanian Riviera, making nature a core part of the guest experience. The project spans 30,000m², including hotel accommodations, gardens, and various amenities, and is currently in the design phase.",
