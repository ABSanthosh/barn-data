  "text": "Chery is one of China’s largest automakers. After cementing itself as an affordable and technically advanced vehicle exporter, the company has now designed a concept van for adventures both within and beyond the city limits. The concept van code-named ‘Travel 4.0’ is part of Chery’s “vision for a sustainable and connected future.” Even though Chery is a Chinese brand, it enjoys substantial footing in parts of Europe and the UK with its Omoda and Jaecoo brands. The automaker has plans to introduce the two brands in Germany this year, which could, it seems be joined by the new Journeo concept van. The Journeo is in fact conceived by Chery’s design team in Raunheim, Germany as a compact vehicle on the road that expands when parked. Designer: Chery Spacious and efficient camper vans from Volkswagen, Winnebago, Ford et al have been thriving on roads and beyond on electric drivetrains. The Chery Journeo concept camper van is not fully electric but it is expandable on demand to be that van you can take on road trips with the family or for an overnight adventure with your partner and doggo. In its normal orientation, the Journeo measures roughly 520 cm long, but with the slidable glass pod in the rear pushed out, the camper van easily adds about 150 mm to the cabin’s length. The concept van is powered by a hybrid system comprising a 2.0-ltr turbo engine and Chery’s Kunpeng Super Performance Electric Hybrid C-DM system paired to deliver up to 2,500 km (roughly 1,550 miles) range on a single tank and full battery. So, if you have been dreaming of embarking on a cross-country adventure, this is the option you can bank on. To ensure your journey – whether on paved or unpaved paths – is stable to your liking, the van features and adaptable air suspension. On the outside, the longish hood is an instant eye-catcher. It’s here in the front trunk that the outdoor kitchen with grill resides. The frunk kitchen can be aptly stocked for afternoon barbeque sessions or dinner on an overnight adventure. The front grille of the van is also expandable. It subtly extends to reveal a comfortable loveseat you can sit on in the shade delivered by the awning that deploys out of a solarized storage module on the rooftop. The Chery concept van is as exciting on the inside as it is on the outside. On the inside, the Journeo concept features four seats: two independent swivel sofas in the front and a convertible loveseat in the back. This seat swings to the sides to create a cozy daybed for which the door inserts can be used as cushions. The rear seat and the island console are based on rails and can be customized to create a lounge setup if needed. Behind the compact sleeping section is the rear windscreen that measures 1.3 sqm, and with the skylight over the cabin, offers breathtaking views whether you’re relaxing after sunset or riding during the day. Since it is only a concept at the moment, Journeo camper van does not have a price or availability date.",
