  "description": "Advertising agency founder Ralph van Dijk, and producer Kate van Dijk, bought a mid-century A-frame house in 2013 and have barely had to lift a finger since. Originally designed and built by architect Graeme Over in 1959, the northern Sydney house is one of a kind, and continues to impress 65 years later. They don’t make them like this anymore!",

  "text": "When looking to move house in 2013, Ralph and Kate van Dijk were initially searching for vacant land, until discovering this A-frame home for sale in Balgowlah Heights. ‘We were looking to build at the time, so my only search criteria was a north east aspect, but it was such an intriguing property I arranged to see it that day,’ says Ralph, who is the founder and executive creative director of Eardrum. ‘It suited our style and virtually every piece of furniture we’d been collecting over many years, so I was emotionally attached to it within about 30 seconds.’ Designed and built by architect Graeme Over, the original Northern Sydney house was built in 1959 and later extended up and across as his own family took over. ‘Graeme liked the A-frame particularly because it is the basis for Tahitian and Hawaiian housing, which is also perfect for our climate,’ says Ralph. ‘This quote of his sums up the house; “There is great beauty in irregularity. I like my houses to be organic — to be absolutely wedded to the site.” Ralph and Kate moved into the home with their children 54 years after the original house’s completion, and amazingly, even today it remains in near-perfect structural condition. ‘This is testament to the brilliance of the architect,’ says Ralph. The couple have since made minor updates to the interior, mainly to reconfigure the bedrooms, and modernise the kitchen. ‘The house has been well built and stands up to tinkering, so it was all done in a matter of months,’ says Ralph. When introducing or replacing elements, the couple decided to ‘double down’ on the mid-century features. ‘We built a stone clad fireplace over the existing plaster one and replaced the carpet throughout,’ Ralph says. Speaking of the green carpet, Ralph says, ‘Kate thinks it’s related to my mild obsession with football (round ball version), but it’s such a happy, inviting colour and it makes the furniture pop and the house sing.’ The A-frame design of the living room is equally the most practical, distinctive, and beloved feature of this home. Ralph and Kate have made memories in this space with their now adult children: musician Ruel, stylist Coco, and writer Sylvie. ‘Having a living space with so much volume is a luxury these days, but as Graeme knew, it’s the perfect design for our climate and a bush setting,’ says Ralph. ‘The roof is clad with century-old terracotta shingles, and fibreglass panels at the apex allow natural light to come flooding in.’ The high ceilings and expansive windows also capture views across Forty Baskets Beach and North Harbour beyond — a location Ralph and Kate never take for granted. [It] never gets old, says Ralph. ‘Being able to walk to our secluded local beach and have a swim, all before our coffee gets cold, is what we probably love most.’",
