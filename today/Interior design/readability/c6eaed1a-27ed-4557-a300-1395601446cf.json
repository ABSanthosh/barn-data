Cozy up with some warm bread from the oven and a bowl of this hearty dish for an easy meal.Â  You know how I love a good crock pot meal!Many of you have tried my easy comfort food slow cooker recipesÂ (chicken and dumplings, creamy chicken and wild rice and mac and cheese) crock pot dishes and love them as much as I do: Be prepared for a new favorite. This one may inch out my chicken and wild rice. It's that good. This chicken and noodle recipe calls for the thicker noodles, so it's more of a hearty meal than a typical chicken soup. If you like a creamier \"soup\" that you can pile high over mashed potatoes, this one is for you!Â  I found this recipe floating around on Facebook years ago, but there was no source.Â  I could tell from the photo that there was more to it than the few ingredients listed. So I added a few and it was absolutely delicious. If you're looking for an easy warm meal on a crisp fall evening, this is one is perfect!Â  This recipe only takes around three hours to make if you cook it on high: This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience.I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  Here are the ingredients for this delicious crock pot creamy chicken and noodle soup:Â  One pound chicken breastÂ  (more or less depending on your preference) Two cans cream of chicken soup Two cups chicken brothÂ  (I added slightly less than that for a creamier base -- again, your preference)Â  One stick butterÂ  One 24 ounce package frozen egg noodles (I use the Reames brand) One tablespoon parsleyÂ  One tablespoon minced onion Â  1/2 tablespoon pepper This is the frozen noodle package you'll want to look for:Â  It really couldn't be much easier. Combine all ingredients but the frozen noodles and cook on high in the Crock Pot for 2.5 to three hours.Â  Remove the chicken to shred it with two forks:Then put it back in the slow cooker along with the frozen egg noodles.Â You can easily shred your chicken with a handheld or standing mixer as well! Let it cook for about 30-45 more minutes (taste your noodles to see if they're done to your liking) and that's it!Â  SO DELICIOUS!!Â  Possible additions and changes to this yummy chicken and noodle recipe:Â  Usually I salt my food but there is no need with this dish. Next time I may try using low sodium chicken broth. I think I could get away with less butter as well. But why mess with a good thing? ðŸ˜‚ Add some frozen vegetables in with the noodles to make it even more hearty. Next time I'm going to try adding mushrooms as well. Sometimes I use cream of chicken and mushroom soup -- both ways are delicious!Â  Make sure you use the thicker egg noodles. Dry thin egg noodles in the pasta aisle would fall apart.Â  The frozen noodles are what make this sooooo good. You know I won't steer you wrong when it comes to recipes, especially Crock Pot versions! This one is absolutely delicious and was a breeze to make.Â  Let me know if you try it! **P.S. You can find my pretty dinnerware here -- I bought the bowls ten+ years ago and they've held upÂ beautifully.Â  PIN THIS RECIPE FOR LATER: Share this",
