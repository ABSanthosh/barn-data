The nine winners awarded in Dezeen's annual awards programme are located in nine different countries including Taiwan, Japan, Portugal, Germany and UK. Aesop Diagonal crowned interiors project of the year Aesop Diagonal by Spanish studio Mesura won the prestigious interiors project of the year award and was also named retail interior (small) project of the year. The interiors master jury praised the retail space in Barcelona for its circular approach, repurposing discarded local stone and transforming it into functional objects. \"This project tackles issues that are incredibly relevant to our time,\" said the master jury. \"An incredible amount of consideration has gone into turning these stone elements into a functional piece of furniture with almost no change to the aesthetic.\" Aesop Diagonal by Mesura. Photo by Maxime DelvauxThe winning retail store Aesop Diagonal was up against projects that included an apartment with secret door disguised as a bookcase in Barcelona, a converted coal mine into a secluded retreat in Taiwan and a tactile restaurant with carved stone bar in Portugal. View the winning interiors projects on the Dezeen Awards website or read below: Aesop Diagonal by Mesura. Photo by Maxime DelvauxInteriors project of the year and retail interior (small) of the year: Aesop Diagonal by Mesura Inspired by the historical public fountains of Barcelona, Mesura repurposed stone fragments of 19-century buildings from an abandoned quarry to inform the interior structure. Using an arrangement of 78 stone pieces including ancient fountains, archways, and pedestals, the studio combined a mixture of stainless steel and natural finishes to emphasise the textures and perforations of the stone remnants. \"It was a brilliant idea to take something so raw and recycle it in this way,\" said the judges. \"Taking something that already exists and transforming it in a way that uses minimal resources and giving it an entirely new function.\" Read more about Aesop Diagonal by Mesura › Kanso Philosophy by Miriam Barrio Studio. Photo by Salva LópezResidential interior of the year: Kanso Philosophy by Miriam Barrio Studio A minimalist apartment that combines Japanese and Mediterranean elements in Barcelona by Miriam Barrio Studio won residential interior of the year. Drawing inspiration from Japanese Kanso philosophy, the apartment features custom furniture to maximise space including a bookcase that doubles as a secret door. \"There is a real sense of harmony to the design, even though it combines two very different cultures,\" said the interiors master jury. \"There is a beautiful simplicity to the lines, which feels very Japanese but offers a Mediterranean warmth,\" they continued. \"This cultural fusion feels highly innovative, functional and multi-layered.\" Read more about Kanso Philosophy by Miriam Barrio Studio › Austa Restaurant by Studio Gameiro. Photo by Daniel SchäferRestaurant and bar interior of the year: Austa Restaurant by Studio Gameiro A tactile restaurant with carved stone bar and custom-made aluminium furniture in Almancil, Portugal won restaurant and bar interior of the year. Studio Gameiro draws on Algarve's craftsmanship for the interior with bespoke furniture including a four-metre-long sofa with plinths made from locally sourced rock salt. \"Compositionally, this interior is very well executed,\" said the jury. \"There's a sophisticated balance of colour and material, and innovative storage solutions that fit well with the architecture.\" \"The approach to sustainability is also admirable, with locally sourced materials that really elevate the space.\" Read more about Austa Restaurant by Studio Gameiro › Locke at East Side Gallery by Grzywinski + Pons. Photo by Nicholas WorleyHotel and short-stay interior of the year: Locke at East Side Gallery by Grzywinski + Pons New York-based architecture studio Grzywinski+Pons won hotel and short-stay interior of the year for its 176-room hotel with a cafe, bar, lounge and co-working space in Berlin, Germany. The studio utilised calming colours and natural textures with pops of colour that are inspired by the waterside location of Locke at East Side Gallery hotel. \"The relationship between the existing building and the new interior is very interesting,\" said the judges. \"There are tensions between the public and private spaces, and a palette that speaks to a younger audience,\" they continued. \"The honesty of the exposed structure contrasts with the new colours, resulting in an expression that is peaceful but also appropriate for the culture in this part of Berlin.\" Read more about Locke at East Side Gallery by Grzywinski + Pons › Land Over Water by Firm Architects. Photo by Giovanni NardiWorkplace interior (small) of the year: Land Over Water by Firm Architects A renovated 675-square-metre flagship office in Hoofddorp, the Netherlands, won workplace interior (small) of the year. Netherlands studio Firm Architects used a palette of sustainable materials such as cork for furniture and wall coverings as well as recycled brut aluminium for glass partitions. \"The sustainability credentials are impressive, as is the link to materials in the Dutch landscape,\" said the master jury. \"There is a consistency in the core foundation material, the use of clay, which has been executed in different ways,\" they continued. \"The zoning concept is also very strong, which is important for a shared space like this.\" Read more about Land Over Water by Firm Architects › Chancery House by Norm Architects and dMFK Architects. Photo by Jonas Bjerre-PoulsenWorkplace interior (large) of the year: Chancery House by Norm Architects and dMFK Architects Danish studio Norm Architects won workplace interior (large) of the year for their playful restoration of The Office Group's Chancery House workspace in London. Pale wood, red-brick, sandstone and stainless steel detailing were used throughout the interiors which were inspired by the building's existing design. The master jury praised the project for its \"simple and quirky\" interior. \"It's rich in layers, but very subtle, with a high level of craftsmanship that feels timeless,\" they continued. \"There is a real domestic charm to this space, which makes you feel like you want to spend a lot of time there.\" Read more about Chancery House by Norm Architects and dMFK Architects › Unmaking for IZA Tokyo by Office Shogo Onodera. Photo by Ichiro MishimaRetail interior (large) of the year: Unmaking for IZA Tokyo by Office Shogo Onodera  A flagship retail store featuring repurposed materials by Japanese practice Office Shogo Onodera for fashion brand IZA Tokyo won retail interior (large) of the year. Onodera's studio used their philosophy of \"unmaking\" for the interiors, which focuses on reducing waste through reuse; the project involved sensitively removing existing materials and repurposing them using a variety of techniques. The master jury enjoyed the storytelling elements of the interior and said that the \"project challenges the norms of what an interior retail space has to be.\" \"The title, Unmaking, is fitting because it's all about reverting the process of craft,\" they continued. \"It gives value to the idea of removing materials, with a sensitivity and attention to detail that makes you think. It is a fantastic example of forward-focused innovation.\" Read more about Unmaking for IZA Tokyo by Office Shogo Onodera › The Mineless Heritage by Divooe Zein Architects. Photo by Justin KaoHealth and wellbeing interior of the year: The Mineless Heritage by Divooe Zein Architects Divooe Zein Architects won health and wellbeing interior of the year for converting an abandoned coal mine in Taiwan. Transformed into a secluded retreat with tea room, small theatre, meditation and exhibition space, the studio retained the original concrete, steel and exposed brickwork detailing throughout each interior. \"This project is very unique – a real escape,\" said the master jury. \"It is a wellness space that feels at one with nature.\" \"It offers you the opportunity to get as far away from everyday life and have a beautiful experience,\" they continued. \"The use of materials is very considered; you're in this dark space, just looking out at the green forest around you – the perfect place to calm the mind.\" Read more about The Mineless Heritage by Divooe Zein Architects › Temporary Storage Garden by Semester Studio. Photo by Chen HaoExhibition design (interior) of the year: Temporary Storage Garden by Semester Studio A temporary pavilion using borrowed materials organised around a central garden won exhibition design (interior) of the year. Designed by Semester Studio for Camerich at the 2023 China International Furniture Fair, the studio was able to monitor how the materials were returned and reused. Easy to dismantle, the studio reinstalled the exhibition for two other companies optimising the use of materials. The interiors master jury praised the studio's approach to circularity and said \"it shows how the concept of reuse and recycling can be applied in an elevated and elegant way.\" \"This is a beautifully crafted exhibition space that utilises lighting to maximum effect,\" they continued. \"The strength is the concept of temporarily turning a pile of materials into something incredible, then sending them back to where they came from.\" Read more about Temporary Storage Garden by Semester Studio › Dezeen Awards 2024 in partnership with Bentley Dezeen Awards is the ultimate accolade for architects and designers across the globe.
