  "text": "Cave Chair merges furniture and spatial enclosureThe Cave Chair, developed by Domain Architects for their newly launched furniture brand Bischiyano, explores the intersection between furniture and spatial enclosure. Conceived as a hybrid between seating and architecture, the chair draws formal reference from natural cave structures, offering a semi-enclosed environment that emphasizes retreat and acoustic isolation.The structure of the chair consists of a geometric wood frame clad in elastic upholstery fabric, with the interior surfaces padded in foam. The padding is thickened at the seat base to improve ergonomic comfort. Both interior and exterior surfaces are finished in the same stretch textile, which is available in a range of color options, maintaining a consistent visual and tactile identity. Internally, the Cave Chair forms an ovoid volume that users can physically enter. The spatial envelope provides a muffled acoustic experience, enabled by the pyramidal outer structure and soft-lined inner shell, which together reduce ambient sound levels. These properties contribute to a heightened sense of enclosure and withdrawal from external stimuli.all images courtesy of BischiyanoCave Chair invites pause, reflection, and sensory retreatBischiyano, a furniture brand founded by Hannah Wang, one of Domain Architects’ partners, takes its name from a term in the Tequesta language meaning ‘favorite path of the rising moon.’ The brand’s identity emphasizes elemental qualities and unconventional formal approaches in furniture. As the brand’s first product, the Cave Chair demonstrates this ethos through its integration of tactile materiality, spatial enclosure, and sensory modulation. By transforming a seating object into an inhabitable microenvironment, the design positions the chair as a space of temporal seclusion within domestic or public interiors.Cave Chair by Domain Architects blurs the line between seat and spacedesigned for Bischiyano, the chair references the protective form of a cavea hybrid of furniture and architecture, it invites temporary withdrawalthe pyramidal structure defines an inhabitable enclosure",
