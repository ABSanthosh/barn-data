  "text": "Henry D’Ath together with Batten and Kamp unveil table seriesHong Kong-based architect and sculptor Henry D’Ath collaborates with design-art duo Batten and Kamp to present Bolete, a family of limited-edition coffee and side tables crafted from hand-carved solid wood and natural stone. Named for their mushroom-like forms, the tables combine the sculptural weight of permanent furniture with a flexible design featuring configurable, overlapping surfaces.D’Ath carves each piece by hand, allowing the grain of the wood and the shape of the accompanying stone to guide its subtly organic forms. Tops are either left natural and sealed with varnish or treated with layers of calligraphy ink to achieve a glossy black finish. ‘Bolete is a retreat from overthinking; where parts were married in a simple desire to make something beautiful with existing content from each of our two practices,’ explains Henry D’Ath.images courtesy of Henry D’Ath and Batten and Kampbolete combines camphor wooden tops with granite stone baseThe combination of wood and stone originated during a custom commission, where Batten and Kamp paired one of D’Ath’s carved wood pieces with their signature raw stone bases, recognizing the harmony between the two elements. The Bolete series features options in natural or glossy black finishes, with wood tops made from Camphor—a locally grown variety valued in China and Japan for its pleasant aroma and insect-repellent properties. Supporting the wooden tops are raw Taishan Granite stones, commonly used in Zen gardens for their grey-white tones and resemblance to Karst Mountains. Each stone is individually sourced and left untreated, ensuring every table is entirely unique. ‘Dan, Henry, and I have known one another for most of our lives and, through that time, have admired and been inspired by each other’s work,’ shares Alexandra Batten. ‘It was effortless to find the place where our practices overlapped and design a piece from that connection. The series comes from our shared New Zealand sensibility—natural materials, robust forms, simplicity. But it is made with local materials and carries hints of Zen aesthetics.’ Henry D’Ath collaborates with Batten and Kamp to present Bolete, a family of limited-edition coffee and side tablesmodular design allows for the expansion of the collectionInitially released as a side table in 2023, the collaborators expand the Bolete series to include coffee tables. The modular design of the piece allows for various shapes and sizes through overlapping surfaces. The collaboration merges influences from New Zealand and Hong Kong, reflecting the shared heritage of Alexandra Batten, Daniel Kamp, and Henry D’Ath, all originally from New Zealand but now based in a shared Hong Kong studio. Offered in limited editions of eight pieces plus four artist proofs per configuration, the series is slated for exhibition in New York or Paris in 2025. crafted from hand-carved solid wood and natural stonenamed Bolete for their mushroom-like formsD’Ath carves each piece by handinitially released as a side table in 2023",
