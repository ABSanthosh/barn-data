  "description": "This Federation cottage in Northcote was working well for its owners, until it wasn’t. Now with two teenage children, the family needed more functionality and space, including places of connection and retreat to live ‘alone together.’ The renovation and extension by Austin Maynard Architects highlights simplicity, inspired by the family’s year living in Japan. Everything now has its place across three levels, unified externally by a batten screen that speaks the same language as the original facade.",
