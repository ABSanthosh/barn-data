  "text": "Flexible wooden lampshade cover using a slab of timberKurahito Craft channel on YouTube shows how to transform a hard slab of wood into a flexible, see-through lampshade cover and more. Instead of using ingredients to make the wood soft or using a piece that has already been altered, either in form or through components, the Japanese content creator uses just a piece of timber for the project. He needs the help of a table saw for the process, too. He begins the flexible wooden lampshade cover by shaping the main material into an oval. To do this, he uses another piece of wood as a guide, also called a fence.The craftsman holds everything in place with a clamp. He adjusts the height and angle of the blade, then lowers it before starting the cut. He trims along the fence, resulting in a rail-like shape. This is risky, so people who want to try it at home should proceed with caution. The creator makes the cuts in small steps. After completing one side, he measures and processes the other until the form looks like the letter M. He uses a hand plane to smooth the sharp corners. After that, the process that he describes as ‘yaruki’ begins for the flexible wooden lampshade cover.all images courtesy of Kurahito Craft Channeltechnique allowing designs suited for specific functionsKurahito Craft keeps on cutting the wood until the shape starts to resemble a centipede. However, it still breaks when it bends. He then switches to a thicker piece of wood and changes the design; this time, cutting all four sides instead of adding more oval cuts. He repeats the earlier process and then smooths the surface using a sanding machine. He uses a flat plate to continue cutting the pieces. The result gives him a flexible wooden lampshade cover that looks like a flower or a gas burner. When he bends it this time, it doesn’t break and keeps its shape. When it’s time to test it out, the content creator fits a lightbulb in the middle, and the now cut timber is able to hold its new shape. The flexible wooden lampshade cover isn’t the only end result of Kurahito Craft’s project. Designers can adopt the technique to make structures and modular fixtures from wood instead of using other components or additives. The approach also allows users to create designs that are suited for specific functions or what they need, with the flexible wooden lampshade cover as just an example.the slab of wood can bend without breakingthere are no additives added to make the wood malleableview of the flexible wooden lampshade coverthe creator uses a flat plate to continue cutting the piecesthe now cut timber is able to hold its new shape",
