  "text": "One of my goals this 2025 is to read more books. Since I read all over my apartment, it would be nice to have a light source that can go with me whether I’m in my living room, work space, or bedroom. Right now, I rely on my regular fluorescent light everywhere else and a small lamp set up on my bedside table. But a lamp I can bring with me anywhere would be more convenient if I wanted to read in the dark. Designers: Shelley Simpson and Zachary Hanna for Mud Australia The Pop Lamp is a portable and rechargeable LED lamp that is completely wireless and can be placed anywhere you would need a light source. It is made from just one piece of handmade porcelain and inside that minimalist body, there is a concealed internal dimmable LED light source. The lamp can last up to 6 hours without charging if used at 100% brightness and up to 96 hours on the lowest brightness. The lamp has a cylindrical body with a slight protruding shade. The metal plate on top is where you have your touch controls. One tap will turn the lamp on while pressing and holding will turn it off. You can swipe your finger onto the plate to adjust the dimness and brightness of the lamp. The Pop Lamp is available in six colors which are the signature of Mud Australia: Blossom, Duck Egg, Dust, Orange, Red, and Slate. Each piece, measuring at 13 x 8 x 24.5 cm is handmade in their studio in Sidney and is carbon neutral. It can be used anywhere indoors and should not be left “unsupervised” outdoors or in wet areas.",
