The design utilizes slender wood offcuts, forming a composition that balances functionality with architectural references.The stool draws inspiration from decorative cornices in Western architecture and the rhythmic beam structures found in Japanese temple ceilings. Its stepped form, when stacked, creates a rhythmic visual effect while maintaining a sculptural presence.all images courtesy of Nao IwamatsuCORNICE is made of slender repurposed wood offcutsConceived by industrial designer Nao Iwamatsu to complement quiet, refined interiors, CORNICE serves both as a seating element and a side table, as well as a sculptural statement piece.Constructed using 13mm wooden pieces bonded with domino joints, the stool maintains structural integrity while repurposing collected offcuts. It is designed for flat-pack shipping, optimizing material use and transport efficiency.
