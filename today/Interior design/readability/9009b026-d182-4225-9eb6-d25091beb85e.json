  "text": "The Neoclassical Apartment feels light, airy, and timeless. The tone is set with light neutral hues throughout the apartment. Simultaneously, the clean lines keep it feeling modern. Visual interest is factored into the space with intricate moldings and polished stone surfaces. Expansive windows allow natural light to flood the interiors. This beautifully reflects off the marble accents and crisp architectural details, creating a space that feels both majestic and serene. The living room in the Neoclassical Apartment uses two expansive two-seater sofas. An organic wooden coffee table and rug add warmth. We love the entertainment complex, which uses a marble block and dark wooden cabinetry. This forms a subtle statement in the living area, as does the multi-globe chandelier hanging above. As a part of the open floor plan, we see a round glass-top dining table paired with soft upholstered chairs towards the back of the living area. The same chandelier also hangs above here, tying the two spaces together. The kitchen in the Neoclassical Apartment is simple and sleek with a marble backsplash. The white cabinetry features clean lines. The bedroom features a simple upholstered bed and gray-and-black artwork depicting branches. The entertainment complex is placed in front of the floor-to-ceiling window (which is paired with light draperies).  We also see dark wooden cabinetry adding a visual punch. In one corner is the opening to an ultra-modern walk-in closet. The bathroom in the Neoclassical Apartment may be compact, but it goes big on marble accents. A freestanding tub and vessel sink add luxury to the space, while the dark wooden vanity adds contrast. The rectangular mirror has a sleek LED strip, providing interesting illumination. The toilet is segregated with a glass partition.",
