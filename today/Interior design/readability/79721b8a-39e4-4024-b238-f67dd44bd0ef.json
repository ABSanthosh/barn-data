Whether you’re at a backyard cookout, a sandy beach, or deep in the woods for a weekend campout, beating the heat is always on the to-do list. Enter the Windchill 47 Cooler: a game-changing gadget that brings ice-cold refreshment and real air conditioning to any adventure. Forget everything you think you know about coolers. Engineered by the folks behind the world’s most popular smokeless fire pit, the Solo Windchill 47 is a whole new breed of outdoor gear. More than just a place to stash your drinks, it’s a high-tech cooling station with built-in A/C and misting. Imagine chilling with friends and having a blast, with a cold breeze on demand and your favorite beverages icy for days. Designer: Solo Stove The Windchill 47 stands out as the world’s first cooler with three different ways to keep things frosty. It starts with traditional ice storage, but that’s just the beginning. Flip a switch and the cooler pulls in hot air, sending it through a high-efficiency heat exchanger and powerful fan, and then pumps out a dry, refreshing chill you can actually feel. There’s even a misting feature to keep things extra comfortable when the sun is relentless. This cooler isn’t just about keeping your cans cold, though with space for up to 65, there’s plenty of room for the whole crew. It runs on a rechargeable battery that powers the Max A/C feature for more than three hours per charge. On top of the air conditioning, the Windchill 47 delivers serious ice retention, holding chill for days so your food and drinks stay fresh throughout your trip. Windchill is packed with features that make outdoor adventures easier and more enjoyable. Built into the lid are the heat exchanger, high-powered fan, and misting pump, all the tech you need to keep cool, cleverly hidden away. The vent hose is stored underneath the lid and can be rotated to aim the breeze exactly where you want it, making it perfect for tailgates, patios, and campgrounds alike. No more worrying about dead batteries, either. With integrated USB-A and USB-C ports, you can charge up your phone, speakers, or camera right from the cooler. Rugged all-terrain wheels and a telescoping handle mean the Windchill 47 goes wherever you do, from rocky campsites to sandy beaches, and the built-in bottle opener is always there when you need it. If you’re ready to upgrade your next outdoor gathering, the Windchill 47 Cooler proves that you don’t have to sacrifice comfort for adventure. With this powerhouse in tow, you’ll have icy drinks, a refreshing breeze, and all the power you need to keep the fun going, no matter how hot it gets.",
