  "text": "The Double Duo tiny house takes a different approach by using two shipping containers instead of just one. This design choice creates more floorspace, allowing for a spacious interior with a generous living area, two bedrooms, and two bathrooms. Built by Custom Container Living, the Double Duo is made from two 40-foot (12.2-meter) containers, offering a total of 640 square feet (almost 60 square meters) of living space. The exterior can be left with its original container finish for an industrial look or partially clad in wood for added warmth. This setup provides flexibility in both appearance and layout, making it a practical and comfortable home. Designer: Custom Container Living Entering the Double Duo, you step directly into a living room that feels noticeably more open than most container homes. There’s plenty of space for a full-sized sofa, a coffee table, an entertainment center, and even a large TV, making it ideal for relaxing or hosting friends. Adjacent to the living area is a well-appointed kitchen, especially for a tiny house made from shipping containers. It features a double sink, a fridge/freezer, an oven with a four-burner propane stove, and a microwave. Optional upgrades include a dishwasher and a stacked washer/dryer. Generous cabinetry provides ample storage, making the space both practical and comfortable for daily living. The main bathroom in the Double Duo is designed with comfort and functionality in mind. It features a combined bath and shower, a standard flushing toilet, and a vanity sink, offering all the essentials you need in a compact space. One of the highlights of this bathroom is its direct access to the adjacent bedroom, making nighttime routines more convenient. The bedroom itself is equipped with a double bed and built-in storage, providing a cozy and organized place to rest. Thanks to the home’s single-floor layout, there’s generous headroom throughout, allowing you to stand upright and move around with ease—a notable benefit in the world of tiny houses, where lofts and low ceilings are common. This thoughtful design ensures the space feels comfortable and accessible, enhancing the overall living experience. On the other end of the Double Duo, you’ll find a second bedroom that also benefits from ample headroom and features a comfortable double bed along with a spacious walk-in closet. Attached to this bedroom is a private en-suite bathroom, complete with a shower, double sink, and toilet, providing added convenience and privacy. The Double Duo receives its power through a standard RV-style hookup, and interior temperatures are managed by a Mitsubishi mini-split air conditioning system, ensuring year-round comfort. Unlike some tiny homes, it isn’t trailer-mounted, so it must be delivered to your chosen site by truck. Currently, this well-appointed container home is available for purchase at a price of US$139,000.",
