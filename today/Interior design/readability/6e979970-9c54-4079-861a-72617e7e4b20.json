All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Hayley KessnerIt’s hard not to notice when your bath mat is in need of an upgrade. After all, no one wants to feel perpetually damp fabric underfoot, deal with a sliding mat every time you step out of the shower, or simply look at an eyesore of a rug in your bathroom. When it comes to household essentials that have the potential to improve the experience of being in a space, the bath mat is right up there with rugs and comforters. It should be as functional as it is show-stopping, so don’t be afraid to judge one by its cover — you’ll be able to tell fairly quickly whether or not it’s anything you’ll want to step on (or even see) fresh out of the shower.Just like other linens around the house, bath mats need to be switched out every once in a while. So, if shopping for a bath mat hasn’t been as easy as adding one that matches the bath towels in your cart — or if doing so has left you wanting more in the way of flair, plushness, absorption, non-slip features, color, etc. — you’re in the right place. We put bath mats from a range of brands, prices, and purposes to the test. Keep scrolling to find the ones that impressed us the most.The Best Bath MatsWhat to Consider When Buying a Bath MatBath mats are a combination of aesthetics and functionality. Both are important, but think about which one concerns you and your household the most: whether it suits your decor, feels amazing, or takes all the anti-slip precautions. Do you have kids or elderly household family members? How many people need to use the bath mat? How often are you able to wash it? Determining your priorities first can dramatically narrow your scope in terms of shopping for the right bath mat. As for aesthetics, if you’re into bright colors or bold designs, woven mats tend to offer more possibilities. If you prefer natural materials, a minimalist look, or Scandinavian- or Japanese-inspired decor, wood mats are a solid option. Are you open to prints and designs or would you prefer a more classic look? Does it need to match your bath towels? Do you just care about it staying put, being absorbent, and drying quickly? Perhaps investing in a low-profile stone bath mat (that’ll last years) is best for you.Once you know the look(s) you’re open to, think about sizing. Will you need something small, large, or could you go for multiple mats? Lastly, how do you want it to feel? Thick, soft, and fluffy? Solid, fast-drying, and sturdy? Somewhere in-between? Take a look below at the different materials most commonly used for bath mats to find which one could offer you the most in terms of your preferred look, sizing, and feel.MaterialsCotton: Moisture-wicking and hypoallergenic, this natural material is the most common among traditional bath mats. These have the potential to match your bath towels or be totally unique stand-alone pieces. Chenille: Blended from cotton, silk, wool, or other natural or synthetic fibers, chenille bath mats leverage the properties of each material in order to absorb water quickly, be washer- and dryer-friendly (check care instructions first!), and stay colorfast with a bit of sheen. They’re often soft, even fluffy, with a highly textured appearance.Stone: Commonly made from diatomaceous earth, or the naturally occurring mineral found in the sea made from fossilized organisms, stone bath mats air-dry extremely quickly, are resistant to bacteria and mold, need only occasional rinses, and absorb around 150 percent of their weight in water in an instant. Wood: Typically crafted from bamboo, teak, or beech wood, these bath mats are corrosion-resistant and mildew-proof. What they lack in fluffiness, they make up for by not requiring a trip to the washing machine or nearly as many washes overall. Depending on what the wood is coated with, if at all, these bath mats are either water resistant or highly absorbent. Nylon: One of the most low-maintenance synthetic materials when it comes to bath mats, nylon can be machine-washed and dried with little fuss. While not usually as soft as cotton, chenille, or some other synthetic fibers, it’s highly durable and great for households with kids or multiple people.Polyester: Both water- and stain-resistant, polyester makes a better material for bath mats than it does bath towels or linens that have more sustained contact with our skin. These mats are easy to wash regularly, stay colorfast, and yield designs with cleaner, more perfected lines. Memory Foam: Able to quickly contour to the shape of your foot, memory foam bath mats are like absorbent pillows for your bathroom floor. They’re almost always paired with non-slip traction underneath for the best of both worlds: softness and support.What We Look For in a Bath MatWe put a number of bath mats across a range of styles and materials to the test, judging them by the following criteria: Functionality: How absorbent is it? Does it capture water quickly? How long can it go between washes? Is it non-slip? Look: What style does it best suit? Is the design bold? Does it fade after washing? Feel: Is it comfortable to step on? Is it soft or hard? Fluffy or smooth? Does it feel secure to the ground? The Best Bath MatsLeave it to one of our favorite retailers, West Elm, to come out on top with its Memory Foam Bath Mat. The best bath mats deliver when it comes to style, feel, and function — and this option checks every box. It comes in four soft hues, with a textured pattern on top that has a boho feel to it. Still, it’s just subtle enough that it won’t overwhelm your bathroom like a traditional print might. That texture is on a removable cover, which means you don’t have to toss the whole thing in the wash. The interior is absorbent memory foam, which will keep the floor dry and make for a super-plush stepping surface right out of the shower.“I enjoy how cushiony and soft it feels underfoot,” Haley, AT’s commerce SEO writer, says. She ended up gifting it to her parents because it was slightly too large for her bathroom, so don’t forget to measure! “I honestly wish this mat could fit into my space just for its comfort, and the fact that it has a removable cover makes washing it super easy,” she adds. 100% cotton shell and 100% polyurethane foam insert 20″ x 34″ Available in 4 colors Machine wash cold on gentle cycle; tumble dry low Who It’s Best For: Those who want an low-maintenance bath mat; those who are looking for a mat that’s as stylish as it is cozy.Good to Know: Don’t worry if you see some shedding at first; Haley says that it stops after some use.Best Budget-Friendly: Brooklinen Bath MatThick and soft are two qualities we try to find in all of our bed and bath linens, and Brooklinen’s Bath Mat checks off both. Designed with 100% Turkish cotton, the mat will keep your feet warm and dry the minute they leave the tub or shower, because the material strives to retain heat. This is an especially great perk during the cold winter months. The mat is made to absorb water quickly too, so you won’t have to worry about it becoming sopping wet or taking forever to dry between uses. Best of all, the overall look is simple and clean, making it a versatile option for different style preferences.“As a big fan of Brooklinen’s Super Plush Towels, I was interested to try their bath mat and see if it was just as cushy as the towels,” Alicia, our commerce deputy editor, explains. “And the answer is: Yes. The Brooklinen Bath Mat is so absorbent (it soaked up all of the water and dried within a few hours after my shower curtain liner was misaligned). It feels like a bath mat from a luxury hotel. I love it.” 100% cotton Available in 2 sizes and 9 colors OEKO-TEX certified Machine wash cold; tumble dry low Who It’s Best For: Those who want a spa-like bath mat; those who want a minimalistic style.  Good to Know: It’s also occasionally available in limited edition colors.Pottery Barn is one of our go-to places to shop for high-end linens, so it comes as no surprise that its Faux Hide Bath Mat won us over. With a shape that’s much more unique than a traditional mat, this option has a glamorous air to it and a feel that reflects it. It mimics the softness of sheepskin and will make you feel like you’re stepping onto a cloud. It also features the Pottery Barn quality that we’ve come to expect from the brand: Its durability means that you won’t need to swap it out for a good while.Our executive lifestyle director, Charli, advises to not let the color deter you. “I didn’t think I could love a white bath mat, and I was wrong,” she says. “This was one washes so well and is super absorbent without holding onto odor or moisture. It feels great under my feet after a shower and looks amazing with my bathroom decor.” 100% polyester with synthetic latex backing Available in 2 sizes OEKO-TEX certified Machine wash cold on gentle cycle; tumble dry low  Who It’s Best For: Those who are after more unique and natural look in their bathroom; those who enjoy a high pile feel underfoot.Good to Know: There’s also a 64-inch runner version if you have more space to work with.Feel may be a priority for you over everything else — if so, you’ll want to go with our Best Plush pick. In fact, you’ll get two mats for virtually the price of one if you do, which is a major bonus. Lavish Home’s Memory Foam set includes one oversized bath runner and a standard mat, so those with larger bathrooms can appreciate a uniform look. Your feet will comfortably sink into the foam core, while the exterior’s chenille fabric feels soft to the touch and wicks away moisture. They won’t budge from where you place them, either, thanks to the rubber backing. “It’s so soft and cushy,” AT’s managing editor, Terri, praises. “The pile really holds its shape after use and washing.” Memory foam and polyester chenille 32″ x 21″ Available in 11 colors Features anti-slip rubber backing Machine washable Who It’s Best For: Those who want their bathrooms to feel as cozy as possible; those with more ground to cover in their bathrooms.Good to Know: According to Terri, “it’s so plush that [her] bathroom door gets caught on it, so [she had] to reposition it so it’s not in the way.” Make sure to consider placement!The Company Store’s Company Cotton Turkish Cotton Bath Mat is proof that luxurious bath linens can actually be wallet-friendly, too. Soft and plush, the mat is also surprisingly durable for its price and won’t fall apart after only a few months of use. Simply designed with a Dobby stripe for a texturized accent, it’s easily matched to other bath linens and bathroom aesthetics, especially because it comes in 19 different colors. Because the bath mat isn’t non-slip, it’s best to hang it between uses over the bathtub or on a towel rack so it can dry. Purchasing a rug pad is also recommended to keep the mat from moving out of place.When Britt tested the bath mat for herself, she actually found it to be majorly absorbent. “After showering and leaving for work one morning, I returned home to find that the shower head had been dripping the entire day. When I walked back into the bathroom many hours later, the Turkish cotton bath mat was soaked… but my floor was dry,” says Britt. “If that bath mat hadn’t been there, I would have ended up pulling all of my towels out of the closet to sop up the mess. That was the ‘aha!’ moment that makes me stand by this bath mat to this day.” 100% combed Turkish cotton 20″ x 36″ Available in 19 colors   800 GSM OEKO-TEX Standard 100-certified  Machine wash cold; tumble dry low Who It’s Best For: Those who want high-quality cotton at a fraction of the price; those who like the classic bath mat style; those who want their bath mat to match their towels.Good to Know: You can add personalization for an additional $12.At first glance, you might do a double take at the sight of a stone mat sitting outside of a shower. Dorai’s Zen Bath Stone isn’t your typical bath mat, but it instantly creates a luxe look and feel to a bathroom while producing maximum results. Made from the brand’s patented material, Diomat — diatomaceous earth and recycled paper — it’s created to feel like natural stone. Despite the hard material, the bottom has a rubberized bottom pad that prevents the mat from slipping or scratching floors. It works to remove water altogether without generating mold and mildew by absorbing 150% of its weight in moisture, which evaporates in seconds.“When I step on the Dorai Bath Stone Mat, the bottoms of my feet dry instantly. No joke — they’re bone-dry. And any water that drips off my body is immediately soaked up in the stone,” Mark, AT’s commerce director, says. No more trails of water when you forget something! Diomat (diatomaceous earth and recycled paper) 23.6″ x 15.6″ Available in 2 colors  Features anti-slip bottom pad Rinse to clean; use included sander to buff away stains and scuffs Who It’s Best For: Those who want something seriously long-lasting; those who want the quickest-drying mat option; those who don’t necessarily need a plush bath mat.Good to Know: Dorai also makes dish-drying mats and other kitchen, bathroom, and even pet essentials made to withstand years of water wear — and look good doing it.*Honorable Mentions: Dorai also has a larger version of its mat called the Dual Stone Bath Mat. Our commerce coordinator Mila has as many positive things to say about that model as Mark did about the standard one. “I’d say it takes within less than 10 seconds for my feet to get completely dry,” she confirms.Another one we loved was the Me Mother Earth Stone Bath Mat, which is a great alternative if you want a more affordable stone option. “I love how I can literally see the mat soak up the water after I step out of the shower,” says commerce editor Britt. “I haven’t experienced any mold, mildew, or bad odors with this mat either, which is always a plus.”Wood might not be the first material that comes to mind when thinking of a quality bath mat. These days, wood furniture and other products are mass-made with cheap particle boards, synthetic laminates, or veneers. However, when we put The Citizenry’s version to the test, it passed with flying colors. It’s hand-crafted in Japan with its native hinoki wood, which is known for its soft feel and — get this — aromatic scent that it releases when wet. It’ll give your bathroom a spa-like vibe every time you shower, according to Britt. “If you want to add some calming style to your bathroom, this is the bath mat to buy,” she says. “Plus, even though the mat is smooth, it has anti-slip feet on the bottom so it doesn’t slide around.” Hinoki cypress wood 24.4″ x 17.75″ Available in 2 sizes  World Fair Trade Organization certified Wipe with a damp cloth to clean Who It’s Best For: Those who want to give their bathrooms a beautiful bathroom upgrade; those who don’t mind sacrificing cushion for a material that’ll last longer with proper care.Good to Know: The brand recommends wiping the mat dry after it gets wet to preserve its look, as well as keeping it out of direct sunlight to avoid discoloration.We were already fans of Weezie’s Signature Bath Mat, and this adorable version ranks just as highly in our book. It has it all: The terry material is equal parts soft and absorbent, drying quickly so you don’t have to worry about it getting gross. You can even hang it on a hook to hasten the process with the attached loop. Plus, it washes wonderfully, according to commerce assistant editor Morgan, and it still looks as new as the day she got it. The sticky dots on the back ensure that it doesn’t slide around on tile. What sets it apart even further, of course, is the piped border around the scalloped edges.“The design and pink color elevates my bathroom so much!” says Morgan, who adds that she bought a shower curtain with the same edges to match. “While it isn’t the thickest mat I’ve ever owned, it’s still comfortable to step on, and I don’t mind letting go of that to have such a cute look. I think the lack of pile will help it hold up longer.” 100% organic long-staple cotton 24″ x 34″ Available in 3 colors  Features non-slip backing Hypoallergenic and OEKO-TEX certified Machine wash cold with like items and colors; tumble dry low Who It’s Best For: Those who want a durable, reliable bath mat that also elevates the space it’s on; those who want a secure mat that also dries fast.Good to Know: You can add a monogram for an extra $15, or snag the matching towels!Additional reporting by Kendall Cornish.",

What they lack in fluffiness, they make up for by not requiring a trip to the washing machine or nearly as many washes overall.

Still, it’s just subtle enough that it won’t overwhelm your bathroom like a traditional print might. That texture is on a removable cover, which means you don’t have to toss the whole thing in the wash.

Because the bath mat isn’t non-slip, it’s best to hang it between uses over the bathtub or on a towel rack so it can dry.
