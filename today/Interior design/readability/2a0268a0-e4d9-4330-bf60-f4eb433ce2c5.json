  "description": "Two Parts House, as its name implies, is a new coastal home designed by Sonelo Architects, comprising two key components: a double storey ‘nucleus’, and quieter single storey for guests. The house references nostalgic Australian beach shacks in its use of weatherboard and timber, whilst also taking inspiration from homes in Sweden and Mallorca, which both hold special meaning for the owners.",
