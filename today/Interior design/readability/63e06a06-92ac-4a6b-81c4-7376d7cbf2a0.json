I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  I've done this before with runners, but for more of a lumbar pillow. This one had four designs, two longer ones and two at the end that were more square. I loved that they were embroidered -- a little detail that makes them look a little more expensive. Here's what I did:  I measured from each end to make sure the design was centered. I cut them out (making sure they were mostly square shaped).  Two of these designs were at the ends of the runner, so I only had to sew up one side! You can close up that one side with a sewing machine or by hand. I usually do a very simple hand stitch that will be easy to open up later so I can reuse the pillow forms.  I used these inexpensive soft pillow inserts. They are super squishy which is good because these are smaller pillows. This runner was only 14 inches wide -- I knew they'd be smaller which was fine with me. Keep your eye out because there are tons of runners that are much wider.  A long table runner would make a great, large lumbar pillow for the couch or bed! I may have squealed out loud when I started stuffing them with the inserts:  I mean, come ON. That's adorable.  I love them!:  The runner was $13 and I already had the inserts so each one was about was only a few bucks for me. Remember the insert can be used over and over again -- I remove my covers and change them out a lot.  Check out my tutorial on adding a zipper to a DIY pillow to make them even easier to reuse!  I loved these Pottery Barn pumpkin pillows: So I did some digging and found some super cute Pottery Barn napkins that had the same look, and some plaid ones with the same colors:  These were on sale so I got eight napkins for about $45. To me that's a lot for eight napkins -- but it's GREAT for eight pillows.  By the way, I found this runner at Marshall's that looks SO similar to the PB napkins and pillows:  Usually I'll just put two napkins together and make them the same on both sides. I wanted to make these really stretch so I used some inexpensive linen I had as the backing.  It would also be cute to use two different placemats on each side so you could flip them around for a different look! I just traced the napkins and cut out the fabric for the back:  Place the good side of the napkin against the backing fabric, sew up three sides, then turn it back right side out and stuff with your fill or insert.  I'm so quick at pillows now it only takes maybe five minutes for me to do each one. And I'm not an excellent sewer. Far from it. But pillows don't have to be perfect, thankfully. Most fabrics are very forgiving. I added inserts and then sewed up the last side by hand:  Because I had the inserts these cost me less than $6 each!  I love the more muted tones for this season. So pretty: I leave these out for a few months and I'll use them year after year. This DIY method is WAY cheaper, especially if you want a bunch of them! It was funny because I told the employee at PB what I do with the napkins and she did the same. Love it. ;)  Adding the fall colors around our home this time of year makes me so happy. This is the start to my favorite few months of the year!: Have you tried this decor trick yet? If you aren't comfortable with a sewing machine, ask around. If you have the materials ready to go it will literally take minutes for a friend who sews to put them together.  I know the sewing machine is intimidating, but it's not that bad, I promise! I use a Brother sewing machine similar to this one. Once you get the hang of it you'll be whipping out napkin pillows left and right! :)  Go get yourself some napkins! Kitchen tea towels! Shower curtains! You can make pillows out of whatever textile you love.",
