  "text": "You may know Leica for their expensive pro-grade cameras, but did you know the company makes expensive projectors too? Aside from high-end cameras, the company has made in-roads in quite a few industries that rely on optics, like binoculars, televisions, and projectors. Although the brand is most known for building products with a premium price tag, their latest projector, the Cine Play 1 has an unusually affordable price, considering its 4K output and ability to output a massive 300-inch screen to rival most cinemas. I’ve long been an advocate for projectors. They’re the same price as TVs, while being portable and having the ability to cast displays nearly 5x larger than most televisions. While the Cine Play 1’s $3,795 price tag isn’t really “affordable”, it does feel so when compared to something like Samsung’s 146-inch “The Wall” 4K television that has an eye-watering $220,000 market price. Contrast it with any other leading 4K long-throw projector brand too, and the Cine Play 1 fits well within the $2000-$4000 range for its category. Designer: Leica So, what makes it special? For starters, the Cine Play 1’s compact design. We’re talking a sleek 10.3 x 9.5 x 9-inch box that packs a mighty 3,000 lumens, making it versatile enough for various settings—even well-lit rooms. Thanks to its triple RGB laser tech and Leica Image Optimization, colors remain balanced and vivid, while its 4K clarity holds strong even as you scale down to 65 inches. This adaptability makes it ideal for any space, whether you’re hosting a gaming night or screening movies under the stars. The overall design is a nod to Leica’s strong minimal-metal visual DNA. With a Bauhaus-inspired single-piece aluminum body and glass front, it’s a minimalist piece that complements any space. As an optional add-on, Leica also lets you buy a floor stand that complements your projector with an all-metal design and hidden power connections that route cables through the stand’s central cylindrical pillar, rather than having the cable dangle aimlessly around and ruin your room’s aesthetic. You’d expect anything with Leica’s brand name to nail the visuals and optics, but the projector does a stellar job with audio too. The Cine Play 1 is built-in 10-watt speakers feature DTS Virtual:X, simulating surround sound to create an immersive audio experience. This means there’s no need to fuss with external speakers; you’re set with crisp highs and rich bass tones right out of the box. User experience features like automatic image alignment save you from the usual trial-and-error of projector placement. And with HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support, Leica wants you to enjoy content in the quality it was meant to be seen. With built-in WiFi, the projector also lets you stream directly from your favorite apps, turning any surface into a high-quality viewing experience without additional gear or hassles. The inclusion of Apple Airplay, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and multiple ports allows you to stream from smartphones, tablets, laptops, or external drives. The VIDAA smart system gives you quick access to popular streaming apps, while smart home integration lets you control it with just your voice. Priced at $3,795, the Cine Play 1 is definitely a more affordable entry in the Leica lineup, aimed at enthusiasts who appreciate high-end design but are conscious of budget. And if you’re short on surface space, Leica offers a compatible tripod stand for an extra $495, so you won’t be restricted to a countertop setup. For those ready to elevate their viewing game without a massive home theater overhaul, the Cine Play 1 feels like an intriguing blend of luxury and practicality.",
