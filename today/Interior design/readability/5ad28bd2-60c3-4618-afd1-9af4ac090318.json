They sell them in sets of five in black, brown, cream and green.**I found a couple really cute entertaining/serving pieces recently as well. This Christmas platter from Michael's had the sweetest little details:Â Isn't the tree peeking through the window so cute? This was only $10 on sale -- I can't decide if I'll display it or use it.Â These Santa glasses from Kirkland's were another favorite:Â They'll be fun for holiday cocktails, and would make a really great gift as well! I was impressed by the quality -- they are plenty thick and don't feel like they'll break if you look at them wrong.Â I like that I can use them as pretty bowl filler or hanging from garland or the tree:Â We'll have to see where I end up using them. :)Â I used one in our basement last year and loved it. It's so lightweight, but super fluffy.Â It would also look great layered on a tray or down the middle of a table with these cute wooden bells I picked up:Â I had a larger version already, so the three will look great nestled together. They actually jingle too! :)Â The letters are hanging from a thin velvet ribbon, and are easy to move around. It has a patina to it, so if you don't like an older, vintage look, you may not like this one.Â I use faux garland and stems ALL over our house during the holidays -- they are so versatile! These spruce stems are different from any I've seen before. They are SO soft and hang so beautifully:Â The stems are really full and only $5 each. They are SO cute in the Santa boots I picked up at Kirklands! How fun are those?Â These are battery-operated and looong, about 42 inches. So pretty!Â Battery-operated lights like these are great on a tray or centerpiece where you can't run plugged lights.Â Those are the all items I picked up this year! Nothing too crazy, but I really love every single one.Â When do you decorate for Christmas? I plan to do start earlier than ever this year, and yes, we host Thanksgiving! We just eat our turkey and mashed potatoes by the light of the tree. ;)Â I've learned the earlier I can finish up the decorating, the more I relax and enjoy the season. I LOVE the process, but by the time December hits I want to lighten my load as much as possible!Â But first, I need to get my office makeover finished up! I'll be back with progress on that next week.",
