  "description": "Australia is leading the world in our uptake of rooftop solar, with more than 4 million households producing their own renewable energy, and now home battery installations are also on the rise. But there’s a lot to consider: how much do they cost? How do you pick the right installer? And is it worth it? We speak to Jet Solar founder Jason Dickinson — a Melbourne-based electrician and Tesla Premium Certified Installer — to help cover off these frequently asked questions below.",

More than 75,000 battery storage systems were installed across Australia last year, up 47 per cent from 2023. Jet Solar founder Jason Dickinson who specialises in solar and battery installs — with more than 16 years industry experience — says any home planning to install rooftop solar should also invest in a battery like Tesla’s Powerwall. ‘Solar panels only work during the day, so if you’re not home using that power, it just goes to the grid — it’s a waste. You’re not getting your money’s worth,’ he explains. Last year his team installed about 100 new home batteries, and they’re projected to tackle between 500-600 battery installs in 2025. ‘It’s really taken off,’ he adds. Why should I invest in a battery? A typical residential solar system without a battery will only cover about 30-50 per cent of household power consumption. With a solar battery, this can be increased to 80 per cent, or potentially even cover the household’s total power consumption, according to Solar Choice. Australia has an abundance of solar power in the middle of the day, but in the evening, when energy consumption is at its highest, solar production drops off. ‘With a battery, you can then use all that excess solar power at night, instead of buying it from the grid,’ Jason says. Another benefit of home batteries like Tesla Powerwall are features like Time-Based Control, which optimises your energy usage to avoid paying peak prices. Or, with Storm Watch, in the event of an outage or extreme weather, the system will charge fully so you can keep your house running. ‘It can even forecast when a storm is coming’ Jason says. Where can batteries be installed? Batteries must be kept out of the sun and must comply with a number of safety regulations, which mandate how close they can be installed to a window or door. ‘Every site is different,’ Jason says. ‘We carry out a site visit and discuss with the owner. Normally we recommend installing them in a garage or on an external south-facing wall that is ideally undercover.’ How long do batteries last, and how much do they cost? The price ultimately depends on what system you chose, and how much energy your household requires. Some of the leading options range from around $10,000-$15,000 for an installed battery with a useable capacity of between 10-15 kWh. Again each battery’s lifespan will differ depending on the product, but Jason says it’s worth looking for one with a longer warranty, such as a Powerwall, which has a 10-year warranty. Seeking out an experienced and reputable installer is also important. ‘I see too many people getting burnt choosing [a brand] with a price that seems too good to be true. But what they’ll do is they’ll have a subcontractor installing it, who’s just the cheapest guy they could find to install it,’ Jason explains. He says going with an established business like Tesla is a safe bet, and recommends searching the Tesla Certified Installer database for businesses that have gone through a strict vetting process to become Certified to install Tesla Products. ‘You can expect to pay a little bit more for that, but you get what you pay for in this industry,’ he says. Is it worth it? How long will it take me to earn back my investment? Rooftop solar saves an average Aussie family $1500 on their annual bill, and this almost doubles if you add a battery, the Clean Energy Council says. ‘The more energy your house consumes, the quicker you’ll get your money back,’ Jason says. To get the most out of their systems, customers are switching to all-electric hot water systems, heating, and even electric vehicles so they can power their whole house and car with the battery’s reserves. Jason says one of the most important things to consider when assessing whether you should install a battery, is how long you’ll be living in your house. Currently, it takes the average household about eight years to earn back their investment, but there are a number of rebates and incentives from state governments to make installing a battery more affordable. The Federal government have also promised a new rebate that will knock off 30 per cent of the battery cost. ‘That should bring the return on investment to under five years, which makes it a great investment for anyone going to be in the house longer than that,’ Jason adds. What’s all this talk about feed-in tariffs? How can a battery help? A feed-in tariff is a credit you can receive for any unused solar power being sent back to the grid. At one point in time, feed-in tariffs were mandatory in every state in Australia, but this incentive has slowly come to an end over the years as rooftop solar has become more mainstream. ‘When I first started my business 16 years ago, Victorians could earn up to 66 cents per kilowatt-hour for exporting the excess energy back into the grid,’ Jason says. ‘Then it got reduced down to 30, then 15, then 6.6 and now it’s around 3 cents.’ Today, some electricity providers still offer households a small feed-in tariff. Some offer free energy from around 11am-1pm, when there’s an oversupply of solar flowing. And in certain cases throughout NSW, some households could actually be charged a few cents for sending power back to the grid to help manage the issues caused by the dramatic midday surge to the grid. Jason says this is another great reason to prioritise your self-consumption with a home battery. With Tesla Powerwall, you could even have the option to sell your energy back to your retailer during peak consumption periods like at night, so it’s best to shop around for a company that can further maximise the investment on your battery.
