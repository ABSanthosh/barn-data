  "text": "Passionfruit Melting Moments (Makes 14)  250g unsalted butter, softened 65g icing sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting the fork 60g corn starch Pinch fine sea salt Passionfruit buttercream 100g unsalted butter, softened 350g icing sugar, plus extra to dust Pulp from 3-4 passionfruit Method: Preheat the oven to 160 C fan-forced. Line two baking trays with baking paper. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, place the butter, icing sugar and vanilla and cream on a medium-high speed until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes). Add the flour, corn starch and a pinch of salt and mix on a low speed until the mixture just comes together. Scoop tablespoon amounts of the mixture and roll into a ball. Place onto the prepared trays, leaving room for them to spread as they cook. Dip a fork in a little flour and press down on the balls to flatten slightly to around 1 cm in thickness. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Allow to cool. For the passionfruit buttercream, place the butter and icing sugar in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on a medium-high speed until light and fluffy (3-4 minutes). Reduce the mixer to low and add the passionfruit pulp, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the mixture is thick but pipeable. You may not need all of the passionfruit. Pipe the passionfruit buttercream onto half of the melting moment biscuits and sandwich with the remaining half of the biscuits. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to slightly firm up, dust with icing sugar and serve. What else I’m cooking: As a snack when friends are over, I arrange witlof leaves on a platter. Top each leaf with a slice of peach or nectarine (figs would be good too), a piece of stilton and some chopped walnuts. Drizzle everything with good olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar and season well. What else I’m eating: The Prawn cocktail at The Builders Arms Hotel. So retro, so delicious!",
