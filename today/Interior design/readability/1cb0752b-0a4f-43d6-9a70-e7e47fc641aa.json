  "text": "A travertine ramp forms the centrepiece of the Vans West End store in London, which was remodelled by architect Andrea Caputo to celebrate skateboarding, music and art. American apparel and accessories brand Vans looked to its skateboarding heritage when developing the concept for its store on London's Oxford Street, which it has occupied since 2019. A travertine skate ramp sits at the centre of the storeCaputo's Milan-based studio oversaw the transformation of the store, which celebrates skateboarding culture through its bold design and direct references to the sport. The main feature that runs the length of the store is a 200-square-metre skate ramp made from travertine stone that was developed with input from Vans' team of skateboarding ambassadors. The ramp has a wall at one end. Photo by Rafal Wojnowski\"Designed as a single large block of stone, entirely laid and polished on-site, the ramp will be the beating heart of the store,\" said Vans, \"used for regular skate lessons, demos and events by the Vans skate team and local skate schools.\" The ramp is divided along its length into different sections that form obstacles for performing tricks. This \"multi-transition\" configuration resembles an extended half pipe with a dramatic vertical wall at one end. It can be used for seating when it's not being skated. Photo by Rafal WojnowskiWhen not in use for skating, the ramp's modules can be reconfigured to provide seating or merchandising stands. A series of perforated glass panels that function like peg boards can also be added to enhance the retail displays. The modular set-up allows the interior to be easily reconfigured so it can perform its everyday role as a retail space, as well as hosting activities and events such as live music shows or art exhibitions. Other references to skateboarding featured throughout the store include the plywood used for wall panelling and product displays, which recalls the materiality of conventional skate ramps. The Vans store also features carved plywoodThe plywood was carved to create an irregular three-dimensional surface intended to evoke the way skateboarders \"grind\" the metal parts of their boards along ramps, rails and copings. The rest of the interior has a stripped back, industrial aesthetic, with a concrete floor and exposed ducting contributing to a sense of urban authenticity. Andrea Caputo's studio wanted the store to celebrate skateboardingVans West End will present a wide range of Vans products alongside curated partnerships with brands such as jewellers The Great Frog and creative studio Gomi, which produced a collection of checkered speakers and powerbanks exclusively for the store. Caputo previously designed a store for Vans in Seoul, South Korea, featuring plywood display modules informed by the work of American artists Carl Andre and Donald Judd. Last year, Vans unveiled a temporary skate bowl in front of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Paris. The photography is by Tom D Morgan unless otherwise stated.
