  "description": "Mid-century design, combined with a love of Japanese ceramics and the beauty of Victoria’s coast all inspired the look and feel of this little beach retreat. Sunset is a newly built accommodation designed by Shelby Ann Studio and ceramicist Chela Edmunds of Takeawei. Located in the laid-back coastal enclave of Jan Juc, the getaway spans just 28 square metres, but anything it lacks it size it makes up for with its clever design.",

  "text": "When you live in a place as beautiful as Jan Juc — about an hour and a half outside of Melbourne — it’s only right to want to share it with others. Designer Chela Edmunds of ceramics studio Takeawei was brainstorming ways to use her studio space and bring new creatives to her coastal community when she decided to set up a new accommodation on her family’s property. ‘We live in such a beautiful part of the Surf Coast, sitting in between Torquay and Bells Beach, with its wild and rugged coastline and pristine beaches and I love sharing that with people,’ Chela says. ‘I thought, why not offer accommodation and a studio space to visiting artists as a creative retreat?’ This was the initial inspiration behind Sunset, a 28-square-metre newly built getaway located on the site of her family’s former veggie patch. Chela engaged designer Shelby Ann Studio for the project. One of the biggest challenges was the orientation — the sloping roof manages to maximise outlook and natural light while ensuring privacy — and finding a way to squeeze all the amenities for a self-contained studio into a compact footprint. Shelby came up with a clever open-plan floorplan that makes the most of the small space, relying instead on dividing joinery to create a sense of separation between the sleeping quarters and living areas. ‘As Chela is a ceramicist, it was important to have space for dinnerware and sculptures to sit on display,’ Shelby adds. Influences of mid-century design and Japanese minimalism shine through in the use of timber open-shelves and the mustard-coloured sofa. A fun circular window also offers a retro edge, as Japanese mosaic tiles feature in both the kitchen and immersive green bathroom. The green and blue hues of the nearby ocean are reflected in the interior colour palette, which was inspired by the earthy surrounds. ‘Walking into the space you just feel relaxed,’ Shelby says. ‘It’s like the after feeling of a deep breath. It was important to create a space that felt cosy and warm whilst bringing some more bold elements into the space.’ Chela says Sunset is now ‘the perfect balance’ of relaxation and adventure; function and form. ‘Sunset is centrally located in Jan Juc, just a short stroll to local cafés, the beach, and clifftop walks to Bells Beach and Torquay,’ she says. ‘Each space is designed to connect with nature—you can wake up to the sight of gum trees from bed, enjoy breakfast with a view, or soak in the Ofuro-style tub while watching the trees sway in the breeze. ‘I want Sunset to feel like a second home: somewhere that inspires creativity, invites rest, and lets you live your ideal beach life.’ Book a stay at Sunset here and find out more about artist residencies here.",
