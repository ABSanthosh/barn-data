Unfortunately, these bulky devices tend to make you look like a TIE fighter pilot.Australian medical products company ResMed produces an alternative. Their N30i is lightweight, minimal, and looks as if an industrial designer was actually involved in its development. \"AirTouch™ N30i is an exceptionally comfortable nasal mask with a frame fully wrapped in soft, luxurious-feeling fabric that's gentle on your face and hair. Its tube-up design means no tubing in front so you have the freedom to sleep in any position you want.\" The nasal cushion is made of silicone for comfort. The hose connection is quick-release, for when you need to get up in the middle of the night to hit the bathroom. Additionally, the mask is designed to be easy to disassemble and clean. Designed in Australia, the N30i won an Australian Good Design Award.",
