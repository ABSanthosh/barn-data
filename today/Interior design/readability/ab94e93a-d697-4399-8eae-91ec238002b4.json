The trolley features a lightweight, foldable, and durable aluminum frame, and weighing just 10 kilograms, it can be easily transferred. Its advanced AI enables navigation while tracking real-time performance, analyzing the player’s movements, and offering insights and advice to help improve gameplay.all images courtesy of Futurewaveixi’s feedback improves golfer’s performanceThe development of iXi took Futurewave product agency and Botronics two years of research and innovation.The trolley features the patented iXi latch © 1-clic folding system, offering compact storage. By tracking key metrics like swing patterns and distances, the device provides personalized feedback, giving golfers the tools to ace their performance. In addition to its cutting-edge technology, iXi delivers a user-friendly design. The intuitive controls allow golfers to focus entirely on their game, while the trolley takes care of transporting their equipment.
