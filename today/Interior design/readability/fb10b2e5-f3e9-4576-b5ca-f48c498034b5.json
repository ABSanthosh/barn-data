(This is probably twice the size of all of my kitchens up till our last house.)Â  I'll take you through the steps of this project (with links to full tutorials) and then I'll share the final reveal at the end of the post.Â  I am so incredibly proud of this room because I did almost every project on my own. I thought the massive kitchen makeover I did at our last house was a lot of work -- this one beat that by far! It took me more than a year to complete the space.Â  Building and installing cabinetsÂ  The first step in this space was figuring out a functional kitchenette layout. The only major appliance in here is a fridge, so I didn't have to worry about a typical \"work triangle.\"Â  But I did want the room to flow well for us. After living with it for so long, I can say the final layout has worked perfectly! I decided on unassembled cabinets from Home Depot. They were SO easy to assemble...once I got a couple down I was knocking them out fast.Â  We saved a ton of money building the cabinets myself. The price is lower but they are made with quality materials and include all of the bells and whistles like soft close doors and drawers:Â  Instead of using the (more expensive) refrigerator side panels, we had a 4x8 wood panel cut down. I later color matched the cabinets at the paint store to paint these and the trim. LVP flooring installation and reviewÂ  This was my first time installing LVP flooring, and may be my last. ðŸ˜‚Â  OK, it wasn't really that bad. I think if I had a more open space with less things to cut around, it wouldn't be nearly as much work.Â  We are thrilled with our choice for the flooring in this kitchen area. I chose the Dusk Cherry color from the Lifeproof line at Home Depot.Â  We recently had a minor water issue (coming from an ice maker) and the floors are still as good as new. They are waterproof and can be installed right on top of cement. Â  Overall there has been ZERO wear and tear -- nothing that I can see at all. (That's with four pets in the house as well.)Â  Countertop, sink and faucet installation I've installed smaller countertops over the years, but nothing like this. I chose butcher block counters for this area because they are 1. affordable 2. easy to find and 3. look GREAT!Â  When I've installed these before, it's been one piece. This time I measured, cut down, fit and then stained and treated three large pieces before installing:Â  Once they were in, I cut a hole for the single basin sink and installed that with the faucet.Â  I can't believe in my 25+ years of DIYing that I had never installed a faucet, let alone one where I had to add all of the plumbing fixtures to the rough in coming out of the wall.Â  But I did a TON of research, borrowed some tools from a friend and got it done! I was SO proud of myself, especially when I turned on the water and there wasn't one leak. :) (Even now!) Sometimes my desire to learn new things comes from my complete and total impatience to just get it done. Ha! It works out well for me. Tile backsplash and DIY gallery rail I used a dark ceramic tile with a faux marble look and black grout for the backsplash. I love the contrast against the warm wood countertops: I later installed black outlets and covers to blend in with the backsplash.Â  One of my favorite projects in here was this \"faux\" gallery rail I added to a small shelf above the tile:Â  Gallery rails are metal fixtures you can install on shallow shelves and/or ledges -- and I love the look of them. Problem is, they are VERY expensive.Â  It gives us a great spot to display photos and art that we love.Â  DIY countertop bookcasesÂ  I've had these shelving units in mind for years! I really wanted to make the space between them curved, but so far I haven't added that detail.Â  If you've followed me over the years, you know how much I love built ins of any kind. I knew I could add some character to this room with some built in shelves.Â  I love having a spot to add some decor, plus they are a great spot to hang our wine classes. Stay tuned to see what I did with all of those wine corks!Â  DIY bar with hidden storage Our plan all along was to built a bar/peninsula to finish up this space, but it wasn't till about a year later that I finally completed that part.Â  I had to figure out how I wanted it to work first. I ended up using wall cabinets for the main part of the bar:Â  My only splurge in this kitchenette was the countertops on the bar. They are a black granite with gold, white and gray tones and SO much pretty movement. The installers matched the movement from the top to the side \"waterfall\" piece:Â  During this process, we also extended the floors to a nearby doorway. This made the room feel so much bigger and gave the chairs room to be pulled out easily.Â  Wine cork wall with dart board This was another one of my favorite projects, even though it took FOREVER. ðŸ˜‚ We've had a ton of wine corks that I've saved up for 15-20 years, knowing I'd do something fun with them eventually.Â  The process was easy, just time consuming. I shared how I easily cut the corks in that post as well!Â  Now let's take a look at the whole finished space! There was one addition I hired out at the end -- I painted the crown molding but had some help putting it up. I was worn out!Â  I had it wrapped around the bookcases as well, so it makes them look more custom and ties them into the space even more: We've had these wine refrigerators forever. They aren't the same but look super similar.Â  I just swapped the direction of the door on one, so we can open them from the middle of this area:Â  The other side of the room isn't as exciting, but it is super functional! This is where most of the storage is, these cabinets provide more than enough down here:Â  My cabinet layout had some open, awkward spaces. So instead of wasting space in the corners under the counters, I decided to add some simple open shelving on either side of the sink cabinet:Â  We loved this space before I finished the bar, but it finally feels complete with it done! Our son loves to sit here and do homework:Â  I forgot one additional change we had done as well -- an electrician ran a couple recessed lights over the bar:Â  I didn't want hanging lights, as I thought it would get too busy. The recessed lights are perfect, and of course are on a dimmer so we can dim the light if needed.Â  The hidden storage in the bar is awesome, and I have to show everyone where it is when they visit. ;)Â  We love this space so much, it's been a wonderful addition when we entertain our family and friends. But my little family uses it most of all -- we are definitely basement people and at least one of us spends time down here every evening.Â  Hope you enjoyed the tour, let me know if you have any questions! I'll include sources at the bottom of the post:Â  Sources for items in this room:Â  Bar stools are from At Home Baskets from Target Rug in front of sink Lamp on counter Glass containers with wood lids Wine glass racks from Amazon Antique brass cabinet knobs Antique brass cabinet handles \"Bar and lounge\" sign above cork wall Brass swing arm sconce (comes in set of two, the other is in our pantry) Large artwork was from HomeGoods Decor was all items/frames we already had.",
