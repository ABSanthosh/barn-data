  "description": "Though it looks more like a scooter, this Olto E-Bike was designed specifically for bike lanes. Created by NYC-based transportation startup Infinite Machine, the Olto was designed with what I can only call a cyber-utilitarian aesthetic. The Olto is well-proportioned, getting right what the Tesla Cybertruck got wrong. When you nail proportions and get angles right, it imbues the design with confidence, which is further evinced here by the unadorned welded steel and anodized aluminum body. There are no extraneous stylistic elements here. It's clean, modern and beautiful. It's also available in all black. It has a 40-mile range and can hit a top speed of 20 mph. It takes 5.5 hours to get a full charge. Here's where the removable rechargeable battery goes:To fully appreciate the design, you really need to see how this thing works. Check out the magnetic folding pedals, the flip-out passenger footpegs, the hanging hooks beneath the seat:One hurdle to owning one is its weight. At 176 lbs, only those who live in elevator buildings would be able to keep this in their apartments; otherwise it would have to live outside. City dwellers might not be comfortable leaving a $3,500 machine, locked or not, in full view of thieves.The Olto is currently in production and will be available for sale later this year.",
