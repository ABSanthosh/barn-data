  "text": "Tables are designed to be stable, or at least they should be if they’re meant to serve their purpose of providing a safe horizontal platform to put things on. More often than not, table designs are meant to visually convey that characteristic through their structure, forms, and materials. Of course, there will always be exceptions that challenge our brains with a visual that seems contrary to a table’s spirit. This table might be made of thick stainless steel always associated with sturdiness, but its irregular, almost chaotic appearance goes against that flow. In fact, its asymmetrical structure doesn’t inspire confidence in its stability, forcing people to pause and possibly consider the deeper meaning behind the beautiful yet unorthodox side table design. Designers: Nikita Gorshkov, Alexandra Ivanets (Primitive Buro) Very few things in nature have perfect symmetries or geometrical shapes. You will always find some imperfection, like a jagged edge, a torn piece, or a missing part in naturally occurring things, and yet these very same objects impress a sense of beauty that is difficult to pull off artificially. Designers continue to be inspired by these imperfections, transforming flaws into strengths like in this Flaw coffee table. Almost like a decaying tree trunk, a puddle of muddy water, or a cracked piece of rock, the Flow table’s lone leg introduces an element of controlled chaos to the design. Rather than some uniform pattern, the abstract-looking jagged edges create a sense of tension that is meant to contrast with the rest of the table’s aesthetic. Polished to a mirror-like finish, the stainless steel construction looks almost diametrically opposed to the brutally unfinished shape of the table. It also has the effect of distorting the images mirrored on its surface. While most tables have two or more legs to keep them balanced, the Flow table’s asymmetrical bracket-like form will cause some to wonder whether it will tip over under some weight. Of course, it’s crafted to actually be structurally stable, but that doesn’t stop our minds from questioning the disjunct between what our eyes see and what we expect. It adds yet another element to that controlled chaos and beautiful contrast that the design wants to express. The Flow table offers a bold and interesting choice for homeowners who like to live on the edge and have furniture that reflects that as well. The tension between chaos and control, unpredictability and stability, and asymmetry and balance make for an interesting presence in any space, whether it’s in the middle of your living room or even off to the side of your desk.",
