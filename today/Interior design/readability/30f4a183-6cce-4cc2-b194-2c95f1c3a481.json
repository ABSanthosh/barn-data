  "text": "Photo: Holly Becker Let’s discuss old homes and how to modernize and enhance their unique beauty through thoughtful design, while honoring their history. I’ve included a list of resources for you for heritage paint brands in both the USA and Europe, and listed some great resources in Europe for finding unique cupboards, sinks, and other special antique items for your historical home. This is a topic I’m passionate about, especially given my 15 years of experience as an Interior Designer in both the United States and Germany. I currently enjoy the charm of historic architecture in my German city, but I’ve also had the pleasure of living and working in New England - I’ve lived in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. I mainly spent the most time though in Boston, one of the earliest settlements in the United States, which is renowned for its beautiful and historically rich architecture, making it one of the most picturesque cities in the country.Here in Germany, I am lucky enough to have a beautiful old turn-of-the-century Jugendstil apartment from 1901 in Hannover’s most beautiful districts called List. I chose this space for its architecture, square meters (230m2), access to the forest behind my house, and the natural light that fills the rooms from morning to night. I also wanted to live here because I love the unique features such as 125 year old herringbone wood flooring, original double doors in several rooms with glass panels, some of the ceilings have intricate carvings, we have beautiful old doors as you enter each room, a grand entryway, and transom windows, to name just a few of the unique traits in my space. I also have two wintergartens, completely surrounded by glass, for relaxing in the summer and for my 48 plants and succulents. Each evening, I unwind as the sun sets over the clay-tiled rooftops, casting warm light through my dining room and scattering playful reflections from a disco ball atop my cabinet. I love the charm of historical property and hope to always be fortunate enough to enjoy property like this.As for my design style - well my furnishings blend various styles and periods, from vintage flea market finds to sleek Scandinavian pieces, with a nod to my American roots through Knoll and Eames chairs. My home is a blend of old and new, inside and out with lots of art and handmade objects like ceramics - which I collect and love. The bathrooms and kitchen floors date back to the 80s, adding another layer to its history but sadly, not an era I loved - so these rooms are my least favorite in the house and in dire need of renovation. However, this mix of past and present, new and old, imperfect and very imperfect, creates a truly special living space - at least in my eyes. This is why I thought to share some ideas around heritage decor and to highlight one of my favorite books at the moment which perfectly captures this blend of styles, but also that teaches you how to embrace heritage homes and their special charm, along with navigating the path to making them more modern without losing their sense of history and originality.\"Heritage Style\" is the latest book by British stylist Selina Lake, published by Ryland, Peters \u0026 Small. It’s a beautifully styled and photographed guide that brings together her best ideas on period decor. The photos in this post are from the book. Selina graciously allowed me to select some of my favorite photos, styled by her and photographed by Rachel Whiting, to share with you here, I hope that you enjoy them. Selina’s gorgeous book celebrates what she calls the “new nostalgic mood” in interiors, showcasing homes she’s styled with a mix of vintage, inherited, and modern pieces. She offers tips on how to achieve this timeless look, resulting in a home that's both personal and stylish. I found this book inspiring and even picked up a few new ideas, which made it worth sharing with you because sometimes I truly think in the world of design I’ve seen and heard it all, but I did pick up a lot of good information in this book. Selina says, \"Our homes have become more important to us than ever, and heritage style taps into the comforting charm of traditional interiors. Paneling, wallpaper, floral fabrics, and heritage paint colors create a backdrop for houseplants, artwork, and contemporary crafts. Upholstered and wicker furniture, decorative details, and plump cushions add warmth, welcome, and a sense of familiarity.\"I couldn’t agree more. It’s that same cozy, reassuring comfort we feel when we step into a childhood home or visit our grandparents.This is the magic behind some of the most beautiful yet comfortable interiors today—capturing that lived-in warmth and blending it with your own personal style. Creating this mix, though, can be tricky. That’s where Selina’s book comes in. It’s a guide to developing a keen eye for mixing old and new, combining color, pattern, and texture, and learning the art of editing to keep only what truly matters or that makes you feel comfortable and happy. Before moving to Germany, I lived in an 1875 carriage house in Hollis, New Hampshire, and before that, a restored barn outside of Boston. I’ve also designed and renovated many period homes and apartments throughout the years for myself, my family and my clients - so I know quite a lot about restoration and renovation particularly when dealing with older properties. \"Heritage Style\" demonstrates how to craft a home that feels both modern and nostalgic, striking the perfect balance with personal touches that make your space inviting and comfortable, so you don’t have to be a designer like me to do it - you just need a great book and a good eye - and of course a list of fabulous, trusted resources (paint company, architect, contractors, salvage yard, antique store, etc.) One thing I’ve learned is that if you want to create a beautiful residence within an older home, you should consider mixing up patterns, which brings personality and a touch of the unexpected to your space. Combining patterns from different eras adds depth and tells a richer story, steering clear of the flat, catalog-style look that’s so common on Instagram or the all-beige aesthetic which to me, looks like an home for the elderly! I remember the all-beige nursing home my great grandmother lived in during the final days of her 97th year of life - it was all beige in the reception, sitting room and kitchen area. My mother also has the all-beige aesthetic in the elderly care center that she spent the final year of her life in - I couldn’t believe how colorless and sad the environment was - all beige - what a way to live the last years of life! My thoughts on all beige homes remains the same as it always have - no thanks! I love beige but it needs to have some contrast and interesting art and design to drive it up and forward or else, yeah, it’s depressing as hell. Anyway, creative pattern mixing sets your home apart, especially when incorporating vintage or heirloom pieces. It also gives you a chance to add your unique design point-of-view and show your vibe because we all have vibes… So share them through your room designs.Speaking of vibes, whether it’s a digital mood board, a Pinterest board, or a physical mood board, start by laying out the vibe you want to create. For heritage homes, incorporate signature patterns like gingham, dainty florals, leafy designs, and traditional prints from companies like Farrow \u0026 Ball or William Morris. Add plenty of natural materials like jute and ceramic, along with handmade elements—think woven, embroidered, carved, quilted, or block-printed pieces. Don’t forget to include paint swatches and natural elements like herbs or flowers. As you dive into the mood board exercise, it’s a good time to research heritage colors that suit your home’s architectural style and era. This helps you to honor the home and its unique timeline. Many paint companies offer heritage palettes that can be a great starting point, like Farrow \u0026 Ball for example. You could even hire a heritage color consultant, but if you’re like me, you’ll enjoy doing the research yourself—that’s part of the joy of owning (or renting) an old home! A basic understanding of your home’s history makes it easier to choose the most flattering colors.

Mismatch furniture is oddly the perfect match, really! When everything matches, it doesn’t look cozy and collected over time - it looks like a catalog page and who really wants your rooms to look like everything in them was sourced in one place? In this older home by the sea in Kent, England (left), mismatched chairs paired with a gingham tablecloth, a simple paper pendant, and a natural hemp rug add visual interest without overshadowing the architectural details. The paper pendant definitely is unexpected because these things are literally everywhere (thanks IKEA), but they strangely fit an abundance of spaces and are an extremely affordable lighting option. This can be effective when you just spent thousands restoring an old home or paying thousands for heritage eco-friendly paint! Aside from the pendant, I’d say the patterned wooden floors, built-ins, and grand shuttered doors with intricate plasterwork take center stage, while the furnishings provide a charming cottagecore touch. Mixing modern and vintage elements in the kitchen can be a bit trickier than in other rooms, but the result is worth the effort. In the photo above, the cupboards and long table were sourced from a Belgian antiques dealer—they originally came from a monastery! The kitchen’s decorative plaster ceiling is beautifully highlighted with Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Slipper Satin paint, while the modern marble worktop adds a contemporary touch to the space. While it’s tempting to go all-new, especially since finding old cupboards, sinks, or faucets can be challenging and expensive, consider opting for “vintage-inspired” pieces instead—Restoration Hardware has built a business around this concept. For lighting, explore vintage stores for fixtures that match your home’s style, or choose new ones with a vintage feel. “It’s not only a comforting style, but also a sustainable one, built around pre-owned and vintage pieces sourced at online auctions or on Instagram and given a new lease of life in modern homes” — Selina Lake If you live in the UK or Europe and wonder where to source vintage cupboards for the kitchen, or sinks, etc. then you may want to check out these markets on your next road trip:Pamono (Europe-wide) Pamono offers a wide selection of vintage and antique furniture, including kitchen cabinets. The platform connects buyers with sellers across Europe, providing a curated selection of high-quality pieces.Selency (France) Selency is a French online marketplace that specializes in vintage and second-hand furniture. They have a good selection of vintage kitchen cabinets and other kitchen furnishings.VNTG (Netherlands) VNTG specializes in mid-century and vintage furniture, offering a selection of kitchen cabinets that can be sourced from various locations across Europe.Brussels Design Market (Belgium) One of the largest vintage design markets in Europe, it’s an excellent place to find vintage kitchen cabinets and other furniture.Mercanteinfiera (Italy) Held in Parma, this fair is one of Europe’s largest antique and vintage furniture fairs, with many dealers offering vintage kitchen pieces.Portobello Road Market (UK) This famous London market is a great spot to hunt for vintage kitchen cabinets and other antique items.Retrouvius (UK) Retrouvius specializes in architectural salvage and reclaimed materials, including vintage kitchen cabinets.Les Puces de Saint-Ouen (France) Located in Paris, this flea market is one of the largest in the world and offers a vast selection of vintage and antique kitchen furniture.LASSCO (UK) LASSCO is a renowned salvage company that offers reclaimed and vintage items, including kitchen cabinets sourced from historic buildings.Piet Jonker (Netherlands) Piet Jonker specializes in architectural antiques, including vintage kitchen furniture and cabinets.Demolition Depot (Germany) Specializes in reclaimed architectural pieces, including vintage kitchen cabinets and fittings.Tip: eBay can be a good source for vintage kitchen cabinets, especially from private sellers and small shops across Europe and Etsy has numerous sellers offering vintage and antique kitchen cabinets from various parts of Europe, too. I’ve also purchased a lot of interesting things are flea markets all over Berlin, Hannover and Hamburg - the markets in Europe are endless for vintage finds! Always remember to add a modern edge with some bold, unexpected accents to bring a heritage home into 2024! The homeowner created this striking quilt above (left), which pairs beautifully with striped bedding and vibrant orange velvet pillows. The result is a warm, inviting space that’s also a real showstopper. The black accents and the plaster walls with a pink backdrop add depth and character. In the photo to the right, imagine the space without the chair - not the same vibe - the chair adds some spice and its mid century flair breaks up the cottagecore aesthetic.Homes that feel truly inviting often have a thoughtful mix of textures and eye-catching details, don’t you think? I hope you enjoyed my thoughts around heritage design and found some of this information helpful. If you have any questions, please remember to ask below in the comments. I’m an Interior Designer with an extensive design background in design in both the United States, Germany and northern Europe, so please just ask!Selina’s beautiful book, Heritage Home, can be purchased from Amazon, www.rylandpeters.com, Bookshop.org and many other places.Images © Rachel Whiting, taken from Heritage Style by Selina Lake, published by Ryland Peters \u0026 Small (£25) Holly Becker Holly Becker is the Founder and Author of design and lifestyle site, decor8.

id=\"block-a10e8386ea77b8ef8bd3\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eLet’s discuss old homes and how to modernize and enhance their unique beauty through thoughtful design, while honoring their history. I’ve included a list of resources for you for heritage paint brands in both the USA and Europe, and listed some great resources in Europe for finding unique cupboards, sinks, and other special antique items for your historical home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a topic I’m passionate about, especially given my 15 years of experience as an Interior Designer in both the United States and Germany. I currently enjoy the charm of historic architecture in my German city, but I’ve also had the pleasure of living and working in New England - I’ve lived in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. I mainly spent the most time though in Boston, one of the earliest settlements in the United States, which is renowned for its beautiful and historically rich architecture, making it one of the most picturesque cities in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere in Germany, I am lucky enough to have a beautiful old turn-of-the-century Jugendstil apartment from 1901 in Hannover’s most beautiful districts called List. I chose this space for its architecture, square meters (230m2), access to the forest behind my house, and the natural light that fills the rooms from morning to night. I also wanted to live here because I love the unique features such as 125 year old herringbone wood flooring, original double doors in several rooms with glass panels, some of the ceilings have intricate carvings, we have beautiful old doors as you enter each room, a grand entryway, and transom windows, to name just a few of the unique traits in my space. I also have two wintergartens, completely surrounded by glass, for relaxing in the summer and for my 48 plants and succulents. Each evening, I unwind as the sun sets over the clay-tiled rooftops, casting warm light through my dining room and scattering playful reflections from a disco ball atop my cabinet. I love the charm of historical property and hope to always be fortunate enough to enjoy property like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for my design style - well my furnishings blend various styles and periods, from vintage flea market finds to sleek Scandinavian pieces, with a nod to my American roots through Knoll and Eames chairs. My home is a blend of old and new, inside and out with lots of art and handmade objects like ceramics - which I collect and love. The bathrooms and kitchen floors date back to the 80s, adding another layer to its history but sadly, not an era I loved - so these rooms are my least favorite in the house and in dire need of renovation. However, this mix of past and present, new and old, imperfect and very imperfect, creates a truly special living space - at least in my eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is why I thought to share some ideas around heritage decor and to highlight one of my favorite books at the moment which perfectly captures this blend of styles, but also that teaches you how to embrace heritage homes and their special charm, along with navigating the path to making them more modern without losing their sense of history and originality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://selinalake.co.uk/portfolio/heritage-style/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026#34;Heritage Style\u0026#34;\u003c/a\u003e is the latest book by British stylist \u003ca href=\"http://selinalake.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSelina Lake\u003c/a\u003e, published by \u003ca href=\"https://rylandpeters.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRyland, Peters \u0026amp; Small\u003c/a\u003e.

Paneling, wallpaper, floral fabrics, and heritage paint colors create a backdrop for houseplants, artwork, and contemporary crafts. Upholstered and wicker furniture, decorative details, and plump cushions add warmth, welcome, and a sense of familiarity.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t agree more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s that same cozy, reassuring comfort we feel when we step into a childhood home or visit our grandparents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the magic behind some of the most beautiful yet comfortable interiors today—capturing that lived-in warmth and blending it with your own personal style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreating this mix, though, can be tricky. That’s where Selina’s book comes in. It’s a guide to developing a keen eye for mixing old and new, combining color, pattern, and texture, and learning the art of editing to keep only what truly matters or that makes you feel comfortable and happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Before moving to Germany, I lived in an 1875 carriage house in Hollis, New Hampshire, and before that, a restored barn outside of Boston. I’ve also designed and renovated many period homes and apartments throughout the years for myself, my family and my clients - so I know quite a lot about restoration and renovation particularly when dealing with older properties. \u0026#34;Heritage Style\u0026#34; demonstrates how to craft a home that feels both modern and nostalgic, striking the perfect balance with personal touches that make your space inviting and comfortable, so you don’t have to be a designer like me to do it - you just need a great book and a good eye - and of course a list of fabulous, trusted resources (paint company, architect, contractors, salvage yard, antique store, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\" data-block-type=\"5\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723642289528_169021\"\u003e\n\n      \n\n      \n        \u003cfigure\u003e\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \u003cdiv data-animation-role=\"image\"\u003e\n            \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg data-stretch=\"false\" data-src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg\" data-image-dimensions=\"575x706\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"\" data-load=\"false\" elementtiming=\"system-image-block\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg\" width=\"575\" height=\"706\" alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 100vw, 100vw\" onload=\"this.classList.add(\u0026#34;loaded\u0026#34;)\" srcset=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=100w 100w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=300w 300w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=500w 500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=750w 750w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=1000w 1000w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=1500w 1500w, https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58b56e5cd2b857960a275c83/6fa3d0db-b2dc-4e6d-bca8-b6e54378f4de/Screenshot_14-8-2024_17057_substackcdn.com.jpeg?format=2500w 2500w\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-loader=\"sqs\"/\u003e\n\n            \u003c/p\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        \u003c/figure\u003e\n      \n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-block-type=\"2\" data-border-radii=\"{\u0026#34;topLeft\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;px\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;:0.0},\u0026#34;topRight\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;px\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;:0.0},\u0026#34;bottomLeft\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;px\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;:0.0},\u0026#34;bottomRight\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;unit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;px\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;:0.0}}\" id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723642289528_172866\"\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eOne thing I’ve learned is that if you want to create a beautiful residence within an older home, you should consider mixing up patterns, which brings personality and a touch of the unexpected to your space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCombining patterns from different eras adds depth and tells a richer story, steering clear of the flat, catalog-style look that’s so common on Instagram or the all-beige aesthetic which to me, looks like an home for the elderly! I remember the all-beige nursing home my great grandmother lived in during the final days of her 97th year of life - it was all beige in the reception, sitting room and kitchen area. My mother also has the all-beige aesthetic in the elderly care center that she spent the final year of her life in - I couldn’t believe how colorless and sad the environment was  - all beige - what a way to live the last years of life! My thoughts on all beige homes remains the same as it always have - no thanks! I love beige but it needs to have some contrast and interesting art and design to drive it up and forward or else, yeah, it’s depressing as hell. Anyway,  creative pattern mixing sets your home apart, especially when incorporating vintage or heirloom pieces. It also gives you a chance to add your unique design point-of-view and show your vibe because we all have vibes… So share them through your room designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of vibes, whether it’s a digital mood board, a Pinterest board, or a physical mood board, start by laying out the vibe you want to create. For heritage homes, incorporate signature patterns like gingham, dainty florals, leafy designs, and traditional prints from companies like Farrow \u0026amp; Ball or William Morris. Add plenty of natural materials like jute and ceramic, along with handmade elements—think woven, embroidered, carved, quilted, or block-printed pieces.
