  "text": "Folks over at 8BitDo are on a role this year with the release of high-quality gaming controllers (most often officially licensed) that cater to the needs of every kind of gamer. Just when you thought what more could come from the house of this innovative tech company, they have the perfect gift this holiday season for kids and people with small hands. The peppy gamepad is basically a compact and lighter version of the Ultimate 2C controller. The officially licensed Xbox controller is 20 percent smaller and 10 percent lighter than its predecessor, thus making it a good option for gamers who think the Xbox Series X|S controllers are a bit of a handful. Weighing just 189.6 grams the controller is well-suited for long playing sessions which can fatigue your wrists and hands. Designer: 8BitDo The layout on the controller is similar to the regular ones by Xbox – the only difference being the more crammed positioning (or compact alignment if you have small hands) of buttons. The buttons, joysticks, and triggers are full-sized, so that you don’t miss any input during crucial gameplay action. Although the main target audience of this gaming peripheral is teens and younger gamers, it’ll be the most cozy option for female gamers who tend to have smaller hands and males with average-sized hands. The action buttons, directional pad, and the magnetic Hall effect joysticks are positioned very close together. This while keeping in mind ergonomics and a clear distinction in gaming inputs when multiple buttons or joysticks are pushed. 8BitDo has also included Hall effect triggers on the rear, and slightly smaller shoulder buttons. The visually striking gamepad comes wrapped in a translucent shell with white, green and pink hues along with the matching button and joystick color theme. Whenever a button is pushed or the joystick rolled, the cool LED lights react with flashes or follow the direction of the movement. This they call the Fire Ring and it looks amazing. Ultimate Mini is going to be available in wired option only, so that there is no extra battery weight just like in other wireless controllers. It is compatible with Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Windows 10 or higher PCs. The compact gamepad can be ordered right away in the US for $35 from the official 8BitDo online store or Amazon.",
