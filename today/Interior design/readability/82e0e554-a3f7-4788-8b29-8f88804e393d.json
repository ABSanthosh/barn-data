The experimental furniture piece was SLA 3D printed out of Accura, a tough, flame-retardant resin that offers both durability and, after cleanup, a fine surface finish. As with much of Donders' work, this was designed less as a production piece, and more to demonstrate the role that advanced computational modeling can have in material optimization.
