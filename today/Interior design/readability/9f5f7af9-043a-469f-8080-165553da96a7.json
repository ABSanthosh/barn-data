  "text": "G.ao House by 85 Design sits quietly in Hòa Hải, Vietnam, blending seamlessly with the tropical surroundings. This project goes beyond providing just a home or office. It represents a move toward more sustainable architecture in Vietnam, showing how even small buildings can make a difference. The design serves as both a residence and a workspace, making it practical for modern living. Through careful selection of materials and thoughtful energy use, G.ao House addresses the realities of the climate crisis. Its approach highlights how smart, sustainable choices can be integrated into everyday spaces, setting an example for future projects that aim to balance comfort, functionality, and environmental responsibility in a compact urban setting. Designer: 85 Design G.ao House uses a prefabricated steel frame, chosen for its efficient assembly and recyclability. This construction method keeps waste low and allows the building to adapt as needs change over time. By minimizing the building’s footprint, the designers created more space for gardens, improving airflow and letting in natural light. The integration of a rooftop solar array supplies the house with over 11,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy each year. Smart management systems further optimize how energy is used and stored, making the setup both practical and efficient. This approach ensures the home remains flexible, sustainable, and comfortable, reflecting a thoughtful balance between modern living and environmental care. 85 Design arranged the G.ao House to connect indoor and outdoor spaces across two main floors and an attic. The front garden features water elements and reclaimed stone, referencing the site’s original construction and adding unique texture while minimizing waste. On the ground floor, a relaxed dining bar welcomes the office community, while the upper floors combine private and shared areas with flexible layouts. The design includes a double-height void, a balcony with a cascading waterfall, and a glass fish tank, all of which enhance the sensory experience throughout the home. These thoughtful details help create a dynamic environment that feels open, inviting, and closely tied to its natural surroundings. G.ao House extends its eco-friendly approach with a green wall that runs from the ground to the roof, helping to improve air quality and regulate indoor temperatures year-round. The attic offers wide views and features adjustable roof elements to respond to changing weather. On the roof, solar panels and systems for cooling and water storage are neatly integrated, supporting the home’s efficient, low-impact design. This house is designed to do more than provide shelter. Its energy and water systems cut fossil fuel use by up to 80 percent and prevent over 8.5 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. Over time, these savings are similar to planting thousands of trees, making the house a meaningful part of a broader environmental effort.",
