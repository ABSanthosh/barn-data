  "text": "SICIS TRANSFORMS POOL WITH ILLUMINATED VETRITE SURFACESICIS steps up the game in aquatic architecture with a transformative take on swimming pool design, turning decorative glass into a glowing, underwater surface. At the private residence known as Olympic Villa in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the Italian brand showcases the potential of its signature glass panel system, Vetrite, applied in a fully submerged, illuminated installation. Unlike traditional pools that reflect their environment, this one emits a luminous glow from beneath the surface. Made possible by the patented Neptune system, the project merges SICIS’ technical expertise with a purpose-built lighting solution engineered specifically for underwater use. Vetrite panels from the Gem Glass collection create a mineral-inspired pattern that lights up the water both day and night, enhancing the pool’s presence as an immersive and ever-changing visual centerpiece.swimming pool at Olympic Villa glows with SICIS’ Vetrite decorative glass panels | all images courtesy of SICISFROM MOSAIC TO UNDERWATER INNOVATION WITH DECORATIVE GLASSFor centuries, decorative glass was largely considered too delicate for the demanding conditions of aquatic environments. Integrating it safely and effectively below water required technical reinvention. That’s where SICIS comes in. Known for its roots in fine mosaic craftsmanship, the Italian brand has continuously expanded its material research to develop surfaces that balance artistic impact with structural resilience.Based in Ravenna — the historic heart of Italian mosaic — SICIS draws on traditions of manual skill and visual storytelling to inform its contemporary production methods. What began as a vision to modernize the mosaic has evolved into a full-spectrum interior design brand, encompassing furniture, lighting, textiles, and architectural surfaces.Vetrite surfaces from the Gem Glass collection bring depth and luminosity to the waterBACKLIT TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED FOR AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTSVetrite, the material at the heart of the Olympic Villa project, is a large-format decorative surface made by fusing glass with polymer films. Its unique composition lends visual depth and a gem-inspired translucency, while maintaining the durability required for challenging environments, including underwater applications.For this particular installation, 120×120 cm slabs from the Vetrite Gem Glass collection were cut and arranged in a bookmatch layout, ensuring that the mineral-inspired pattern repeats symmetrically across the pool’s surface. The result is a continuous, flowing aesthetic that echoes natural crystal formations — organic yet meticulously controlled.SICIS’ patented Neptune system enables fully submerged lighting beneath decorative glassBringing this vision to life beneath the surface is Neptune, SICIS’ patented system engineered for submerged backlighting. It uses a very low voltage power supply, ensuring total safety even in direct contact with water. A specialized matrix evenly distributes light, accentuating the visual complexity of the material while withstanding water pressure, humidity, and temperature changes.The effect is a pool that emits a stable, ambient glow — visible even during the day and dramatically intensified at night. When illuminated, the Vetrite surface comes alive, shimmering with aquatic tones and revealing intricate layers of light and texture. During daylight hours, it reflects its surroundings with subtlety and elegance.",
