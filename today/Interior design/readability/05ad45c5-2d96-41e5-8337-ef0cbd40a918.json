  "description": "This Leo chair is by Teo Primo Frizzarin, an Industrial Design student at ECAL. It aims to consider the ergonomics of those working on a canvas rather than a desk. \"For painters, working on a vertical surface rather than horizontal one creates physical problems, mainly related to not having adequate arm support. Leo is a chair developed for canvas painters.\" \"Its seat, inspired by a horse's saddle allows a stable posture while guaranteeing great mobility in space.\" \"Its adjustable armrest provides support that adapts easily to different positions and heights.\" The Leo was Frizzarin's diploma project, and won a \"Très Bien\" mention.",
