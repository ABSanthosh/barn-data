  "text": "Modders take it upon themselves to make inventive transitions to the existing ideas, giving them a new lease of life and possible direction that manufacturers themselves may not have crossed. A case in point is the new BBook AI Original Edition: a portable laptop-style gaming device featuring the internals of a PlayStation 5. The modded Sony game console in the new portable body comes attached to a 17.3-inch 4K display, and weighs close to 5kg dead weight. Almost twice as heavy as the original console, a first look at the BBook AI reminds me of the gaming laptop I owned back in 2008. It is a visually intriguing creation nonetheless, for it has made it possible to play your favorite game like Astro Bot even when you do not have the convenience of an external screen to plug your PS5 into. Designer: UFDTech The brainchild of Chinese modders, the battery-less laptop-style BBook AI Original Edition is in itself a fully functional PlayStation 5 that you can use on the go, or perhaps setup traditionally with an external screen at home. Powered by an eight-core AMD CPU, and a 36 Compute Unit AMD RDNA 2 GPU, features 16GB of GDDR 6 unified memory, 825GB of PCIe 4.0 storage, and an attached 17.3-inch 3840×2160 IPS display with 100% DCI-P3 coverage and a meagre 60Hz refresh rate. All this resides within the 3D-printed body of the BBook AI Original Edition. From how it appears in the pictures, the BBook AI will have its own keyboard and a USB Type-A 10 Gbps port for connectivity. As previously mentioned, this laptop-like PS5 can connect to an external display, if needed. It comes with an HDMI 2.1 port on the side for that. If you want to do that, then there is essentially no convenience of the BBook AI. The idea of portable gameplay is compromised, and if ought to do that, you might as well invest in the original PlayStation 5. That said, convenience is also compromised by the fact that the BBook AI Original Edition does not have a built-in battery. So, when you have to play a game on it, you would have to rely on AC power to run it. If you don’t mind the idea of a PlayStation 5 in a laptop form factor, measuring 13.3mm thick, and weighing 5kg with its adaptor; you are in for a pretty loud – its sound system capable of reaching 71.3 dB – 3D printed gaming laptop you can get your hands on for $2,750.",
