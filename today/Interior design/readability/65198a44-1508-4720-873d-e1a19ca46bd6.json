This significant improvement in file compression saves valuable storage space and streamlines the post-production workflow for content creators. Image: DJI Air 3S camera: 24mm The dual-camera system is further enhanced by intelligent features like Subject Focusing, which keeps the subject in sharp focus even during manual flight or when the subject moves off-center. This allows pilots to concentrate on creative aspects of shot composition and camera movement without worrying about losing focus on their subject. Additionally, the Air 3S features ActiveTrack 360°, which automatically plans flight paths based on the surrounding environment to ensure dynamic shots that keep the subject in the frame, even when partially obscured by obstacles like bushes or bridges. Overall, the DJI Air 3S’s advanced dual-camera system represents a significant leap forward in aerial imaging technology. It offers professional-grade image quality, versatile focal lengths, and intelligent features catering to amateur enthusiasts and professional photographers. Enhanced Safety Features The DJI Air 3S introduces innovative safety features that set a new standard for drone operation, especially in challenging low-light conditions. At the forefront of these advancements is the integration of forward-facing LiDAR technology, making the Air 3S the first DJI drone to incorporate this sophisticated sensing capability. This LiDAR system works with downward infrared time-of-flight (ToF) sensors and six vision sensors positioned at the drone’s front, rear, and bottom to achieve comprehensive nightscape omnidirectional obstacle sensing. Image: DJI This advanced sensor array enables the Air 3S to automatically detect and navigate around obstacles during both flight and return paths, significantly enhancing safety during nighttime photography sessions. The LiDAR technology, in particular, excels in low-light environments where traditional vision-based sensors might struggle, providing pilots with greater confidence when operating in dim conditions or urban areas with complex structures. The Air 3S also features an improved Smart Return-to-Home (RTH) function. This next-generation RTH system utilizes the drone’s enhanced sensing capabilities to plot safer and more efficient return paths. When adequate lighting is available, the drone employs real-time vision positioning and map construction technologies to memorize its flight path. This feature ensures a safe return even when taking off from locations without a strong satellite signal, such as indoor environments or areas with heavy tree cover. Image: DJI Another notable safety enhancement is the Air 3S’s ability to maintain stable flight in winds up to 12 m/s (approximately 26.8 mph). This wind resistance, combined with the drone’s advanced obstacle avoidance systems, allows for safer operation in various weather conditions, expanding the range of environments and scenarios in which pilots can confidently fly. The Charging Hub with Power Accumulation also allows users to effectively consolidate power across batteries, which is helpful for longer sessions. The drone’s safety features are further complemented by its extended flight time of up to 45 minutes. This longer operational window reduces the pressure on pilots to rush shots or compromise safety to capture footage before the battery depletes. It also provides ample time for careful navigation and thorough environment assessment, especially in unfamiliar or complex shooting locations. DJI has also implemented a Data Protection feature in the Air 3S. The Local Data Mode acts like an “airplane mode,” completely disconnecting the drone from the internet and ensuring that all data remains solely within the device. This feature addresses privacy concerns and provides an additional layer of security for sensitive operations or when flying in restricted areas. Additionally, the 42-GB built-in storage and Off-State QuickTransfer provide seamless file transfers without needing external storage or keeping the drone powered on. These comprehensive safety enhancements make the DJI Air 3S a powerful tool for capturing stunning aerial imagery and a more reliable and secure platform for amateur and professional drone pilots. By prioritizing obstacle avoidance, stable flight, and data protection, DJI has created a drone that allows users to focus on their creative vision while minimizing operational risks.

In contrast, the Mavic 3 Pro boasts a triple-camera system with a 4/3 CMOS Hasselblad main camera (20MP), a 1/1.3-inch CMOS medium tele camera (48MP), and a 1/2-inch CMOS telephoto camera (12MP). While the Air 3S lacks the long-range telephoto of the Mavic 3 Pro, its primary camera offers higher resolution and potentially better low-light performance due to its larger sensor size.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImage Quality and Video Capabilities: Both drones support 10-bit video recording. However, the Air 3S has improved its ISO performance, with a maximum ISO of 12,800 in Night Mode and 3,200 in D-Log M and HLG color modes. The Mavic 3 Pro’s main camera can shoot at a higher resolution of 5.1K/50fps, while the Air 3S tops out at 4K/60fps.
