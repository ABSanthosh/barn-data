Prior to working at ATM, I earned my degree in Culture Writing and Criticism from NYU, and I interned at publications like CNN Underscored, TV Insider, Texas Monthly (I'm a Dallas native), and more. When I'm not writing, I'm usually at the movies or browsing in a thrift store.published yesterdayWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.I’m all about making my apartment smell good. When my friends walk through the door, I want the first thing that they notice to be the scent — even ahead of my decor. As you might’ve already guessed, lighting candles has become an essential part of my evening ritual, but as much as I love them I have to admit that they can be a bit high-maintenance. On top of making sure it burns evenly, you can’t really leave a candle unattended due to the flame. And as much as I wish I could, I can’t leave a candle burning every minute of every day: Replacing them is pricey, especially considering my favorites are over $30.It might surprise you that I only bought my first fragrance diffuser in the past year. I truly don’t know why it took me so long! They’re certainly more subtle than candles — which you might even prefer if you have a sensitive nose — but they still help tremendously in maintaining a space’s freshness. For Christmas, I received a diffuser unlike any other that I’ve tried (or seen) before. In fact, it doesn’t look like your typical reed diffuser at all: It looks like a real flower in a vase!What Is the Bridgewater Candle Flower Reed Diffuser?Bridgewater’s double-duty diffuser will be your most fun piece of decor. Filled with the brand’s “Sweet Grace” scent — passionfruit and apricot are paired with notes of tea, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, and patchouli — it smells just as sweet as it looks. After opening the textured milk glass vase, all you have to do is insert the attached “stem” of the flower into the liquid, and the oils will travel up the wick and into the petals.Over a period of 60 days as it diffuses the scent, the flower turns from white to pink, with the petals expanding and “blooming” at the same time. Once the flower loses its color again, that signals that it’s time to replace it. You can even get one more use out of it when you buy the Sweet Grace refill.Why I Love the Bridgewater Candle Flower Reed DiffuserIf I didn’t know otherwise, I would think that this diffuser was a real flower. The petals have such a realistic texture and translucence to them, and it has only looked better over the past month as it’s “bloomed” — but, of course and unlike a real flower, it won’t die and the petals won’t fall off! It’s been so cool to watch the color change. The white disappeared fairly quickly; it took only a couple of days to become fully pink.Its size is on the smaller side, but that’s part of what makes it ideal for my tiny studio. It takes up hardly any space at all on my side table, so you could fit it next to a lamp and other decor. Its compactness also makes it a great fit for a nightstand or even a bathroom counter, where I’m sure it would do wonders in keeping the air free of that mildewy smell that sometimes overtakes the space no matter what you do. The bright scent is understated — it naturally becomes slightly stronger the closer you get to it. You could say that this gem has firmly made me a diffuser fan. I used to shy away from them in favor of candles because I didn’t really like the look of the reeds, and honestly, I was never truly sure that it was working. This find solves both problems: It gives me a low-maintenance floral accent piece, and I can actually see it working as it changes color. Plus, its appearance leaves no question as to when it’s time to replace it! If you’re after a flame-free home fragrance that doesn’t detract from your stylish decor, I can’t recommend Bridgewater’s diffuser enough. Apartment Therapy's Home RunsGet full reviews of editor-favorite finds sent twice a week to your inbox.",
