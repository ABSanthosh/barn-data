  "text": "The Trump Organization and DarGlobal have announced plans for the Trump International Hotel \u0026 Tower in Dubai. The skyscraper will reach 350 meters (1,148 feet), making it one of the tallest buildings in the city. It will feature the world’s highest outdoor swimming pool. The tower’s design is simple and slender, with a notable void at the top similar to the Shanghai World Financial Center. This project focuses on luxury real estate and marks a new partnership between the Trump Organization and DarGlobal, without involving peace treaties or trade deals in the Middle East. Designer: The Trump Organization \u0026 DarGlobal The Trump International Hotel \u0026 Tower in Dubai will have 80 floors dedicated to residential and hotel use. Suites are designed with inspiration from the Trump Tower Penthouse in New York, but with a more subdued color scheme. Floor-to-ceiling windows will provide views of the Dubai skyline, including the Burj Khalifa. Amenities will include the world’s highest outdoor swimming pool and a private club. The building aims to offer luxury living and hospitality, focusing on modern design and comfort. This project is part of a collaboration between the Trump Organization and DarGlobal in Dubai’s real estate sector. “Trump International Hotel \u0026 Tower, Dubai is a project that reflects our unwavering commitment to excellence, luxury and innovation,” said Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization (which the US President maintains ownership of). “We are honored to partner once again with DarGlobal on this landmark development, bringing unparalleled quality and world-class amenities to Dubai’s luxury market. Dubai is a global destination that shares our vision for iconic development, and we’re proud to expand the Trump brand in one of the most dynamic cities on earth.” There is currently no confirmed start date for construction or information about the architect for the Trump International Hotel \u0026 Tower, Dubai. However, the project is expected to be completed by December 2031. In addition to this development in Dubai, the Trump Organization has expanded its partnership with DarGlobal to Qatar. Together, they have announced the creation of the Trump International Golf Club, Doha. While images have not yet been released, the project will include an 18-hole golf course named after the former U.S. president, as well as luxury branded villas. The golf club and residences will be situated south of Doha, the capital of Qatar, furthering the Trump Organization’s regional real estate presence. These projects signal an ongoing expansion of the Trump Organization’s brand in the Middle East, focusing on high-end real estate and hospitality. With ambitious developments in both Dubai and Doha, the company continues to target luxury markets and iconic locations. While many details are still forthcoming, these ventures highlight the Trump Organization’s strategy of partnering with regional developers to create prominent, branded properties. As the projects progress, they are set to contribute to the evolving skylines and leisure offerings of both cities, further cementing the Trump name in the global real estate landscape.",
