For me, growing up in the 80s meant falling under its spell at age 13, back when quarters vanished fast as I honed my reflexes and memorized combos. Iconic Arcade, with backing from Medion AG—a Lenovo company recognized for its strengths in gaming and computing—is inviting fans to relive those glory days by launching the Street Fighter XXL Arcade Machine at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. Designer: Iconic Arcade This 9/10 scale stand-up cabinet captures the vibe of a classic arcade unit without dominating your rec room. Pre-orders are live at major retailers for $699, and deliveries are slated to begin in Q2 2025. Two distinct variants, the Street Fighter II The World Warrior XXL Arcade Machine and the Street Fighter Alpha 2 XXL Arcade Machine, honor the 90s arcade craze with updated features for an era that thrives on online connectivity. The release also features a collaboration of several entities, including Eldohm, Media1UP, and Arcade PR, all working closely to blend classic gaming with modern technology. Iconic Arcade focuses on authenticity and performance, which is why the Street Fighter XXL Arcade Machine is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 sporting a 2.4 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A76 processor. The cabinet stands about five feet seven inches tall, weighs around 90 pounds, and measures 67 by 23 by 28. The 19-inch BOE monitor delivers vivid colors and crisp animations across 14 official Capcom titles, including Street Fighter II The World Warrior, Street Fighter II Champion Edition, Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting, Hyper Street Fighter II The Anniversary Edition, Street Fighter Zero, Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, Street Fighter Zero 3, Street Fighter III 3rd Strike Fight for the Future, Giga Wing 2, Final Fight, Knights of the Round, Progear Storm of Progia, and 1944 The Loop Master. Real arcade-feel controls use Happ-style joysticks and Sanwa-style buttons, so fireballs and spin kicks are intuitive whether you’re a returning pro or a fresh recruit. Online multiplayer and leaderboards bring a dose of community rivalry, letting you face off against friends or take on complete strangers who appreciate Capcom classics. The cabinet is equipped with HDMI Out, making it simple to record matches or stream them live for an audience, which is perfect for content creators and esports enthusiasts. A lit marquee and glowing faux coin door provide the nostalgia factor, and an adjustable volume control and headphone jack cater to nights when you want to keep the noise down. Assembly is straightforward, and you can set it up in the afternoon. Design Elements The two distinct designs—the Street Fighter II: The World Warrior and Street Fighter Alpha 2 cabinets—each bring their own flair, rooted in nostalgia while making bold visual statements. The World Warrior edition sports a gritty black-and-yellow theme that perfectly encapsulates the hard-hitting vibe of the original arcade. Its side panel features Ryu in a dynamic fighting stance, with bold yellow text slashing across the cabinet’s side. This textured design reflects the rugged and competitive spirit of the era, with details like the Capcom USA logo adding a nod to its heritage. The Alpha 2 edition takes a different approach, opting for a sleek blue gradient backdrop with key characters from the Alpha series depicted in striking artwork. The gradient blends seamlessly with vibrant colors, offering a more modernized but equally nostalgic aesthetic. The side panels feature intricate art of Ryu and Akuma facing off, bringing the Alpha series’ storyline and rivalries to life. This cabinet’s smoother design cues cater to those who appreciate a refined touch, while still evoking arcade memories. Both cabinets share rad physical features, including a glowing faux coin door that recreates the feel of old-school arcades and an illuminated marquee that grabs attention in any room. The control decks are designed with a metallic diamond plate finish, giving a tactile and industrial feel that’s reminiscent of classic arcade builds. These details totally amp up the look but also reinforce the durability and authenticity of the experience. Whether you’re drawn to the grit of the World Warrior edition or the polish of the Alpha 2 cabinet, each design tells its own story while staying true to the spirit of Street Fighter. Medion AG’s role as the driving force behind Iconic Arcade adds an extra layer of credibility for anyone familiar with its track record in consumer tech. The German manufacturer has been part of Lenovo’s global family since 2011, and it’s using that expertise to reimagine home arcade systems that balance iconic styling with modern-day performance. The brand also plans to unveil additional licenses and classic titles over the year, backed by partnerships with other leading publishers and franchises. When Q2 2025 rolls around, the cabinet should be ready to unleash old-school rivalries in living rooms everywhere, standing as a retro centerpiece that merges the electricity of 90s arcades with the advantages of contemporary technology.",
