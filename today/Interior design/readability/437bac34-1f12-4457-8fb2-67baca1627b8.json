  "description": "French startup Metacar Mobility Systems has developed a compact EV called Kiwee. Intended as a car sharing service in urban centers, their strange micro-vehicle can link to its brethren, front and back, creating a sort of ESG centipede. These would be stored outside of train stations, like bikeshare stations. As they sit in their station, they charge.The idea behind the linking ability, said to be inspired by shopping carts, is two-fold. One is to minimize the footprint of the vehicles when parked. The other is that, when the vehicles need to be redistributed, a single driver can tow as many units as needed.That linking ability, at least for purposes of redistribution, would swiftly become obsolete if autonomous driving becomes the norm. However, it is interesting to think of how it could have power-sharing or perhaps even safety implications.MMS is currently seeking funding.",
