Today we’re sharing our advice on how you can make the room transition seamless, with some clever pieces of furniture from Koala that both you and your little one will love.",

But furniture is one of those things that can (and should!) be used for years on end, if you pick the right pieces. And it all starts with the collection you buy when the time comes to turn the baby’s room into a proper kid’s bedroom. Here are our top tips on how to style the perfect retreat that your kid will love today, and well into the future. 1. It’s all about the bed Now that your little one is growing up, perhaps the biggest change is upgrading from a cot to a more grown-up bed! The Joey Bed Base from Koala features adjustable height legs, to help make the transition a bit less daunting for your little one. The timeless timber base is designed to evolve as your kid grows up, starting on the low legs to be closer to the ground, before eventually graduating to the full height bed. There are also handy optional guard rails you can add to keep wriggly toddlers at bay. 2. Maximise storage You can never have enough storage in kid’s spaces. In our room transformation, we’ve added Koala’s Balmain Bookshelf to display those cherished books, toys, and sentimental objects. Made from warm, solid ash timber, it’s a piece that will last well into their teen years. We also added a mix of boxes and rattan baskets to store clutter out of view, making it super easy to tidy up after playtime. 3. Inject personality One of the most fun parts about re-styling this room is that it’s an opportunity to inject some of their unique personality into the space. Start with finding the right colour: in our example, the gender-neutral backdrop of mint green is refreshed with neutral tones of brown, oatmeal and more playful pops of red and blue. And rather than repainting the room in your kid’s favourite colour (which they’ll inevitably change their mind about) perhaps invite them to help you choose or create some art to personalise the space. We also added a cork board, which is a great way for them to display drawings, posters, or photos, that can be changed up frequently. 4. Create a quiet zone In addition to being a place for playing and sleeping, every kid’s bedroom should have a dedicated ‘chill out’ zone. Something like the Suffolk Armchair from Koala is another comfy option, and the washable covers mean you don’t have to panic about any stains or marks ruining the plush fabric. On the day bed above, we used an abundance of cushions in various patterns to create an inviting reading corner, made extra cosy with Koala’s Lazy Sunday Throw blanket. It’s now perfect spot where they can have some quiet time after a busy day — something we all need, no matter how old you are!
