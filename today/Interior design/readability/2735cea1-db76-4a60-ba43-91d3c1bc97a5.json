Winning an iF Gold award, globally recognized for celebrating the best in design excellence, marks a significant achievement for the company, which has continuously reshaped the world of watercraft with their foldable designs. As part of designboom’s studio visit interview series with iF DESIGN, the trip to Oru Kayak’s studio in Emeryville, California, offered insights into their award-winning design and an opportunity to interview Forrest Harvey, Director of Product Design, about their design philosophy and principles.‘The founding statement of Oru Kayak is to transform how people connect to the outdoors. That mission drives all of our work and products,’ begins Forrest Harvey, Director of Product Design at Oru Kayak. ‘The idea for the company began when our founder, living in a small apartment with no space for a kayak, was inspired by an article about origami—and the rest is history.’Apply for the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025 by November 6th, 2024 – here.designboom visited Oru Kayak’s workspace in Emeryville, California, as part of a studio visit series with iF DESIGN AWARD 2024 winners | images © designboomSTORY BEHIND ORIGAMI-INSPIRED KAYAKSOru Kayak’s design philosophy emphasizes simplicity, portability, and the joy of exploration. Since its founding in 2012, the brand has continually reimagined what a kayak can be, drawing inspiration from origami—a paper-folding practice that perfectly marries art and functionality. Their studio is a hub of creative energy, where engineers and designers collaborate to refine and reimagine each product. Prototypes are made, tested, and adjusted in a tireless pursuit of perfection. This commitment to continuous improvement has propelled Oru Kayak to the forefront of the industry, leading to creations like the Lake model—currently the world’s lightest and most compact rigid kayak—as well as new ventures like camp furniture.‘We’ve been making kayaks since 2012, offering models that range from ultra-recreational to ocean-going closed cockpit kayaks. In 2023, we began expanding into adjacent categories, like camp furniture with our Oru campline, which  includes lounge chairs, side tables, and convertible picnic tables with integrated storage. We applied the same design principles and materials from our kayaks to these new product lines,’ says Harvey.founded in 2012, the brand’s story began by reimaging a kayak using origami – a paper-folding practice‘LAKE’S STANDOUT FEATURE IS THAT IT ONLY HAS ONE LOOSE COMPONENT’The Lake model, winner of iF DESIGN AWARD 2024, embodies Oru Kayak’s design philosophy in its purest form. Its minimalist approach eliminates unnecessary components, leaving only what’s essential for a seamless kayaking experience. As the lightest and most portable rigid kayak on the market, it features just one loose component—making it simpler to use than their other models like the Bay, Coast, or Haven. This design caters to both experienced paddlers and beginners, turning kayaking into an accessible adventure. ‘The standout feature of the Lake is that it only has one loose component. Our other kayaks have bulkheads, floorboards, loose seats, and many straps, designed for more rigorous settings like ocean use,’ comments the Director of Product Design. ‘With the Lake, we integrated everything possible, so users don’t have to assemble multiple parts. It’s essentially just the kayak hull and the floorboard with the seat, and you’re ready to go.’the company has continuously shapeshifted the form of foldable watercraft, producing many different types of kayaks including the iF DESIGN AWARD-winning LakeOru Kayak’s commitment to innovation was internationally recognized when the Lake won Gold in the iF DESIGN AWARD 2024 – the highest honor in one of the world’s most respected design competitions. This achievement solidifies the company’s standing in the design community, particularly for creating accessible, high-performance products that address common barriers to kayak ownership, such as weight, storage, and transport. ‘When you spend so much time tweaking and refining a product, it’s always interesting to see how it’s received by a jury of your peers. Winning the iF Gold Award validates the time and effort we put in and shows that our product resonates with people—even those unfamiliar with our brand,’ explains Forrest. ‘Entering award competitions challenges us in ways we might not consider during product development and provides valuable feedback from fresh perspectives.’the Lake embodies the studio’s minimalist philosophy in its purest formThanks to owning its manufacturing facility, Oru Kayak has the ability to quickly adapt and refine its products, allowing the company to meet evolving customer needs. By addressing the entry-level market with the Lake, Oru Kayak has made kayaking more accessible to new users previously deterred by the high price points of earlier models. This approach keeps the brand relevant to both enthusiasts and newcomers, and nimble enough to diversify into other outdoor product lines like camp furniture.‘The Lake kayak was a big opportunity for us to reach the entry-level market. As a premium brand, we realized that new paddlers who didn’t want to spend much, struggled to connect with us. The Lake helped bridge that gap. Having our own manufacturing facility also lets us innovate quickly, adjusting designs based on customer feedback and continuous testing,’ concludes Forrest Harvey, Oru Kayak’s Director of Product Design.Apply for the iF DESIGN AWARD 2025 by November 6th, 2024 – here.engineers and designers work closely in the studio to refine and reimagine each productthe kayaks’ origami-style construction allows users to transport, assemble, reassemble, and store with ease",
