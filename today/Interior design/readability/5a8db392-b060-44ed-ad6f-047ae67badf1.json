Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here A place for everything and everything in its place is my mission for this year, but the truth is I really got inspired for it last year with a few simple projects that I haven’t shared on the blog yet! I started getting these cabinets organized last fall as a part of a fun cozy home challenge HomeBodies did in HomeBody Gathering Place. In our renovation we had cabinetry designated in our dining area for our coffee making area and our Berkey Water filter. While we don’t have a fancy coffee station or water filtration system, what we have works great for us so I wanted to make it as functional and organized as I could. I put up this adorable peel and stick wallpaper on the back of the cabinet, just for fun — it makes the whole experience of preparing coffee more charming. It was so simple to do! Before I explain the organization, here is a list of some cabinet and organizing supplies I used: This cabinet organizer shelf This wood lazy Susan This plastic tray under the coffee gadgets Milk frother/steamer (love this one, it’s stainless steel instead of toxic nonstick coating!) These blue and white buffalo check lidded canisters Coffee grinder Botanical coffee mugs Blue and white geometric pattern coffee mug Click here for above sources This whole organization project took me less than 30 minutes to make the additions and improvements, so I wish I had done this ages ago! But I’m glad I finally did it. Now that this cabinet is extra cute, I am inspired to keep the cabinet more organized, too! Organizing the Coffee Cabinet (a place for everything!) I decided we should use the two upper shelves only for serving platters. I have no other cabinet for them so this made sense! Our shelves are adjustable so I can rearrange later if desired. To make better use of the rest of the cabinet space, without making it feeling too cluttered, I added some tiered accessory shelves to elevate some of the mugs and organize supplies. Cabinet organizer shelf // Botanical coffee mugs // Similar Homebody Mug (my mug is from here) This cabinet now holds only the mugs we’ll be using often this season (this is key, we cannot keep EVERY mug in this cabinet!) We put the mugs on the Lazy Susan and a few others that will sit next to it on the tiered shelves. No more cluttered cabinet! Our extra mugs are stored in the cabinet below. I also got a set of cute checkered canisters to hold coffee beans and spoons. We keep this tray under our coffee grinder and the milk steamer/frother to make it easier to clean up the cabinet from the inevitable messes made while grinding coffee and steaming milk. We still use this stovetop espresso brewer (someday we’ll get a fancier machine, but we’ve used this for years and it is so simple and makes good coffee)!. Organizing Our Berkey Water Filter Cabinet We used to have the Berkey sitting on a bench in our mudroom, but this was always my intended spot for it. It’s safe from little hands and puppies and so convenient for grown people to use. The drawer underneath the Berkey pulls out so we can easily fill it and we put a tray and mat under it to catch any drips or overflow. We put our Berkey on this stand so we can easily get a glass under it to fill. Works great! Someday we may get a whole house filter (or a new one at the kitchen sink like we had in the past) but we’re perfectly happy with this arrangement. The cabinet shelves above and below the Berkey hold our pretty blue and green drinking glasses, electric hot water kettles (I have this copper and this blue kettle) and other handy items. A Place for Everything Even though it’s always been nice to have all of these cabinets to store stuff, having a place for everything and everything in its place means that now I really enjoy using these spaces as they are intended (and enjoy keeping them organized!) every day. Small Space Tip The doors on the coffee cabinet slide back in so they don’t stick out into the room — this is a handy small space hack if you are getting new cabinets :). Now that it’s so cute I can even leave the coffee station open whenever I want to! Our home may not be huge, but I wanted to make every space count. I pictured a cozy, comfortable, orderly place right here in the dining room where family and friends could gather around and chat while making coffee or tea. I’m happy to have created a pleasant experience for everyone!
