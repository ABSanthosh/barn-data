  "description": "Retro architecture fans rejoice: this modernist house in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs has just hit the market. Designed by local architect Theodore Berman, the Kew residence was built in the late 1950s, but was thoughtfully renovated when it last changed hands about 10 years ago. The family home has luckily retained plenty of its vintage charms, with unique stonework, panoramic windows, and a terrazzo-lined entry. Step inside!",

  "text": "The Kew home at 25 Studley Park Road has only been home to a handful of lucky people since it was built in the late 1950s. Known as the Krongold House, the three-bedroom abode was built by the Krongold family (who today run a building company of the same name) and designed by notable architect Theodore Berman. It reportedly remained in the family for more than four decades, which is perhaps why it’s still in such good condition today. The current owners however were actually on the hunt for an Edwardian when the property came up for sale about 12 years ago. ‘We were converts the minute we stepped inside,’ the vendor says. The quintessentially modernist design won them over straight away. With stone piers supporting the carport and a tranquil courtyard garden, the front of the house is decidedly retro, enhanced by the panoramic timber-framed windows. ‘We love the extent of light that enters the home and that the living and dining spaces are connected,’ the owner adds. ‘The true heart of the home is the connection with the gardens at the front and sides, and the fine details and quality of finishings throughout the home.’ The interiors have plenty of character too. Timeless hardwood floors, timber joinery and the terrazzo-lined entry are now paired with a modern kitchen, after a sympathetic renovation by the owners. They worked with architect Richard Swansson to bring the kitchen and bathroom up to ‘contemporary standards’, carefully incorporating mid-century flair with the timber joinery and decorative details. At the rear, the house opens up to a large backyard and patio, where the owners have enjoyed entertaining friends and family over the years. ‘It has been a tremendous and happy place for us to raise our two children,’ they say. 25 Studley Park Road, Kew, VIC is on the market with Geordie Dixon from Jellis Craig Boroondara and will go to auction on 2pm Saturday November 9.",
