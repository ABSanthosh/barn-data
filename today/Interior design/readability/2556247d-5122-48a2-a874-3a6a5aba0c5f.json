  "text": "Anyone who knows their pop culture trivia knows that the longest-running American series still currently on the air right now is The Simpsons. It’s already a cultural institution that has birthed numerous memes, insider jokes, and even predictions that have come true (unfortunately). So it’s no surprise that another pop culture institution, LEGO, has once again partnered with the show to bring a build worthy of the biggest fans of Springfield’s residents. It’s been a full decade since LEGO last transported us to the quirky town of Springfield with a dedicated building set, making the announcement of The Simpsons: Krusty Burger (10352) a moment of pure, unadulterated excitement for fans. This isn’t just another LEGO set; it’s a nostalgic dive into the heart of Springfield’s fast-food scene, a 1,635-piece love letter to the “unhealthiest restaurant in the world” that has provided countless laughs and memorable moments over the show’s incredible run. From questionable menu items to the ever-present threat of Sideshow Bob, Krusty Burger has been the backdrop for some of the most iconic scenes in Simpsons history, and this set even meticulously recreates the drive-thru window where so many chaotic and hilarious encounters have unfolded. This new offering promises to be a substantial and detailed build, giving fans a chance to own a brick-built version of this beloved, albeit slightly unsanitary, establishment. Designer: LEGO The LEGO set is a fully enclosed building but you can remove the roof panels and the side walls to see all the details inside, including the kitchen, dining area, restroom, and even the not-safe-for-kids “Krusty’s Kidz Zone” ball pit. The pieces are that detailed that you can see tiled floors, fryers, condiment stations, and other details that you can recognize if you’re a long time watcher of the Simpsons. Of course no LEGO set is complete without the minifigures and so you get iconic Simpsons residents like Homer, Bart, Lisa, Sideshow Bob, Officer Lou, and of course, Krusty the Clown himself dressed as “Homie the Clown” from a Season 6 episode. If this is not enough for you, you will get a 123-piece Simpsons Living Room diorama as a gift when you purchase this on its initial release. This 1,635-piece Krusty Burger set is a fantastic tribute to The Simpsons, packed with enough greasy goodness and Springfield charm to satisfy even the hungriest fan. With its clever design and iconic minifigures, it’s a build that will surely bring a smile to the face of anyone who’s ever craved a Krusty-brand Seal of Approval. Don’t forget to snag that bonus Living Room diorama during the initial release – it’s the perfect place for your minifigure Homer to enjoy his hard-earned burger!",
