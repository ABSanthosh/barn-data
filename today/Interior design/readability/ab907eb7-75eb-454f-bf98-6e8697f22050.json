Happy 1st day of FALL!!! Yippeeee! It is still hot here, but I am enjoying the parts of the season I can until the autumn chill sings through the air. Like buying a pumpkin for the front steps of the house, lighting candles at night and making the house have a cozy vibe. I will have to wait a few more weeks, but am looking forward to being able to wear cozy tops and pants again and putting my summer clothes away. :-) And speaking of a chill in the air, two weeks ago we noticed our 10 year old Frigidaire refrigerator that came with the house when we bought it wasn’t getting as cold as it should. After programming it multiple times to set the right temp, it kept getting warmer. Hmmm…. then a few nights later in the middle of the night when the temperature sensor alarm woke us from our sleep we noticed that the lights were not going off when the fridge doors were closed as we could see a tiny sliver of light spilling out from a small bottom section between the doors. We found that the heat from the lightbulbs in the fridge staying on made the inside of the fridge very warm. So warm in fact that the inside casing around the light bulbs was melting and dripping. We removed the lightbulbs and within a few hours the fridge temp returned to normal. Time to call a fridge repairman. Appliance guy came and told us it would be cheaper to buy a new fridge as the light sensor was shot and expensive to fix. For now the fridge is cold, but dark. As exciting as it is to get something new, I haven’t bought a refrigerator in a long time. I have been doing some research and was thinking of getting a counter depth model since the one we have is huge for our small kitchen. I could use your help. Does anyone have any fridge recommendations? Since it will be a big purchase I want to make sure I get a good one. Do you have a counter depth refrigerator and like it? How about easy to clean stainless or the glass front models? There are so many choices. I would love to hear your fridge experiences. Thanks in advance.
