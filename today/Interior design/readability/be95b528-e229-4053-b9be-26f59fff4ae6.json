  "text": "The 2025 Archibald Prize finalists have been revealed today, with 57 deserving artists claiming the honors from an impressive 904 entries. Abdul Abdullah has been named the winner of the 2025 Packing Room Prize for his portrait of fellow artist and friend Jason Phu. This year marks Abdul’s seventh time as an Archibald finalist. His portrait, No Mountain High Enough, was selected as the Packing Room Prize winner by the Art Gallery of New South Wales staff who receive, unpack and hang the entries. ‘We were instantly drawn to Abdul Abdullah’s portrait of Jason Phu. Both are accomplished artists whose works have a distinct style and engage with complex social and cultural themes using wit and cartoonish references,’ says Alexis Wildman, senior installation officer and member of the Art Gallery’s Packing Room team. ‘On a technical level, this portrait is very well painted,’ she explains. ‘It really captures the essence of the subject with the image of a lone ranger, an intrepid jokester or a quiet hero navigating the rocky terrain of today’s social climate. This immediately sparked conversation among the Packing Room team.’ Abdul says, ‘It is always an honour to be selected as a finalist for the Archibald Prize, and I am especially honoured to be picked for the Packing Room Prize… Jason is my best friend. We talk on the phone every day, he was the best man at my wedding, and we have travelled together. ‘I’ve painted him as I see him, as a ceaseless adventurer who at any one time is involved in a dozen conversations on a dozen different platforms, bringing his unique perspective to one flummoxed friend or another.’ Other familiar faces among the finalists include Nicole Kidman and her sister Antonia Kidman by three-time finalist, artist Jac Grantford; a self-portrait of former Archibald winner Vincent Namatjira; and acclaimed Australian artist Cressida Campbell by Natasha Bieniek. The winners of the 2025 Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will be announced next Friday May 9 and the winners and all finalists will be exhibited at the Art Gallery of New South Wales from Saturday May 10 to Sunday August 17, 2025.
