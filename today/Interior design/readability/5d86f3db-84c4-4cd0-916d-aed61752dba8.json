Lately, I’ve been finding myself drawn toward the cottagecore aesthetic, that dreamy style filled with soft florals, worn woods, and oh-so-comfy textiles. It’s this enchanting blend of simplicity and warmth that feels like stepping into a storybook or secret garden. So, you can imagine my excitement when I started noticing little pockets of cottagecore popping up at a place that, until a few months ago, wasn’t at the top of my favorites list: World Market! I have to admit, World Market and I have had a bit of an on-and-off relationship in the past. It’s not that I disliked it—I’ve always appreciated their global-inspired décor and eclectic finds. However, life gets busy, and I just wasn’t gravitating toward its aisles like I used to. But in the last few months, I’ve popped into my local World Market a few times on a whim (you know how spontaneous shopping trips go). Let me tell you: It feels as though they’ve turned a corner, full of new and exciting pieces that have truly breathed life back into their selection. It has me happily wandering their aisles, wondering what I’ll stumble upon next!If you’re craving that cozy cottagecore vibe in your home, here are some of the elements and pieces I’ve been spotting at World Market that might give you a little inspiration:Thank you so much for stopping by the blog today! I hope this post gave you a little inspiration to add that cozy cottagecore charm to your own space. I’d love to hear your thoughts and see how you style your finds, so feel free to share! As always, thank you for visiting and supporting my creative journey—stay cozy, friends, and I’ll see you here next time… and be sure to keep up with all of our content daily (HERE)! Xx,Liz Marie",
