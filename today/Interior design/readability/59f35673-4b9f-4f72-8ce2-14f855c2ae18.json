  "text": "Popular culture might have you believe that bigger is better or that material extravagance somehow equates to luxury. But in a world littered with “McMansions,” some projects emerge as testaments to smarter homes and the soul-stirring elegance that emanates from interior enrichments, which encourage life at slower paces. Aria, the contempo-Art Deco dwelling designed by Mumbai-based Studio Nishita Kamdar, offers peace from the din of city dwelling in nearby downtown. Majestic forms and clean lines transform this traditionally “matchbox” structure into one that is aesthetically stimulating with just the right configuration of seemingly voluminous, high-impact spaces and intimate hideaways. The 2,800-square-foot apartment comprises: a central living space that bleeds into the dining area adjacent to a convenient kitchen tucked behind it; a hidden media lounge accessed from the living room and open to a private terrace; the primary bedroom with en suite and dressing room; two additional bedrooms with en suites; and several powder rooms. Though the space planning yields a high return on investment, it is the sensory experience while circulating throughout that is most impressive – providing a few moments worthy of pause and reflection. Aria’s romantic narrative begins before entering the residence where visitors are greeted by a beautifully crafted wooden doorway with distinct geometries carved in relief. Its patterns tease the textures to be discovered beyond the threshold. Within steps from the foyer is an oversized, terracotta-red amorphous sculpture that captures movement in its solid form as it appears to flow into the floor. Upon turning the corner is the dining space demarcated by the African Marble monolith dining table. It is situated under David Groppi’s ‘Moon light’ and surrounded with artworks by Datta Bansode and Subodh Gupta. Within eyesight is a round sitting area with seating that fosters face-to-face communing with those in company. Beyond the central social space, between gold archways, and behind a fluted black wall is the media lounge meant to be a sanctuary for quiet reflection as well as artistic admiration. It boasts the home’s grandest feature – a majestic totem light installation by Klove Studio positioned within an oblong panel displayed in a monumental wall. Hand-painted black and white ceilings invite the eyes to wander upward and into daydreams in stark contrast to the red rug that grounds everything below. Other objects housed alongside these treatments include art by MF Hussain and Sunil Das. Moving through the passageway and into private spaces opposite the more public realm is no less exciting. A commissioned piece depicting a deconstructed Buddhist wheel artwork transforms typical circulation into a dynamic and engaging visual journey. And each space is imbued with personality reflecting every member of the family. Ogle-worthy works present themselves in an eclectic mix of personal expressions at every turn including curated surprises, bespoke artifacts, and whimsical details that elicit joy. And yet the house seamlessly flows from one space to another, maintaining continuity through consistent building materials such as wood flooring and plaster walls. What’s more, all artful interior elements, apart from two or three fixtures, were designed and produced in India. Herein lies the conceptual throughline: the full realization and execution by Indian brands and designers, a commitment shared by Studio Nishita Kamdar and the family to supporting local craftsmanship and creativity. “Is luxury space? Is luxury about expensive belongings? Is luxury costly,” asks the principal of her eponymous studio, Nishita Kamdar. “Or is luxury simply living in a space that allows you to appreciate the finer nuances of life and the little things like art, environment, and moments?” We now have our answer.
