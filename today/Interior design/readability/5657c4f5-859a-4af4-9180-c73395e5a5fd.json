  "text": "As you step into this apartment in Barcelona, designed by Lobo Studio, you will be surrounded by luxuryâ€”the modern classic way. We see a mix of cozy furniture, sleek finishes, and carefully chosen details. The way old meets new in this apartment is aspirationalâ€”and might as well provide inspiration for your next design project! The living room is by far our favorite part of the project. Mismatched furniture adds visual interest to the spaceâ€”especially the zebra-print chairs! A large rug over the wooden floor warms the space up. Next to the wall, a black console table, paired with decor accessories and an organically shaped mirror, makes sure the bare wall is adorned. Behind the living room setting, there is a dining table. There are accent chairs adding a punch of visual interest. The space is delineated with a rug made from natural materials. And, finally, the plush chandelier makes sure thereâ€™s a touch of luxury, too. Behind the dining area is a bright and welcoming kitchen. The neutral color palette keeps the design theme understated. Simultaneously, the wooden flooring factors in warmth. The luxe factor is added by the luxurious marbleâ€”used for the backsplash as well as the island top. This modern classic bedroom creates a subtle design statement in more ways than one. The light beige walls set the base for colorful accents. Read: the navy blue wall moldings and bed. A large piece of artwork using these hues makes sure to tie the color scheme together. We see wooden elementsâ€”such as the bench, flooring, and cabinetryâ€”making the ambiance inviting. On the opposite wall, a striped, asymmetric sofa provides seating space while adding visual intrigue. Recessed shelving provides room for decorative pieces. Finally, the wicker chair adds a traditional element to the modern style. The bathroom in this classique chic apartment is a mix of modern and classic. The clean lines and sleek fixtures keep the ambiance contemporary. Simultaneously, the striped tiles factor in a rustic touch. We especially love the freestanding ceramic tub and vanity adding luxury. And the plants pretty much bring the space to life!",

bedroom creates a subtle design statement in more ways than one. The light beige walls set the base for colorful accents. Read: the navy blue wall moldings and bed. A large piece of artwork using these hues makes sure to tie the color scheme together. We see wooden elementsâ€”such as the bench, flooring, and cabinetryâ€”making the ambiance inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite wall, a striped, asymmetric sofa provides seating space while adding visual intrigue. Recessed shelving provides room for decorative pieces.
