  "text": "A decade after revolutionizing the wearable technology landscape, Eric Migicovsky is challenging the status quo once again. The founder of the original Pebble smartwatch has announced Core Devices, a new venture bringing two timepieces to market that prioritizes what many modern smartwatches have abandoned: exceptional battery life, physical controls, and user-centric design. Designer: Eric Migicovsky The announcement marks a significant moment for wearable technology enthusiasts who have watched the industry gravitate toward increasingly complex, power-hungry devices that require daily charging. Migicovsky’s new creations—the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2—promise an extraordinary 30 days between charges while maintaining the minimalist approach that made Pebble a pioneer in the category. “After Pebble shut down, I never found another smartwatch with the exact same suite of features I wanted,” Migicovsky explained during the announcement. This personal frustration ultimately drove him to create devices that emphasize longevity and practicality over the feature float that characterizes many contemporary wearables. The more accessible Core 2 Duo will launch first, reaching customers in July with a $149 price tag. Its rectangular form houses a 1.26-inch black-and-white e-paper display that remains visible in even the brightest sunlight. The monochrome screen contributes significantly to the device’s remarkable power efficiency, requiring energy only when the display changes. Migicovsky’s team achieved something truly unexpected during development—they located a supplier still possessing unused frames manufactured for the original Pebble 2. “We were able to find a supplier that still had the frames for Pebble Time 2 and Pebble 2,” Migicovsky revealed. “They were never used.” This discovery allowed Core Devices to incorporate authentic Pebble DNA into their new creation, creating a direct lineage to the beloved original. Navigation relies on four physical buttons positioned around the case edges—an intentional design choice that enables interaction without visual attention. “Physical buttons let you control functions while running, swimming, or in meetings without looking at your screen,” Migicovsky noted, highlighting a practical advantage often overlooked in the industry’s rush toward touch-only interfaces. Despite its nostalgic exterior, the Core 2 Duo incorporates thoroughly modern internals. A new linear resonant actuator delivers notifications with more precision and less noise than previous vibration mechanisms. Environmental sensors include a barometer and compass, while IPX8 water resistance ensures swimming poses no threat. The device also introduces a speaker—a first for a Pebble-inspired design—enabling voice interactions and audio feedback. For those seeking more premium materials and expanded capabilities, the Core Time 2, priced at $225, arrives in December. This upscale variant features an aluminum frame rather than polycarbonate, houses a larger 1.5-inch display, and introduces 64-color capability while maintaining the same impressive battery performance. The Core Time 2 introduces a hybrid interaction model that preserves the four-button navigation system while adding selective touchscreen functionality. This touchscreen implementation focuses specifically on allowing users to tap complications on the watch face—small information widgets that can open into full applications. Migicovsky emphasizes this isn’t about creating a “phone on your wrist” but rather enhancing specific interactions that benefit from direct touch. Heart rate monitoring rounds out the Core Time 2’s feature set, providing health insights without compromising the device’s month-long endurance between charges. Both timepieces benefit from Google’s January decision to open-source PebbleOS, which it acquired through its purchase of Fitbit. This software foundation ensures immediate compatibility with the existing ecosystem of over 10,000 Pebble apps and watch faces developed during the platform’s original run. “We’re not messing with a good thing,” Migicovsky stated, emphasizing his commitment to preserving what worked while enhancing what needed improvement. The exceptional battery life—quadrupling the already impressive 7-day performance of the original Pebbles—stems primarily from advancements in Bluetooth technology over the past decade. Modern chips operate with dramatically improved efficiency, maintaining connectivity while drawing significantly less power. The e-paper displays contribute further to this efficiency, requiring energy only during state changes rather than continuously, like OLED screens. “The stress of remembering chargers is always a problem,” Migicovsky explained. “Now you can take the longest vacation you can imagine without bringing your charger.” This fundamental shift in power management transforms how users relate to their devices—from demanding daily attention to becoming a reliable companion that rarely requires maintenance. Core Devices is intentionally limiting production to approximately 10,000 units of each model initially. This measured approach reflects Migicovsky’s commitment to sustainable growth rather than rapid expansion. “I’m intentionally trying to build something sustainable rather than a fast-growing do-or-die company,” he explained, acknowledging lessons learned from Pebble’s earlier trajectory. This limited availability means interested customers should act promptly. Pre-orders opened today exclusively through the Pebble store, with full refunds available for cancellations before shipping. The Core 2 Duo will reach customers in July, while the Core Time 2 will follow in December. Throughout the announcement, Migicovsky emphasized that these watches aren’t designed to compete directly with mainstream offerings from Apple or Garmin. “This is designed for a very specific type of person whose needs aren’t met by the other guys,” he acknowledged. “I’m not sitting here trying to sell millions of these.” For the dedicated community that has kept their aging Pebble watches functioning through community-supported services, these new timepieces represent a long-awaited continuation of a beloved platform. For others dissatisfied with the constant maintenance relationship that characterizes most modern smartwatches, Core Devices offers a compelling alternative—wearables that prioritize longevity, simplicity, and user control over increasingly complex features that often go unused. “The goal is to make something I really want,” Migicovsky concluded. That authentic motivation—creating devices that solve real problems rather than chasing market trends—may ultimately prove to be Core Devices’ most significant advantage in an increasingly crowded wearable landscape.",
