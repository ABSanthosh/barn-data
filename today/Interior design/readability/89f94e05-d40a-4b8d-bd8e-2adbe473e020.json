  "description": "If you're a politically-minded industrial designer, it can be tough to draw a straight line between the work you do and the political system. However, Germany's University of Fine Arts Hamburg (HFBK Hamburg) along with their Federal University of Applied Administrative Sciences, funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, are trying to bridge the gap. They're sponsoring \"Redesign Democracy—Reimagining Voting,\" a design competition that seeks to create a better ballot box.Democracy thrives on participation—the moment when citizens cast their vote in an election is one of the most central expressions of democratic participation. But how does the act of voting affect us? Currently, there is often a gap between aspiration and reality: in some places, simple containers, sometimes converted garbage cans, serve as ballot boxes. It is time to rethink the meaningful act of voting and its context—in terms of design, space, and performance. As part of the research project ReDeRe, the HFBK Hamburg is organizing a competition for the re-design of the voting process. We are inviting all designers, artists, students, researchers and citizens to take part in the competition Redesign Democracy—Reimagining Voting. The aim of the competition is to develop appropriate and visionary concepts that enhance the democratic act of voting. With your designs, you are actively shaping the future of democracy. They help to redefine the relevance and symbolism of voting. Be part of this forward-looking project and help to make the act of voting a visible expression of democracy!The deadline for entries is April 14, 2025.",
