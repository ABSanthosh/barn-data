  "description": "You don’t have to be a car enthusiast to appreciate a luxurious vehicle. Yes, a car is there to help you get from A to B, but a really great car can elevate every day. PEUGEOT believes driving should be a full sensory experience, which is why the French automotive brand has teamed up with Melbourne perfumery Flâner fragrances to create a fragrance inspired by its alluring cars — featuring woody, aromatic and spicy notes. It’s all for the Melbourne Motor Show, where you’ll be able to explore upcoming models like the new PEUGEOT 3008 GT Premium Hybrid and try the limited-edition scent for yourself!",

  "text": "For French automotive manufacturer PEUGEOT, the feeling you get behind the wheel of their cars is just as important as how it drives or looks. It’s fitting then that the word ‘allure’ is a key part of the brand’s philosophy, which first began way back in 1810 as a family business. ‘PEUGEOT looks to breathe a special something into everything the company does,’ says Cynthia Myssy, head of brand at PEUGEOT Australia. ‘The brand’s vision for the future is tech-forward, but always human-centric — focused on making the world a better, more beautiful place to live.’ ‘Allure is more than style, it’s a design philosophy. It’s about creating forms that draw you in, make a statement, and leave a quiet, lasting impression.’ That thinking is behind PEUGEOT’s new generation of hybrid vehicles, including the sleek 3008 GT Premium Hybrid that’s now available to test drive. To celebrate this exciting new chapter, PEUGEOT has collaborated with local perfumery Flâner fragrances to create a unique scent — The Power of Allure — that will be part of their showcase at the Melbourne Motor Show this weekend. Not only will visitors be able to get up close and personal with the striking new models, but they’ll be also treated to an interactive scent bar, offering complimentary samples and larger sizes for test drives. ‘We wanted the scent to evoke the same emotional response you get when you experience the 3008 GT Premium Hybrid,’ Cynthia says of the novel collaboration. Flâner co-founders Andrew Hardeman and Mary Fox drew inspiration for the fragrance from the car and its luxurious interiors, fastback SUV silhouette, and the new Panoramic i-Cockpit — making everyday driving feel a little more elevated. It was a dream concept for the niche perfumers, who expertly tapped into this narrative to bring the immersive fragrance to life. The top notes of bergamot and grapefruit are bold and energising; black pepper and cypriol bring a rugged and refined edge; finished with rich leathers and sandalwood. ‘I’d describe it as a sophisticated and elevated scent that is woody, aromatic and spicy,’ Andrew adds. ‘A car functionally does get you from A to B. But it’s how you connect with a car that truly makes the experience special. We wanted to emotionally capture the feeling of being in a PEUGEOT: the sophistication, refinement, and quiet confidence.’ Don’t miss a chance to experience PEUGEOT and the Allure fragrance at the Melbourne Motor Show, on April 5 – 6.
