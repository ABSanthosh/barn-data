  "text": "This unique family home isn’t a warehouse conversion, but it oozes the same alluring cool factor. Part of a small development in Fitzroy, the surprisingly spacious four-bedroom house spans four floors, thanks to a sophisticated renovation lead by the owners, who have just listed the home for sale. ‘We had been looking for a place that met our vision for inner city living,’ the vendors say. ‘Old warehouses are hard to find, and whilst not a typical brick Fitzroy warehouse, we felt 61 Leicester Street had the right vibe.’ The fact that it was on a street with ‘loads of street art’ was an added bonus. After purchasing the property in 2015, they engaged architects Donald Gallagher \u0026 Associates and Design Fundamentals for a major redesign. In addition to embodying their dream ‘industrial chic’ aesthetic, the floorplan had to accommodate their love of entertaining, and their lifestyle as a family with then-teenaged children. ‘The renovation took about 18 months and we moved back in in February 2020 — at the start of COVID, so we had a lot of time to enjoy our new space!’ they add. The transformation created an additional storey, bringing an extra bedroom or multi-purpose lounge room to the top floor of the building. A curved ceiling and curved rounded window enhances the contemporary interiors, while a new rooftop terrace captures city views. One level down, the main living areas are shaped around a dramatic steel and timber staircase, flanked by separate living and dining zones opening to a wrap-around terrace. Jane Jones Landscapes also helped refresh the lush outdoor spaces. ‘We have had some great nights with friends on what we call the “upper deck” enjoying the view of the Fitzroy skyline,’ the owners say. ‘We’ve loved the kitchen and the large stone bench — which doubles as a casual workspace — particularly on sunny days when all the doors are open to the balcony.’ It’s a private oasis, and the best part is, it’s all within walking distance from the neighbourhood’s cafes, restaurants, shops, and the CBD too! 61 Leicester Street, Fitzroy, VIC 3065 is listed for sale with Mark Verrocchi of Nelson Alexander Fitzroy and will go to auction on Saturday 26 at 10am.",
