  "text": "Tucked into the folds of soft wood grains, this space is more than just a home. It’s a retreat. Inspired by Japanese design principles and grounded in organic materials, Koya House (design by Oli Moskalets) invites you to slow down, breathe deeper, and appreciate the art of intentional living. Every curve, texture, and shadow here tells a quiet story. Let’s walk through the Koya House to have a feel of its soul. The living room at Koya House is a study in sculptural calm. Rich walnut paneling sets a moody backdrop. This is complemented by textural furnishings: a low, stone-colored sofa, a curved wood coffee table, and a bold printed accent chair. Organic forms and curated details, like the stainless steel side table and abstract art, lend a gallery-like vibe. Simultaneously, natural elements like soft blooms keep it grounded. The kitchen and dining area at Koya House features rich walnut cabinetry, paired with a terrazzo-inspired backsplash. This brings organic texture to the kitchen. At the heart of the space, a clover-shaped dining table in a deep oxblood hue acts as both a sculptural centerpiece and a gathering spot. Mismatched yet curated chairs add personality, while the overhead pendant completes the space with quiet drama. The bedroom at Koya House is a quiet composition of wood, warmth, and artful restraint. The custom headboard and wall paneling in richly grained walnut create a cocoon-like backdrop. Olive green bedding adds an earthy contrast, while minimalist accents—like the chrome-framed side table and sculptural red lamp—add style. A bold portrait above the bed adds character, completing the room’s moody vibe. The bathroom at Koya House is compact yet elevated, with a spa-like presence. Olive-toned vertical tiles bring depth and warmth to the walk-in shower. This is softly lit by hidden LEDs. A terrazzo vanity with clean lines adds texture, while sculptural stools and a floating toilet maintain an airy, uncluttered feel. Moody wood paneling and curated artwork continue the home’s signature aesthetic: earthy, artistic, utterly calming.",
