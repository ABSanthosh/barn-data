  "text": "One of the things that most people probably hate is being hospitalized. Aside from of course all the health reasons why this is a hassle, there’s also the added inconvenience of having your vitals regularly monitored. Although of course we know that it’s needed, it still is annoying to be woken up at different times and to be poked and prodded. Designer: Adaption for Skylabs Apollon is an award-winning wearable device that will hopefully lessen some of that inconvenience for hospitalized patients. It has both a wrist-worn module and also a ring-type sensor that is able to measure some of the more important health indicators. It is able to take automatic and periodic measurements of your oxygen level, irregular pulse, pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and skin temperature. It is also able to take body temperature measurements when you need it. The design of the device makes it not so intrusive and uncomfortable for the patient even as it is taking their vitals. It looks just like a regular wearable device although it is of course larger than a smartwatch. The wristband is made from silicone so that it’s hygienic and can easily be attached and removed to the control module. The single-sized silicone ring is placed around the sensor module and can be used by people of various finger sizes. Apollon was actually an honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category at the CES 2025 Innovation Awards. It seems to be a comfortable and non-invasive device for patients in the hospital who are already pretty stressed already because of their health condition.",
