  "description": "To me, the gaming market is a lot like the EDC market: It's fascinating to see what developmental lengths people will go to, to push the UX of some object with highly specific functions. A case in point is this Elitech Protean Space Quick Control Swap Gaming System.The idea behind it, is that gamers have multiple task-dependent UI's on their desks: A keyboard for typing, a joystick and throttle for playing flight simulators, a steering wheel and a shifter for driving games. For gaming accuracy these need to be mounted, and juggling the mounts is apparently a hassle. So what this design does is, provide a modular platform on which to securely attach different controllers.The heart of the system is this keyboard base, with two wings.The keyboard base slides rearwards, revealing aluminum channels.The wing pieces can be slid towards each other along these channels, adjusted to your preferred width.The \"X\" in the top of the wings is stainless steel. This allows you to attach magnetic controllers.Furthermore, there are clamping attachments that allow you to attach a steering wheel and shifter.Thus the gamer can quickly achieve the set-up that they want: This isn't yet in production; the developer is planning a crowdfunding campaign.",
