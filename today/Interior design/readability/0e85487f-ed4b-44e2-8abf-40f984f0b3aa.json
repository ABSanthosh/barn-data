  "text": "Sometimes, at the end of a long and stressful day, the only thing that I can think of eating is a cup of instant noodles bought from my neighborhood convenience store. It’s best eaten with a pair of chopsticks while slurping down the soup but there are times when there are no chopsticks around and you have to make do with a fork, which isn’t the most convenient. Designer: Nissin Nissin is one of the main proponents of instant noodles culture with their ubiquitous Cup Noodle products. They’re now making it more fun and easier to eat your favorite noodles with the Ika Fork or the Squid Fork (ika is of course Japanese for squid). It solves the problem of your noodles slipping out of your ordinary plastic fork’s grasp by redesigning the fork and also making it unique and fun. The fork is designed to look like a real squid, with actual details of the cephalopod included in the utensil. It’s around 8 inches in length and made from heat-resistant materials that can withstand really hot noodles up to 100 degrees Celsius. It prevents your noodles from slipping so you can enjoy the cup without being annoyed. It’s designed for the cup noodles but you can also use it for other food things that require a fork. It’s included in a limited-edition set which has several Cup Noodles flavors and can be ordered through Nissin’s official store and Amazon Japan.",
