  "text": "A kitchen is one of the most valuable spaces in a home. It’s where you cook the things that fuel you, make memories with your family, and it plays a prominent role in many of our mornings. It’s also valuable in a monetary sense, though, as the kitchen is often one of the biggest considerations for those loking to buy a home. That means some kitchen design mistakes can greatly lower your home’s value. If you’re renovating, it’s important to think about how the kitchen will hold up over time, or if you’re looking to get into the market, here are some kitchen flaws that could be hurting your home’s worth. Closing Off the Kitchen Too Much A closed-off kitchen can make a home feel outdated and uninviting. In older homes, kitchens were often separated from the rest of the house, but today’s buyers prefer open layouts that allow for easy movement, connection, and conversation. While you don’t need to knock down every wall, a kitchen that feels too enclosed can be a dealbreaker. Instead of a completely walled-off space, consider partial openings, pass-through windows, or wider doorways to create a better flow while still maintaining structure.

A massive island can make the kitchen feel cramped, while a tiny island can be useless and look out of place. Some homeowners assume that bigger is better, but an oversized island can actually reduce functionality by making it harder to move between cooking zones. On the other hand, an island that’s too small might not be able to serve its intended purpose. Be selective in your island sizing. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Ignoring Natural Light Even if the rest of the design is beautiful, a dark kitchen with no natural light can feel demotivating. Small/no windows, heavy curtains, or poor window placement can make the kitchen feel closed in and cramped. Buyers are drawn to bright, airy spaces, so blocking natural light is a major mistake. If possible, prioritize larger windows or glass doors to bring in more daylight. Even simple fixes, like using lighter window treatments or reflective surfaces, can help bounce light around the room and make the space feel bigger and fresher. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Barefoot_traveller Overloading the Kitchen with One Style A kitchen should have a cohesive design, yes, but going too extreme in one style can backfire. A kitchen that’s overly modern, ultra-traditional, or themed too heavily can feel limiting. Buyers want a space that can adapt to different tastes, and a kitchen that leans too hard in one direction might not appeal to the right people. Instead of committing fully to a specific trend, aim for a balanced mix of classic and modern elements. A flexible design allows the kitchen to feel timeless and adaptable, making it more valuable in the long run. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator Skimping on Ventilation You want good ventilation to keep smoke away, but did you know that poor ventilation also affects the rest of the home? A poorly ventilated kitchen can hold onto cooking smells, making the whole house smell like last night’s dinner. Grease buildup can also be a problem, leaving surfaces feeling sticky over time. A high-quality range hood and proper air circulation make a huge difference in keeping the kitchen fresh and clean. Buyers might not immediately think about ventilation, but they’ll notice when a kitchen feels stuffy or holds onto strong odors. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / photocreo A kitchen should only ever add to a home’s value, not take away from it. The biggest mistakes often come down to choices that make the space feel less open, less functional, or less inviting. Whether it’s blocking natural light, making the layout too rigid, or going too hard with one design style, these issues can all make the space less desirable to future buyers. Keeping these big-picture mistakes in mind can help create a kitchen that’s both beautiful and valuable for years to come.

A poorly ventilated kitchen can hold onto cooking smells, making the whole house smell like last night’s dinner. Grease buildup can also be a problem, leaving surfaces feeling sticky over time. A high-quality range hood and proper air circulation make a huge difference in keeping the kitchen fresh and clean. Buyers might not immediately think about ventilation, but they’ll notice when a kitchen feels stuffy or holds onto strong odors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266800\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266800\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"8688\" height=\"5792\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" title=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723.jpg\" alt=\"A small kitchen in a brown and green apartment.\" width=\"8688\" height=\"5792\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723.jpg 8688w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723-923x615.jpg 923w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-2023-11-27-05-04-51-utc-min-72723-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 8688px) 100vw, 8688px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266800\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/fitted-kitchen-in-small-elegant-apartment-32J42UV\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / photocreo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href=\"https://www.decoist.com/unexpected-kitchen-design-choices/\"\u003ekitchen\u003c/a\u003e should only ever add to a home’s value, not take away from it. The biggest mistakes often come down to choices that make the space feel less open, less functional, or less inviting. Whether it’s blocking natural light, making the layout too rigid, or going too hard with one design style, these issues can all make the space less desirable to future buyers. Keeping these big-picture mistakes in mind can help create a kitchen that’s both beautiful and valuable for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \n        \n        \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003csection id=\"after-content-wrapper\"\u003e\n        Dan is a  writer with many years\u0026#39; experience under his belt, covering everything from entertainment news to astrology.
