Before you start tiling, figure out the middle of the area you'll be working on. Since ours was the backsplash, I marked the middle and centered a tile on that:  I then lined up the tiles each direction to make sure I wasn't going to have any tiny slivers at the ends.  When I was sure of my layout, I pulled out the item that made the process go so quickly. It's a tile setting mat that you use instead of mortar:  Funny thing is, I got these adhesive mats as a gift YEARS ago...I'm talking probably ten years back. I didn't have any need for them then, and tucked them away in the garage where they sat. I forgot about them till we moved.  I wasn't sure if they'd even still work, but I kept the mats hoping to try them one day.  Thankfully they worked SO well and were crazy easy to use! They have a sticky back that you attach to the wall, and a strong adhesive that grips the tiles on the front.  Simply stick the mat on the wall, and when you're ready, peel the paper off the sticky front:  I used one and a half packages for the whole project. I'm really impressed with this product.  I love that this mat makes it easier to work in sections. You can stick the mat to the wall and walk away from the project at any point.  Your tile should include details that will help you determine what size tile spacers and grout joint size you'll need to use. This one suggested 1/16\" grout lines. I thought about not using spacers at all, but decided in the end to use the them for a more uniform look.  My countertop was level, but I made sure to check the tile as I was going to make sure it was level as well:  I wanted a more traditional look, so I did a brick pattern -- this is also a bit more forgiving in my opinion.  You have to be pretty meticulous so the lines match up perfectly with a straight stack tile layout:   If you have outlets or switches to work around, you'll need to turn the power off at the breaker and take your outlet cover off to work around them: Hold your tile mat up and trace where you'll need to cut before sticking it on the wall. You can use a utility knife or scissors to cut the mats.  The mat is VERY sticky, but you can remove tile and rearrange it at first if needed. I'm not sure how that would work after it's been stuck for awhile.  I've always used a wet saw when cutting tile, but because these were so small (and it was COLD in the garage the day I was installing), I went with a tile cutter instead.  It is SO easy to use! You just line up your tile where the cut needs to be:  Then you roll the diamond blade along the tile with some pressure to score it. Make sure your pressure is consistent from start to finish.  Just push down and it snaps the tile in a clean line:  It works so well and super fast. You can use these for larger tiles too -- just make sure the cutter you get will work for your tile.  The only issue I had was cutting smaller slivers of tile. I found that if I scored it with the same pressure from the bottom to top, I could get pretty small cuts.  Always order about 10 percent more tile than you'll need!  My issue with not using the wet saw was cutting around outlets. With a tile saw you can tilt the tile toward the blade for complex cuts. There are other ways to do it too -- I was about to run out and buy a diamond blade for my Dremel tool when I noticed something as I was cutting with the tile cutter... I realized the two pieces can be matched up perfectly after being cut. I got an idea -- I measured where I needed to cut for the outlet, then used the tile cutter to make those. Then I used some Gorilla Glue, matched them back up and clamped them together for at least an hour:  It worked! I wasn't sure it would hold and was pleasantly surprised.  It even worked when I had to cut the tile into three parts to work around an outlet:  I did baby them a bit as I installed -- making sure not to push to hard. But they look great and you would never be able to tell that I cut them apart! That may help you as well if you don't have access to a wet saw. Another great thing about using the tile setting mats is you can grout immediately, unlike mortar. I used this premixed, sanded grout to finish up this tile backsplash:  Make sure to protect your surfaces before starting!  I LOVE these pre-taped plastic sheets for projects like this -- you stick the painter's tape on and then pull the plastic out. It sticks to any surface easily:  Mortar and grout aren't the most fun to install on a vertical surface -- you'll lose a lot to the floor or counter.   I didn't have a grout float (mine was a mess and I had tossed it months ago) so I just used a plastic putty knife -- and I think it was even easier to use: Grouting isn't really hard -- just smush it in there. Fifteen to 30 minutes after, use a large damp sponge and a bucket of water and start wiping excess grout off the tile.  If there are any spots you missed, you can usually move the it around and fill in with the grout sponge.  You'll need to use clean water and wipe a few more times with the sponge to get any grout haze off of the tile. Grout will lighten as it dries, so don't freak out if it doesn't look right at first!  If you are tiling a floor or a backsplash where that will get wear and tear, you'll want to use a grout sealer afterwards so it doesn't stain. Not too bad right? The install went pretty quickly!  To finish up that part of the wall, I made some quick \"floating\" shelves to hang between the cabinets:  I used scrap luan and wood and then nailed them in from inside the cabinets. A little piece of trim across the front finished them off:  This tile is SO pretty!! It comes in cream, white, blue, gray and black. All are beautiful.  I went with cream for many reasons, but mostly because our upper cabinets are not pure white. I worried the white tile would look off against them.  By the way, if you have an outlet in an odd spot -- take your tile down the wall! It flows so much better than ending it awkwardly on the wall around an outlet.  I LOVE this room!: Here's where I started with this area:",
