Their LEVA 'bot is designed specifically to carry a standard Euro-type cargo box. While the wheels allow it to travel quickly on flat surfaces, it can also navigate stairs.Because its wheels can rotate in any direction, the LEVA can pick up or deposit the boxes sideways or front-ways.RIVR reckons their legs + wheels arrangement will give them a competitive advantage:\"Although the use of robotics is widespread in logistics, few solutions offer the capability to efficiently transport payloads both in controlled and unstructured environments. Four-legged robots are ideal for navigating any environment a human can, yet few have the features to autonomously move payloads.\"This is where LEVA shines. By combining both wheels (a means of locomotion ideally suited for fast and precise motion on flat surfaces) and legs (which are perfect for traversing any terrain that humans can), LEVA strikes a balance that makes it highly versatile.
