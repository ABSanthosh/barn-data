  "description": "When ELLISON STUDIOS. unveiled their new concept space in Sydney, it immediately caught our eye. The beloved Australian brand has taken over an entire floor inside the 1920s Edwards \u0026 Co. warehouse building in Surry Hills. Yet, despite its soaring ceilings and open-plan layout, the space is cosy and welcoming thanks to a palette of warm hues, plenty of texture and cleverly delineated ‘zones’. Below, we take you through how to get this look at home, with a few favourite pieces from our Design Directory.",

With its tall windows, lofty ceilings, 100-year-old hardwood floors and open-plan layout, spaces like this one can easily become overwhelming — and everything you put in, too small. But as the team at ELLISON STUDIOS. showcased, you can turn a vast and open apartment into a welcoming space you’ll never want to leave (without moving walls!). Playing with height and scale is a big part of styling a space like this. Choose curtains that run from the ceiling to floor, and use rugs to help delineate ‘zones’ and add layers of comfort. If you are blessed with high ceilings, lighting should come from lamps and low-hanging pendants  — this will help to create a more intimate space. Paper lamp shades are an excellent choice. Not only to cast a soft, warm glow, but also to add texture and much needed visual interest. For the colour palette, choose warm neutral hues, with a few darker accents to anchor each ‘zone’ within the space. A variety of materials and textures is also important. Consider a mix of ultra soft velvet or fluffy shearling, alongside smooth timber and sleek chrome. Finally, it’s the finishing touches that will truly bring these spaces to life. For art, opt for oversized pieces where possible, to play up the scale of the room. Alongside contemporary paintings, also consider graphic or photographic works. Add texture with a few hand-crafted ceramics, and don’t forget a spot of greenery — a tall, sculptural plant is the perfect finishing touch!
