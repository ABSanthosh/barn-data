The Cozy Cabin, designed by Alexey Gulesha, Sergii Plinokos, and Victoria Romaniuk, was never meant to be a forever space, but as the design came together, so did a sense of belonging. With every material choice, lighting tweak, and layout shift, the project began to feel less like a stopgap and more like a retreat.",

  "text": "What started as a simple vision for a cozy little rental quickly grew into something far more meaningful. The Cozy Cabin, designed by Alexey Gulesha, Sergii Plinokos, and Victoria Romaniuk, was never meant to be a forever space, but as the design came together, so did a sense of belonging. With every material choice, lighting tweak, and layout shift, the project began to feel less like a stopgap and more like a retreat. The living room in the Cozy Cabin is the heart of the home: soft, grounded, and inviting. A plush, low-profile sectional anchors the space. This is upholstered in a creamy fabric that feels just as calming as it looks. A deep-pile rug and curved coffee tables add tactile elements. Simultaneously, the room invites you to sink in and stay awhile. The recessed feature in the wall makes for a space-savvy addition. It can recess back into the wall, making room for a full-fledged bed! Tucked just off the main living area, the dining space features a light-toned wooden table with softly rounded edges. This sets the tone: natural, unfussy, and full of warmth. It’s paired with a mix of upholstered and timber chairs, bringing a lived-in feel. Overhead, a minimal pendant light casts a gentle glow. Clean-lined cabinetry in a soft, matte finish keeps the kitchen feeling open and effortless, while open shelving adds rustic charm. The palette stays neutral, letting textures (like natural wood, ceramic jars, and brushed hardware) do the talking. Compact but well-planned, every inch is optimized for easy living, whether you’re making coffee for one or prepping a weekend meal with friends. The bedroom in Cozy Cabin is drenched in soft neutrals and layered with texture. A low, upholstered bed sits at the center, dressed in natural linens and cloudlike throws. Subtle lighting, warm wood accents, and minimalist artwork round out the look—nothing loud, nothing fussy, just pure, understated comfort. The bathroom in The Cozy Cabin may be modest in size, but it delivers big on atmosphere. A floating vanity keeps the space feeling open, while warm wood details and matte black fixtures add depth. The walk-in shower is tiled in earthy neutrals, offering a calming, almost meditative feel.",
