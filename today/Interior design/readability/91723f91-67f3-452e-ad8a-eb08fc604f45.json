  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. If you read my last few posts about not having heat on the main floor of the house and starting the process of having the ceilings repaired and the removable of the popcorn, not much has changed since these postings. The HVAC company is scheduled to come out again tomorrow morning. Keeping my fingers crossed that they can finally figure out what the problem is and get it fixed. As for the ceilings, the guest room where the tree crashed through the roof is all done and Ed and I are beginning to get the room back to normal. I may have to remove the wallpaper I recently put up on one wall (open in same tab) in the room or come up with a creative solution since the ceiling is now about 4 inches higher than it was. I will keep you posted on that. In the kitchen and living room, the contractor’s ran into a glitch last week. After the popcorn was removed, straight lines of cracks appeared and if they skim coat the ceiling as they planned, these cracks would eventually come through. So starting tomorrow, they will be putting up new sheetrock on the ceiling. It is going to be a busy “fix it day” at my house tomorrow. I hope your week gets off on a good start. Now onto the links I found for you this week: Something to Think About Good to know about how safe our phones are from hackers. (open in same tab) What to do if your phone is stolen.
