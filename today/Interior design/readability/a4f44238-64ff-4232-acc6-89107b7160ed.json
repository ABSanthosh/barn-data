While pastels are often the go-to choice for spring, there are plenty of unexpected combinations that can bring warmth and personality to your space. Whether you love bold contrasts or more subtle tones, the right color palette can transform any room into a fresh and cozy space. 1. Moss Green and Beige Moss green has a natural, earthy feel that instantly brings an outdoorsy feel, while beige offers a neutral, grounding touch. A moss green accent wall paired with beige furniture or linens creates a cozy, organic look that’s perfect for welcoming the returning greens of spring. Adding natural elements like wooden furniture and woven textiles further enhances the warmth this palette holds. If you’re looking for subtle pops of color, consider botanical prints or ceramic decor in warm complementary tones. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / vanitjan 2. Butter Yellow and Gray Butter yellow is a softer take on traditional yellow, bringing some warmth without being too intense about it. When paired with a stoney gray, it feels both refreshing and sophisticated. This palette is great for kitchens and living areas, where a touch of brightness helps liven up a usually pretty neutral color scheme. Gray keeps the yellow from feeling overpowering, and yellow keeps the gray from being too cold. The combination is classic, yet still unexpected, making it a great choice for those who want a refined but cheerful spring look. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / hemul75 3. Blue and Terracotta Blue and terracotta mix beautifully, evoking the sky and the earth together as one cohesive palette. They bring an unexpected harmony that feels both soothing and grounded, meaning this combination works particularly well in bedrooms and living spaces where a balance of cool and warm tones can create a calming effect. Terracotta-colored ceramics, cushions, or rugs can add a natural, handcrafted feel, while blue walls, bedding, or seating keep the space from feeling too heavy. It’s a pairing that feels modern but still deeply connected to nature. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / FollowTheFlowStudio 4. Sage Green and Taupe Another green, sage green is a calming, muted tone that’s gentle yet still striking, while taupe offers a neutral, understated complement. This combination works beautifully in bedrooms, reading nooks, or even bathrooms where relaxation is the top priority. Sage green textiles like curtains or bedding add a refreshing pop of color without overwhelming the space, while taupe walls or furniture pieces provide a timeless backdrop to build upon. It’s light without being pastel, striking but soft, making it perfect for the changing tides of spring. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / AlenaVlasko 5. Rust Orange and Olive Rust orange is a rich, warm shade that adds vibrancy to a space, while olive provides a natural, grounding, yet unique contrast. This palette works well in living rooms and dining spaces, social areas that want to feel as vibrant as they do comfortable. Rust orange can be introduced through accent chairs, artwork, or decorative pieces, while deep olive makes a great base in the form of walls or large furniture. The combination is earthy, modern, and versatile, making it a great way to introduce color without it feeling like too much.

Whether you prefer softer hues or something a bit bolder, there’s a perfect combination waiting for you this year. The key is to find colors that make you feel at home while embracing the freshness of the season.

The combination is earthy, modern, and versatile, making it a great way to introduce color without it feeling like too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_266977\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266977\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1741\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A living room with an orange couch and olive green chairs.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1741\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-265x180.jpg 265w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-904x615.jpg 904w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-768x522.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-1536x1044.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-2048x1393.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/interior-of-modern-living-room-2024-10-14-18-11-05-utc-10383-385x262.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266977\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/bedroom-interior-in-vintage-style-in-wolf-color-au-24S7Z9V\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / hemul75\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring is a great time to experiment with new colors and refresh your home’s look.
