  "text": "Goan furniture brand Josmo has opened a flagship store in Mumbai, designed by founder Anjali Mody to reflect a contemporary approach to Indian design craft. With India's interior design market growing fast, Josmo is one of several homegrown brands on the rise. The Mumbai store is the company's first outside Goa, where it was founded by Mody in 2010. Josmo's Mumbai store is divided into different zonesAs creative director, Mody designed the retail space in line with a brand style she describes as \"witty, elegant and unapologetically unique\". \"We wanted it to feel like stepping into a world where every detail whispers Josmo,\" she told Dezeen. \"Think sculptural forms, earthy textures and just the right amount of drama. It's warm, immersive and bold – a space where every piece tells its own story but still feels part of a bigger narrative.\" A curving tassel installation hangs from the ceilingThe store is located on Annie Besant Road, a major street running through Mumbai's Worli neighbourhood. Mody has divided the interior into a series of zones, highlighted by curvy details that include bespoke shelving systems, raised platforms and a tassel installation suspended from the ceiling. \"This fringe moves ever so slightly with a gust of wind from outside, creating the most beautiful romance between movement and stillness,\" said Mody. Textured surfaces were created using waste sawdustMany of the surfaces feature a rough texture, created with a coating of waste sawdust sourced from the brand's factory. These include a sculptural bookcase that frames the entrance space. The showroom launched in November, coinciding with the opening of the inaugural Design Mumbai fair. It showcases Josmo's latest collection, which debuted at Design Mumbai, along with bestselling pieces from previous furniture and homeware lines. The 2024 collection highlights Josmo's ambition to combine digital fabrication technologies with India's handmade traditions, resulting in a contemporary interpretation of design craft. This often creates surprising juxtapositions of form and texture, as seen in products such as the Nanyuki dining table and the Marrakesh console. Josmo's new collection includes the biscuit-inspired Biscoff side table\"We're rooted in India's rich craft traditions but unapologetically modern in how we think, blend textures and play with forms,\" said Mody. \"It's about creating pieces that feel like they've always belonged, yet still make you pause and say wow.\" The showroom includes a space where Josmo can create an entire room interiorMany of the pieces also incorporate playful references, which are reflected in their names. The Biscoff side table, Cadbury box and Chip coffee table all takes cues from sweet treats. The showroom also incorporates a space where Josmo can present an entire room interior, as well as a material library where customers can browse different fabric and finish options. A material library allows customers to browse different fabric and finish optionsThe store is part of a long-term growth strategy for Josmo, which is also set to open two factories and expand into accessories, with the sub-brand Josmo Minis. \"The Mumbai showroom is just the beginning of an exciting chapter for Josmo,\" said Mody. The company plans to launch an accessories sub-brand, Josmo Minis\"We're looking to expand our reach both in India and internationally, focusing on creating partnerships, enhancing our bespoke offerings, and participating in global design forums,\" she added. \"Innovation and sustainability will remain at our core as we continue crafting timeless designs and nurturing the incredible team and community that make Josmo thrive.\" The photography is courtesy of Josmo.
