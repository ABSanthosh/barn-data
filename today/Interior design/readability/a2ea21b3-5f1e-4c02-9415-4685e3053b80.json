Visitors can take a seat, run along, climb upon, or even lay down on the work and enjoy each other’s company and views of the surroundings.They also then become participants, as during Tokyo Midtown DESIGN TOUCH 2024 they were invited to stick different colored paper pieces along the surface to mark a record of their own experience. In doing this, LOGGING HILL was activated beyond urban infrastructure into a public space embedded with the imprints of its users.all images by by Kaoru YamadaTaichi Kuma of TAILAND explores timber’s adaptabilityThe curving pavilion’s primary components are a series of plywood panels that shape the rings. Each a different size — 2 meter, 5 meters, and 10 meters — the rings are fabricated with precision using advanced 3D CNC technology. They further incline a distinct angle and seamlessly connected to the ground. Versatile platforms are then created that accommodate a wide range of activities for the public passing through the park.

During the three-week exhibition, the intervention drew significant attention from visitors, particularly children, who engaged enthusiastically with its playful design.designed by Taichi Kuma of TAILANDLOGGING HILL is an inviting pavilion composed of three interlocking timber ringsa multifunctional gathering space in a Tokyo parkthe curving pavilion’s primary components are a series of plywood panelsentrance view photo by Kaoru Yamadaa welcoming portal that interacts harmoniously with an existing art piece by Florian ClaarLOGGING HILL at night",
