And they create a beautiful ambience for hosting parties. Case in point: these Timberline Arista taper candles—the perfect pick for your dinner table this holiday season! These unscented taper candles feature a subtle, textured finish. What we especially love is that they can blend into any setting. The blue set of candles is great for modern minimalist holiday themes, such as a Winter Wonderland. The red taper adds warmth to a traditional holiday tablescape. Designed to burn cleanly and evenly, these unscented candles ensure your holiday gatherings remain free of overpowering scents. They’re perfect for holiday dinners, intimate celebrations, or even quiet evenings at home. Whether standing tall on their own or paired with elegant candleholders, like the 2-piece metal tabletop stacking set, these candles can really set the scene. Picture them styled with books for a relaxed vibe or as a centerpiece for a formal dinner… the possibilities are endless. You simply can’t go wrong with the classic appeal of these taper candles! Their timeless design make them a staple for festive decorating—and beyond.Available now at Wayfair.",
