  "text": "memorializing pet ashes with living marine reefsResting Reef — the design-driven, sustainable venture reimagining death care — launches the first phase of its service to commemorate past lives, whilst building new life under water. Founded by graduates from Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, Aura Murillo and Louise Skajem, the startup offers a sustainable alternative to traditional pet memorials.With oyster reefs declining by 85% and 90% of coral reefs at risk due to human activity, this new service creates memorial reefs by blending pet ashes with crushed shells. By placing these transformed, underwater ‘urns’ in marine environments, our beloved companions give back to damaged ecosystems, becoming sanctuaries for marine life. The ocean ‘cemetery’ then at once restores marine biodiversity, sequesters carbon, and prevents coastal erosion. In this initial phase, a limited number of 20 pet memorials will be available for dedication in Bali by February 2025.all images courtesy of Resting Reefresting reef integrates biomimicry principlesWith designs based on biomimicry principles, the Resting Reef team uses cutting-edge technology to create reef structures with ridges and textures similar to those found in natural marine environments. The design includes passageways and pocket space that mimics the complex structures of natural reefs, which provide shelter, feeding grounds, and breeding sites for various marine species.Combined with pulverized shells, the ashes of a pet are used to create these structures that are then placed in select underwater locations. Their layered textures mirror the natural growth patterns of ancient stromatolite reefs, fostering the growth of organisms such as corals and algae which play a crucial role in filtering water and maintaining coastal health.Resting Reef — the design-driven, sustainable venture reimagining death care for petsregenerating marine life for sustainable futuresUnlike conventional burial methods, which often involve large carbon footprints, non-biodegradable materials, and significant land use, Resting Reef’s approach and formula provide a regenerative alternative. Over the course of three years, the memorial reefs are expected to capture CO2, contribute to the restoration of marine life, and help protect coastlines from the effects of erosion and rising sea levels. Each installation supports biodiversity, provides a buffer against climate-related impacts, and helps communities dependent on marine ecosystems.The memorial structures are placed in Tianyar Bay and Tulamben Village, North Bali, to reverse the damage caused by decades of unsustainable fishing and coral mining, which devastated local reefs and communities. Since 2017, Dr Zach Boakes and his team at North Bali Reef Conservation have worked to restore the coastline. Now, as part of Resting Reef, he continues the mission by creating lasting tributes for families while offering job security for local residents.the startup offers a sustainable alternative to traditional pet memorialsThese memorials are not only a resting place for loved ones to visit but they also become homes for new life to form.
