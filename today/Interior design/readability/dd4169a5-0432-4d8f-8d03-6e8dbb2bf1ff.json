  "text": "ARROWatch introduces Segmented Geometry as Time InterfaceThe ARROWatch, developed by Ion Lucin and Acero Ionyc, introduces an alternative approach to time representation through minimal, geometric design and a nontraditional interface. The concept is based on rethinking how time is visually communicated and interpreted.Unlike conventional analog watches where hour and minute markers are continuously visible and time is indicated by rotating hands, the ARROWatch employs a single rotating dial segmented by eight transparent dividers. These dividers divide the 12-hour dial into eight equal 45-degree sections. Three of these sections are colored to form an arrow shape.all images courtesy of Ion Lucin and Acero IonycRethinking Time with Ion Lucin’s ARROWatchThe arrow is positioned opposite to the current time markers but points directly to them, enabling time reading through geometric orientation. The time markers are simplified, replacing full hour and minute numerals with key intervals: exact hours, half hours, and additional markers at 15 and 45 minutes. The rotating dial displays this information in conjunction with the fixed arrow form, presenting an approximate yet intuitive reading of time.The ARROWatch, developed by designer Ion Lucin, is currently in its development phase, with a crowdfunding campaign launched on Indiegogo to support production.minimalist design redefines traditional time-tellinga single rotating dial replaces conventional watch handsstrap width of 20 mm complements the balanced design",
