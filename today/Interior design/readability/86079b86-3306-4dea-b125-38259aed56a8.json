  "text": "When it comes to tiles, are you in the camp that considers them as purely aesthetic or entirely functional? There’s no shortage of beautiful tiles out there – ceramic, marble, terrazzo, concrete – but beyond adding visual interest and protecting walls and surfaces, they usually aren’t considered all that utilitarian. That was before Paris-based studio Unknown, Untitled introduced UU Tiles, a collection where ceramic tiles can double as functional hooks and minimalist wall lamps, blending seamlessly into the tiling while also quietly standing out. Originally launched as a research project, UU Tiles evolved into a full-blown collection in collaboration with a historic Normandy tile manufacturer. It challenges preconceived notions about what tiles are – and what they can be. Rather than giving into the trend of mobility and flexibility, where design can be and are encouraged to be, swapped out as needed, Unknown, Untitled leans into the sustainability of permanence, using the fixed nature of tiling as an opportunity to build in function. The collection includes three components: plain tiles, ceramic hooks, and ceramic wall lamps, each of which shares the same tile-based attachment system. Because of their identical dimensions and tonal options, the functional tiles blend beautifully with the decorative ones, creating what the studio calls “a physical interface between the architecture and the living space. Whether you’re hanging up a coat or lighting up a hallway, the tile remains constant, a quiet but intentional design detail. Even as a standalone object, the hooks and lights are a delightful expression of color and form. The look is clean, minimal, and unexpectedly warm, with glossy surfaces that reflect both light and intention. Each options is available in a variety of colors. The idea of permanent storage and lighting might seem a tad intimidating. After all, swapping out tiles is a bit more labor-intensive than changing out a lamp or a hook, but this permanence can be a good thing. It invites a more thoughtful approach to design, one that values longevity and encourages us to consider the earth’s limited capacity to absorb our excess. In a world where so much ends up discarded, there’s something quietly radical about committing to something built to last. Both the lamps and hooks can be used as standalone pieces without the blank tiles surrounding them for a minimalist look. To learn more about UU Tiles by Unknown, Untitled, visit uutiles.com.
