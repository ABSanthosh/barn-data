  "description": "Here's an example of solving a complex problem by synthesizing existing technologies in a novel way.A Chinese inventor known only as Mr. Feng wanted to create a robot that could persistently return tennis volleys, allowing him to practice his sport without needing to line up a human partner. While humanoid robots have made sharp advances in China, none are up to the complicated task of playing tennis.What Feng realized is that you don't need a humanoid robot; you just need a robot that can simulate the inputs and outputs of a human partner. He subsequently created this Acemate Tennis Robot, a rolling box that can track struck balls using a pair of cameras, and reach them anywhere on the court thanks to mecanum wheels. It catches the balls within its net, then fires a new ball back towards the player. By dialing in the timing of when it catches a ball and when it fires one, the effect is as if you're playing with a human.It's an understatement to say backers went wild for the idea. The Acemate has been successfully Kickstarted with over $2.1 million in pledges at press time, with 4 days left to pledge.",
