I’ve been working on organizing and fixing up small spaces in my home little by little this year. I’ve been sharing behind the scenes and progress in our HomeBody Gathering Place community (and these projects will continue even more in 2025 — come join us!). Since October in the HGP I’ve shared before photos and progress updates in my mudroom, pantry cabinets/closet and coffee station! It feels great to be making steady progress on decluttering, simplifying and beautifying spaces. This guest room closet really was getting out of control so something had to be done. In a smaller home, you can’t afford to lose any space to clutter or disorganization, especially a much needed closet. My dream and eventual goal was to wallpaper this closet and repaint the dresser, but I decided in order to quickly get some sense of organization and function before Christmas, I would leave the more creative or time consuming ideas for another season! My goal was to declutter and use what I have rather than get sidetracked on any grand ideas. I finally got a lot of the random stuff out that had piled up there (thanks to the motivation of our HGP Bag A Day challenge which we held this fall. We’ll be doing another community challenge and focus on simplifying our homes in the HGP in January, so I’ll be working another closet or room then!). If you could use a dose of weekly Home Therapy to inspire you to action in the new year, come join us. Sources: Gift Wrap, Ribbon, Floral Box, and Cards Once the clutter was out, I started to think about how I could better use this space. When a closet or cabinet has a distinct function or organizational system, it won’t be as likely to get cluttered again. I had just bought some new gift wrap so I was inspired to focus on using this closet mostly gift wrapping and packing supplies. But also decided to use the upper shelf for guest sheets (I had bought these containers a year or two ago, they work great for organizing our lesser used guest sheets) as well as hung some out of season clothing to one side. Recently I shared my over the door organizer in this post: 10 Organizers We Use in Our Home. I bought this for a different purpose but now I love the organizer in here as it can hold all of the small gift wrapping items that had previously filled up one of the drawers in this dresser. I will probably organize the cubbies of this organizer even more, but it was simple to just toss items in and instantly have an empty drawer to use! This is a Restoration Hardware dresser that was here in the house when we moved in. It’s good quality and I never like to let a dresser go to waste so we moved it in the closet to make best use of space. Now it’s the perfect spot for gift wrapping and the drawers are a handy place for rolls of gift wrap, small boxes and bags, and a spot to stash gifts, too. Then I got an idea for what to do with the rolls of ribbon we’ll use when I wrap Christmas gifts this year. Some of them are in the door organizer, but I thought it would be fun to keep some of the new holiday ribbon I got from Rifle Paper Co. separate to use for Christmas. Since I only wanted to use what I had to organize this closet, I found I had an extra tension curtain rod to use for the Christmas ribbon. The tension rod fit perfectly on one side of the closet. Now this ribbon is organized and very convenient for use in this season. Plus there is a lot more room on the rod so I can add more ribbon! By the way, the trick to making ribbon functional on a rod like this is taping the edge of the ribbon when not in use. Otherwise it will unroll and land on the floor :). Our closet doesn’t have a wired in light so for now I used this set of two rechargeable lamps (on Black Friday sale right now!). I bought these earlier this year and have already found so many places for them around the house, but I decided the lamps in this spot will make gift wrapping extra cozy in these dark evenings! I’ve had the linen boards since my navy office two homes ago. I loved that office so much, I think I might want to paint this whole room navy in honor of it. :) The printable gift tags and Hygge art on the linen boards (which I bought at HomeGoods years ago) are free gifts for members of HomeBody Gathering Place! If you are an HGP member, you can find them in your dashboard. I got all of these adorable wrapping supplies from Rifle this year … including the cards, gift wrap, ribbon etc! I love them all! Now that I have a cozy spot to be, I can’t wait to make a hot drink, turn on some tunes and wrap gifts!
