Sure, they make us more comfortable, but they also support our head and neck, meaning they’re good for our physical health all while being one of our coziest treasures. However, over time, they wear out. They get flat or lumpy and aren’t suitable for sleeping anymore. What do we do with them then? Here are just a few things you can do to make something new out of your old pillows. 1. Transform Old Pillows into Pet Beds Old pillows can find new life as cozy beds for your pets. Rather than tossing them, consider layering a few together inside a durable fabric cover or sewing them into a soft mat for your dog or cat. If you don’t have pets, local shelters are often grateful for donated bedding to keep their animals warm and comfortable. It’s a small gesture that can make a big difference for animals in need!

Sew together two or three pillows, slip them into a sturdy, attractive cover, and you’ve got a functional seating option perfect for casual gatherings or quiet moments with a book. For added flair, consider using secondhand fabric with a bold pattern or specific tones that complement your décor. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / duskbabe 3. Use Pillow Filling for Craft Projects The stuffing inside your used pillow has tons of potential, too. Whether they’re filled with feathers, foam, or synthetic fibers, their insides can be reused for projects like making plush toys, draft stoppers for doors, or padding for quilted blankets. If you enjoy giving handmade gifts, this is a budget-friendly way to make something personal and meaningful while keeping materials out of the landfill.

Recycle into Garden Cushions If you enjoy spending time outdoors, old pillows can be repurposed as padding for kneeling while gardening (or cleaning, if you’re staying indoors). Simply sew a weatherproof cover or use a heavy-duty trash bag to protect them from dirt, moisture, bugs, and other unsavory guests. It’s a simple way to give them a second chance while making another hobby of yours a little more comfortable. 5. Donate or Compost When Possible Sometimes, the best way to repurpose old pillows is by letting them go responsibly. Many textile recycling programs accept old bedding, breaking it down into raw materials for insulation or furniture stuffing. For natural-fiber pillows, like those made with cotton or wool, consider composting the filling. Just be sure to check for any synthetic components before adding them to your pile. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / LightFieldStudios When it comes to reusing anything, not just pillows, the goal is to find both practical and creative ways to give them a second life. It’s about more than simply reducing waste, it’s about turning something worn-out into something useful, comforting, or beautiful once again. With a little elbow grease and a colorful mind, even the flattest of pillows can become something amazing.
