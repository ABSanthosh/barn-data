  "text": "Welcome to the Claylight Home, designed by Salma Khaled. In this sanctuary, soft neutrals and warm woods are design elements. The space is designed with intention and layered with natural light. As such, it celebrates calm, comfort, and quiet beauty. From tactile walls to curved furniture, every corner tells a story of understated elegance. If you’ve ever dreamt of living in a home that feels like a warm hug, this is your mood board come to life. The living room at the Claylight Home features curved, cloud-like seating wrapped in tactile boucle. This invites you to sink in and stay awhile, while the layered neutrals create a visual hush that feels grounding. Earthy textures, like the ribbed floor lamp, carved wooden tables, and textured art panels add depth without disrupting the calm. Sunlight filters through sheer drapes, dancing across the natural wood tones. This is not just a place to gather; it’s a place to exhale. The Claylight Home’s dining space is anchored by a solid wood table and surrounded by plush, sculptural chairs. The type that invites slow dinners and long conversations. A trio of pleated pendant lamps floats above (that feel much like candlelight). But what truly sets this space apart is the custom coffee and tea station tucked into a wood-lined niche. This is complete with open shelving, backlighting, and thoughtfully styled ceramics. The kitchen in the Claylight Home is a perfect expression of understated luxury. With its clean lines, matte cabinetry, and seamless stone backsplash, it proves that simplicity can be stunning. Warm wood details wrap around integrated appliances and open shelving. This creates visual continuity with the rest of the home. Every element in this kitchen feels intentional, from the black sink to the curated shelf styling. The bedroom at the Claylight Home is a retreat within a retreat… an intimate cocoon where layers of texture meet sculptural calm. A palette of warm neutrals flows from the ribbed wall panels to the low-profile bed. Frosted glass wardrobes and floating nightstands keep the visual weight minimal, while statement lighting adds style. In the Claylight Home, the nursery is designed as a multipurpose space. This cozy corner brings together baby essentials and adult serenity. The soft curves of the crib and changing station echo the design language of the entire home. The whimsical animal prints and plush toys add playfulness. Next to it, a generously sized sectional invites the whole family to snuggle in. It’s a space made for moments—reading books, sipping coffee, or simply watching your little one dream. The bathrooms at the Claylight Home channels spa-like serenity. Smooth stone tiles, warm wood accents, and ambient lighting set the tone for a tranquil escape. Fluted wall details bring depth without distraction, while the floating vanity and open shelving keep the space feeling light and grounded.",
