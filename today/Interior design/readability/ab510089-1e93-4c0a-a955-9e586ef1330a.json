  "text": "French architect Joris Poggioli has renovated his Paris apartment, aiming to preserve its historic features while integrating modern design elements. Poggioli sought to renovate the apartment located in a mansion that was once Napoleon Bonaparte's office, while preserving its \"historic soul\". Joris Poggioli has renovated his apartment in Paris\"It was an opportunity to merge my passion for minimalism with the grandeur of Napoleon-era architecture,\" Poggioli told Dezeen. \"The goal was not just to restore but to allow these historical elements to shine once more in a contemporary context, while also bringing forth the voice of our generation, our era, through my intervention.\" The apartment is located in a mansion where Napoleon Bonaparte had an officePoggioli aimed to restore the 90-square-meter apartment's original features, which had been obscured by years of modifications. \"When I first stepped inside, it was like entering a fortress with layers of flooring, insulation, and makeshift walls,\" explained Poggioli. \"Slowly, I peeled away these layers, revealing original parquet, mouldings, and architectural details that had been hidden for decades\". Influenced by Napoleon's historical connection to the building, he sought to honour its heritage while introducing a modern touch. To achieve this, Poggioli focused on subtly highlighting features of the apartment, including the grand proportions, the flow of light through large windows, and the overall sense of space. \"I wanted my design to feel like it was embracing the historical skeleton of the building, enhancing its spirit rather than competing with it\". It has high ceilingsThe 4.2-metre-high ceiling, a focal point of the apartment, heavily influenced his design choices. Elements like an oversized headboard in the bedroom and a mezzanine-like upper floor were introduced to accentuate the tall ceiling. \"The soaring ceiling height was one of the most striking features of the apartment,\" explained Poggioli. \"It immediately influenced how I approached the design, giving me room to think on a grander scale\". \"The void, the space itself, became necessary for thought—it allows mental images to escape and flow freely,\" he continued. The bedroom features an oversized headboardThe apartment also features sculptures borrowed from a client, a collector of Amerindian art, whose pieces have been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Puiforcat also lent a series of bowls designed by American artist Donald Judd, while the other pieces come from Joris' collection. \"These pieces were selected because they represent a bridge between tradition and modernity, much like the apartment itself,\" said Poggioli. \"Amerindian art brings a sense of deep-rooted culture and craftsmanship, while the Puiforcat bowls, with their sleek, timeless design, add a layer of refinement,\" he continued. \"Together, they create a balance that reflects the overall philosophy of the space—a harmonious coexistence of the past and the present, each enhancing the other.\" Various sculptures can be found in the apartmentOther apartment renovations recently featured on Dezeen include an apartment in Barcelona by architect Raúl Sánchez and a brutalist apartment in Canada by architect Jean Verville.
