  "text": "The Rustline Home is decorated is an affair of terracotta, rust, and cream. This space mixes warm tones with bold art, creating an atmosphere that feels expressive. From color-blocked accents to framed pieces that pop against soft backdrops… the home feels like a live-in gallery!This space is decorated by Tetyana Savchenko and photographed by Sergiy Kadulin Photography. The living room in the Rustline Home blends soft grey upholstery with bold accents in rust, ochre, and black. The layered throw and cushions echo the terracotta tones found throughout the home. Simultaneously, the black-and-white geometric rug anchors the space with artistic contrast. Sculptural vases and art books on the nesting tables turn the coffee zone into a mini gallery. Finally, a tripod floor lamp adds a hint of the mid-century modern style. Just beyond, the kitchen continues the warm color story with matte terracotta cabinetry, subtly ribbed for texture, paired with light oak base cabinets and a speckled grey stone backsplash. Minimalist black fixtures and hardware offer a graphic element, while open sightlines between the kitchen and living room create a seamless flow. Tucked between clean lines and creamy walls, the dining area feels like a serene art gallery moment. The rounded table and boucle chairs add softness, while playful wall art and sculptural lighting add whimsy. Whether it’s morning coffee or a dinner chat, this corner makes everyday dining feel curated. This bedroom is anchored by a mix of rust, navy, and marigold. The bold textiles and striped pillows create a dynamic rhythm, while the geometric wall art adds visual interest. Crisp white bedding keeps the look fresh, and the floating nightstands with sculptural vases save floor space while adding functionality. This bedroom features a grid-style mirror that expands the space visually. Bold, framed art pieces inject personality. The color-blocked bedding and folk-style throw hint at global influences, while the adjacent workspace, with its woven baskets and sculptural decor, adds functionality. The bathrooms in the Rustline Home blend warm terracotta vanities with white sinks and black fixtures. Stone-textured tiles add depth, while round mirrors and curated accents keep the look soft and modern. Thoughtful touches, like framed prints and rolled towels, make these spaces feel calm and creative.",
