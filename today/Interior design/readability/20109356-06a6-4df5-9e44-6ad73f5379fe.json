  "text": "Pebble returns as Core 2 Duo smartwatchThe Pebble announces its return as the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 smartwatches. Still developed by the original founder, Eric Migicovsky, the devices faithfully follow the design DNA of their predecessors. In the founders’ new podcast named Tick Talk, Eric Migicovsky even showcases the real-life model of the Core 2 Duo smartwatch before it starts shipping in July 2025. The video shows the accessory featuring a 1.26-inch black and white e-paper display. It runs over 10,000 apps and watchfaces from the Pebble OS, and the frame is polycarbonate and available in white or black. It is water resistant, targeting IPX8, and comes with a microphone. Even with its monochrome display, it still tracks steps and sleep. Overall, the device uses a standard 22mm watchstrap. We’ve looked into the backstory of the Pebble earlier in 2025. A few months later, Eric Migicovsky has finally unveiled his new company, Core Devices, alongside the return of his invention in the form of Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 smartwatches.all images courtesy of Core Devices (Pebble)Personal device that features waterproof speaker designIn his first podcast episode, the inventor and founder says that the Core 2 Duo smartwatch is under testing when it comes to its software. It runs on PebbleOS, which Google has released as open source, but he says not all the features are functional. So far, the real-time clock is not yet enabled, so the time is not displayed. The design team is working on implementing the Pebble recovery firmware at the moment and in time for the delivery. This means that they’re writing the drivers for the vibrating motor, backlight, and accelerometer. Progress is tracked on GitHub, given that PebbleOS is open source. At the present time, Bluetooth is functional, and watch faces perform well. They’re also testing some classic watch faces, including one by Ash and Sliding Text by Andrew Witty. For the standard silicone strap, there’s a strap keeper included. The rear of the Core 2 Duo smartwatch is similar to Pebble 2, plus the tape on the back is structural as the device is not glued. The speaker hole is visible on the back, featuring a waterproof speaker design. The charger connector is also the same as previous Pebble devices, with a USB-C to Pebble connector dongle included for charging instead of a cable. The dongle attaches magnetically to the back and can be carried on a keychain. The battery life is expected to be long, reducing the need for frequent charging. the smart accessory features a 1.26-inch black and white e-paper displayit runs over 10,000 apps and watchfaces from the Pebble OSleft: Core Time 2; right: Core 2 Duo Smartwatchthe Core Time 2 has a colored e-paper screenrear view of the devices with a magnetic charger port",
