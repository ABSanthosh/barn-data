  "text": "Studio Peipei’s glaze reuses dust, eliminating common additivesGerman Studio Peipei produces recycled glaze for ceramics by repurposing sawdust as its primary ingredient. The project addresses waste by transforming up to 40 tons of unused stone dust per month from various production sites into a valuable resource. The ceramics industry typically consumes large amounts of different raw materials, but this innovative glaze adapts to various types of stone, creating new colors and structures with each batch. Transparency and gloss vary with the type of clay, mixing ratios, and processing methods, keeping the glaze exciting and consistent. Over three years, the studio has refined a recipe that works with nearly every type of stone, continually sampling materials and adjusting the formulation as needed. Studio Peipei’s glaze eliminates the need for common additives like quartz sand, metal oxides, and stabilizers, as stones naturally contain enough quartz. all images courtesy of Studio Peipeidust from sagrada familia’s figurines is recycled in the glazeWhen sawdust from the Dichtl company, located 60 kilometers from Munich-based Studio Peipei, is in short supply, they use dust from stone craftsmen Barbany Artesans in Barcelona, including the dust from the figures that adorn the Sagrada Familia. The preparation process is highly efficient, as the water required for processing is already pressed out of the stone dust during production, minimizing energy consumption and simplifying production. The formula adapts to the natural fluctuations in stone materials, ensuring consistent quality. Certified for daily-use items and tiles, the glaze provides a sustainable alternative to traditional resources that are often mined, shipped, and processed globally. Currently, the design studio produces from one to two tons of recycled glaze per month, with the potential to scale production as needed. material-based Studio Peipei produces recycled glaze for ceramics by repurposing sawdustpackaging and test bags follow the eco-friendly conceptStudio Peipei extends its commitment to sustainability by focusing on eco-friendly packaging. The small test bags are made from uncoated, 100% recycled paper, also incorporating stone dust residues. The associated labels are printed on leftover stock from large and local printing companies that would otherwise be discarded, in collaboration with Papier Retter. The labels are produced with the help of The Happy Club, a local risography studio that employs one of the most sustainable printing processes using plant-based colors. Larger packaging bags are sewn from old tarpaulins and advertising banners, emphasizing their effort to rethink product life cycles. Though they attempted to establish a deposit system to promote a packaging cycle, reusable systems are not yet widely adopted outside Germany, and customer participation has been limited.
