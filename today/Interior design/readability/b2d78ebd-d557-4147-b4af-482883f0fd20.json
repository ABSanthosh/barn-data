  "description": "It’s hard to believe this impressive family home was born out of a simple post-war cottage. The owners had moved from Melbourne to Queensland with a vision of building their sustainably designed forever home, with beautiful valley views of the Sunshine Coast. Maytree Studios managed to maximise space and minimise waste by reincorporating the old asbestos-ridden structure into an innovative new house, immersed in nature.",

  "text": "When owners Maryanne and Nyall moved their family from Melbourne to Queensland, they purchased a post-war cottage on a lush 1.5-acre block on the Sunshine Coast. While the location was completely picturesque, the home itself was in disrepair, with an undercroft filled with asbestos. But rather than knock down their existing home, the couple engaged Maytree Studios for a more creative renovation, in hopes of turning the old structure into an idyllic forever home fit for their family — with two kids, a dog, and chickens in tow. ‘The dwelling sat as an isolated object in the landscape with no front, back or formal sense of arrival,’ Maytree Studios director and architect Andy Keeffe says. ‘The decision to reuse the existing home was a key aspect of the project — we saw its potential. The house had a solid timber hardwood frame, hardwood floors, and concrete posts, which were all valuable elements that formed the foundation for our design.’ The cottage’s upper level was transformed into a dedicated bedroom wing, as downstairs became an open-plan rumpus room. This allowed them to focus most of the budget on a new kitchen, dining, and living pavilion, which follows the natural slope of the land to feel immersed in the landscape. Inside, the material palette of blonde plywood and concrete floors creates a warm and relaxed atmosphere. ‘A carefully crafted hallway and staircase along the edge of the old and new seamlessly links the two areas,’ Andy says. ‘As you move between spaces, curated views are gradually revealed, enhancing the experience of connection and discovery throughout the home.’ In contrast to the cottage’s cement construction, the new elements of the house are clad in timber, complemented by spotted gum decking that leads down to an above-ground pool, where the owners can swim overlooking the horizon. Designing the house to withstand Queensland’s harsh climate — without blocking the stunning views — was another challenge. Double-glazed windows and a 2.1m-high eave extending over the width of the verandah provide shade, aided by the canopy of a newly planted jacaranda tree. ‘The result is a beautifully balanced indoor-outdoor experience,’ Andy says. ‘The home remains cool with minimal air-conditioning, thanks to the shading and breezes from the valley. ‘The family often spends time outdoors on the grassy area under the jacaranda, reading or napping — a perfect harmony of design and nature.’",
