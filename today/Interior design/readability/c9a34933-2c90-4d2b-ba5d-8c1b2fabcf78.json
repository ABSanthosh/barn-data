  "text": "There’s a new place to stay when exploring NSW’s Yass Valley. Located about 45 minutes north of Canberra you’ll find Yarrh Wines —  a vineyard and winery established in 1997 by husband and wife Fiona Wholohan (winemaker) and Neil McGregor (farmer). The property features their corrugated iron cellar door connected to a rammed earth winery, and the owners’ private residence. Now you can extend your stay at Yarrh Wines at one of two new tiny houses on site designed in collaboration by McShane Studio and Cubby and Co. The compact and sustainably-designed homes are an extension of Yarrh Wines’s ‘light touch’ approach. The two 19.2 square metre cabins — nicknamed Mawson and Kira — are technically tiny homes, but with a surprisingly spacious feel due to their defined bedrooms (no fold-down beds), kitchens, and bathrooms. Cooking enthusiasts are encouraged to visit the Kira cabin, which features a central 1.5m concrete island bench and integrated farmhouse-style sink, while the Mawson cabin is primarily designed for relaxation with its classic kitchenette and L-shaped lounge area. Both cabins are designed to capture views of the property through large windows and wraparound outdoor decks that extend the living space. Materials including natural stone, hardwood timber, and micro cement serve as a durable base and reflection of the landscape beyond. ‘These materials were carefully selected to withstand frequent use, develop a rich patina, and evoke a sense of history over time, ensuring the cabins remain both functional and captivating for years to come,’ says, Bridget McShane, director of McShane Studio. Director of Cubby and Co, Erin Wilson, adds, ‘Both Mawson and Kira embrace their unique materiality and design, creating spaces that are as thoughtful as they are timeless.’ Book your stay at Yarrh Wines’s tiny homes here",
