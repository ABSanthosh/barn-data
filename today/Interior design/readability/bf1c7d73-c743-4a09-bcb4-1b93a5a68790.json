  "text": "When it comes to kitchen appliances, I’m not very particular with the design of these items, as long as they are functioning as they should. I am also not that great of a cook and kitchen user so they don’t need to be pretty or even matching since I’m just using them when I need them. But there are a lot of well-designed and well-matched appliances that you can add to your well-stocked kitchen and cooking area. Electric kettles are one of those things that I have but I don’t really think about how I’m using it, as long as it turns my water hot enough. Designer: Nendo for Alessi Toru is Alessi’s new collection of kitchen appliances designed by Japanese brand Nendo. The name means “through” in Japanese and the collection features black tube-like elements running through the different items. The kettle is the first item in the collection and it matches Alessi’s metalworking techniques. It looks like a typical stainless-steel pitcher but how it’s designed is what makes it a bit different than your typical water kettle. Normally, a kettle is gripped from the side but this time, this household object is turned into a symbol of art. The Toru kettle has a top-suspended shape so you can lift it more easily from the base. You can hold the upper part of the handle and tilt the kettle to pour the water into your cup or bowl and it should pour out smoothly as you tilt it lightly. When you’re boiling the water, the base has an integrated appearance with its soft form. When you detach the kettle and ready for pouring, it takes on a straight and simple silhouette. The handle becomes a spout, softening the metallic material as water courses through it. The Toru collection also has other kitchen appliances, including a juicer, toaster, warmer grill, toaster racks. Of course all of them have the stainless steel look that matches Alessi’s and Nendo’s aesthetics. The minimalist look can match a lot of kitchen designs, especially those that want to go for that kind of refined look that only silver appliances can give.",
