  "description": "Whirlpool's new Spin\u0026Load Dishwasher Rack is designed to improve accessibility. The lower-level rack can rotate a full 360 degrees, making it easier for those with mobility issues to access all parts of it. You don't have to buy a new Whirlpool machine just to get the rack; it can be retrofitted into 24\" wide machines made by Amana, JennAir, KitchenAid, Maytage and Whirlpool. A complete list of model compatibility is here.The product grew out of an internal initiative known as AVID (Awareness of Visible and Invisible Disabilities), whereby company interns engaged in a design competition to create a more inclusive product. Company engineers then ran with the winning design, collaborating with the United Spinal Association for feedback, as well as conducting separate user testing. This design is a great example of a company pushing farther, of their own initiative, to solve more people's problems. With any luck, competitors will take note and end users will benefit.The Spin\u0026Load rack is available for $150.",
