  "text": "Mars on Earth, designed by Oli Moskalets, is a design concept inspired by space. In this small apartment (available for renting) in Spain, we see cosmic inspiration meeting grounded minimalism. This isn’t science fiction; it’s a sensory experience rooted in rich terracotta tones, sculptural silhouettes, and deep wood finishes. The interior feels like a warm embrace from another planet—inviting, bold, and impossibly calming. Mars on Earth was born from the idea of translating the raw Martian landscapes into a sanctuary that’s livable. As such, we see the line between architecture and atmosphere blurring. A special mention for the red marble accents, which reflect planetary terrain. The end result is a space that feels timeless, elemental, and just a little bit otherworldly. The living area of Mars on Earth is anchored by a curvaceous rust-toned sectional. The space invites deep lounging while making a sculptural statement. Floor-to-ceiling drapes in a matching hue partition the space. Simultaneously, dark wood paneling and soft lighting add warmth and depth. A spherical-legged side table and abstract vases add an artistic touch. Tucked beside the living area, the workspace in Mars on Earth blends focus with mood. A streamlined dark wood desk anchors the nook. This is paired with a minimalist chair. A bold, textural lamp adds rhythm, while a black vase with delicate branches softens the geometry. It’s a space designed for slow mornings, vinyl afternoons, and intentional pauses. At the heart of Mars on Earth lies a striking open-plan kitchen and dining space. This is grounded by a monumental red marble island that commands attention. The natural veining of the stone evokes Martian landscapes, while minimalist black stools add contrast and clarity. Flanked by warm wooden cabinetry and backed by more red marble, the space is equal parts gallery and gathering place. A special mention for the stainless steel sink diversifying textures. A low-profile platform bed, anchored by a warm upholstered headboard, invites rest without distraction in the bedroom. We see a terracotta bench continuing the theme seen in the living area. Flanking the bed, twin sculptural lamps with textured terracotta bases stay true to the room’s palette—soft browns, dusty neutrals, and earthy reds. The palette is monochromatic but never monotonous. Textural play—from the grain of the wall panels to the matte plaster finish—adds quiet richness. Facing the bed, a floor-to-ceiling window frames the natural landscape, blurring the boundaries between indoors and out. It’s a room made for silence, softness, and stargazing.",
