Find the 28 statement pieces we’re loving right now from our Design Directory below, along with some styling inspiration.",

  "text": "You know those spaces that feel full of personality from the moment you arrive? It’s probably because they had some great statement pieces that made the interiors come to life. Think something colourful, textural, or anything that draws your eye and adds a bit of flair. They don’t have to be loud. In fact, the best designers and stylists know how to pepper expressive furniture or unique lighting into a room without overwhelming the space. A great way to do this is by picking pieces that feel harmonious. For example, the glossy red Carimate Armchair from Cult ties in beautifully with the red ring of the Ingo Maurer Floatation Suspension Lamp from Space Furniture to create a dreamy dining setting. Something bold like Loom’s 7287 Moroccan Beni Youss Rug is also perfect for those who want to play with colour, as you can use the rug’s textural pattern to guide the colour palette of your decor — styling it with artworks and objects that feature similar pink, brown, and blue hues. Or, you might prefer to select a singular hero piece that either contrasts or compliments the rest of the interiors. We love how the sleek the Stainless Steel Coffee Table by Tigmi adds a refreshing modern accent to a simple backdrop of white walls and timber joinery. The paper construction of the Akari UF3-Q lamp from In Good Company is another special piece that quietly draws your attention with its delicate materiality. Curved forms also help inject character into a room. The velvet Mimi Bench from Fenton \u0026 Fenton and BoConcept’s Imola Swivel Armchair both feature strong silhouettes that would provide intrigue and functionality to a neglected corner of the living room or hallway. Plus, there’s a reason the Ligne Roset Togo Large Settee from DOMO is one of the most coveted statement pieces of all-time. The sofa is famous for its slouchy, low-slung structure, and with so many colours and fabrications to choose from, it works in almost every space! Want to see more?
