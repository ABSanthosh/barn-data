HAPPY VALENTINE’S DAY! I’m just popping in with an apology and a GIVEAWAY for you! Part of what I love about blogging and sharing my home online has always been the connections that happen when you share a bit of your life and in return, people share theirs with you! I’ve always appreciated the shared moments that happen, just like this quote: “Friendship … is born at the moment when one says to another “What! You too?” ― C.S. Lewis But lately the blog has been quiet so I want to apologize for that. For the last few years I’ve received many emails from my blog readers who were were having trouble leaving comments here. It was frustrating (only a rare few were still able to comment!) but this week my site developer has figured out the cause and resolved it. I’ve appreciated that many of you who weren’t able to comment still took the time to email me to ask questions or leave sweet messages about my posts. That has meant a lot to me! Yet that’s not the experience I want my friends to have here. This year I will be celebrating 18 years of blogging– I remember the early days when the comment section felt like a community! I miss that. :) I know readers enjoy connecting with others and reading their experiences too, so having the comments working is helpful for everyone. So now that comments are fixed (fingers crossed!) I would LOVE to hear from you! Leave a comment on today’s post below, and as a thank you for testing out the comment option, I will choose 3 of you at random to send a coffee card so you can treat yourself or send you a signed copy of one of my books (your choice!). Tell me in your comment where you’re from and how long you’ve been reading here or what you enjoy about The Inspired Room! I’d love to hear from you! Comment below to enter!",
