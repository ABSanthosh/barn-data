The embedded chess pieces are ceremoniously unveiled, evoking the sense of occasion synonymous with the arrival of a Rolls-Royce motor car. Generous spacing around the chess board enhances the game's theatrical allure, while the use of the finest materials, hand-fitted veneer, and polished details echo the superior craftsmanship found in Rolls-Royce interiors.\" The pieces are hidden away beneath the surface of the board:A push-to-open drawer on either side contains extra queens, for when you manage to get a pawn all the way across the board.Each piece and each square contains a perfectly centered magnet, allowing you to avoid the problematic piece-creep that bedevils so many chess players. As far as I can tell, you don't have to buy a Rolls-Royce car to buy the chess set. Mother's Day is coming up, so if yours appreciates faceted polished stainless steel chess pieces with a ceramic cladding and choosing between exotic veneers and leathers, well, you're welcome.",
