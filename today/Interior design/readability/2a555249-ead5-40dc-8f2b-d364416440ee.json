  "description": "Interior stylist Belle Fearon and Jake Weston moved from Paddington to Avalon Beach for a slower pace of life, including daily beach visits. They searched for an original weatherboard cottage retaining its ‘beach shack’ essence, and found it in this sun-filled home. Since then, it’s been summer holidays year-round for the couple and their regular guests. They’ve made only small DIY updates to the property so far, adding character to the relaxed interiors through lighting and eclectic styling.",

  "text": "A location within walking distance of the beach was the only non-negotiable for interior stylist Belle Fearon and Jake Weston’s home. They found this and more in an Avalon Beach weatherboard cottage, featuring green views from every room, and relaxed interiors ready for Belle’s eclectic styling stamp. ‘Visiting the house for the first time, we both felt it was just such a sun-filled, happy home,’ says Belle. ‘It’s such a special spot. You’re completely engulfed by nature in most directions and there are so many beautiful walks and hikes close by. There’s a big surf culture and a lot of artists/creatives live here, which I think creates that friendly, eclectic neighbourhood feeling… ‘It definitely has a sweet small town vibe.’ Belle and Jake have made only small DIY updates since moving in to personalise the interiors with colour and warmth. The ‘wild amount’ of downlights were the first thing to go, making way for pendants and handmade wall lights that add interest and ambience. ‘We much prefer softer, warmer sources of lighting from lamps, pendants, and wall lights,’ explains Belle. ‘My aim is to one day have no downlights!’ The central living room fireplace was also modified, removing cold stone cladding in favour of a more refined olive tile border, with storage boxes on either side. Custom banquette seats made by Belle’s mum, as well as books and sentimental artwork add another layer of sophisticated colour. The crisp white walls and light timber floors allow Belle’s furniture collection to come to the forefront. She has a weakness for chairs (‘I’ve been placed on a one-in-one-out chair ban!’) and the clean lines of Danish furniture that sit quietly within the space. No matter how busy life gets, Belle and Jake’s home is a place to recharge. The living room is bathed in sun throughout the day, creating a warm backdrop to unwind and connect. ‘We both feel completely relaxed at home. It’s like our own little nirvana,’ says Belle. ‘Friends and family who love to come and stay for the weekend tend to say it feels like a summer holiday, all year round.’",
