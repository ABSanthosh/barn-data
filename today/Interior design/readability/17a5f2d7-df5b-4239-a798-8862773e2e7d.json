  "text": "aatismo’s Form of Existence collection at SaloneSatellite 2025AATISMO presents Form of Existence, a collection of four sculptural lighting and furniture pieces exploring the emergence of form and structure. The collection examines the transition from formlessness to defined existence, drawing from organic processes and natural evolution. The works will be exhibited at SaloneSatellite 2025, Booth B014 at Milan Design Week.AATISMO’s design concept traces life’s transition from a primordial state to structured form and function. Light appears in darkness, matter takes form, and elements assemble to create order. The collection reflects these transformations, translating them into material compositions and spatial arrangements.all images by Shinya Sato unless stated otherwiseTetra lounge chair and Terra low table shape geometric forms Tetra is a lounge chair composed of four interdependent units, each shaped to provide structural support when combined. The design by creative studio AATISMO relies on mutual reinforcement, allowing the individual components to achieve stability together. The assembly reflects a modular approach, where discrete forms establish a collective structure, emphasizing balance and interaction in furniture design.Terra incorporates Oya stone, a volcanic tuff from Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, in its tabletop. Natural voids within the stone, often considered unsuitable for commercial use, are filled with a composite of liquid acrylic resin and gypsum powder, enhancing both structural integrity and visual contrast. The surface is polished to reveal intricate patterns formed over geological time. The composition reflects the interaction between natural formation and material intervention, bridging organic textures with functional application.Tetra is a lounge chair relying on interdependent structural unitscore and seed sculptural lighting pieces use glass and metalCore features a spherical glass element that functions both as a structural and luminous centerpiece. The design is inspired by microscopic life forms, with a glass sphere acting as a lens to diffuse light onto a frosted glass disc below. Fine wires extend from a supporting ring, balancing the composition and creating a suspended effect. The design emphasizes equilibrium and weightlessness, enhancing the interaction between light and space.Seed is a portable lighting object with a translucent disc surface supported by a semicircular metal frame. The surface diffuses warm light, while the frame provides structural support and serves as a handle for transport or wall mounting. The design allows flexible placement, either resting on the floor or suspended. Inspired by the dispersal of plant seeds, the piece is designed to adapt to different environments, extending illumination across varied spaces.four distinct components combine to provide balance and stability | image by AATISMOthe design emphasizes modularity and mutual reinforcementdiscrete forms establish a collective structure, emphasizing balance and interaction",
