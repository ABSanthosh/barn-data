  "text": "It’s always fun seeing what lies behind a period cottage facade. From the outside, the white-picket fence and single-fronted exterior of this Brighton home is as traditional as they come. This charm continues when you step inside, but the original residence has been recently reimagined by local architectural and construction firm Mckimm. Both the owner and Mckimm director Danica Garizio were eager to maintain and celebrate the architecture’s elegance in the renovation. ‘The home had classic elements such as intricate timber detailing, ceiling roses, a stone-arched hallway, original timber doors, Baltic pine flooring in the bedrooms, and ornate open fireplaces,’ Danica says. They decided to restore the front of the house, in addition to installing new parquetry timber flooring, lighting, and stone around the existing fireplaces. The rear, however, is what needed a real refresh. The living and dining room were combined to create one open-plan space, enhancing the ‘flow’ of movement and natural light throughout the floor plan. ‘Our team aimed to create a space that feels open and airy, bringing in natural light wherever possible,’ Danica adds. Soft, circular skylights were cut into the hallway and bathrooms, enhancing the new curved walls crafted from polished plaster. ‘The greatest challenge of this project was finding the right balance between preserving the heritage aspects of the home, while modernising the space to meet the client’s contemporary needs,’ Danica says. ‘The key was to create a seamless transition between the old and the new.’ In the extension, terrazzo flooring helps set the tone for the updated kitchen and sun-filled living room primed for entertaining. A palette of natural stone, timber joinery, and sheer linen curtains combine to create the sophisticated interiors. The resulting home now feels inviting and fresh, without overshadowing the cottage’s original beauty.",
