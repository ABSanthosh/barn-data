  "text": "the splash lab turns bathrooms into creative expression The Splash Lab, a design-forward brand based in Los Angeles and London, has made a name for itself by transforming something as utilitarian as a bathroom into an opportunity for creative expression. Specializing in washroom products and modular systems for corporate, commercial, public, hospitality, and leisure spaces, the brand collaborates closely with architects and designers to achieve a balance between high creative standards and modern functional needs. Their ongoing research into the perfect public bathroom experience reveals a growing preference for sleek, spacious designs featuring high-quality materials, touchless technology, and hidden plumbing – all hallmarks that define The Splash Lab’s core ethos of enhancing aesthetics and usability.reimagining public washrooms with customizable, modern fixtures | all images courtesy of The Splash Labwashrooms that consider everyoneFor too long, restrooms have been an afterthought in design, despite being some of the most used spaces. The Splash Lab aims to change this narrative by rethinking how hygiene rituals could be transformed into creative opportunities. Guided by the inspiring principle, ‘necessity drives invention,’ the brand approaches restroom design with four key pillars in mind: inclusivity, innovation, sustainability, and holistic design. From foot baths for religious rituals to wheelchair-accessible features, their adaptable approach ensures a positive experience for all users, regardless of age, gender, or ability, and even extends to customizing products for cultural practices, letting everyone feel considered. ‘We have, for example, made small tweaks to the height and splash back of the Monolith basin to create a custom footbath,’ says Amanda King, London-based spokesperson for the brand. ‘Offering multi-faith washroom facilities keeps institutions particularly competitive as they are more attractive to international students or talent. The modularity of the Monolith basin allows us to change small aspects of it (the length, the countertops, back, mounting height, access, connection to pipework) without threatening the integrity of the design, so the product remains rigorously tested and carrying the correct approvals.’modernized washroom of PennyHill Park in Surrey, featuring a custom Monolith basinadding custom value to restroomsKey to their success is early collaboration with architects. A pivotal moment for the brand was their work on Apple’s headquarters with Foster + Partners, where custom washroom fixtures became sculptural elements within the overall design. This partnership proved that even the simplest utilities could make a visual impact, adding value to the entire space. Their approach continues to inspire with projects like the washrooms of One Saint Paul’s Square, where the Aerofoil basin – a striking technical feat – floats on the wall like a shard, in a sleek black marble-like finish. This design meets the aesthetic and functional goals set by architects GPAD, ensuring harmony between the washrooms and the building’s lobby and common areas.The Splash Lab’s modular systems offer flexible solutions that adapt to various architectural styles and user needsMeanwhile, at PennyHill Park in Surrey, The Splash Lab worked with designer Monia Allegretti to modernize the washrooms of the hotel and spa. The solution combines the custom Monolith basin with elements from the award-winning Ribbon collection, integrating sensor-operated facilities that solve the issue of water spilling and trailing across floors while preserving the historic property’s stately elegance.By embedding flexibility and modularity into their product collections, The Splash Lab helps architects and designers realize washrooms that are more than just functional – they’re part of a building’s identity. Their thoughtful approach contributes to the overall design narrative, adding both quality and a user-friendly experience to every project.",
