Each piece, designed by the creative duo of Lionel Dinis Salazar and Jonathan Omar, showcases the intersection of history, craftsmanship, and contemporary design, revealing the profound relationship between light and material. Exhibited at ToolsGalerie in Paris, Néophore focuses on the shapes of ancient jars and amphorae, reinterpreting them as light containers through the use of ceramic and a specific enamel. The light source becomes the essence of the concept: like a material to transport, it guides the form of the container, inspiring new uses and new objects.all images by Ophélie MaurusDöppel Studio experiments with light, form, and materialThis exploration of contrast between neon light and terracotta led Döppel Studio’s designers to collaborate with Aliénor Martineau of Alma Mater, a ceramicist specializing in creating enamel based on natural minerals, to design a custom enamel. Blending amphora, lamp, and container, the exhibition invites visitors to discover a collection of atypical pieces that highlight, through the object, both the usage and measurement systems of ancient civilizations, as well as the cult of Prometheus (the fire), and, quite obviously, light—translucent or overflowing—as a material in its own right.
