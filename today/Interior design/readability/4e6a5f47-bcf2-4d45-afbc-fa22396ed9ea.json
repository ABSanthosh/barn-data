  "description": "These StakeLights are by Washington-based camping gear company UCO. They're tent pegs with a built-in LED light, meant to make it easier to set up a tent in the dark. They also make it easier to locate your tent at night, like when you're returning from a midnight call-of-nature answering.The LEDs can be removed from the stakes, if you need a portable light in a pinch. They're perhaps better suited to car campers, as opposed to those hiking in with everything on their backs; the stakes weigh 37 grams apiece (as opposed to the 10-15 grams your average tent peg weighs), and that's without the AAA battery each stake requires, another potential hassle. That said, they'll put out 17 lumens of light for up to 10 hours. They can also be set to strobe for up to 24 hours, if you're in an emergency situation. They're sold in 4-packs that run $25.",
