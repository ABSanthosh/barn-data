  "text": "Who says tiny can’t be functional, stylish, and endlessly inviting? In the heart of Bulgaria is this beautifully designed tiny home by Rawan Khaled—proof that less can truly be more. With a footprint that prioritizes efficiency, this space is tailored for modern living. Whether you’re a minimalist, a traveler, or a renter looking for smart design solutions, get inspired by this tiny home in Bulgaria. This (tiny) living room shows us how small spaces can feel open, airy, and stylish, too! The clever spatial planning is paired with a neutral color palette and soft textures. A compact yet expansive sectional takes center stage. Paired with this is a geometric coffee table, which adds visual interest. Its material is smoked and translucent, adding to the airy vibe of the space. The skylight-style windows are large enough to welcome plenty of natural light. Even then, we see a small lamp in the cozy corner, illuminating your favorite book as you read it. Right next to the living space is the kitchen, gently segregated with a light oakwood dining table that also doubles as the kitchen island. This is perfect for two to enjoy an intimate dinner under a conical Japandi-style pendant light. The cabinetry in the kitchen is sleek and hardware-less, adding to the airy vibe. We love the undercabinet lighting adding visual interest as well as functionality. The bedroom is light and airy with a beige color palette. The headboard is tall with a chevron pattern. This guides the eye upwards and creates the illusion of more height. Sleek custom cabinetry is fit right under the loft ceiling, making sure residents can tuck away and organize their essentials. An accent chair and a smoked glass table create a cozy seating area. The bathroom in the tiny house continues the beige color palette. A wall-mounted toilet keeps the floor empty, creating a sense of airiness. Luxury is added to the bathroom interior with a sleek vanity and matte black hardware. The bathroom goes big on organization with the backlit recessed shelving, where bottles and toilet rolls can be placed. There’s also room for closed storage.",
