Curated by Alexis Del Toro and Jorge Diego Etienne, the exhibition brings together over 6o designers to transform these everyday objective through diverse materials, techniques, and cultural narratives. Their interpretations range from explorations of artisanal techniques to experimentations with new technologies, ranging from ceramics to biomaterials. Highlights include a flippable hammer-shaped vessel, a modular kit that invites personalization to the seasoning experience, and a duo of whimsical tabletop character companions.all images courtesy of DECODEover 60 designers reimagine the humble culinary companionsSalt and pepper have long held pivotal roles in gastronomy and culture. Salt was indispensable for food preservation, while pepper, often referred to as ‘black gold,’ symbolized luxury and trade power. Their pairing in French cuisine during the 17th century marked a significant turning point, establishing their role as essential table companions. DECODE’s exhibition takes inspiration from this rich history, challenging designers to interpret salt and pepper shakers beyond their utilitarian purpose. These objects, central to the dining experience, become tools of personalization, reflecting traditions, social status, and individuality.The featured designers come from diverse disciplines and approaches, resulting in a dynamic collection of works. Some embrace regional craftsmanship, incorporating techniques such as ceramics, wood carving, and metalwork to root their creations in local traditions. Others take a more conceptual route, using the salt and pepper shakers to explore abstract themes such as cultural identity and duality. A recurring theme in many of the designs is material innovation, with pieces crafted from bioplastics, recycled metals, and 3D-printed ceramics. These approaches demonstrate how even the simplest objects can be transformed into symbols of progress, sustainability, and storytelling.the exhibition reinterprets salt and pepper shakers through innovative materials, techniques, and cultural narrativesdecode reconsiders the role of design in our everyday livesThe Sal \u0026 Pimienta exhibition reflects DECODE’s mission to elevate design as a cultural and economic force.
