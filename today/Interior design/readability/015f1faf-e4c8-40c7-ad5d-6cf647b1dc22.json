This tranquil resort, accessible only by sea, has partnered with Istanbul’s renowned contemporary art gallery, Galeri Bosfor, to present an exhibition that marries art and nature. The exhibition is divided into two parts: a white cube gallery space and a sculpture installation garden. Both spaces invite visitors to explore the vibrant interplay between artistic production and nature, particularly focusing on reactions to the warmth and brightness of the summer season.boutique resort Yazz Collective proudly hosts an immersive art exhibition from Istanbul-based contemporary art gallery, Galeri Bosfor | all images courtesy of Yazz Collectivea sanctuary for the SensesExclusively accessed by boat and completely distant from the city, Yazz Collective has positioned itself as more than just a luxury resort, incorporating contemporary art into its identity and standing out out as a destination where guests can enjoy both relaxation and creative inspiration. The Sanctuary’s commitment to environmental responsibility is woven into every facet of the design, from minimizing its ecological footprint to preserving the landscapes of Göcek-Fethiye. While immersed in the modern green architecture, guests are invited to enjoy refined living, stylish accommodations, a beach restaurant, and spa services. In 2024, Yazz Collective is collaborating with art gallery Galeri Bosfor (see here) for an exhibition that combines cultural engagement with the beauty of the Turkish Riviera, offering visitors an immersion into art as well as an exploration through the resort.the sustainability approach of Yazz Collective is deeply ingrained in every aspect of operationsGaleri Bosfor’s artistic exhibition curates the turkish RIVIERAThe exhibition unfolds in two distinct spaces: a traditional white-cube gallery and an open-air sculpture garden. These spaces invite guests to explore a rich dialogue between contemporary artistic expression and the natural world, with a particular focus on the radiant warmth of the summer season.
