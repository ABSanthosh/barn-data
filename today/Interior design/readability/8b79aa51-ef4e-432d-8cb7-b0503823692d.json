You can pour yourself a cup of tea, curl up and explore your cottage-by-the sea style in a whole new way. The If I Lived in a Cottage By the Sea Dreambooks are a not only a fun escape, you can use them as inspiration for your real home, no matter where you live. Come dream with me of a cottage by the sea! Each of the images in the Dreambooks are dreamed up and created by me with AI design tools, specifically for inspiration and dreaming! I love that they may be a little quirky, imperfect or even aspirational at times. To me, that’s part of the charm and dream of a cottage by the sea. This is the type of visual Dreambook I always dreamed of having for myself, so I’m thrilled to have created something that inspires others as much as it inspires me! It’s so fun to imagine ourselves at home in any of the spaces, kicking off sandy shoes and letting the sea breeze drift through open windows! Even though I now live in my own cottage by the sea, I still LOVE dreaming about them! In fact, it was through dreaming that I found my inspired style, long before my dream ever came true. The Dreambooks are not really about where you live, but how.
