  "text": "The AGE360 skyscraper in Curitiba, Brazil, is a model of innovative design by Triptyque Architecture and Architects Office. Its unique exterior is not just visually striking but also functional, featuring a concrete exoskeleton that offers structural support and maximizes interior space by eliminating the need for internal columns. Originally planned to reach 150 meters (492 feet), its height was reduced to 124 meters (406 feet) to comply with local planning laws. These regulations also led to the chamfering of the north and east sides, ensuring that essential views and sunlight are preserved for the surrounding areas. Designer: Triptyque Architecture and Architects Office Recalling the innovative design of Zaha Hadid Architects’ renowned Morpheus Hotel, this skyscraper is crafted with a unique structural approach, omitting traditional internal supports. Instead, the building relies solely on its central elevator and stair core to maintain its structural integrity. This intentional design choice creates a spacious and luxurious interior, offering open floor plans that enhance the living experience within the residences. These expansive layouts provide a sense of freedom and openness and also improve the panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, offering residents breathtaking vistas and a seamless connection with the environment outside. “The tower relies on a load-bearing facade, freeing the internal spaces from structural constraints and allowing total reversibility of layouts,” said Triptyque and Architects Office’s press release. “The structural grid is interrupted to accommodate collective spaces dedicated to sports and well-being, while its lightweight, fully glazed facade opens the interior spaces to panoramic views of Curitiba, thus connecting the residents to the outside world.” The interior of the building is thoughtfully designed to encompass a total of 36 floors dedicated entirely to residential spaces, providing ample living areas for its occupants. The building also features a dedicated amenities space located approximately 70 meters (229 feet) above ground level. This area is equipped with a variety of luxurious facilities, including an outdoor garden area that offers a refreshing natural retreat, a beautiful pool for relaxation, and a state-of-the-art spa and fitness center to cater to health and wellness needs. While it may be a stretch to label this massive concrete edifice as entirely sustainable, it does incorporate several environmentally conscious features. The building is fitted with solar panels that play a crucial role in reducing its overall electricity consumption from the grid. A sophisticated rainwater capture system is also integrated into the building’s infrastructure, ensuring that collected rainwater is utilized efficiently to irrigate the vegetation throughout the complex. These eco-friendly measures contribute to a more sustainable living environment, even within the confines of such a substantial concrete structure. Conceived in 2017 and completed over eight years, the project was developed by AG7 Realty, with interiors by Suite Arquitetura and landscape design by Renata Tilli Paisagismo.",
