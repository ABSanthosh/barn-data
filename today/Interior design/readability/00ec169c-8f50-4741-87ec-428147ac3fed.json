If you’ve been leaning into neutral tones like greige, you’re not alone, they’ve dominated the design world for years. But something newer appears to be taking the crown for the go-to kitchen color of the modern age. Is it something bolder, or just a new shade of neutral? Let’s find out. The Rise and Fall of Greige Greige, a blend of gray and beige, has long been a favorite for kitchens thanks to its adaptable nature. It’s a simple, easy-to-build upon base that can be paired with nearly any decor style, from modern to traditional, making it an obvious choice for homeowners seeking a clean, understated look. But as time has passed, greige has started to feel overused and a little too safe. Its muted tone can lack character, especially in spaces meant to feel lively and personal, which kitchens certainly can. Many people are finding that greige no longer delivers the warmth and energy they want in such an important space. While it’s far from disappearing completely, greige is slowly being edged out by more dynamic choices. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / puhimec Why Greige No Longer Fits The shift away from greige could reflect a larger desire for individuality and personality in home design. Neutral tones, while timeless, can sometimes feel overly generic, particularly in spaces that see as much use as the kitchen. During a time when people are spending more hours at home, there’s been a push to create spaces that feel inspiring and unique, two qualities that greige does not have. Many are now seeking something with more vibrancy and life—something that better represents their personal style. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / wolfhound9111 A New Theme So, what’s replacing greige as the more popular, or sought-after, kitchen color? It appears that green is quickly becoming the hot new color for kitchens. Shades of green are often associated with nature, so bringing it into the room of our home where we’re working with products of the earth (produce, herbs, and animal products) helps us feel connected with what we’re cooking, in a way. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / archideaphoto It’s also very flexible in its tones. Soft greens like sage or mint can brighten a room and make it feel more open, while darker greens like emerald or forest add a unique sense of richness. Unlike greige, green feels dynamic and alive, bringing an emotional lean that neutral tones often lack. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / puhimec How to Move to Green Incorporating green into your kitchen doesn’t have to mean a complete redesign. Start with small changes, such as adding a backsplash or updating your decor with green accents. The most common change is the switch to green cabinets, which you could paint yourself if you’re up for the project. It’s a color that pairs beautifully with natural wood, marble, and metallic finishes, making it easy to match with the other features or materials you’re already using. For those hesitant about bold greens, muted shades like olive or sage can be a more gentle introduction. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / archideaphoto Greige kitchens had their time, offering calm and simplicity when they were needed most, but as design trends evolve, green kitchens are really taking center stage, offering a new way for us to look at an experience time spent in our kitchens. Whether you’re ready for a full transformation or just want to dip your toes into the trend, green kitchens provide a refreshing update that’s both beautiful and surprisingly flexible.
