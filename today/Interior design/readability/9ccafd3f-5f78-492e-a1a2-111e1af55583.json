I found these cool \"Harry Potter\" candles last year and we absolutely fell in love with them. They are such a fun addition to our fall and Halloween decor this time of year. (But I think they could be carried through to the holidays easily!) Can you believe I've never seen any of the Harry Potter movies? I know! My sister and son chastise me often about that fact.Â  But because our son loves it so much, I grabbed these cool hanging candles last year. I immediately hung them in our foyer:Â  This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience. I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  We couldn't wait to get them back up this fall!Â  These particular floating ceiling candles come in a set of 12 and include fishing wire (the key to the floating look), the ceiling hooks with sticky pads and a very cool wand that turns them on and off. I changed the way I hung the candles this year, because the sticky hooks they come with took some drywall off when I removed them last year: I even used a hair dryer to try to loosen them up, and a few still did a bit of damage.Â  Obviously it isn't too noticeable, because I still haven't touched them up a year later. ;)Â  I double knotted the fishing wire around the pin and tightened it as well as I could. When you push the pin into the ceiling, it holds it secure. You don't see the pin at all! And I doubt I'll fill these holes later -- they're way too small to worry about. The newest version of these candles is even better, because there's a small hook in the \"flame\" of the candle to run the fishing wire through. Mine didn't have that so I wrapped the fishing string around the head of the flame instead, which has worked fine.Â  Mine hang just slightly off because of that, instead of perfectly up and down:Â  I kind of like that though! It makes them look like they are authentically floating. ðŸ˜‚ The drippy candle look of ours looks more realistic -- most of them I've found look more plain.Â  These Harry Potter inspired candles take two AA batteries each and last year they lasted for four weeks easy. We turn them on almost every evening.Â  The wand is just as fun as the candles: The candles are turned on and off with it and the tip glows when you push the buttons:Â  SO fun! What a cute, playful addition for this time of year!Â  I think ours are made for indoors only, but honestly I think they'd be fine on our covered porch where they wouldn't get rain or snow. They would look really cute in the DIY glowing witch hats I made years ago! The candles are actually quite pretty, I think they'd even look beautiful during the holidays. I may hang these from the Christmas tree this year. We love the warm, flickering light in the evenings:Â  Here are a few more \"Harry Potter\" floating candle options:Â  This set comes with 24 candles and the wand This set of 20 candles with wand has two options - flicker or steady - and can be set on a timer! These come in a set of 12 in black, ivory or white.Â  Aldi had a set that came out last year, hopefully they'll come back this month! Remember to take your batteries out when you store these away for next year.Â  Are you a big Harry Potter fan? Even if you've never seen the movies, these ceiling candles are a fun and whimsical decor accent for the fall season!Â  Share this",
