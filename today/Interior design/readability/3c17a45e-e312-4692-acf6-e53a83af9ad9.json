The project, led by renowned lighting designers Guido Bianchi and Nicoletta Rossi, brings out the finest details of this marble wonder, thanks to iGuzzini’s Sipario floodlight, a luminaire specifically designed to enhance artworks and cultural spaces.thanks to iGuzzini lighting, Michelangelo’s Pietà shines again in Saint Peter’s Basilica | images © Matteo De Mayda, all images courtesy of iGuzzini SIPARIO FLOODLIGHT DESIGNED FOR CULTURAL VENUES AND ARTWORKSDeveloped with a commitment to sustainable lighting that benefits both the environment and the preservation of art, iGuzzini’s Sipario floodlight brings advanced technology to cultural spaces. Its patented Opti Beam Reflector optics deliver clean, precise beams of light, highlighting every delicate detail of Michelangelo’s Pietà without glare or shadows. Light, compact, and energy-efficient, Sipario also features smart technology and eco-friendly materials, reflecting the company’s dedication to responsible lighting.To fully capture the emotional and visual impact of Michelangelo’s Pietà, iGuzzini’s Sipario floodlight offers four distinct lighting scenarios, each tailored to highlight different aspects of the sculpture and its surrounding environment. These scenarios – North, East, South, and West – are controlled via a KNX system, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on the Basilica’s needs.a new lighting design, conceived by designers Guido Bianchi and Nicoletta Rossi has been installed and entirely sponsored by IGuzzini IlluminazioneTAILORED LIGHTING SCENARIOS FOR MICHELANGELO’S ICONIC SCULPTUREsThe North scenario creates a balanced chiaroscuro effect, using Sipario floodlights mounted on pilasters to emphasize the sculpture’s plasticity and detail. The lighting enhances the harmony between individual elements, such as the folds of Mary’s robe and the expressive features of Christ, while also illuminating Giovanni Lanfranco’s frescoes on the central vault with subtle transitions of light.In contrast, the East scenario delivers a dramatic ‘light blade’ effect, casting a sharp beam across the Pietà from a floodlight mounted at an angle. This effect focuses on the serene, recumbent face of the Virgin Mary, while subtle reflections on the marble give the sculpture a striking emotional presence.the sculpture is lit with iGuzzini’s Sipario floodlight, a luminaire specifically designed to meet the lighting requirements of artworks, museum spaces, cultural venues and theatresFor larger events and ceremonies, the South scenario provides a brighter, more expansive lighting environment. Designed for clear visibility from the Basilica’s central nave, this scenario floods the sculpture with light, accentuating its contours while maintaining the delicate balance of the surrounding architectural elements.The West scenario, used for daily viewing, offers a more understated illumination. Track-mounted floodlights with narrow beams crisscross at symmetrical angles, softly highlighting the sculpture’s features and balancing the contrasts between light and shadow. This setting ensures that visitors, whether up close or viewing from afar, can appreciate the Pietà in its full splendor.the lighting design is fitted with patented Opti Beam Reflector optics, designed and produced in-house by iGuzzini",
