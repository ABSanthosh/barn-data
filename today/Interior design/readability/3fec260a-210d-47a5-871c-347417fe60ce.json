  "text": "Lisbon’s charm doesn’t come with fanfare—it’s tucked away in its winding alleys, its sunlit rooftops, and the clatter of its old trams scaling steep streets. The city rises and falls like a wave, offering glimpses of the Tagus River through breaks in the skyline. Standing at the Miradouro das Portas do Sol, you’re treated to a view that’s pure poetry: orange-tiled roofs spilling down hillsides, punctuated by the white of church towers and the occasional green of a courtyard. It’s the kind of scene that stays with you long after you’ve left. Capturing that feeling in LEGO is an idea that sneaks up on you. At first, it’s hard to imagine plastic bricks recreating something so alive. But “Lisbon, Framed” does exactly that, turning a fleeting moment into something tangible. Using a 48×64-brick frame, the build offers a cropped, painterly slice of the city as seen from Portas do Sol. Shades of yellow, orange, and red stack and overlap, mimicking sunlight glancing off rooftops, while clever brick techniques add just enough texture to feel authentic. Designer: liayaaaa The LEGO MOC (My Own Creation) designed by LEGO user ‘liayaaaa’ creates a sense of perspective only using flat 2D bricks, which is honestly remarkable. Most LEGO builds aim to recreate something in three dimensions—a towering castle, a bustling street, a spaceship ready for liftoff. But this one flattens the world, framing it like a photograph. It’s a bold choice, and it works. By narrowing the focus, the build becomes a window into Lisbon’s essence rather than a recreation of its details. It’s not about bricks; it’s about what those bricks make you feel. You can almost hear the clinking of glasses from a nearby café and the hum of a tram in the distance. That’s the magic of this piece. It captures not just the visual beauty of Lisbon but the mood, the atmosphere. It’s a build that tells a story without needing minifigures or moving parts. For LEGO enthusiasts, this creation is a reminder that the medium isn’t limited to playsets or models. It’s an art form, capable of inspiring nostalgia, curiosity, and joy. For anyone who’s stood at Portas do Sol—or dreamed of it—this piece taps into something deeply personal. And maybe that’s the most exciting part. “Lisbon, Framed” isn’t following trends or chasing after the biggest, most complex designs. It’s quieter, subtler, and in its way, far more impactful. If you’re the type to linger on details, to find beauty in simplicity, this is the kind of build that will speak to you. With over 1,600 supporters on the LEGO Ideas forum, the “Lisbon, Framed” set is slowly but surely inching towards the 10,000 vote mark. If and when it does, LEGO’s internal team will review/refine it before turning it into a box set. If you’re a LEGO or art enthusiast who’d love to build out this set, head over to the LEGO Ideas website and vote for this entry!",
