  "text": "It was clear from the start that this Megalong Valley home would be designed around its spectacular valley vistas. Located on a sprawling 67-hectare-paddock in the Blue Mountains, the architectural building cleverly spirals around a central axis, framing views of the landscape at every turn. But Adriana Interiors founder Adriana Logue says the owners — a professional couple — didn’t just want their dream build to capture the stunning scenery, they wanted to bring the calming atmosphere of nature inside the home. The brief was to enhance the 360-degree outlook, reflecting the unique perspective of each space in its interiors. ‘The clients wanted a moody yet intimate moment within each room you entered,’ Adriana says. ‘Minimal clutter was a big part of the direction.’ Almost every design choice was driven by the site itself, from the organic rammed earth walls to the polished terrazzo floors, as the charred-timber cladding on the exterior referenced the peeling bark of surrounding trees. This raw and earthy material palette also played a big part in the home’s styling. Adriana partnered with King Living’s trade program, King Trade, to find the perfect pieces from the Australian-owned furniture brand’s collections at exclusive trade discounts. With tailored advice from the King Living team, Adriana selected the Neo Bed for the guest bedroom and the Jasper Sofa upholstered in the luxurious Prestige Saddle leather — for a textural touch in the light-filled living room. ‘Darker leathers were used to contrast against greys and the Saddle leather embraced the redness of the tree bark outside and added warmth to the area,’ Adriana says. ‘The Jasper Sofa moulds perfectly [to your body] and the smell of the leather added to the feel of the room.’ In the secondary living room — dubbed ‘the retreat’ — you’ll find another Jasper Sofa lined in Eucalyptus Mint fabric. ‘The home predominantly uses dark and deep tones, but I wanted this space to have a lighter feel,’ Adriana adds. It’s the perfect spot for a nightcap or to read a book, enveloped by the soft sage tones of the sofa, while brass accents were used for quiet luxury and a pop of colour. And no matter where you are in the home, you feel a connection to the outdoors knowing you can look out the window and take in the magical, ever-changing environment.
