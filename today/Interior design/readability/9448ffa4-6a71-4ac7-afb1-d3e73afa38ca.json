  "description": "With a background in behavioral science, over a decade ago Vicki Tan became a product designer. (The UX kind, not the industrial design kind.) Over the years she's plied her trade at Google, Lyft, Spotify and is now the design lead at Pinterest. She's also corralled her design thinking skills and grasp of why people make the decisions they do into a book, called \"Ask This Book a Question.\" She describes it as \"An exploration into better decision making, grounded in the science of cognitive bias and the wisdom of storytelling.\"Ask This Book A Question arrives like a trusted friend, one who knows that decision making is less about unlocking secrets and more about understanding the quiet ways we navigate uncertainty. Through a series of visual prompts, the book maps the invisible geography of our minds – from our perception of time to our tendency to remember the bizarre over the familiar to the shortcuts we take when avoiding difficult truths.This book is a companion for anyone who has ever felt stuck under the weight of too many choices, offering a thoughtful way to sit with uncertainty and navigate life's most pressing questions. Why did a designer write a book about decision-making?Because no matter who we are, we all struggle to make choices that truly align with who we want to be. I've redesigned how we think about cognitive biases – not as flaws to fix, but as powerful tools for making more intentional, self-aware decisions.How can making decisions feel more playful?The book is made up of three parts: questions, stories, and biases.
