  "description": "One of my favorite things to do in every season is just putter around the house. In the winter, it’s an indoor rhythm—quiet and cozy. I’ll make a hot drink, light a candle, tidy up a corner or maybe move a few things around just to make the space feel a bit more inviting. It’s not about tackling a big project—it’s about being present and making the home feel better in small ways. In the summer, I’m still holding a warm mug (anyone else a hot coffee year-round person?), but the experience feels a little different. The doors are always open so a fresh coastal breeze comes through. I might step outside on a whim to clip herbs or snip some flowers, and come back in the kitchen to put them in a vase. While I'm there I might clear the counters or rearrange a shelf, but only if I'm inspired to. Most of the time I'm just puttering around the house, doing any small thing that makes me happy but also doing nothing in particular.",

Most of the time I’m just puttering around the house, doing any small thing that makes me happy but also doing nothing in particular. From: @homebodygatheringplace (follow along on Instagram or join us here) Puttering is not about productivity or getting things done. It’s more like a hobby or activity I look forward to. A slow ritual that helps me feel more at peace and connected to my home (and myself). People often ask, “What do you do for fun?” For me, this is it. :) Puttering. It’s simple, but it brings me joy. From @homebodygatheringplace (follow along on Instagram or join us here) puttering (verb): to occupy yourself in an unhurried, pleasant way with small tasks, without focusing on anything in particular. Whether it’s winter or summer, puttering always feels like time well spent! It’s like home therapy for a HomeBody like me! Are you a putterer, too? Click here for above sources",
