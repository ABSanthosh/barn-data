  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. I love everything about this time of year, especially the build-up and excitement of the arrival of fall. I recently read that the cozy and good vibes many of us love about the fall season can play a huge role in boosting our motivation. I am not sure about that, all I know is that when the calendar page turns to fall and we enter the “ber months” – you know the months of September, October, November, December, I become my happiest and most productive self. I think it has to do with being a home lover and enjoying the nesting process of making my home and life comfy and cozy. It’s still hot outside with no brrr factor yet, but that hasn’t stopped me from lighting candles in my living room, placing my collection of fur throws on the seating, baking bread and earlier this week letting a stew simmer on the stove all day. That and the bread I made for an easy and delish dinner that I can repeat on another night with the leftovers. Slow and easy = joy. As you can see I am eager to begin hunkering down for the season and making sure I am setting it up to be just right. I hope you have many things in your life right now that bring you joy. If not, it is very much worth the time to create the little rituals that make you happy. Now onto the inspiring links and ideas I found this week for you.
