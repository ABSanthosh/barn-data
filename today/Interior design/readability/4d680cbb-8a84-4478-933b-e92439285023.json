The design explores geometric repetition and motion within a minimal structure.The piece comprises three vertical circles functioning as wheels and one horizontal circle forming the tabletop. All four elements are identical in shape and size, establishing visual coherence and constructional simplicity. The table is capable of movement, with a swiveling rear wheel integrated to enable directional control, akin to the steering function of a rudder.rear wheel gently maneuvers Rolly through spaces like rudder on a boat | all images courtesy of Mike \u0026 MaaikeRolly’s design merges mobility with furniture functionalityA steel frame connects the components and supports the pivoting mechanism, enabling the piece to function as both a serving cart and a display surface. The wheels and tabletop are constructed from solid Ash or multi-ply wood with an Ash veneer finish.
