  "text": "The winners of the Dulux Colour Awards 2025 were revealed in a special event at the National Gallery of Victoria last night. Recognising the most inspired and transformative examples of colour use in the built environment, the prestigious awards selected just 10 winners from a shortlist of more than 88 projects. Sarah \u0026 Sebastian’s Armadale store by Richards Stanisich took home the top award, Australia’s Grand Prix, for its singular use of a striking green (Dulux Delta Break), juxtaposed with reflective silver accents. The shiny, jewel-like store also won the Commercial Interior – Workplace and Retail category. Meanwhile, an evocative house renovated by Pac Studio was awarded the New Zealand Grand Prix. The project called Lava Flow features a deep Dulux Murray Red on the ceiling and skylight of the building, inspired by Auckland’s volcanic landscape. ‘It never ceases to amaze us how conceptually courageous and strategically sophisticated the colour schematics are, year on year,’ Dulux colour and communications manager Andrea Lucena-Orr says. Rule-breaking colour usage was evident across all categories this year, with many projects showcasing how contemporary colour can transform a heritage home — seen best in the Residential Interior Winner, Elonera House by Studio Doherty. The Melbourne designers used soft hues of duck-egg blue, dusky pink and pale yellow to give an elegant Edwardian’s home a fresh and calming new feel. Inspiring hotel Melbourne Place by Kennedy Nolan, won the Commercial Interior – Public and Hospitality category, but the practice also received a commendation for its Rosherville House, which pairs warm timbers with chocolatey browns and cool blue-greens. 2025 Dulux Colour Awards Winners Grand Prix Australia Winner: Sarah \u0026 Sebastian Armadale by Richards Stanisich New Zealand Winner: Lava Flow by Pac Studio Residential Interior Winner: Elonera House by Studio Doherty Commendation: Lava Flow by Pac Studio Commendation: Rosherville House by Kennedy Nolan Commendation: Wharf House by Arent\u0026Pyke Residential Exterior Winner: Dunstan by SSdH Commercial Interior – Workplace and Retail Winner: Sarah \u0026 Sebastian Armadale by Richards Stanisich Commendation: Comma Byron Bay by Duet Commendation: Buon Gusto by Studio Shand Commercial Interior – Public and Hospitality Winner: Melbourne Place by Kennedy Nolan Commendation: Burly Bar by Studio Plenty Commendation: Auburn High School Senior Centre by WOWOWA Architecture Commercial and Multi-Residential Exterior Winner: Northern Memorial Park Depot by Searle x Waldron Architecture Commendation: Windale Hub by Adriano Pupilli Architects Temporary or Installation Design Winner: Carol Jerrems: Portraits by Youssofzay Hart AU Student Winner: Landscape of Co-existence by Angela Xu and Georgia Reader (University of Sydney) NZ Student Winner: Pātaka Kōrero / Fale o Tala, A Storehouse of Narratives in Samoa by Will Chomchoei (University of Auckland) See more from the Dulux Colour Awards here.",
