  "text": "A CELEBRATION TO REAFFIRM QUALITY WOODEN FURNITUREIn 2025, Pedrali marks a significant milestone, celebrating two decades since the establishment of its wooden furniture manufactory in Manzano, Italy. Located in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Chair District, this facility quickly became a crucible where iconic designs like Frida, Malmö, and Nemea were brought to life. These creations solidified Pedrali’s dedication to Italian know-how, quality craftsmanship, and a forward-thinking approach to sustainable design. Marking its 20th anniversary, the brand also introduces Griante, its first wooden chair specifically crafted for outdoor use, designed by CMP Design.

This approach, deeply integrated with a profound respect for natural resources and collaborative design, leads to products that are not only aesthetically compelling but also built for longevity and environmental responsibility – critical considerations for contemporary architectural and interior projects.This dedication to quality and regional expertise stems from a clear vision articulated by the company‘s leadership. As Monica Pedrali, CEO of the company, explains, ‘Italy boasts some of the world’s best technologies for manufacturing wooden chairs, and a heritage of expert skills in raw material selection and complex processes that is hard to replicate elsewhere. As seating experts, we couldn’t afford to not have a wooden chair in our collection.’ Moreover, the choice of location was equally decisive. ‘The Friuli region has a tradition and manufacturing know-how of wooden chairs like nowhere else in the world. It is a classic example of an Italian industrial district where the collaboration of many craftsmen with specialised skills creates something unique. Since we decided to open a wooden manufactory, we had no choice but to come to this territory to find the best expertise.’Pedrali blends Italian know-how and quality craftsmanship | image © Filippo RomanoSUSTAINABILITY AT THE CORE OF WOODWORKING Leveraging this regional expertise and collaborative spirit, the Manzano manufactory has been the birthplace of several iconic designs. The Frida chair, designed by Odo Fioravanti and awarded the ADI Compasso d’Oro in 2011, is a prime example. Featuring a three-dimensional curved plywood shell on a solid wood frame, its construction, demanding absolute precision in design and production, demonstrates Pedrali’s ability to push the boundaries in woodworking. Furthermore, numerous collections by CMP Design, such as Malmö, Nemea, and Nym, showcase a versatile design language rooted in thoughtful material application and structural ingenuity.Frida chair by Odo Fioravanti exemplifies Manzano’s precision in wood processing | image © Piercarlo Quecchia, DSL StudioAll of Pedrali’s wooden products are FSC® C114358 certified, guaranteeing wood sourced from responsibly and adequately managed forests that align with strict environmental, social, and economic standards. This commitment is central to the brand’s deeply ingrained sustainability practice, further strengthened through its adoption of water-based coatings. Composed mostly of plant-derived resins, this choice significantly decreases chemical compounds found in traditional coatings, resulting in a healthier working environment, reduced air pollution, and substantial energy savings. It’s a challenging yet crucial innovation for the wooden seating sector, where solvent-based paints are typically used.CMP Design’s Nemea chairs showcase a versatile design language rooted in thoughtful material application | image © Piercarlo Quecchia, DSL StudioBeyond product design, Pedrali’s commitment to environmental responsibility extends to its operational footprint. The Manzano manufactory itself exemplifies this, having undergone a significant expansion in 2019 that included the installation of photovoltaic panels and a full conversion to LED lighting. These substantial upgrades directly contribute to reducing the company’s overall CO2 equivalent emissions, a commitment rigorously measured through its Corporate Carbon Footprint assessment. Additionally, a dedicated vacuum plant for wood waste separation ensures that both clean and treated wood chips are efficiently recycled and reused.The 20-year milestone of the Manzano production site is not merely an endpoint but a powerful motivation for Pedrali to continue its journey of constant growth and renewal. It stands as a testament to the enduring values of tradition, innovation, and sustainability, driven by the perseverance, passion, and dedication that define Pedrali’s approach to furniture design.Pedrali’s water-based coatings, derived from plants, reduce chemical compounds and environmental impact | image © Piercarlo Quecchia, DSL Studioa fully managed in-house production process ensures quality and precise control over every stage | image © Piercarlo Quecchia, DSL Studio",
