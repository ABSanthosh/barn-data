And so does the rise of home office pods that you can plonk inside your garden, and enjoy working in peace and quiet.  As far as modern outdoor home office sheds go, you can now choose from a wide assortment of cubicles that you wouldn’t want to leave. Looking like tiny little homes, garden office pods are self-sufficient, productive spaces where you can make a living and create, think, and ponder. 1. Tiny and Efficient Office Shed Sett Studio garden office Sett Studio designed such a backyard office to not only be stylish but also energy-efficient thanks to Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPs). A tall window provides views of the garden, while the solid wall street fences off the busy street. The beauty of having your own working studio is, obviously, that it eliminates commute. But it’s not only saved time you gain. You can also order a garden office pod design that will accommodate your every need like additional space for meeting with clients or a separate room for resting. This pod was designed for a professional photographer to remove distractions as well as provide some space to receive clients and do small shoots. 2. Small and Modern Outdoor Home Office Sheds Wooden garden office by Backyard Room Backyard Room decided to combine functionality and natural aesthetic in this tiny office shed project. It is not only surrounded with greenery, it is planted with it, which creates an intimate and fairytale-like retreat. Small pod is enough to house a desk and a couple of chairs. Outside, there is an adjoining terrace and a bench for productivity-raising breaks and post-lunch naps. 3. Narrow Office Shed Garden Studio by Serge Schoemaker Architects A long narrow garden isn’t a problem for a custom design. Garden Studio in Bussum is a narrow unit that acts as a study, a guest house, and a storage place. Aside from fitting perfectly into the allocated space, the studio has a design that corresponds with the neighboring buildings, but not without a modern touch. 4. Cozy Mini Pod Office Shed Custom Mini Pod by Pod Space Although their price can reach up to $30,000, the office pods may well be worth it as a temporary (or permanent) office space or studio for your business. It doesn’t have to be big. This small office shed was built for a chartered structural engineer, and reportedly paid off. 5. Wooden Office Shed Office in My Garden pod The modern outdoor home office sheds market has grown so much that you don’t need to buy prefabricated catalog models. You can have your own design built by professionals, who specialize in construction and carpentry like Paul Winters of Office in My Garden. Winters offers custom design as well as a portfolio rich in different types of units combining modern design and practical sensibilities. 6. Modern Outdoor Home Office Shed With Wood Plank Siding Garden office pod by Green Studios Wooden plank siding is the most attractive thing in the world. And it seems like office pod manufacturers know it better than anyone. Even the most modern office will look inviting and stylish with this type of siding. Just look at this Green Studios garden office pod. 7. Sleek Backyard Office Shed Office pavilion that doubles as a yoga studio by Neil Dusheiko Architects These are also easier to fit with more traditional or simply older modern architecture. Sleekness and simplicity of such design works wonders in any style. Bold glass inclusions like in this office-yoga studio by Neil Dusheiko bring contemporaneity to simple wooden structures. 8. Garden Office Shed Office shed with bike storage by Green Studios A garden office shed can be repurposed for storage and additional needs like a workout room or a guest house. A professional photographer, Ben Rice commissioned Green Studios to build him a garden room, where he could keep his kit as well as work. Ample space within the structure further provides multiple changeable options. 9. Minimalist Modern Outdoor Home Office Shed Garden office with a green roof by Waind Gohil Architects At the very least your garden office can double as a roof garden. It’s not purely decorative, mind you, a green roof is a great way to insulate a pod that stands in a sunny spot. Surrounding yourself with greenery is a good way to create a perfect creativity-inducing retreat as well. 10. Private Backyard Office Shed Inoutside backyard office Australian magazine called Inoutside designed an entire collection of modern outdoor home office sheds. You can see a glimpse of what’s on offer in this Cooba unit. Enclosed in wooden plank siding, the office looks stylish and modern with its modest black steel-framed windows and glazed doors. 11. Contemporary Large Office Shed Modern office shed by Peter Guthrie Peter Guthrie imagined a clean contemporary modern office in the garden without any unnecessary details or elements. Just the walls, the roof, and some natural light. We like the simplicity of the project that focuses on work and eliminates distractions. There is just a thin glass transom for resting your eyes without needing to get up every fifteen minutes. 12. Comfy Backyard Office Shed Micro Max Pod by Pod Space Another project from Pod Space is Micro Max Pod that flies under $20,000 mark. Although small, it offers a feature you wouldn’t find even in the comfiest office – underfloor heating. Ever dreamed of working without your shoes on? The rest of the bill includes a full height window and a glazed door, Siberian larch cladding, and white micro-porous paint interior. 13. Modern Outdoor Office Shed With Louvre System Modernist garden office by KitHaus Many of the modern outdoor home office sheds remind us of those trendy tiny houses. Seriously, it looks like one could live in these offices. KitHaus specialize in small homes, but some of their sheds would make perfect garden offices like this one from K4 Series. Turns out tiny structures are more versatile than they look. 14. Shaded Office Shed Garden pavilion guest house and office by BLOOT Architecture BLOOT Architecture combine living space with a home office, and they did it under permit-free construction limits. The result is a brick cube-like structure with a timber facade and a Louvre system that provides more privacy for the guests, and eliminates visual distractions for the working residents. 15. Glass Office Shed Garden office by Cube Life Cube Life offer their expertise in garden building along with modern home office model designs that are so good, you could hold meetings in them. This particular shed is like no other, as it features glass walls all around, but when you need to shut out all the distractions, a louvre system is there to provide comfort. 16. Contemporary Backyard Office Shed Sky Pod by George Nijland Another one of Pod Space designs was conceived by George Nijland. It’s difficult to find a more contemporary, sophisticated, and stylish garden office shed. A small Louvre system looks more decorative than practical, but you’ll never lack natural light with that generous skylight in the middle of the pod’s ceiling. 17. Contemporary Style Garden Office Sheds Studio Shed If wood doesn’t suit your new contemporary house, then perhaps a design from Studio Shed’s Signature Series would make a fitting addition to your yard? Made of Zip System weatherproof wall panels and corrugated Galvalume roofing, these sheds are built to last a lifetime, or at least that’s what the firm promises. 18. Tiny Office Shed OfficePOD Want your office to have a futuristic or space ship-like aesthetic? OfficePOD is the perfect candidate, as it looks like a small ship’s cabin, designed just for work. The POD was designed to eliminate distractions so expect decent soundproofing and sleek interior design. 19. Glass Cube Office Shed Harwyn Office Pod Harwyn is, too, an extraordinary office pod that challenges the rules of garden offices themselves. Its sleek and minimal design is more contemporary than modern. Built with a double-layer protective system, the Harwyn cubicle is weatherproof, but you can add features like remote control blinds, a heating panel, and many others when choosing your design. 20. Whimsical Office Shed Shoffice by Platform 5 Architects Combining shed and office in more than just the name, Platform 5 Architects created something more than your run-of-the-mill garden office for a 1950’s terraced house in St. John’s Wood, London. Its curvilinear shape, that was intended to fit organically with the natural environment, creates pockets of space for work and rest, and bears a cool retro futuristic aesthetic. 21. Versatile Office Shed Also from Studio Shed, we have the Summit series which comes in several formats. You can go for a bathroom and a small kitchen, a bathroom and a large kitchen, or only a bathroom and a large open space. After all, it’s up to you and your needs.  The office shed comes with top of the line bathroom amenities, sturdy flooring, a tankless water heater, and HVAC, to name a few. The kitchen is also fully equipped if you choose to have one.  22. A-Frame Home Office Shed If you want an office shed that looks like a small home, then one from Sheds Unlimited will certainly do the trick. The one we’re proposing comes with an A-frame, and vinyl shutters. Depending on the size, it will cost you between $4,000 and $8,300 to get this one in your garden.  Then, you’re going to have to invest a bit to transform this beautiful shed into an actual office. Nonetheless, it’s just a bit of DIY work.  23. Friendly Office Shed Another cool option is to get your office shed from Stoltzfus Structures which gives you plenty of customization options, allowing you to pick the doors, the windows, flooring, roof, and so on.  The floors are insulated so you don’t have to worry about being too cold, the walls and ceiling insulation will help you enjoy the shed year-round.  24. She Shed or Office Shed? This time around, the office shed doubles as a she shed for one lucky customer. It’s the place where she works on her art and that also serves as a much-needed workspace.  Created by Tuff Shed, the build features four windows, a beautiful door, and it’s super easy to set up.  25. Modern Office Shed The folks from Modern Shed are ready to help you build your perfect office shed, with just the right size, the format you need for your backyard, and so on.  It’s possible to choose how many windows you want, what shape they should have, whether to have an awning, what the walls should be made of, and on and on. It’s a dream come true for everyone who wants to micromanage the project.  Final Thoughts on Backyard Office Sheds There is nothing quite like working in a peaceful green garden within a few feet of your own home. Modern outdoor home office sheds allow that separation to be as convenient and painless as possible.",
