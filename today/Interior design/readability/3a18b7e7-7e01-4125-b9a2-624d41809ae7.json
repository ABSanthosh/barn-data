  "text": "In the quiet streets of Tottenham, London, a modest 1970s clergy house has been reimagined as an environmentally conscious family home, cloaked in the textured warmth of cork. Known as Nina’s House, the transformation was led by design studio Nina+Co in partnership with ROAR Architects, demonstrating how regenerative materials and thoughtful design can be used to turn a passive facade into an engaging and high-performing community landmark. At the heart of this “deep retrofit” is cork, a material considered as poetic in its physical presence as it is powerful in its technical performance. Once cold and uninspiring, the building has been made to radiate warmth, curiosity, and intention, as it has been covered entirely in expanded cork panels. Dark, mottled, and tactile, this natural cladding is made to invite the hands of schoolchildren, the questions of neighbors, and the admiration of passersby. Designer: Nina+Co and ROAR Architects The use of cork in architecture represents a shift toward biomaterials that are both high-performing and sensorially engaging. As a material, cork combines sustainability with durability, offering a renewable alternative to synthetics while delivering superior insulation. It reduces the building’s embodied carbon and enhances its energy efficiency, making it a strategic material choice for climate-resilient design. Cork, which is harvested from the bark of cork oak trees, is known as a renewable and biodegradable material with strong insulation properties. In Nina’s House, expanded cork was chosen for its regenerative farming practices, zero synthetic binders, and minimal build-up requirements; no plastic membranes or toxic adhesives were included. Its low-impact manufacturing process uses only heat to expand the cork, further emphasizing its role in environmentally responsible construction. According to Nina Woodcroft, founder of Nina+Co, cork stands out as a natural material that is not only effective but also appeals to the senses. She emphasized her fascination with cork’s scent, feel, and sustainable story, noting that this project used cork for both function and visual impact. The house, she explained, was intentionally wrapped in a breathable and insulating material to offer both environmental performance and gentle street presence. Cork’s application at Nina’s House challenges the misconception that natural materials are limited to rustic or niche aesthetics. Instead, it demonstrates how cork can serve as a contemporary architectural finish, one that ages gracefully and contributes to long-term resilience. Rather than extend the home, the existing footprint was maximized. The ground floor layout was opened up, and the small garage and porch were brought into the thermal envelope, so that a sense of flow and cohesion was created. Budget was directed toward infrastructure: the gas supply was removed, underfloor heating and an air-source heat pump were installed, airtightness was improved, and all glazing was replaced with high-performance alternatives, including suspended film technology and triple glazing. Expanded cork was made to play a starring role both outside and in. On the facade, it is used as an insulating skin; inside, cork can also be seen in flooring, while walls have been finished with lime-based plaster containing cork granules. In areas where external insulation was not possible, these lime plasters were applied to provide an internal thermal buffer. The decision to leave some internal surfaces raw and sealed with a non-toxic glaze was made both for stylistic and economical reasons, so that practicality could be blended with beauty. Cork’s versatility enables it to be used beyond cladding. Its acoustic properties make it ideal for interior finishes, especially in homes that aim to be peaceful and meditative. It also helps regulate humidity and temperature indoors, supporting healthier living environments. Throughout the house, reclaimed and local materials have been used to reflect a low-waste, high-value design ethos. Pine floorboards that were removed for structural work were reworked into ceiling cladding. A statement kitchen island, designed by Woodcroft, was crafted by local artisans from a London Plane tree that had been felled in Soho Square, an urban tree that was given new life by the organization Fallen \u0026 Felled. The kitchen also features recycled plastic countertops, by which the home’s dedication to circularity is echoed. All joinery was made ultra-locally using British Douglas Fir tri-ply board, thereby showing how sustainable design can be used to support local economies while reducing carbon impact. The cork cladding is expected to last between 15 to 25 years. When its surface has weathered, lime render will be applied over it, so that its life can be extended while its appearance is subtly altered. This long-term approach reflects a preference for resilience over superficial finishes. Cork’s biodegradability also ensures that it can return safely to the earth at the end of its lifecycle, reinforcing the circular logic behind its use. In total, Nina’s House measures 112 m² (1,206 ft²), modest in scale but grand in vision. Its open-plan layout has been designed to support a young family’s dynamic lifestyle, with zones for connection and quiet being offered. Movement, gathering, and even dancing are encouraged, so that sustainability can be felt less like a constraint and more like freedom.",
