  "text": "Designed by D3 Buro, Andrei Teut, and Elizaveta Vornicoglo, the Willow Apartment pretty much captures the gentle sway of willow trees—evoking calm and serenity. It is designed to reflect the soft embrace of nature. And for that purpose, you will see plenty of earthy tones, organic textures, and understated luxury. The gentle flow of wood-grain surfaces and warmth of soft neutrals whisper calm. Think: cloud-like upholstery, light-washed oak, and sculptural accents. These are used strategically, in a way that they blur the lines between modern minimalism and a cozy retreat. The Willow Apartment uses a large oversized sofa, sleek in build, as the main seating space. A rust orange accent chair adds on some more space while incorporating a punch of color. The entertainment complex is sleek, featuring a wooden build and interesting LED lighting. A compact bookcase on one end lets residents showcase their accessories. The dining table uses light-hued wood, as do the chairs surrounding it. Behind this, we see modern, hardware-less cabinetry setting a contemporary ambiance. The wooden detailing and LED lighting make sure to add warmth. The kitchen island also uses a light variety of wood and is paired with three modern rustic bar stools. A vase of small red flowers adds a punch of color. This bedroom in the Willow Apartment features a fluted panel design on the wall. The bed has plush upholstery, and the sleek, low nightstands add luxury. One of the secrets to a modern ambiance is the smooth and minimal cabinetry. Finally, this bedroom uses a wood accent wall to create a welcoming ambiance. The headboard of the bed uses LED lighting, creating a distinct yet warm partition. We love the accent pendant light illuminating the matte black sculpture. Next to this, a bookcase holding decorative—sometimes functional—accessories adds style.",
