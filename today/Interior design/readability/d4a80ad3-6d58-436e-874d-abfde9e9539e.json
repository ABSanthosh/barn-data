But Chinese manufacturer Tyvok has created a sort of hybrid with the Spider X1S. It's a large-format laser cutter with a compact form factor.It consists of a laser cutter head (both 10W and 20W units are available) that rides on a gantry supported by blocks on either end. These blocks have wheels on them, that can either ride on rails or on the worksurface itself. By choosing the length of the gantry and rails, the idea is that you can achieve the following:With a scheme like this, the devil is in the UX details; in practice, how easy or difficult is it to set up and index the system?
