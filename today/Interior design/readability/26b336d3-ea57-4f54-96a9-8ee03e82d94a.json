  "description": "Playgrounds have traditionally been the domain of elementary schools. But Pennsylvania-based playground equipment manufacturer Playworld reckons that folks of all ages would benefit from using them. They've thus designed two systems, ENERGI and LifeTrail, aimed at older users.Each system consists of low-maintenance outdoor equipment and signage. Their ENERGI system, aimed at junior high and high school kids, has five components that offer 120 different body-weight-resistance exercise between them. The weatherproof signage contains graphics demonstrating the exercises, and the company also offers online instructional videos. Their LifeTrail system, designed for seniors, consists of five stations and an additional two that are ADA-approved and can be used by wheelchair users. The graphics on the signage are printed large, for easier visibility. Designed in collaboration with a kinesiology and gerontology specialist, the LifeTrail system provides 21 different exercises to help seniors keep fit. Both systems feature exercises broken into beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, in a bid to maximize inclusivity. The ENERGI system is targeted at middle schools and high schools, while the LifeTrail market is parks, senior centers and retirement communities.",
