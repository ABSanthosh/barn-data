  "text": "LA-based Jared Frank Studio has looked to Milan's history of modernist design for references while focusing on \"what a West Coast pizza parlour could be\". Wildcrust occupies a single-storey building with a fully glazed front in Highland Park, north of Downtown LA. At Wildcrust, Jared Frank Studio chose contrasting colours and materials in reference to Italy's design greatsWhen designing the interiors, Jared Frank Studio used the opportunity to rethink the pizzeria typology and move away from the aesthetic typically found in the Northeast US. \"Chef Miles Okabayashi engaged Jared Frank not just to design a restaurant, but to develop an original vision for what a West Coast pizza parlour could be,\" said the studio. Pistachio was chosen for the colour of cabinet fronts and a light fixture above the stainless steel counter\"Instead of trafficking in Tri-State nostalgia, Frank looked towards the long history of Milanese modernism, from Piero Portaluppi's Deco to Aldo Rossi's PoMo and everything in between.\" With the greats of Italian design in mind, the designer imbued the space with contrasting colours and materials, and a variety of decorative lighting fixtures. A mirrored band with zigzag trim wraps the space above claret-hued banquettesPistachio green was chosen for wall-mounted cabinets, the sliding fronts below the stainless steel service counter and a linear light suspended above it. A backsplash of tiny red and burgundy tiles echoes the claret-coloured leather used to cover banquette seating, which wraps around circular tables. Decorative lighting designs throughout the space include sconces shaped like inverted stepped pyramidsA band of wraparound mirrors above the banquettes is topped with a zigzag trim where the pistachio hue appears again. Additional seating is provided at a picnic table and benches, all with A-shaped metal supports, and a small counter at the window. Speckled back and white tiles cover the floor and extend part of the way up the wall, above which the exposed brickwork is whitewashed. For lighting, sconces shaped like inverted stepped pyramids are mounted on the walls, while pendant lights comprising stacked disks match the leather upholstery. Tiny red and burgundy tiles form the service area backsplash\"With Wildcrust, Frank argues that it is LA, not New York, that has inherited Italy's exuberantly playful relationship to modern life and food,\" said the studio. This is Frank's first hospitality project since Tenants of the Trees, a popular LA nightclub during the late 2010s. Wildcrust is located in a single-storey building in LA's Highland ParkThe dining scene in Los Angeles continues to boom, particularly across the neighbourhoods north of downtown. Recent openings with notable interiors include Moroccan-influenced Zizou and the tiny Thai eatery Holy Basil Market. The photography is by Tim Hirschmann.
