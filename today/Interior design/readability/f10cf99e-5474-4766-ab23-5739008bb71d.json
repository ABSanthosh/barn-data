Reimagining Summer: Studio Bonarchi’s Nostalgic Revival of a Seaside Apartment in Greece Detailed InformationProject NameCorinthian gulf apartmentPosted inInterior DesignLocation Greece Interior DesignerStudio BonarchiCompleted2024 Nostalgia plays a significant role in interior design by evoking a sense of comfort and emotional connection through familiar aesthetics. It draws on elements that remind us of the past, creating spaces that feel warm, personal, and reflective of fond memories. As Gaston Bachelard wrote, \"The house shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.\" This belief—that nostalgic design can transform a home into a sanctuary made of memories and dreams, where past and present harmonize as one—was at the heart of the owners of this summer apartment in Greece when they commissioned Studio Bonarchi for a much-needed redesign. Originally the treasured getaway of the owners' grandparents in the early 1970s, the property, a compact apartment perched above the seashore of the Corinthian Gulf, was the vacation paradise of their childhood. Working closely with the owners, Studio Bonarchi completely transformed this sentimental retreat, blending cherished memories with thoughtful, contemporary design inspired by the stunning sunset views and the artisanal heritage of the French Riviera. The result is a space that encapsulates both the passage of time and the changing seasons—from summer to autumn, and spring to summer—capturing the bittersweet beauty of nostalgia in every detail. Photography by Dionisis Andrianopoulos. Photography by Dionisis Andrianopoulos. Photography by Dionisis Andrianopoulos. Led by interior designer Vangelis Bonios, Studio Bonarchi has built a reputation for interiors of soulful simplicity and understated sophistication, underpinned by clean lines, muted tones, and fine materials, and enhanced by bespoke furnishings and well-crafted details. Bonios’ signature aesthetic carries through in this project, albeit with the addition of vibrant pops of colour. Known for his preference for monochromatic schemes, this time the white interiors are enlivened by radiant yellows, oranges, pinks, and blues. \"With an unobstructed view of the sunset as the main protagonist,\" the designer explains, \"it was almost subconsciously settled that the colour palette of the new interiors would reflect the breathtaking beauty of the setting sun.\" Bonios’ approach to redesigning the apartment focused on creating the illusion of a spacious suite while preserving its intimate charm. Walls were replaced with sliding doors and shuttered panels, opening up the space and evoking the breezy elegance of the French Riviera—a place dear to the owners.

Several original furniture pieces from the 1970s were thoughtfully retained and given a modern edge through new fabrics, lacquered finishes, and unique treatments. These nostalgic items were complemented by a curated mix of furnishings and objects lovingly collected by the owners over years of travel, along with contemporary pieces handpicked by the design team. Among these are a limited series of handmade ceramics by naked summers, the brainchild of Greek painter Christina Mandilari, and “Artificiel” textured porcelain cups, a collaboration between Athens-based designer Yiannis Ghikas and Myran design shop. Studio Bonarchi also designed bespoke elements such as the bedside sconces. Vintage rattan stools by Pierantonio Bonacina from the 1970s sit alongside a white lacquered desk from a concept store in Hydra, paired with a flea market table lamp from Barcelona. Books and hotel directory editions from Capri and Portofino add a personal flair, while a cabinet of memorabilia further contribute to the scheme’s rich narrative. Bedding and bath towels by Greek brand KIMISOO further enhance the sense of quiet luxury throughout the space. As the summer slowly gives way to autumn and the owners prepare to return to Athens, the apartment remains a serene sanctuary, where a vintage vinyl record by Michel Legrand echoes the sentiment of the season. This final touch, along with the apartment’s carefully curated details, beautifully encapsulates the spirit of the retreat—a place where the past and present coalesce in perfect harmony, offering a lasting reminder of the beauty and comfort of home. It is also a celebration of the ever-changing seasons, with every corner of the space quietly proclaiming, \"We will always have summer!\" Photography by Dionisis Andrianopoulos.
