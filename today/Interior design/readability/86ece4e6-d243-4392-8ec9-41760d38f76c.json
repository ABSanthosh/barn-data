  "description": "This renovated apartment is both Matt Vescovo’s personal home, and the debut project of his newly launched furniture, fixtures, and equipment design consultancy, MR.V Studio. The design speaks to both — serving as a functional base for the creative director and his partner, and a showcase of MR.V Studio’s adventurous style. Matt shares how he gave new life to the 1930s Bellevue Hill apartment, with a reconfigured floor plan and sophisticated use of moody colour.",

  "text": "Creative director Matt Vescovo had a clear vision for the renovation of his art deco apartment in Bellevue Hill. At the time, he was in the process of establishing his design consultancy, MR.V Studio, so the project needed to both support his everyday life, and epitomise the studio’s aesthetic. ‘It kind of pushed me to make more adventurous choices on the finishes,’ says Matt. ‘It needed to be a true reflection of what I/we like, and not because it felt “safe” for the space.’ The designer and his partner Jack Murray quickly identified the potential of swapping the position of the kitchen and main bedroom.‘This opened up a great big space for the new kitchen,’ says Matt. Original 1930s features were highlighted in the remaining bedroom and hallway, leaving the heavy lifting to the joinery, furniture, and injection of colour in the renovated spaces. A threshold lined with stainless steel marks the entry into the new kitchen, featuring joinery inspired by the Scoop kitchen by Studio Doherty for Laminex. ‘It instantly captured the vibe I was aiming for,’ says Matt. ‘As soon as I saw it, I ordered a sample of the Smoked Birchply and began planning the entire palette around that material.’ Matte appliances from Smeg’s Neptune Grey range tie in with the cabinetry, appearing almost as a custom colour match. ‘We selected the cooktop, oven, and wine fridge from that range, and together they’ve really elevated the space with a refined, cohesive look,’ says Matt. Space has been maximised by positioning the fridge and freezer under the bench, creating more room to prepare food, and allowing the original fireplace to remain in place. ‘It doesn’t work, but it’s a nice nod to the age of the building and its beautiful deco features,’ says Matt. The bathroom was renovated by Matt a couple of years prior to the main project, introducing the most colourful room of the home. Bold two-tone red and dark blue tiles sit alongside fluted glass and a stone basin, without overpowering the space. ‘We removed the bathtub to allow for a full reconfiguration of the layout. We also swapped the positions of the shower and basin to improve the flow and accessibility of the space,’ says Matt. Laminated redwood flooring throughout the apartment was replaced with oak boards in the communal spaces, with carpet in both bedrooms, working to define and elevate the interiors. Matt says the renovation has added so much more than just aesthetic improvements; it’s elevated the experience of daily life in the home. The apartment is a testament to his vision, and MR.V Studio’s fresh design approach.",
