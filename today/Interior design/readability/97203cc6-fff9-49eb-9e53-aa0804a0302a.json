It features a sleek square design and premium metal-and-glass body. It sure is one fantastic addition to intimate dinners as well as festive gatherings! One reason we love this piece is because it’s smokeless. So, you get the glow of a real flame but without the hassle of smoke. Whether you’re setting the scene in a living room or roasting s’mores on a balcony—the Solacea fire pit can create an inviting and clean-burning environment. Also, the larger combustion chamber means you get an extended burn time—and uninterrupted relaxation. There’s no need to constantly refuel, which is perfect for evenings spent entertaining or unwinding. This tabletop fire pit works seamlessly with bioethanol, isopropyl alcohol, rubbing alcohol, or gel fuel. The decorative white stones included add to its visual appeal, while its modern matte beige finish complements a variety of interiors, from rustic and cozy to sleek and contemporary.  At 6.3″ x 6.3″ x 10.6″, its compact size makes it effortlessly portable, perfect for any tabletop setting. Designed with ease in mind, the Solacea Fire Pit is lightweight and simple to clean.Available now on Amazon.",
