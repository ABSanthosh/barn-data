Village in the US, a new development in Ireland showcases the rapid progress of this technology. This new project showcases the the scope of 3D printing, and how it can deliver affordable homes in less than half of the time required by traditional construction methods. As the potential of 3D-printed architecture widens, we are witnessing a whole new era in the housing sector, where cutting-edge technology is being utilized to build economical and sustainable homes. Dubbed Grange Close, this three-unit terraced social housing project was developed by HTL.tech in Louth, eastern Ireland. The project spans 330 sq m (3,550 sq ft), with each of the three homes offering 110 sq m (1,184 sq ft) of floor space across two levels. This innovative approach highlights the potential of 3D printing to revolutionize housing construction. Designer: HTL.tech The impressive development was constructed within 12 working days, including the initial site preparation and the handover of keys to the client—a local council that will finish furnishing the homes and rent them to social housing tenants at an economical price. COBOD says that the build time was 35% shorter than the build times of similar homes. COBOD’s BOD2 printer was used to print the home. The process involved extruding a cement-like mixture out of a nozzle in layers, while simultaneously following a blueprint. The ground floor took seven days to construct, while the top floor took another five. In the end, the human builders came and applied the finishing touches, adding a roof system and electrical systems. This took up most of the build time. “Approximately 50% of the time savings came directly from 3D printing the wall system,” explains COBOD. “The remaining savings were achieved through the precision of 3D construction printing, which enables seamless integration of other building components – such as partition walls, floor systems, and trusses – to already be considered during the planning and preparation phases, resulting in a more efficient construction process.” A closer inspection of the home shows that it is like most modern homes out there. It doesn’t have a telltale ribbed wall which signifies that it is a 3D-printed home. This gives the impression that it is a contemporary home with a sophisticated design language, allowing residents to feel they are living in a fully constructed dwelling. Since the completion of the home, HTL.tech has made some changes and improvements, and they believe that in the future the printing time will be reduced from twelve days to nine days, which is even better, allowing them to set up 3D-printed homes quicker and faster.",
