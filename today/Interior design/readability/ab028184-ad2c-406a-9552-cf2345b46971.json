  "description": "I spotted this cargo truck while watching a video on Toyota's manufacturing plants in Japan. Look closely at the cab's wheels:Incredible. I don't think I've ever seen a tractor-trailer with four-wheel steering. It not only makes sense for Japan, with its narrow streets, but would make backing the truck up in confined spaces a heckuva lot easier in any country. Not to mention the reduced turning radius.The truck model is called the Profia, and it's made by Toyota subsidiary Hino. I do wonder if we'll ever see this in the 'States; I'd imagine anyone with a CDL who tries driving one of these would never want to go back.",
