What forms, colors and materials define and shape product ranges for dining, living, giving and working? The Ambiente Trends 25+ formulate three surprising answers under categories DEEP, REAL and EASE. From 7 to 11 February 2025, the The Ambiente Trends 25+ come to life in Frankfurt, in the Trend Area in the foyer of Hall 4.1. With selected exhibitor products, Ambiente sets the agenda and reflects the latest developments with the most popular themes, lifestyles and trends, offering buyers, product designers and collection managers numerous design options for staging showrooms, shop windows and product presentations in a varied and surprising way.how do we want to live and work?

The first hotspot for orientation and a valuable ordering aid for trade buyers from a wide range of retail sectors from all over the world is the Trend Area with the presented Ambiente Trends 25+. These are derived by the renowned agency Stilbüro bora.herke.palmisano from international trends in fashion, art, interiors and lifestyle. In their research for Messe Frankfurt, they are inspired by young, up-and-coming as well as well-known designers. In view of the many uncertain dynamics in the world, their forecast for the new worlds of living and working gives cause for optimism: ‘The new trends revolve around intensive designs, joyful ideas and product developments that question norms and allow us to see the familiar from a new perspective. Craftsmanship, sustainability, the circular economy and innovative technologies are major design drivers that will win over consumers, retailers and commercial interior designers,’ says Annetta Palmisano, Stilbüro bora.herke.palmisano. For each of the three Ambiente Trends 25+, nine colors with eight micro color themes enable individual focal points that can be changed and reinterpreted over the course of the year.the Ambiente Trends 25+ are derived by the renowned agency Stilbüro bora.herke.palmisano from international trends in fashion, art, interiors and lifestyleDEEP supports a warm, sublime living environment and brings a whole new sensitivity to nature and craftsmanship. Traditional craftsmanship is reactivated and elements such as water, fire and earth in particular are the inspiration for creative designs. Materials such as wood, ceramics, glass and metal, as well as new material creations, appear in their own authentic colours. Night blue, eggshell ecru or green tea create an atmospheric effect. Metallic nuances such as matt silver, dark bronze or light gold lustre also catch the light.DEEP dives deeply into nature and brings tranquillity to all areas of home living | image © Messe FrankfurtREAL’s designs are understandable and radically simple. Functionality and creativity go hand in hand. Here, the 3D printer ensures perfect surfaces and new materials for a more sustainable future. Ecological and social aspects are incorporated into the material selection process and the concept of recycling becomes part of the product. This results in a remarkable variety of materials, from recycled aluminium or wood to glass and ceramics with innovative glazes and composite materials. Waste becomes a valuable raw material. Rich and unobtrusive colours such as biscuit, deep bottle green, woody beige, caramel, glassy mint, orange-red, aluminium grey, saffron and dark grey support the deliberately timeless design and a clear look.REAL focusses on sustainable designs and encourages positive change | image © Messe FrankfurtEASE creates what we want at this time – a place full of lightness and joy that inspires surprises and even more creativity. Fruity tones such as delicate plum, bright orange and lemon meet soft nuances such as sky blue or denim as well as deep, dark tones such as moss, sea green or sweet cherry wood. The textile inspiration is particularly strong here: experiments with embroidery, floating threads or patchwork give rise to new craft practices. Sustainable materials are created from fabric or yarn remnants, innovative 3D knitting techniques combine craftsmanship and digital design possibilities. Materials such as glass, paper or ceramics are creatively processed and combined with each other. This results in unexpected surfaces and textures that invite you to touch them.EASE takes working with fabrics and yarn to a new level and sets everything in motion | image © Messe Frankfurtfor each trend, nine colors with eight micro color themes enable individual focal points",
