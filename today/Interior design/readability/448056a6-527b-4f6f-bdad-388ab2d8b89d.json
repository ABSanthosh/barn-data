  "text": "In modern times, where most speaker designs follow sleek, minimalist trends aimed at blending into modern interiors, few attempt to make a bold visual statement. The majority prioritize portability, connectivity, or smart features, often at the expense of long-term value or distinctive form. Challenging this landscape of functional sameness, the AA67 speaker emerges as a striking exception. Created through a collaboration between conceptual design studio Alaska Alaska and precision electronics label Caliper, the AA67 challenges the conventions of audio hardware by fusing sculptural aesthetics with acoustic performance. Rooted in Alaska Alaska’s ethos of reinterpreting meaning and recontextualizing iconic forms, the AA67 draws direct inspiration from Slovenian designer Saša Mächtig’s legendary K67 Kiosk—a modular structure celebrated for its bold design and utilitarian legacy. This influence is evident in the speaker’s commanding presence and functional elegance. Designer: Alaska Alaska and Caliper Drawing inspiration from brutalist architecture, industrial design, and the sculptural traditions of artists like Donald Judd and Richard Serra, the AA67 is designed to command attention. Its solid, geometric form is built from CNC-machined aluminum, bead-blasted and anodized for a matte, tactile finish. At 25 inches wide and weighing 18 kilograms, the speaker sits somewhere between high-fidelity audio equipment and an art object, resisting the idea that electronics must be visually discreet. Inside, the speaker is equipped with carefully selected components to match its outward ambition. It features a two-way driver configuration: a 6.5-inch aluminum cone woofer and a 1-inch soft dome tweeter. These are powered by a 100-watt Class D amplifier and enhanced through digital signal processing to ensure clarity, balance, and spatial detail across a wide frequency spectrum. Whether delivering high-resolution music or low-end heavy playback, the AA67 promises a listening experience that is both rich and precise. Functionality is streamlined without being compromised. The speaker offers wireless connectivity via Bluetooth 5.3 and also includes analog input options through RCA and AUX ports. Physical controls are positioned as tactile aluminum dials along the top edge – intuitive to use and satisfying in their mechanical response. Notably, the design avoids digital screens or app dependence, emphasizing timeless utility over fast-changing tech trends. Each AA67 unit is hand-assembled in Los Angeles in limited batches, reflecting a philosophy rooted in longevity and responsible production. By avoiding mass manufacturing, Alaska Alaska and Caliper aim to reduce waste while creating products that age gracefully both in performance and appearance. The rear of the unit includes a modular port system designed to accommodate future upgrades, a thoughtful nod to evolving user needs and environmental sustainability. Produced as a limited edition of just 25 made-to-order units, the AA67 is available in eight distinct colorways: white, pink, green, black, grape, blue, grey, and orange. Currently offered exclusively through Caliper’s official webstore, it presents a rare opportunity for collectors, audiophiles, and design connoisseurs to acquire a sculptural object that bridges historic design language with contemporary audio innovation.",
