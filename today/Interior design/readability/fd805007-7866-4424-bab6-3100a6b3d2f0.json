  "description": "You probably know Flack Studio as the highly successful Australian design studio behind Troye Sivan’s home, and the current restoration of Andy Lee and Rebecca Harding’s historic mansion. In between client projects for household names, Flack Studio’s founder David Flack, and chief marketing officer Jason Olive recently completed a major transformation of their own Brunswick cottage, introducing luxe stone and bold colour to elevate its period features. True to form, the couple are onto the next project, meaning this custom designed Flack Studio home is for sale!",

  "text": "It was just 18 months ago that Flack Studio founder David Flack, and chief marketing officer Jason Olive, bought their single-fronted Brunswick cottage, which has just hit the market. The existing house had a strong character due to its exposed brick walls and timber panelling, but the couple saw potential to create something more special. They’ve since renovated almost everything in the home, ready for a new owner to appreciate. ‘We know the challenges that the cost of renovating presents,’ says David. ‘This home is turnkey, custom designed, made with love, and one of a kind.’ The front door opens to the hallway with original Baltic pine floors, high ceilings, and a new skylight injecting light into the home. Cobalt doors reveal the living area, featuring a new deep red quartzite fireplace, Belgian linen curtains, and statement pendant lighting that imparts a warm glow. The dining room has been relined with solid blackbutt timber, punctuated by red steel openings that connect to the side garden and kitchen. The kitchen flooring is a standout — described by David as a kaleidoscopic pattern of handmade Italian terracotta combined with five different types of Italian stone cut especially for this project — complemented by stone quartzite benchtops, and a Moroccan handmade tile splashback. The bathrooms are equally bespoke, including the futuristic powder room with blue marble floors, Venetian plaster walls, and a custom stainless steel freestanding basin. Western light streams into the main bathroom via a custom steel pivot circular window illuminating the caramel mosaic tiled walls and Tiberio marble vanity. ‘The house embraces the unique exposed brick walls, original Baltic pine floorboards, and heritage features throughout with our interventions of materials a balance between warm, natural, and muddy tones (scorched almond, camel, olive, white pepper) accented with punchy glossy red openings and transitions painted,’ says David. ‘We love the balance of space alongside the cosiness we have created. It feels like home.’ Landscaping by Florian Wild has further enhanced the property, creating a lush outlook to the side from the kitchen and living areas, and a tranquil courtyard. Alternatively, a rear-laneway roller door enables off-street parking. The home is within walking distance of Sydney Road and its numerous cafes and restaurants; Anstey train station; and multiple tram lines. David loves nothing more than a new project, so the couple are moving onto their next renovation. The two-bedroom property heads to auction this month, presenting a rare opportunity for a buyer to move into a Flack Studio home, without having to lift a finger! 7 Howard Street, Brunswick, VIC is listed for sale with Elizabeth Kelly and Kristian Gunn from Jellis Craig and will go to auction on Saturday June 21 at 1pm.",
