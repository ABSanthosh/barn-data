  "text": "Upside Down Burnt Butter + Peach Cake (Serves 8) 80g caster sugar 45g unsalted butter, cold 750g yellow peaches, cut into wedges Brown butter cake 200g unsalted butter 200g caster sugar 3 eggs 150g full fat sour cream 1 tsp vanilla extract 250g self raising flour ½ tsp sea salt crème fraîche, to serve Method: For the brown butter cake, melt the butter in a small saucepan over a medium heat and continue to cook until nut brown. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool and solidify. Preheat the oven to 180C and grease and line a round 23cm baking tin. In a small saucepan, place the sugar with 1 tbsp of water. Set over a medium flame and cook until it reaches a deep amber colour, swirling the pan as needed. Add the cold butter and swirl to incorporate. Pour onto the base of the cake tin and arrange the peaches on top, in a circular fashion. Set aside. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, place the now solidified brown butter with the sugar and beat on a medium speed for 6-8 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed. Add in the sour cream and vanilla and continue to mix until combined. With the mixer on low, add the flour and salt and mix until just combined. Spoon the batter over the peaches and spread using the back of a spoon to smooth. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back when touched. Allow to cool for 20 minutes in the tin, then invert onto a serving plate. Serve with crème fraîche. What else I’m eating: The Cypriot pita from Tedesca! Such a tasty morsel in a beautiful setting! What else I’m cooking: Sicilian almond milk puddings with honey and pistachios. So simple and a wonderful dessert in warmer weather.",
