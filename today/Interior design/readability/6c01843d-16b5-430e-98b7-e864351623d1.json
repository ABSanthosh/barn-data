  "text": "Bare Root Creation in the UK has reimagined small-space living by converting a worn 1940s railway car into a practical and affordable tiny house for two. Located in Cornwall, England, this unique dwelling sits on a double-axle trailer and measures 18 feet (5.5 meters) in length. It features a sturdy corrugated metal roof and is clad in larch, giving it a rustic yet inviting appearance. While built on wheels, its design is intended for semi-permanent placement on land rather than frequent towing. This creative transformation makes it ideal as a cozy vacation retreat or a guest house, blending vintage character with functional modern living. Designer: Bare Root Creation The tiny house offers 144 square feet (13.4 square meters) of interior space, finished with reclaimed wood sourced from old railway cars, preserving its historical character. Entry is through large wooden double doors that lead straight into the living area. This space features an L-shaped seating arrangement with built-in storage and a nearby window for natural light. The adjacent kitchen is simple but practical, equipped with a sink featuring a cutting board insert, a small fridge, a microwave, and a few cabinets for storage. The use of reclaimed materials and efficient layout gives the home both a sense of warmth and functionality, making it comfortable for short stays or as a guest retreat. The bedroom in this tiny house takes a creative approach, though it’s not ideal for those with limited mobility. To enter, you climb through a circular porthole-style opening that connects the living room to the sleeping area. Inside, you’ll find a cozy double bed nestled within the reclaimed wood walls, creating a private and unique retreat. This setup adds a touch of adventure and novelty, making the bedroom feel separate from the main living space while maximizing the use of limited square footage. On the opposite end of the house, you’ll find the bathroom, which is compact but practical. It includes a small sink, a shower, and a standard flushing toilet, providing all the essentials for comfortable daily living in a small footprint. Currently, the tiny house is listed for sale on Tiny House Listings at £35,000 (about US$44,000). Buyers can also opt for upgrades such as a wood-burning stove for extra warmth, a water heating system for added comfort, or authentic train-style steel carriage wheels to enhance its vintage charm and mobility. This blend of history, practicality, and customization makes the tiny house a standout choice for anyone seeking a unique getaway or guest accommodation.",
