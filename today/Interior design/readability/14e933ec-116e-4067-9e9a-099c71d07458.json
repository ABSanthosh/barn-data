  "description": "A French mobility company called Mobilize has designed a new type of vehicle from scratch. Two, actually: The Duo, an enclosed two-seater electric quadricycle, and its sibling the Bento, which ditches the back seat for a large storage box.Both vehicles were meant to be strong urban design statements, and to not draw on outdated references. \"The Duo's greatest strength is its unique design,\" says Jean-Philippe Salar, Mobilize's Design Director. \"What we wanted for this vehicle was to avoid imitating a car. It's in effect a little spaceship, a little lunar capsule on 4 wheels.\"Not being a car, the diminutive Duo can be driven by folks as young as 14 in France. The tandem seating arrangement, rather than side-by-side, is to make the vehicle as narrow as possible, the better to slip through traffic. The gullwing doors allow ingress and egress even in tight spaces. The charging cable sits in a dedicated compartment in the vehicle's nose. And, surprisingly, the vehicle features an airbag for safety. The company refers to the single-seater Bento as a micro utility vehicle; it boasts a cargo box on the back that can swallow nearly a cubic meter. The Bento requires a proper driver's license, as its more powerful electric motor can top out at 80 km/h (50 mph). It's targeted at last-mile delivery services and tradespeople who travel with tools. Intriguingly, the dashboard of both vehicle was inspired by an icon of 1980s urban culture: The boombox. \"The design of Duo et Bento, both on the outside and inside – with its dashboard that refers to boomboxes – deliberately goes against the grain of classic automotive language,\" says Salar. The designers also decided not to include a screen, reckoning that most people are already carrying one these days.Both vehicles require half the space to park as a car. The construction of the vehicles is decidedly un-car-like: \"It's based on a metal birdcage structure to which we simply glue plastic panels,\" says Benoit Abadie, Mobilize's Director of Engineering. \"We have around 300 parts in Duo, that's 5 times less than in a normal car, which has around 1,500.\" Mobilize is a subsidiary of Renault, and both vehicles are manufactured at Renault's factory in Tangiers. \"It's an ISO 14001 plant that's working towards carbon neutrality,\" says Wafa Boujguenna, the company's Industrial Project Manager. \"Duo and Bento are eco-designed vehicles, made from 40% recycled materials, battery included, and are 95% recyclable, including the battery.\"The vehicles will be sold in France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. No word on if these will come to the U.S.There's a great interview with the design team below, explaining what they were going for:",
