  "text": "Not all everyday carry multitools are the same. I don’t mean just in terms of their functional abilities and tool selection, but also in their design. Some may be well-equipped with essential tools, yet their usability can be compromised due to ineffective design. Gerber Gear understands this, which is why the company offers multitools in various shapes, configurations, and tool combinations to cater to different user needs. Carrying the baton forward from the previously popular Stake Out – 0.75 inches thick camping multitool with 11 different tool combinations – is Gerber Stake Out Spark. The upgraded version of the Stake Out, Spark – like its predecessor – can set up a camp, start a fire, and help cook in the wilderness. It is however going ahead with a different set of tools – 10 now – and a distinct, butterfly opening for quick and easy access, that at least I would prefer over many EDCs. It may look slightly bulkier, but I believe that should be worth the gamble. Designer: Gerber Gear As a wholesome multitool for any adventure you can think of, the Spark is designed with substance and utility at the forefront. Outdoor seeking versatility without bulk in the backpack or pocket, can give the Stake Out Spark a spin on their next backpacking, bike camping, or any adventure of choice. We strongly emphasize the former since in addition to being a workhorse to take on whatever camp task you need to tackle, it can (using an onboard plier) be used for occasional gear repair and other tasks involving wires and cables requiring twisting and turning. Versatile 10-tool multitool, the Spark can let you start a fire, repair a bike, start dinner, and even assist in breaking down camp and windup. It is built with the philosophy of “getting more done without bringing tons of gear.” This one tool should be enough to ensure you can have more time in nature and less time worrying about the How! With a classic butterfly grip to access either of the two pliers, a ferro rod and saw to spark up a campfire, and a carabiner to carry it without crowding the bag or bulking up the pocket; the Stake Out Spark has a tent stake puller that helps wind up a camp in a snap. Other essentials in the Spark’s features set include a wire cutter, bottle opener, blade with plain edge, ruler, and an awl because why not? The Gerber Stake Out Spark like its predecessors comes with a lifetime warranty. Its pocket clip or carabiner (as mentioned above) allows you to carry it comfortably in a manner you wish. For those fussy about colors; Spark is available in Coyote Brown and Baltic Haze colorways. You can get it right away for $69.95.",
