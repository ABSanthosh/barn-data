She says that one-note ceiling bulbs can cast harsh shadows and don’t offer flexibility to play with the brightness and color in your space. The good news is that even if you’re a renter stuck with the lights your landlord chose, there are easy ways to make your space cozier and less stark with just the lighting — here’s how.Credit: chuckcollier / Getty Images1. Consider Your BulbsSimply swapping your bulbs can make a big difference. “Lightbulb technology has come a long way,” Cantley says. “LED lighting is available in numerous color temperature options and can provide dimming capabilities to 1% or less.” Even the size of your bulb can change how your space feels. She likes that a small, flangeless LED bulb creates “a clean-looking ceiling with incredible lighting that can completely change a room.”Matthew Coates, owner of architecture firm Coates Design, never uses cool-toned bulbs, which he says can “make the space feel cold and clinical.” Instead, he recommends warmer white bulbs with a color temp of up to 3,000K. Just be sure to keep things consistent. “One common mistake I often see is when folks mix light temps within the same room — this is a big ‘no-no’ and can ruin the ambience in a hurry,” he says. Credit: GCShutter / Getty Images2. Layer Your LightsCoates considers the overall function of a space when planning lighting. “The kitchen is not just a place to cook, but it can often be used as a social hub where people gather,” he says. “Having flexibility in the lighting for times like that is essential.” The best way to do this is to combine, or layer, various types of lighting in the room. And this doesn’t have to mean a full kitchen remodel: “Adding a little accent lighting — like soft LED strips or a small countertop lamp — can bring charm and personality to the space,” Coates says. Switching to dimmers is another low-effort way to regain control of your lighting, especially if you’re married to (or stuck with) recessed lighting. “Imagine having just one volume on your television … doesn’t make much sense, does it?” Coates says. You can replace standard light switches with inexpensive dimmer switches quite easily. This Philips Hue Smart Dimmer Switch includes a remote, so you can change the vibe in your space without even getting off the couch.   Under-cabinet lighting is another simple addition that creates warm layers of lighting in your space. According to Coates, “reflective surfaces like glossy tiles can also help bounce light around, making the kitchen feel brighter and larger.” Installing under-cabinet lighting is typically quick and inexpensive. Philips Hue Indoor LED light strips simply stick in place and can be cut to fit any space. The color-changing lights match any mood and are controlled with an app or voice assistant. If you prefer individual lights, try these Brilliant Evolution LED light pucks or GE Wireless LED puck lights that are stick-on, battery-operated disks that illuminate with one touch. Sconces and pendant lighting add another layer of lighting to create an inviting space. Depending on your kitchen layout, Cantley likes to add sconces or a hanging light fixture either over the island or the kitchen table (but never both, which can feel busy!).By strategically lighting your kitchen on multiple planes, you’ll have the illumination you need to accomplish culinary tasks, and the control to dim things down for an intimate meal. A few well-placed bulbs can transform your kitchen from sterile-feeling to the inviting heart of your home.What do you think about these lighting mistakes and expert tricks?
