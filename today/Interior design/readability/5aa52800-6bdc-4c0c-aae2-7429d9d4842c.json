  "text": "In a poignant intersection of art and environmental awareness, Franco-Croatian artist and paper designer Ana Brecevic has unveiled her recent series, “Plasticum.” This serves as a powerful visual commentary on the ever-growing crisis of plastic pollution in the Earth’s oceans. Brecevic, whose artistic focus revolves around the living world, draws inspiration from her life between two countries and a deep concern for the escalating loss of biodiversity in both regions, particularly the deterioration of the Croatian Mediterranean coast. Her experiences have fueled the sensitivity of her work, inspiring the themes she explores through her intricate creations. “Plasticum” directly confronts the invisible yet pervasive threat of plastic pollution in our oceans. The series juxtaposes the inherent beauty of marine ecosystems with their alarming vulnerability to human impact. Brecevic meticulously hand-cuts silhouettes of bleached corals and delicate gorgonians, also known as sea fans. These paper forms, reminiscent of fragile underwater life, are then adorned with “baubles” that starkly resemble plastic debris. Designer: Ana Brecevic At the heart of “Plasticum’s” design is the conscious choice of materials. Brecevic exclusively utilizes recycled paper, upcycled fabrics, and natural dyes. This deliberate selection directly mirrors the series’ theme, transforming discarded materials into poignant representations of environmental degradation. Her technique involves meticulously cutting silhouettes of delicate marine forms, specifically bleached corals and gorgonians (sea fans). This intricate process highlights the fragility and beauty of these underwater organisms, which are directly threatened by pollution. The forms Brecevic creates are immediately recognizable as marine life, albeit in a spectral, “bleached” state. This visual cue poignantly references the coral bleaching phenomenon, a direct consequence of environmental stress. What elevates the design is the stark contrast introduced by the ornamentation of these delicate forms with “baubles reminiscent of debris.” These additions, made from the same recycled and upcycled materials, mimic the appearance of plastic fragments, microplastics, and other pollutants that are choking our oceans. This juxtaposition is crucial to the series’ aesthetic, forcing viewers to confront the beauty of marine ecosystems alongside the ugliness of human-generated waste. In essence, the design of “Plasticum” is integral to its message. The choice of recycled materials, the delicate yet ghostly forms, and the contrasting “debris” all work in harmony to create a powerful visual narrative about the urgent need to address ocean plastic pollution. Brecevic’s meticulous craftsmanship transforms what might be considered waste into objects of artistic merit, compelling viewers to reconsider their relationship with plastic and its impact on the fragile beauty of the underwater world.",
