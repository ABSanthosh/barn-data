I don’t mind making new seasonal decor purchases when I see something when out and about that I love, but for the most part, what I really crave is coming across creative ideas for my home and life. My mind lights up when I see creativity being used, especially if the decor items are made by repurposing something or use paint, fabric, or wood scraps. Last week my friend, Alison told me about a table setting and floral centerpiece that were assembled for a charity event hosted at her sister’s art gallery in Naples, Florida. She texted me a few photos of the event. After scrolling through them I knew I had to share them with you. The charity luncheon was for the Naples Botanical Garden’s Leadership Council, hosted at Amy Art Gallery + Studio. As you can see the entire table setting for the event is very colorful and inviting. The table sparked my interest right away, but it was not what I truly loved about the table setting. I also smiled when I found out that the attendees of the event had fun painting cutout wood dolls on stands. They could take these home to use as decor in their homes. I would have loved to see all of them lined up after they were painted to see how each attendee’s personal style and color choices differed. What I loved most though about the table setting was the very creative use of craft paint to create the real floral centerpiece for the table. I have painted real flowers myself before, but never like this. If you look closely at the white roses you can see they are colorful, but you might not be sure how they got that way. Each rosebud is real. They were splatter-painted with different colors of craft paint to coordinate with the colorful melamine dinner plates around the long table. I loved this idea! It was perfect for an event held in an art gallery that is all about art and creative expression using paint. Splattering paint over anything is easy to do and you may even have the craft paint on hand to do it without having to buy new paint. You may never have the need to paint rosebuds, but the idea takeaway that I wanted to share with you is that when doing anything, never forget to take the time to think out-of-the-box to come up with creative and unique ways to do anything in life, especially when decorating or entertaining in your home.
