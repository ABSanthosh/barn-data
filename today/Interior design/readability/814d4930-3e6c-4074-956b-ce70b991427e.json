  "description": "The owners of this Mornington Peninsula property briefed landscape architect Phillip Withers to bring a ‘slice of the Blairgowrie foreshore into their home.’ With the luxury of a generous site and some existing coastal vegetation, Phillip’s team were able to expand on the existing environment with complementary native grasses, perennials, edibles and boulders. The result feels like an extension of nearby Koonya Beach, translated to fit a residential context.",

  "text": "The naturalistic layering of this Mornington Peninsula garden was designed by landscape architecture studio Phillip Withers to create the perception of walking on nearby Koonya Beach. The garden’s predominately coastal planting palette achieves this, while simultaneously introducing well proportioned zones with natives, perennials, some edible species. Phillip’s starting point for the new garden was existing vegetation, particularly two large Acer negundo (box elder) and a Leptospermum laevigatum (coastal tea tree) on the Blairgowrie site. Locally sourced boulders were selected to define various zones, including the grand entrance framed by sculptural Banksia integrifolia (coast banksia) and Banksia marginata (silver banksia). Connection to the accompanying house on site, designed by MA+Co, is facilitated in the use of concrete steppers. Cream coloured limestone is meanwhile reminiscent of local limestone, contrasted against the matte black facade of the house. In the back garden, a mixed palette of soft grasses, shrubs, and perennials sits alongside more rugged coastal species. ‘With existing significant trees, such as the magnificent Banksia integrifolia, the clients hoped to integrate local coastal plants into the palette and bring a slice of the Blairgowrie foreshore into their home,’ says Phillip. Sculptural species add height and dimension including Agave americana (century americana), Doryanthes excelsa (gymea lily), and Xanthorrhoea australis (grass tree). Flowers such as Sedum ‘Autumn Joy’, Persicaria affinis ‘Dimity’ (Himalayan knotweed), and Echinops ritro ‘Veitch’s Blue’ (globe thistle) inspire intrigue and seasonality. Last but not least, edible plants were incorporated into the garden including Meyer lemon Washington navel orange, olive, pomegranate, and feijoa trees. Residents can meander through the planted spaces on the generous site (2700 square metres) to arrive at the pool, tennis court, basketball court, and firepit, creating a ‘wonderful leisure filled escape,’ as Phillip describes it. The garden is ephemeral, looking vastly different throughout the year depending on seasonality and maturity, particularly around the pool. ‘The combination of native grasses and perennials create a dynamic wave of green, blue and pink that sways gently in the breeze,’ says Phillip. A corten steel rod curves through the garden beds, enhancing the sense of movement throughout the landscape. ‘It never ceases to provide throughout the year,’ Phillip says.",
