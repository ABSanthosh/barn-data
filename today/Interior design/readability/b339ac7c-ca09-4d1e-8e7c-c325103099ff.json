  "text": "I legitimately gasped when I saw this appliance in my news feed. Yes, waffles are just pancakes optimized for better surface area and pockets to carry butter or syrup… but what if the waffle weren’t flat? What if it were bowl-shaped? Just imagine not having to precariously balance whipped cream and berries on top of a stack of waffles when you could just put the toppings INSIDE the waffle? Sounds revolutionary, and something most dudes would absolutely love. Yes, I know Father’s Day is just around the corner, but Bro Love is permanent; so in case you’re looking to self-pamper, or gift this to a dad (or even a non-dad) in your life, this might just be the only acceptable way to eat waffles from now on. Designer: Presto Click Here to Buy Now I can’t begin to tell you how much my mind is blown. Here’s a small nugget of information for people who don’t know me – I love food, I love gadgets, and I love creativity. The Presto Waffle Bowl Maker scratches every one of those itches PERFECTLY. Ladle your batter in, shut the lid, wait for a bit, and you’ve got a literal edible bowl made of waffle batter. The bowl measures 4-inches wide, making it perfect for breakfast or even snacks. The possibilities are dizzying if you think about it. Imagine filling your waffle bowl with fruits and syrup for a nice breakfast. Or a thick soup for an impromptu meal. Chuck salsa, ranch, or guac in and you’ve got a perfect dipping bowl for all sorts of condiments. Heck, even hummus works in a pinch. Not a savory or brekkie person? Heck, load it up with scoops of ice cream. Chuck some Maltesers in. Maybe popcorn. The best part of the experience is that there’s no cleanup afterwards. The bowl is literally the dessert once you’re done with your meal. Keep a jar of Nutella or Cool Whip handy and just break off parts of your bowl and eat them once you’re done. The perfect way to end a meal… and no loading the dishwasher either. I’m thoroughly impressed. Click Here to Buy Now",
