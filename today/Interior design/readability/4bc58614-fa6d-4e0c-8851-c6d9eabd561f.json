  "description": "Byron Bay is arguably one of the most relaxing places in Australia, with plenty of dreamy getaways dotted around the NSW coastal region. But Neil and Krystal Hipwell’s two newly built holiday homes offer something a little different. Bunker Byron and Banks At Byron are positioned together on one block, giving large groups the rare chance to stay together, right in the heart of town. Each of the accommodations has its own distinctive personality inside, complete with timeless furniture from King Living.",

  "text": "Bunker Escapes founders Krystal and Neil Hipwell (director of Futureflip) dreamed about creating the ultimate Byron Bay escape for almost a decade before bringing it to life. ‘After we had our wedding here in Byron — over 11 years ago — we realised that there was a real lack of accommodation that catered for larger groups situated in the heart of town,’ Krystal says. In 2023 they found the perfect block and moved their family of five to live on the building site, which was big enough to create not one, but two luxury holiday rentals. The first, Banks at Byron, is a contemporary take on the area’s quintessential coastal luxe style, with seven bedrooms that sleep up to 18 guests. Meanwhile Bunker Byron, is a modern, brutalist-inspired ‘concrete jungle’, softened by serene landscaping and pops of green throughout the interiors. It sleeps up to 14 people and also has an impressive rooftop ‘recovery space’ — featuring a yoga studio, gym equipment, barrel sauna, ice bath, and hot tub. ‘We really wanted to create two totally different aesthetics,’ Krystal says. She worked with King Living’s trade program, King Trade to style each of the homes with durable and high-quality pieces that reflect the two distinctive looks. ‘Comfort is the number one must for any holiday accommodation, which is why we knew that partnering with King Living was going to serve our guests well,’ she adds. With pastel colours, curved venetian plaster walls, and a spiral staircase, Banks’ living room was the perfect setting for the 1977 Sofa in the Biscotti colourway. Over in the moodier Bunker Byron, the feature is a spectacular sunken lounge — one of Krystal’s last-minute design changes. ‘As Neil was literally prepping for the concrete pour, I decided I just had to have this sunken lounge,’ she says of the custom conversation pit, upholstered in rich green velvet fabric from King Living. ‘It’s become one of my favourite features of the home.’ As part of Krystal and Neil’s focus on wellness, all of the bedrooms across both properties are complete with personalised mattresses from the Sleep+ collection, ensuring every guest can enjoy a good nights sleep. There’s no shortage of serene indoor-outdoor spaces in either of the homes, and the best part is, they’re completely private. Like luxury resort, just for you and your favourite people!
