  "text": "Even though a lot of kids now are not able to tell time by looking at a wall clock, there are still a lot of people who like having an actual clock hanging in their home. There is also no lack of product designers trying to create unique looking and even environmentally friendly designs for these analog time tellers. While we can always glance at our phones to tell time, there’s still something comforting about looking at the wall to tell time. Designer: Yuichi Nara The SiO2 Clock is created from diatomaceous earth that is found in large quantities in the Noto region in Japan. This material is normally used to make bricks and stoves but there are a lot of discarded waste material that just contributes to waste. So they used these unused materials and used a plastering technique traditional to the town of Kanazawa to create an eco-friendly and traditionally and locally-based wall clock. There’s nothing really different about the basic design of the clock compared to others but because of the material and the technique used, it gives off a very earthy and warm vibe. It also employs a 3-D design achieved through die-cutting and distortion-free molding so there are shadows cast from the hands to tell time. The SiO2 logo displayed on the clock above the hands is not just the name of the product but is also the chemical symbol of the main component of the diatomaceous earth. It’s available in several earthy colors (white, gray) but there’s also green and pink for those that may like a muted splash of color.",
