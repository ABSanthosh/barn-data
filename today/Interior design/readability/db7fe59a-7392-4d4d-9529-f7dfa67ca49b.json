  "description": "This art deco-style building in Newcastle is part-dream home, part-investment property. It’s a mixed-used building, with a ground-floor commercial space that’s currently leased out and a two-storey loft apartment above, revealing architectural arches after the 1800s building was reimagined in the 1930s. The elegant building is now on the market, giving a new owner the chance to move into this unique two-in-one — located just a block away from the beach and the harbour!",

  "text": "Today, this art deco-style building in Newcastle features a ground-floor commercial space used as a real estate agency’s office and a two-storey apartment above. But the property’s current owner says it’s had a colourful past. ‘It’s been a restaurant and dining rooms — ladies area was upstairs, they had their own floor — a travel agency, locksmith, bookmaker, insurance company and much loved doctor’s office,’ vendor Jen Robinson says. ‘Most properties with a history are dark and cold. But this building is filled with light, plus it’s warm in winter and cool in summer.’ Jen came across the listing at 59 Hunter Street about four years ago, after hunting for a mixed-use property exactly like it. ‘Extra income plus a home was my plan. Everything I looked at in Sydney was an astronomical price for a small property,’ she says. Aside from being a good financial investment (with the rental returns currently bringing $44,000 a year) the late 1800s building had plenty of architectural appeal. It was reportedly reimagined by architect W.D Jeater in the 1930s, who reimagined the building’s ‘amazing ceilings, beautiful arched frames, and the gorgeous tiled facade’ in line with art deco flair. Then, about a decade ago, local architects Shaddocks converted the property into the separate commercial space and residential apartment as it stands today. Now, the loft-style, one-bedroom floorplan features a sweeping wall of joinery, which Jen has used to create an enviable personal library. She’s also installed Caravaggio pendant lights in the kitchen, commissioned new bespoke cabinetry, and restored the plaster ceiling with green accents since moving into the eclectic abode. In addition to having a covered alfresco area, Jen’s enjoyed the private rooftop garden as part of her calming sanctuary. ‘[The building] is huge, over 300 square metres combined,’ she adds. ‘That’s bigger than many suburban homes, yet it’s right in the centre of town, and a block from both the beach and the harbour. That doesn’t exist in Sydney. Newcastle is a jewel.’ 59 Hunter Street, Newcastle, NSW is for sale with Mavis Real Estate and will go to auction in late November.",
