  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Happy June 1st. This past week I did something very exciting. Something that I should have done weeks ago after pollen season was over. I did some deep-dive spring cleaning. I know exciting, right? :-) It was something that had to be done – long overdue, but more importantly I wanted the windows in my house to look summery like the windows in the photo above. I started by removing the screens from the windows in the house and took them outside to give each one a good soapy scrub with a scrub brush and hosing off. I clean the glass on the windows and sliding glass doors all the time, but the screens just get a dusting or a going over with the nozzle of the vacuum hose. It wasn’t a fun job and one that I didn’t think would make a decorative difference, but I was happily rewarded for my efforts when I placed each screen back in the windows and saw what a difference cleaning them made. If your window screens haven’t been cleaned in awhile, I highly recommend taking the time and effort to get them cleaned. Now I have to do the screen doors… slow and steady will get them all done before the first day of summer arrives. :-) If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
