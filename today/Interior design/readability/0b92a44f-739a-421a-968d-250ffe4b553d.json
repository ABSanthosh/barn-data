  "text": "The Wabi Apartment in Riyadh, designed by Nshan Manougian, is where the Japandi design comes to life. We see soft neutrals, honest materials, and a deep sense of calm. Together, these elements blend together Scandinavian and Japanese charm—and intentionally. Let’s walk through the Wabi Apartment and see how every detail celebrates stillness. The living area invites you in with its low-profile sectional, upholstered in soft, natural fabric and perched on a minimal wooden base. This is paired with a sculptural lounge chair and a sleek, square coffee table. Simultaneously, the space is bathed in light from sheer floor-to-ceiling curtains. A cluster of pendant lights hangs above like paper lanterns, creating a soft rhythm. Moving into the kitchen, the warmth continues through flat-panel cabinetry in walnut tones. This is then accented by smooth white marble counters and backsplash. The island is both functional and sculptural—anchored by a unique, lantern-like pendant that adds softness. Subtle black fixtures provide contrast. The dining area is beautifully integrated, sitting beneath a pair of tiered pendant lights. A solid wood table is flanked by minimalist chairs and a bench with soft bolsters. Behind it, delicate Japanese-style wall panels with hand-painted plum blossoms offer a poetic backdrop. This bedroom features a low-slung bed, framed by integrated nightstands and softly glowing amber lamps that cast a gentle, golden hue. A feature wall of woven-style panels adds both texture and depth. To the side, a built-in desk and open shelving create a seamless flow between rest and quiet productivity. Finally, Shoji-style wardrobe doors bring a distinct Japanese influence to the room. The second bedroom in the Wabi Apartment is a quiet celebration of contrast. A low platform bed anchors the room with a sense of purpose and stillness, while the vertical stone panel behind it introduces an organic texture. To one side, a sculptural vanity setup with an undulating mirror offers personality. The light fixture above—woven and glowing—adds a subtle nod to traditional Japanese craft. Opposite the bed, a beautifully crafted storage wall brings in rhythm and order. Perforated cane panels slide open to reveal shelving. In true Japandi fashion, the kids’ room in The Wabi Apartment is a space that honors childhood curiosity without compromising on calm and cohesive design. The room features a built-in climbing gym with ropes, rings, and a mini climbing wall—encouraging movement and imagination. Just beside it, a custom bunk bed setup encourages a restful sleep. Storage is cleverly concealed behind cane-paneled cabinetry, while a cozy reading bench by the window offers the perfect pause for quiet moments. Finally, a compact, sculptural desk invites creativity without clutter. The bathroom in The Wabi Apartment is clad in warm stone-toned tiles with subtle texture. A floating concrete vanity, paired with matte black fixtures and an illuminated mirror, adds sculptural depth. The walk-in shower, framed by minimalist black grid glass, continues the Japandi language of clean lines and timeless materials.",
