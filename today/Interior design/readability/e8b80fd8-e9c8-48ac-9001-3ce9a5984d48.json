All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Westend61/Getty ImagesLet’s be real: Standard dorm desk chairs are never pretty. They’re usually wooden and boring with a (probably dirty-ish) colored seat cushion that actually isn’t soft at all.  Because you have no choice in picking your dorm room furniture,  you’re just stuck with whatever chair you get. And realistically, you can’t decorate your chair, because you have to return it to its original state by the end of the year. Given all that, I just dealt with my desk chair during my freshman year, and so did everyone else I knew. So when I spotted Mazzy Williams’ (@mazzy_williams) TikTok about using a dining room chair cover to upgrade a dorm chair, I was shocked at how much it can elevate the look of the chair. Williams got the idea from a friend and went ahead and bought this set of two to split with a roommate. One person commented, “this is so so cute.”These particular chair covers are currently on sale for $14.44 for a two-pack on Amazon (full price is $16.99) and come in various colors like white, black, chocolate, and gray. You can choose your color to match your dorm aesthetic. Even though dorm desk chairs aren’t necessarily the same size as dining room chairs, these covers still worked for Williams thanks to their easily stretchable material — they’re puckered at the top with a flowy skirt at the bottom. Of course, you’ll need to check to see if they’d fit your own desk chair dimensions. I would buy the light khaki option (even though it’s currently unavailable) for my college apartment desk chair because it matches my boho aesthetic the most. I would also use these slipcovers on the chairs around my actual dining room table and get them in white to match that area’s vibe. It’s hard to believe, but these fun chair covers could make a boring, old dorm desk chair look curated to your dorm design!This post originally appeared on Dorm Therapy.
