  "description": "Here's an interesting way to solve a problem with form. Your typical projector comes with adjustable feet or an adjustable stand in order for you to select the appropriate angle of projection. But this PlayCube Projector, by Chinese manufacturer TCL, borrows from a certain popular puzzle to provide angle adjustments: \"Inspired by the Rubik's Cube, TCL PlayCube Projector has a unique rotating mechanism, bringing fun to home and outdoor use. Its compact cube design delivers 750 ISO lumen high-quality projection, with flexible angle adjustments through a patented rotation, requiring no external stand.\" This seems like one of those ideas that looked great at the napkin stage. I imagine in real life it would be fiddly to use; the rotating mechanism needs to be \"sticky\" enough to hold its position, yet smooth enough to allow for fine adjustments. TCL says the PlayCube will hit the market later this year, though they've yet to announce pricing.",
