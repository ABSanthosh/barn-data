  "description": "If you've got your smartphone in a protective case, chances are it's plastic. For those that prefer a more natural material—and are willing to leave your phone naked while in use—leather goods company Hard Graft offers this $126 Masterpiece iPhone Case, which is about as minimalist as you can get. These are artisan-made in Italy, using full-grain vegetable-tanned leather sourced from Tuscany. The interior is soft and suede-like, and the edges are hand-painted. The case is attractive in a less-is-more kind of way, but I'm not sure how practical it would be over time; leather has a tendency to stretch, and a protective case is no good if your phone can slide out of it. The company says \"To avoid stretching the leather, push the bottom of the case, while pulling on the top of your device.\" In other words, you have to adjust to the object, the object doesn't adjust to you. The things people do for luxury.",
