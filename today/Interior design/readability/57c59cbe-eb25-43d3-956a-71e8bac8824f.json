It’s a vulnerable, comforting space, one we should treat well so we can spend our nights in bliss. To ensure that comfort, we need to look at the quality of the fabrics that swaddle us each night, our bedding. Here’s a complete guide to every layer of bedding you should have and how to pick the best. 1. Sheets Sheets are the first layer of your bedding, the part you feel closest to when you sleep. Your sheets include your fitted mattress cover as well as a top sheet, the layer between you and your comforter, though some people opt out of using a top sheet entirely. Prioritize softness and breathability, especially if you run hot at night. Look for natural materials like cotton or linen, which are not only durable, but also only improve with time and washing. Pay attention to thread count, but don’t overemphasize it—anything between 200 and 400 is often ideal. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / wirestock 2. Mattress Protector A mattress protector, though often forgotten, plays a big role in the longevity of your bed. It goes atop the mattress but under your fitted sheet, and it, as the name implies, protects your mattress from natural body oils, sweat, spills, dust, other allergens, and a great number of other things. It keeps them all from seeping into your mattress and thus degrading it (or irritating you) over time. There are many types and materials of mattress protectors, and many do the job just fine, so what you’ll want to look for are ones that have a waterproof layer, don’t trap heat, and don’t crinkle or make unnecessary noise as you move.

Your choice depends on how you sleep, since back sleepers may prefer something flatter for neck support, while side sleepers benefit from firmer, thicker options. Materials matter here too. Memory foam molds to your head and neck, and are thus very supportive, while down pillows are more comfort-forward. You might even need a different shape of pillow entirely! This is one piece you should do a fair share of research on to make sure you’re getting what you need. Don’t forget to study the signs that a pillow needs replacing!

It’s the largest, fluffiest blanket that also serves as the top layer for your setup.  If you’re prone to overheating, look for moisture-wicking fabrics or lighter options. For all-season comfort, consider a medium-weight down or synthetic fill. Duvet covers make it easy to switch up your room’s aesthetic without a complete overhaul, while comforters are made with one set design. The style or color you pick might look great in your room, sure, but don’t forget to focus on how the material feels against your skin. It’s not worth the cute aesthetic if it makes you uncomfortable! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz 5. Decorative Layers The final touches like throws, quilts, and decorative pillows are what make your bed feel complete. These are where you can experiment with textures, colors, and patterns to reflect your style, the seasons, or your desired level of luxury. A knit blanket draped at the foot of the bed or a patterned quilt adds coziness and individuality to your space. Some extra pillows stacked at the headboard can make an otherwise simple bed seem much fancier. Remember not to go overboard though, too many extras can make your bed look cluttered rather than inviting. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Lazy_Bear When choosing your bedding, think about what makes you feel calm and cared for. Your bed isn’t just a place to sleep, it’s where you unwind, dream, and recharge, so take your time when shopping for each of the pieces listed here. Don’t just go for what you think looks good, make sure it will take care of you properly by both feeling comfortable and being durable. Proper sleep is what sets you up for a better day, every day, so put some thought and effort into the spot that will hold you while you rest!
