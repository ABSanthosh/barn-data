  "description": "A decorative, DIY way to hide TV electronics and components in style. While I was designing our HUGE entertainment center project in our basement, I wanted to make sure we could hide the cable box and stereo system receiver out of the way. I didn't want to look at them every day, but we needed to be able to access them easily of course.  Thankfully there's an easy way to do that if you are stashing these electronics inside a cabinet or console. I've shared how to add metal sheeting to cabinet doors before, (you can see the fireplace makeover at our old house there) but this time it was even simpler. I figured I'd share how I did it.  Why add metal sheeting you ask? Well when you hide electronic components hidden away, it's best to give them some air flow. Otherwise they run hot and that will shorten the life of the components. Also, your remotes won't work through a wood cabinet door, but will through metal sheeting.**You can also use an RF remote control system that allows you to keep your TV electronics in another room -- I'll add a link to that at the end of the post. We didn't want to use that because we use the voice controls often.  Here's a reminder of how this project ended up:  This is one of my favorite projects I've ever tackled!     I cut the back out of two of the bottom bench cabinets in preparation for the electronics to be added later. We knew we'd have a receiver down there at the very least, and I wanted to allow for more air flow and access from the backs of the cabinets.  A few weeks ago we had the first part of our sound system installed, and every time we turned on the TV we had to open the cabinet to get the remote to work. Then a cat or two would crawl back there...so I knew it was time to get those door fronts replaced.  I removed the cabinet doors from the hinges and used a large drill bit to make holes in the four corners of the front panel.

This takes a little bit more of a steady hand but it doesn't have to be perfect! I had plenty of spots that weren't perfectly flush:  It worked really well! I cleaned all of that up and touched up the inside parts with the paint color, Westchester Gray by Sherwin-Williams.  Last time I did this I used a silver metal sheeting with a dark gray on our old fireplace built ins. This time I picked a brass/copper finish that matched our brass hardware. These sheets come in a few colors and designs. Just figure out the size you'll need and then it can be cut with regular scissors. This sheeting is very thin!  I used my stapler to secure the metal to the back of the cabinet frame:  It went into the sheeting easily -- but you may have to pound the staples in so they're flush with the wood.  The rough edges of the sheeting aren't crazy sharp -- I wouldn't rub my fingers along them on purpose but they won't cut you just by touching it. You can add some small trim over the edges if you are worried about those.  It looked even better than I expected! LOVE it:  You can find links to the brass hardware I used here. I really like the design on these metal sheets -- that look is called Lincane.  I know I say this all the time, but don't let anyone tell you you can have both form and function. It just takes some creativity (or an internet search!) to make it happen. :)  The remote works perfectly through the sheeting -- so no need to open the doors anymore. Here's how the space looks now:  I'm considering adding it to all three lower cabinets, but I don't really want to spend more money when I like it as it is! This stuff isn't crazy expensive, but I can only get one door out of each sheet. You can find these at most hardware stores or I'll share some online sources below. These sheets are a great option if you need remote control access in a built in unit, but they also just look great as a custom accent on any cabinet! You can also use glass or cane webbing if you'd rather not use the metal. Here are a few screen options to hide your electronics:  This metal mesh would give you a modern look  Use this roll of rattan cane for a traditional or transitional look Share this",
