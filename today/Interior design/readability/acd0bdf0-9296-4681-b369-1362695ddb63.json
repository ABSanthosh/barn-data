  "description": "It’s always a good news story when a 1970s house falls into the right hands. This house belongs to Barry Plant Highton director Kieron Hunter who purchased the house after listing the property for sale. Working with architects Made For, furniture curators Wildflower, and builder Clarke and Co, the brick and timber bones of Kieron’s circa 1979 house have been repaired and enhanced — introducing a more open kitchen and playful use of color.

  "text": "Real estate agent Kieron Hunter seemingly ‘manifested’ his Highton, Geelong house. Cara Stizza, founder of Wildflower retells the story, ‘He had just been the underbidder on a house around the corner, missing out by only a few grand. ‘After the auction, he had gone for a drive and ended up falling in love with this house. He decided to knock on the door to see if they had any interest in selling. ‘When nobody was home, he left and didn’t pursue it any further. Three days later his phone rang, and it was the owner of the property wanting to list her house.’ Other agents had said the house needed significant work before being ready for market, so the owner was delighted to discover an agent who appreciated its current state. Kieron’s agency ran a full campaign on the property, but in the end, he couldn’t let it go to another buyer. ‘He ended up being the winning bidder,’ says Cara. The agent’s love of the home is evident in its renovated kitchen and bathroom  — designed in collaboration by architects Made For and furniture curators Wildflower — which lean into the original 1979 design by architect Nicholas Day. ‘The kitchen felt very closed off to the rest of the house — even though it was in the middle of both living areas — so we wanted to find a way to open the space up a little more, so you weren’t distracted by the closed off wall next to the sunken lounge,’ says Cara. Made For and Wildflower designed and reconfigured these spaces, while repairing important existing features (including rotten western red cedar timber beams), and enhancing the use of colour. ‘We work in the same office, so we were always bouncing ideas off each other to ensure that every element worked together harmoniously,’ says Cara. The red brick walls, slate floors, and rich timber surfaces remain the hero, complemented by a more playful furniture scheme, plus terracotta and mustard tiled benches in the kitchen (Artedomus Antilia), bathroom, and en suite (Artedomus Cotto Manetti). Cara explains, ‘The cedar and the brick became overpowering when not paired with the correct furniture or colours… It really needed the right shapes and textures that sat in the house with ease and didn’t fight with it.’ Clarke and Co builders managed the project demo, build, and management of joinery delivery and installation. ‘They were incredible at making sure the details worked, ensuring that the bullnose detail on the tiled bench work was done to a high standard,’ says Cara. Of all the projects she’s designed, architect Katie Checken of Made For says she’s most proud of this one. ‘I truly think we were able to fulfil the client’s brief of designed spaces that feel warm, inviting, and calm.’ Likewise, Cara and the Wildflower team couldn’t be more pleased with the project outcome. ‘I’m most proud of how we pushed some of the textures that the client wasn’t originally sure about,’ she says. ‘Being able to layer patterns together is what makes these spaces truly special and unique.’",
