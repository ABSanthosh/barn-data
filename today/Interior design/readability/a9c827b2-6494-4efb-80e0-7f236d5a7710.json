  "description": "Britas and other popular water filtration systems are often made of plastic. For those who prefer metal, there are stainless steel offerings from Berkey and Boroux, shown below. Well-considered industrial design is about the transitions. The equatorial seam on both the Berkey and Boroux units is probably cost-effective, but lends these units an institutional look. In contrast, a startup called Rorra produces a more designey stainless steel offering: Rorra's more flowing form gives you the impression the designer(s) sweated the details. To me it's a lot easier on the eyes. There are a couple of caveats with the Rorra. One is that it requires four AAA batteries. These do not power the filtration—the unit is gravity-fed, as are the competitors'—but provide the juice for the filter replacement notification light. Which leads us to the second caveat. All water filtration systems require the user to periodically replace the filter. And the filters for these three manufacturers are proprietary, meaning if they go out of business, you've now got a worthless stainless steel artifact. Berkey has been around for over 30 years, providing some peace of mind as to their longevity. Boroux is a bit newer, having launched around 2016. Rorra, the newcomer, came on the market in 2020. With any luck their offering's better looks will lead to market longevity, but anytime you buy something from a new company that requires replacement parts, you are taking a gamble.",
