  "text": "You’re spending a weekend away in a cabin in the woods with friends. It’s a relaxing and comforting retreat, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. And what would make this time even more special? An off-grid hot tub designed for friends, helping you soak your worries away! Based in Bowen Island, British Columbia, Goodland designed a Group Wood Burning Hot Tub, a wonderful example of a thoughtful outdoor design. This larger-capacity model expands on the brand’s original wood-fired concept, accommodating four adults in a space that prefers shared experiences over solitary soaking. The Canadian studio has crafted something that transcends typical hot tub functionality, creating a vessel for connection that celebrates the entire ritual of outdoor bathing. At $10,499, this piece represents a pretty large investment in both materials and philosophy. The construction methodology reveals Goodland’s commitment to lasting quality through material selection. Marine-grade aluminum forms the structural foundation, paired with sustainably sourced western red cedar and thermally treated Nordic pine. Hand-sanded cedar surfaces meet double-welded aluminum seams, while brass and oak details punctuate the composition with understated sophistication. Designer: Goodland Measuring 91.5 inches long by 49 inches wide, the Group Tub provides substantial capacity without overwhelming smaller outdoor spaces. The wood-burning heating system eliminates dependence on electrical connections or gas lines, making it suitable for remote locations where traditional hot tubs fail. Setup requires just 15 minutes and basic tools, transforming from shipping components to a functional bathing vessel with remarkable efficiency. The design accommodates natural water sources, extending its utility beyond conventional backyard installations. The user experience centers on ritual and preparation rather than instant gratification. Gathering wood, building a fire, and waiting for the water temperature create an intentional pause in our accelerated daily rhythms. Founder Craig Pearce describes this approach as placing value on pleasure over productivity, and transforming what could be a simple soaking into a meaningful outdoor ceremony. The extended heating process becomes meditation, connecting users to natural cycles often absent from modern convenience. Sustainability principles guide both material selection and manufacturing processes. Every component maintains recyclability or sustainable sourcing credentials, positioning the tub as a conscious alternative to chemical-dependent traditional models. The western red cedar interior provides natural antimicrobial properties while the aluminum structure ensures decades of reliable performance. The Group Wood Burning Hot Tub occupies unique territory in the outdoor living market, merging functional bathing equipment with an experiential design object. Its $10,499 price point reflects premium materials and Canadian craftsmanship while remaining accessible compared to high-end traditional installations. If you’re seeking outdoor bathing solutions that celebrate process alongside result, then Goodland has created a compelling option that honors both form and philosophical function.",
