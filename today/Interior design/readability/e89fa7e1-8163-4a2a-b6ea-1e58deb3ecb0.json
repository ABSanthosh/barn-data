  "text": "There are certain timeless watches that display fine craftsmanship and draw power from iconic in-house movements: The Oris ProPilot X Calibre 115 is one of them. The contemporary Oris watch flaunting titanium case and bracelet, and 10-day non-linear power reserve indicator on a fully skeletonized dial is a fine example of independent Swiss mechanical watchmaking, which has now received a zodiac makeover to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The special edition Oris ProPilot X Year of the Snake watch is limited to only 88 pieces and exudes a very attractive green hue inspired by the year of the Wood Snake, which 2025 is according to the Chinese zodiac calendar. This is the second ‘year of the snake’ edition watch we have discussed in as many days: just yesterday we covered the red-hot dialed Longines Conquest Heritage with and artistic caseback. Designer: Oris This special version of the Oris’s most innovative watches has been decorated in cyan detailing, which is inspired by the color linked with the Chinese zodiac element of wood. For a more interesting detail, the signature 10-day power reserve at 3 o’clock has been provided with a golden snake-tongue seconds hand that stands out of the symbolic green skeletonized dial. The other things including the innards of the watch remain the same as its base model. Constructed from multi-piece titanium, the watch features a 44mm case and has sapphire glass with double-sided anti-reflective coating. The dial reveals large Super-LumiNova-filled hands for hours and minutes with a subsidiary second at 7:30. The watch runs on the skeletonized Calibre 115 in-house movement which is hand-wound and has a large 10-day power reserve indicator on the dial showing the time you have before giving the watch a wind. The Oris ProPilot X Year of the Snake edition comes on a titanium strap, inside a special carry box. Priced at $9,100 it is limited to only 88 pieces; if you are interested, you may just want to hurry before stock runs out.",
