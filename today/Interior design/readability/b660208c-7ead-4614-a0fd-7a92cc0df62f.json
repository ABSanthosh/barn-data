  "text": "While most of us probably want to have some form of sustainable energy source at our homes, not every household has the right conditions to install some sort of device or system. But as we continue to look for more energy-efficient and environmentally safe ways to power our homes, expect there to be more companies that will look for urban living-friendly solutions. We will get easier and more practical ways to have things like photovoltaic power generation accessible to whatever space we’re living in. This will eventually remove some people’s excuses and/or reservations on why they cannot have things like solar panels in thier homes. The CESC Solar Parasol, a creation of gang.lab design, is making waves in sustainable outdoor solutions.Recently awarded the prestigious Red Dot Award: Product Design 2025, this innovative parasol seamlessly blends intelligent technology with sleek aesthetics, offering a glimpse into the future of urban living. More than just a stylish shade, the CESC Solar Parasol is a smart shading system designed to enhance both residential and commercial spaces, particularly balconies in high-rise buildings. It transforms previously underutilized areas into environmentally friendly and energy-efficient focal points. Designer: gang.lab design The core of the Solar Parasol lies in its integration of high-efficiency solar panels. These flexible panels are capable of generating 315W of power, effectively harnessing free energy from nature. This power can be used to illuminate the integrated 12W LED lamps, providing a warm 3500K light source for evening enjoyment of outdoor spaces. These panels are constructed with a durable aluminum alloy frame and a metal fluorocarbon coating in white. Beyond energy generation, the parasol boasts an adaptive control system that intelligently manages both energy harvesting and shading.The sun blind angle can be adjusted between 0°, 35°, and 90° within 45 seconds, allowing users to customize the shade according to their needs and the position of the sun.This operation can be conveniently controlled via a remote control or a dedicated mobile app. It’s designed for balcony mounting, transforming neglected corners into functional spaces, whether it’s a residential or commercial space. The CESC Solar Parasol by gang.lab design offers a compelling vision for the future of outdoor spaces. By integrating solar technology into everyday objects, it promotes a more environmentally conscious and energy-efficient way of living, all while enhancing the beauty and usability of our balconies and outdoor areas. This innovative product is a testament to the power of thoughtful design in creating a more sustainable future.",
