  "text": "British architect Peter Cook has revealed his design for a whimsical children’s pavilion adorned with Lego bricks, planned for construction next to the Serpentine Gallery in London. Titled the Play Pavilion, Cook crafted the vibrant geodesic structure in collaboration with the Serpentine Gallery and Danish toy manufacturer, The Lego Group. Scheduled to open on June 11 to celebrate World Play Day, Cook’s orange pavilion will be featured alongside the annual Serpentine Pavilion during the summer. This year, the adjacent pavilion is being designed by Bangladeshi architect Marina Tabassum. The Play Pavilion will be capped with a striking geodesic dome roof and feature rounded walls adorned with vibrant Lego murals. These walls will be punctuated by a variety of uniquely shaped openings, offering an intriguing visual and tactile experience. The pavilion will include an array of interactive elements, designed to foster an environment for playful exploration and creativity. Visitors will find crawling holes inviting them to embark on mini-adventures, a slide for added fun and excitement, and a small performance space that can be used for impromptu shows or gatherings. This design aims to inspire imagination and engagement among children and adults alike. Designer: Peter Cook “The Play Pavilion tantalizes by being bright, curvaceous, and strange, and on closer inspection, the acrylic skin of the enclosure erupts into delightful and inventive murals that burst out into Lego brick-built elements,” said Cook. “Entering the Play Pavilion, mysterious stalagmite-like masts reveal the intricacy and creative potential of the space. Then you see walls with long runs of Lego baseplates, with visitors invited to play and create,” he concluded. Cook sought to evoke a sense of mystery and discovery in the pavilion’s design by partially obscuring the activities taking place inside. “The Play Pavilion is an opportunity to remind the public that architecture can be cheerful as well as focused, with a degree of mystery on first sight,” said Cook. “We can see glimpses of people moving around inside, with children appearing from mystery places. Then, on entering, all is revealed. Cheerful architecture takes you beyond the day-to-day predictability of cause and effect. Just as in the tradition of pantomime, it sends you away with a smile on your face.” The Play Pavilion will feature a strong steel frame, complemented by bolt-on panels that contribute to its modular design. Its distinctive geodesic dome will be enveloped in a skin of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a durable and lightweight material known for its transparency and weather resistance. The structure is thoughtfully engineered to allow for easy disassembly, facilitating its potential relocation and reconstruction at a different site once its tenure at the Serpentine concludes on August 10. This design ensures that the pavilion can continue to inspire and delight in new settings, extending its life and impact beyond its initial installation.",
