  "description": "There is truly no other property like the North Melbourne home that’s just hit the market. Originally a separate warehouse and cottage, the current owners have spent the last decade converting and renovating the adjacent properties to create the one awe-inspiring inner-city home complete with four bedrooms, three bathrooms, two courtyards, and a rooftop deck.

  "text": "The current owners of this unique North Melbourne property always dreamed of warehouse living but couldn’t find the perfect space, so they created their own. In 2015, they purchased a former horse stable turned suspension shop, kicking off a multi-stage renovation journey over 10 years. ‘We’ve continually adapted the warehouse to meet the changing needs of our family, transforming it from a raw, open-plan studio into a multidimensional home filled with warmth and love,’ says Chevagh Pavlidis, who owns the property with her husband Kristjan. They eventually added a first floor extension to the converted warehouse, before purchasing the cottage next door. ‘This gave us the opportunity to future-proof the home with additional space, as well as create a cottage-style garden for our daughters to play in and enjoy,’ says Chevagh. Chevagh and Kristjan (a former carpenter) designed and built the project themselves to honour the property’s history while introducing a more family-friendly feel. Original warehouse features such as concrete floors and exposed trusses have been retained, alongside natural timber and curved fittings introduced to soften the space and create balance. ‘Our use of colour throughout the home is subdued and feminine,’ says Chevagh. ‘We’ve used a mix of walnut and oak finishes, coupled with soft hues of pink, purple, and blue throughout the interior, to counteract the industrial elements of the space.’ Masses of white wall space highlight ever-changing natural light and views of the property’s two courtyards: one at the front of the warehouse on entry, and the second behind the cottage. The latter is an open-air green space, with a spiral staircase leading up to the warehouse rooftop deck offering daily views of the hot air balloons floating across the city. ‘Living in an inner-city suburb and having the space to grow a garden from scratch has been a true luxury,’ says Chevagh. ‘Our aim was to blend the natural beauty of a classic cottage garden, with its abundance of flowers and winding pathways, with the sophistication and practicality of a European-style courtyard using natural stone pavers and potted trees to anchor the space… The backdrop of flowers, vines and fruiting trees add another layer of depth and serenity to the home.’ Chevagh and Kristjan are incredibly proud of their transformation that has created a large family home with outdoor space in inner-city Melbourne. ‘The ability to arrive home after a busy day, close the doors, and be completely disconnected from the city and surroundings is our favourite feature. It truly is a private sanctuary,’ says Chevagh. Spread across two titles, the property contains four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a studio across the two houses. A secure double garage is accessed via Little Provost Street. 39-41 Provost Street is now on the market for the first time since Chevagh and Kristjan’s major renovation. A true labour of love, this property presents a one-of-a-kind opportunity for a spacious and stylish family living in inner-city Melbourne! 39-41 Provost Street, North Melbourne VIC is listed for sale by expressions of interest closing August 12 with David Sanguinedo and Arthur Psarras at Jellis Craig.",
