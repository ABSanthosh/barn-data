  "text": "Half a banana, a roll of duct tape, and a seven-figure price tag. That’s all it took for Maurizio Cattelan’s “Comedian” to punch modern art in the face and kiss it on the lips. The absurdity was part of the appeal: a \\$120,000 fruit taped to a gallery wall, both universally hilarious and deeply provocative. Now, in a delicious twist, it’s been immortalized in LEGO by TheOhMyBrickBoxAdmin. LEGO’s version of Comedian lands like a wink and a nudge to anyone who’s side-eyed contemporary art or stood slack-jawed at its audacity. Built with 241 pieces, this miniature tribute includes not only the iconic banana-and-tape motif, but also a gold-accented frame that drips with pretension, satirizing the kind of art-world seriousness Cattelan’s original so gleefully mocked. It’s peak irony rendered in plastic bricks, and it’s glorious. Designer: TheOhMyBrickBoxAdmin There are two sizes included: one that stands at 16×20 studs and a smaller 6×8 version that practically begs to become a keychain. Think of it as pocket-sized postmodernism. The banana curves just-so against the gray “American tape,” replicating the slapdash charm of the real thing while keeping its humor intact. This is not an attempt to elevate the original, but to lean fully into its ridiculous legacy. The real kicker? A minifigure of Maurizio Cattelan mid-epiphany. He’s posed in front of a blank canvas, brush in hand, staring into the void of inspiration. According to TheOhMyBrickBoxAdmin, he was ready to paint a still life before being struck by the urge to simply tape up a banana. The minifig’s facial expression says everything: part dazed genius, part cheeky menace. It reframes the artist not as visionary, but as a cartoon protagonist pulling brilliance from boredom. There’s no attempt to justify the art, or the build, with pomp or pretense. That’s what makes it land. This LEGO Comedian doesn’t chase meaning, it builds the joke and walks away, grinning. It reduces high-art controversy to something you can snap together on your desk during a lunch break. It doesn’t explain the gag; it freezes it in plastic and lets you laugh on your own terms.",
