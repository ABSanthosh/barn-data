A subtle nod to nostalgic palettes of the past, yet fresh enough to fit in with modern sensibilities. Let’s get into why this color looks so good and just how beautiful a kitchen accent it could be. Feels Like Home Butter is a color that instantly feels comforting. It’s the shade of fresh-baked bread, warm pancakes, and family meals around the table. Unlike bright yellows, which can feel harsh, Butter is soft and more natural. There’s something about it that makes a space feel lived-in, familiar, and full of warmth. It’s the kind of color that doesn’t just decorate a room, it makes it feel more like home. However, it’s also very cheerful. It’s bright, it’s invigorating, and it’s a splash of sunshine that we can use both in our mornings for breakfast and in our evenings for dinner. Photo Credit: KitchenAid A New Neutral Neutrals are the backbone of most kitchens, but they don’t have to be boring, as Butter is a fresh take on neutral tones. It carries the softness of beige and cream but with a bit more personality. It pairs well with wood, stone, stainless steel, and even some bold colors. It’s a reminder that neutral doesn’t have to mean lifeless, and that a touch of warmth can change the entire feel of a kitchen. Photo Credit: KitchenAid Brings Out The Best Speaking of those bold colors, Butter pairs beautifully with some stunning shades. It softens deep greens, makes navy feel richer, and balances out crisp whites. It’s a great backdrop for colorful dishes, patterned tiles, and other mixed materials. It’s a color that enhances instead of competes, so it’s easy to work into any space. Of course, KitchenAid is releasing a stand mixer in this color, so you could introduce it into your kitchen with that, but other small appliances, dishware, or even a painted accent wall are also great places to start if you want to get in on the year’s trendiest color. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Nostalgia Meets Modern Design KitchenAid described their pick as, “Driven by the desire for comfort and nostalgia, the color yellow, with its ability to transport us back in time, evokes warm memories. While it hearkens back to the soft yellows of the 1950s or 1960s, Butter feels fresh and modern, a classic neutral.” Photo Credit: Canva Pro Butter as a color is reminiscent of kitchens from decades past, where home-cooked meals and family gatherings were the norm. But paired with modern appliances and finishes, it feels fresh and new. It’s proof that some colors never really go out of style, they just evolve, making it a great color to bring into the future with us.
