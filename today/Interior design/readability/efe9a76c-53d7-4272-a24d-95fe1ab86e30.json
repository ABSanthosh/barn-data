If you’re a student struggling with good study habits, or even a professional prone to getting distracted, and suffering from unproductivity, then there is a desk to help you through this dilemma. Named Peask, this furniture design is a ‘self-directed and focused’ desk. Designed by Minjeong Kim, Soyeong Kim, and Yumin Seo this conceptual desk design was created to help students study efficiently, inculcating healthy study habits. The designers noticed an increasing number of students feeling stressed with academic expectations, and being unable to study productively due to anxiety and a lack of self-direction. Hence, they created Peask to help students overcome these hurdles, enabling them to focus better and perform their best. Designer: Minjeong Kim, Soyeong Kim, and Yumin Seo Peask was designed to encourage students to self-study, pushing them to develop a habit where they can study by themselves, without any external pressure or force. This ‘self-directed’ study desk is equipped with multiple components and elements such as a pen holder, partitions, storage space, and a touch bar and panel. Custom height-adjustable partitions and handy storage space have been integrated to ensure students have a well-organized and tidy desk, enabling them to focus better. You can move the partitions around, to create an ideal desk setup. While the pens can be neatly organized using the additional pen holder. There is a nifty storage space placed under the desk, so users can easily store their books and other learning equipment to create the perfect study environment, where everything is easily accessible. The touch bar can be used be adjust certain settings, for example, students can set a timer to ensure they study for the required hours. They can also set their learning record to better manage their learning curve. These nifty features help students to better understand and control how much time they spend studying, and how much spend they spend on breaks. The partitions can be adjusted to differentiate between study time and break time, ensuring students focus while studying, and relax while taking a break. Currently, the Peask is a concept, but such a smart furniture design could help students improve their learning and concentration capabilities.",
