  "text": "Halfway Serious encourages collaboration between two usersHalfway Serious, a chair designed by Ahn Kihyun, examines human interaction and social behavior through a cooperative approach to furniture design. The piece requires two people to collaborate and engage with the wooden chair simultaneously, with a shared objective of maintaining balance and preventing an egg placed on the structure from falling. By doing so, the design promotes communication and mutual reliance between users through a shared experience. Following Ahn Kihyun’s first piece from the Halfway Serious series, the work takes an experimental stance on furniture, transforming its use into a performative act.all images courtesy of Ahn Kihyunwooden chair by Ahn Kihyun becomes an exercise in balanceSitting on the chair becomes an exercise in balance and coordination, evoking a heightened sense of physical awareness. The balancing mechanism integrates parallel bars with structures designed to stabilize and protect an egg placed at either end. This incorporation of fragile elements like the egg introduces tension and emphasizes the delicate equilibrium between participants. The piece, designed by Ahn Kihyun, highlights the role of furniture as more than functional objects, pushing boundaries to explore themes of fragility, collaboration, and human interaction.
