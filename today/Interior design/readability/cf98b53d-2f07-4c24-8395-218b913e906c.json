  "text": "Gradient Watch: a wearable piece of artLawa Design’s Allen Shakir and Ewa Bryzek, based in Copenhagen, conceive Gradient Watch, a minimalist analog watch that translates time into different patterns. A wearable piece of art that doesn’t just tell time, but expresses it. Gradient Watch tells time with the help of two overlapping gradients – one for hours and one for minutes – blending into different patterns as time passes. In an era dominated by smartwatches and their steady stream of distractions, Gradient Watch aims to make time reading a simple yet visually pleasing experience. Every moment is unique, and the watch’s design is a reflection of just that.all images courtesy of Lawa DesignGradient patterns blend as time passesIt may not look like it, but Gradient Watch is every bit as analog as a traditional wristwatch. Designed by architects duo Ewa Bryzek and Allen Shakir from Lawa Design, the watch is equipped with a Japanese Miyota 2025 quartz movement, running smoothly and reliably. The hands move in small increments that are barely noticeable to the naked eye resulting in a smooth movement that almost appears digital. With a case of 38 mm, Gradient Watch has a versatile size that suits both smaller and larger wrists. Its balanced proportions provide a classic look without feeling too bold or too delicate. The lugs on the watch are carefully designed to hug the wrist, enhancing comfort and offering a refined, minimalist appearance. The project is available now on Kickstarter.Gradient Watch is a minimalist analog watch that translates time into different patternsGradient Watch is an analog wristwatch, designed by Ewa Bryzek and Allen Shakir from Lawa DesignGradient Watch comes in four different colors with easily replaceable straps in leather and stainless steelthe unisex timepiece has a versatile size that suits both smaller and larger wriststhe wearable piece of art tells time with the help of two overlapping gradients | Gradient Watch blackone gradient hand for hours and one for minutes blend into different patterns as time passes | Gradient Watch goldGradient Watch aims to make time reading a simple yet visually pleasing experience | Gradient Watch blackthe watch is equipped with a Japanese Miyota 2025 quartz movement, running smoothly | Gradient Watch rose goldbalanced proportions provide a classic look without feeling too bold or too delicate | Gradient Watch silverthe lugs are designed to hug the wrist, enhancing comfort and offering a refined appearance | Gradient Watch silverproject info:name: Gradient Watch designer: Lawa Design | @lawadesignlead designers: Allen Shakir, Ewa Bryzekkickstarter: Gradient Watchdesignboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.edited by: christina vergopoulou | designboom",
