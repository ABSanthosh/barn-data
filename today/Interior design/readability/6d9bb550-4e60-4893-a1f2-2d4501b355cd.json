These smart lights are equipped with software that connects to an app or phone to automate the lighting system and it can also be controlled via smartphone using Bluetooth connectivity. The setup typically involves a combination of smart lights and smart switches that work with voice control assistants, smart TVs, and Wi-Fi thermostats. Some of the lighting options range from cool white to bluish tones alongside warm, orange-hued light with customizable color temperatures. The primary difference between conventional and smart lighting is that conventional lights can only be turned on and off or dimmed using a wired switch or remote control, while smart lights can be easily scheduled. Note that Smart lighting systems are highly versatile and available in LED bulbs, strip lights, and outdoor lighting. Additionally, these lights can easily integrate with smart home setups, they feature motion sensors and be easily scheduled. The GLORB is a cutting-edge ambient smart light that is designed to bring dynamic, customizable lighting to any space. This geodesic sphere features 80 individually illuminated triangular LED panels, each capable of producing various colors and light patterns. Unlike traditional ambient lighting, the GLORB offers a unique and visually interesting experience, with the ability to change colors, animate light patterns, and respond to audio, making it an ideal addition to modern homes or office environments. Designed for versatility, the GLORB can be used as a tabletop light or suspended from the ceiling using its included stand, which also functions as a ceiling mount. The lamp is compatible with major smart home systems, including Alexa, Philips Hue, and Home Assistant, and it supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. Additionally, the GLORB is water-resistant, making it suitable for outdoor use, such as in gardens or around swimming pools. With its energy-efficient design, customizable features, and ability to evolve through software updates, the GLORB is a premium choice for functional and aesthetic lighting needs. How Do Smart Lights Function? Smart lights are powered through a standard socket or lamp, with some models offering wireless options. The best part about smart lights is that they can be controlled via a smartphone app using Bluetooth, or connected to a hub that plugs into the Ethernet port of a Wi-Fi router, allowing remote control from anywhere. However, the disadvantage is that Bluetooth-controlled lights are limited to use within Bluetooth range. The most popular smart lighting option is smart bulbs, as they are easy to install in conventional light fixtures. These bulbs allow users to adjust the light temperature to suit different activities and times of the day. With continuous innovation in smart lighting, the Workmate is a smart LED lamp with an external screen designed to display important widgets. This enhances one’s desk setup by bridging the gap between your PC, laptop, and docked phone. It’s perfect for professionals and creatives who are working in the office or working from home. It offers features that help track productivity, such as logging work hours while the lamp’s sleek design integrates seamlessly into any workspace, providing both functionality and style. Also, the Workmate transforms into a multifunctional gadget with sensors, scanners, and a small projector that turns your desk surface into a touch-sensitive platform. This virtual widget system allows for controls like notifications, audio management, and smart lighting adjustments. With additional features like the Micrograph Pro lens for magnification and potential future applications like X-ray readings, Workmate goes beyond just lighting and transforms into an interactive accessory with a variety of useful and innovative functions. What Are the Benefits of Smart Lighting? The biggest advantage of smart lighting is the ability to create schedules that automatically turn lights on or off. For example, lights can be set to mimic a sunrise by gradually changing its color to match the time of day. Smart lights can also be controlled via timers, sensors, voice commands, or remotes. For instance, when a person enters the home, motion sensors detect movement and activate the lights. This enhances home security by illuminating lights when motion is detected, such as when a car passes outside. Additionally, lights can adjust to your reading environment, and studies show that aligning light temperature with the sun’s color boosts energy levels and overall well-being. Furthermore, these lights are long-lasting, energy-efficient, and include dimmable functions that allow users to adjust brightness levels. In this example, Smart lighting takes on a new level with the Star Bulb, which transforms light into an immersive experience. With 95 individually addressable RGB LEDs and advanced Chip-on-Board (CoB) technology, it creates dynamic and fluid light patterns that evoke the nostalgia of lava lamps with a distinctly modern vibe. Each LED can be controlled separately by offering endless customization options which include calming hues to vibrant colors that adapt perfectly to different moods. The Star Bulb also excels when paired with others and syncs seamlessly for coordinated light shows that transform the overall look of your room or any interior. It’s easily controlled through an app or integrated into your smart home system like Google Assistant, Alexa, or Apple Home, and simplifies advanced lighting systems. Designed by Moonside, the Star Bulb elevates your existing lamps into a futuristic lighting experience that offers artistic flexibility and functional smart lighting. What Are the Various Types of Smart Lighting? The revolution in smart lighting technology is transforming the way we illuminate spaces. When selecting smart lights, it is important to check their compatibility and plan for adequate smart plugs, switches, and motion sensors. The different types of smart lighting include: Smart Plugs: Allows users to turn lights and wired appliances on or off by converting them into smart devices that can be controlled via a phone app or voice commands. Smart Bulbs: Smart bulbs and downlights, can be integrated into existing fixtures to enhance traditional lighting and offer control via voice or app. Strip lights can be used to highlight architectural interior details, and create subtle backlighting or downlighting effects. Color-changing Bulbs: Available in various colors, these smart lights offer customizable lighting to suit different moods or settings. The Govee Floor Lamp Pro is a sleek, modern smart lighting solution that combines style and functionality. Standing 67 inches tall, it features a minimalist design with a durable aluminum rod and a white silicone LED strip, available in black and gray. The RGB lighting offers a variety of customization options through the Govee Home app, allowing users to adjust brightness, color, and animations to create the perfect ambiance.

The Govee Floor Lamp Pro is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control. It’s ideal for any setting, from movie nights to parties, adding both a decorative touch and dynamic lighting effects to your home.

The IKEA JETSTRÖM smart light panel combines simplicity with functionality, offering an elegant solution to smart home lighting. With a minimalist design, the 30cm x 30cm (11.8in x 11.8in) square panel features rounded corners and a soft white diffuser cover, ensuring it complements various interior styles. Its sleek, unobtrusive aesthetic makes it an ideal addition to any room, whether as a standalone piece or when grouped with additional panels.
