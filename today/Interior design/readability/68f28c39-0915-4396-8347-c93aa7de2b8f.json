  "text": "Automatic transmission cars were good, self-driving EVs even better, and now ones that can console you on a bad mood day are god sent. Yes, this is the future of mobility that’s upon us and the Robo-EV by PIX Moving Team is the living example. The micro car envisioned for choked city mobility is completely 3D-printed out in one piece making it structurally strong and easy to manufacture for commercial use. The Switzerland-based company has crafted a prototype of this bold vision and we are impressed. Designer: PIX Moving Team The real-time manufacturing processes employed in manufacturing this four-wheeler make way for complex component manufacturing, ease of customization, and of course modularity of use. There are other benefits as well including lightweight yet robust chassis and frame. The team used basalt composite to make the suspension ultra-reliable minus any bells or whistles. Even the wheel arches are made from 3D-printed metal. Its real USP lies in the smart technology embedded on the inside. Robo-EV comes with an AI system that can detect the mood and tone of the driver in real-time. Based on the data, the intelligent car can provide emotional support via its large language model. The interaction can be two-way as the car’s voice system also functions as a voice assistant. In a way, you won’t need a buddy on long trips when you’ll be driving this Swiss EV on the roads. Robo-EV touts regenerative braking adding to its reserve of battery power, and extending the total range. PIX Moving Team tested the two-seater vehicle on the road and the results have not yet been shared with media houses. The electric vehicle of the future is targeted primarily towards ridesharing and public transport domains. More than that it gives a clear vision of what the future of city transportation will be like.",
