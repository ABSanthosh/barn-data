  "text": "The Funhouse by Konpak Tiny Homes may appear simple from the outside, but its interior is full of surprises. Designed with playfulness in mind, this towable home features a spacious living room centered around a climbing wall, which leads to a distinctive netted lounge area perfect for relaxing or hanging out. Built on a sturdy triple-axle trailer, the Funhouse showcases a stylish two-tone exterior, complemented by a deck and a compact storage box for added convenience. At 8.6 meters (28 feet) long, it offers more space than the firm’s Jordy model, making it both practical and fun. Designer: Konpak Tiny Homes Entry to the Funhouse is through elegant double glass doors that open directly into the inviting living room. This central space is designed for both comfort and functionality, featuring a roomy L-shaped seating area equipped with built-in storage beneath the cushions, making it perfect for stowing away blankets, books, or other essentials. A stylish coffee table anchors the space, while large windows and ample glazing bathe the room in natural light, creating a bright and airy atmosphere. Directly above the living room is an eye-catching hangout area with a unique netted floor, reminiscent of the design used in Baluchon’s Mina model. This elevated nook is accessed by a built-in climbing wall, making it a playful spot for relaxing, reading, or simply lounging above the main living area. While the netted floor and climbing wall add a sense of fun and adventure to the home, they may not be the most practical choices for everyone—imagine needing to navigate the climbing wall in the middle of the night to access the bathroom. For those seeking more conventional options, the netted floor can be replaced with a solid loft bedroom floor, and the climbing wall can be swapped out for standard stairs to improve accessibility and convenience. The rest of the tiny house is designed with practicality in mind, without any quirky features. The nearby kitchen is well-equipped, offering an oven, sink, two-burner propane stove, fridge/freezer, washer/dryer, and ample cabinetry. It leads to a surprisingly spacious bathroom for a home of this size, complete with a shower, vanity sink, flushing toilet, and wall-mounted cabinets for storage. The Funhouse includes one main bedroom as standard—a cozy loft with a low ceiling, accessed by a staircase integrated with storage, and furnished with a comfortable double bed for restful nights. The Funhouse offers a range of customizable options to suit different needs and lifestyles. Buyers can choose features like full off-the-grid functionality, allowing for independent living with solar power and water systems, as well as the option for an outdoor shower and other tailored add-ons. The starting price for the Funhouse is US$91,000.",
