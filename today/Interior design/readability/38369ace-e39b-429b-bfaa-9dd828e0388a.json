For FIVE DAYS (started today until  July 23 at midnight CET) you can snag my FIVE bestselling classes for just €97 each. After the clock strikes twelve on Wednesday, July 23rd, they’ll disappear forever, so no re-runs, no future discounts, gone, retired, nada. Only those who enroll or took these courses in the past, will have forever access.Below you’ll find a quick taste of what’s inside each course plus the incredible guest experts who joined me. Ready? Let’s make your summer a summer of learning and growth! And remember, all of these classes are SELF-PACED and complete, so you can start taking them the moment you pay - and stop and start as you wish for the months and years to come. Pick one course, two, or more… They are each €97 which means they are 60-80% off! Really! Don’t miss this. Attract, Engage + Grow Was €497 Now €97Learn the art of Instagram strategy, email‑list building, and creative blogging alongside industry trail‑blazers including  New York Times bestselling author and Doré founder Garance Doré; Desha Peacock, founder of Sweet Spot Style; Niki Brantmark, author and voice behind My Scandinavian Home; and Paige Brunton, creator of Square Secrets™.

In addition to our four expert sessions, you’ll receive 6 modules filled with lessons from me.Guest Expert Garance Doré.

The voice behind My Scandinavian Home shares how to grow joyfully with timeless content loops that thrive despite algorithm shifts and keep followers coming back for more. Clarity  Course Was €247 Now €97Feeling a bit all over the place? The Clarity Course was designed to help you deeply understand yourself and your journey, providing you with the tools and insights to move forward with confidence and purpose. This is the mindset and vision‑mapping journey that helps you uncover (or remember) what you stand for, who you serve, and why anyone should care. Expect guided journaling, intention cards for you to download and print, and lots of tips and tricks on mindset particularly for female founders and small business owners, creatives, and content creators. Substack Masterclass Was €297 Now €97If you want to turn a free newsletter into a paid, community‑powered income stream, this is it. I walk you through building your Substack with a tour of the backend, content creation, and nurturing readers so they want to pay you. Here are two of my guest experts that share their knowledge with you in this class. These conversations were recorded over Zoom in 2024. The strategies shared are timeless and just as powerful in today’s 2025 marketplace.Guest Expert Kate Watson‑Smyth. Award‑winning British interiors journalist and stylist, best‑selling author of the Mad About The House book series, and creator of the UK’s most‑read design blog of the same name. After more than 25 years writing for titles such as The Financial Times, The Independent and Living etc, she now reaches a global audience through her wildly popular Substack newsletter (#5 on Substack in the Design category) and co‑hosts the chart‑topping interiors podcast The Great Indoors. She’ll share her beginnings on Substack and why she moved over there in the first place along with her plans moving ahead.Guest Expert Christina Loff. Christina is Substack’s Head of Lifestyle \u0026 Writer Partnerships, where she helps hundreds of lifestyle, food, design, and culture creators grow paid newsletters and deepen reader community. Before joining Substack, she spent more than a decade in book publicity and creative marketing, guiding authors and indie brands to best‑seller lists and devoted followings. She also pens two scent‑obsessed newsletters, The Dry Down Diaries and Fever Dream, proving her audience‑building know‑how in real time. In our discussion, she explains how to get your Substack up and running and how to profit from it, almost immediately. Blogging Today Was €427 Now €97Think of this as your modern blogging survival kit, without burnout, so you can grow your followers and your brand. You can expect two guest experts in this wonderful course on blogging and creating an online presence that gets you noticed, plus 6 modules packed with lessons from me.Guest Expert Bonnie Christine. Surface‑pattern designer, educator, and creator of the $5 million‑plus Immersion course, Bonnie turned a passion blog into a community so devoted her last launch cleared seven figures.Guest Expert Desha Peacock. Founder of Sweet Spot Style and long‑time retreat leader, Desha has spent over a decade turning modest mailing lists into six‑figure revenue engines. Blogging Your  Way  Masterclass Was €497 Now €97My career, from start to finish in 5 packed modules with loads of lessons… Nineteen years of blogging distilled into a single course, covering everything from choosing a niche and defining your voice to diversifying revenue streams and stacking traffic sources. If you’ve ever wondered how I transformed a personal blog into a global brand, this course lays it all out. Gain the skills you need to build your own brand - or launch a side hustle - on a blog‑based foundation and unlock true time, location, and financial freedom. If you dream of working from a café in Copenhagen one week and your kitchen table the next, all while earning what you’re worth, this course if for you. Build on the solid footing of a blog, and claim the independence that follows. Why €97? Are you going to stop teaching?I started teaching Blogging Your Way as my signature course in April 2009, over 16 years ago. I’ve taught courses online ever since, year after year, with live workshops, too. I love to teach and connect with so many wonderful people online and off. For the rest of 2025 and into 2026 and beyond, I want to go more in the direction of small business and interior design/styling/photography, so while blogging will be part of my business course in 2026, I won’t offer singular classes on blogging again so this is your last chance to grab them. I will retire my Clarity course because I want to move mindset into my future business course as a module versus it’s own course, and expand on it. My Substack course will also be retired as it will be part of a module in my future business course too. Each of the courses in this sale have sold for anywhere between €247 and €497, so dropping them to €97 is a genuine 60–80 % farewell gift. Once the clock strikes midnight CET on 23 July they disappear into my private archive for good. You’ll keep lifetime access if you buy them now though, perfect for an immediate deep‑dive or a rainy‑weekend binge with snacks!Which class do I take to start a blog, or become a better blogger?If you want to start a blog, I suggest taking Blogging Today and the Blogging Your Way Masterclass. If you want to add an email list and Instagram, also add Attract, Engage and Grow to your shopping cart. Even if you buy all three classes today, you spend less than if you had purchased one of them before this sale began! So you’re still saving - stock up!Ready to jump in?I’ve built five brand‑new sales page packed with each lesson in each module with testimonials and loads more information. Choose your courses there, and, if you’d like an extra mindset boost, pick up a copy of the Get Real Reset e‑book  I just wrote for only €37.Remember, the next time I open enrolment will be with courses that range from €427–€2,500 and come with a firm no‑discount policy - I won’t retire them, they will open registration once each year. So this sale, this amazing promotion, is the one and only moment my courses will ever wear a €97 price tag (or be priced lower than €427 - so grab them - one, two, three, four or all five!I would love to welcome you inside before the door clicks shut. Let’s make this the summer you stop scrolling, start building, and give your creativity the megaphone it deserves.See you on the inside, Holly 🌿 Holly Becker Holly Becker is the Founder and Author of design and lifestyle site, decor8.

with loads of lessons… Nineteen years of blogging distilled into a single course, covering everything from choosing a niche and defining your voice to diversifying revenue streams and stacking traffic sources. If you’ve ever wondered how I transformed a personal blog into a global brand, this course lays it all out. Gain the skills you need to build your own brand - or launch a side hustle - on a blog‑based foundation and unlock true time, location, and financial freedom. If you dream of working from a café in Copenhagen one week and your kitchen table the next, all while earning what you’re worth, this course if for you.

Are you going to stop teaching?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI started teaching Blogging Your Way as my signature course in April 2009, over 16 years ago. I’ve taught courses online ever since, year after year, with live workshops, too. I love to teach and connect with so many wonderful people online and off. For the rest of 2025 and into 2026 and beyond, I want to go more in the direction of small business and interior design/styling/photography, so while blogging will be part of my business course in 2026, I won’t offer singular classes on blogging again so this is your last chance to grab them. I will retire my Clarity course because I want to move mindset into my future business course as a module versus it’s own course, and expand on it. My Substack course will also be retired as it will be part of a module in my future business course too. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach of the courses in this sale have sold for anywhere between €247 and €497, so dropping them to €97 is a genuine 60–80 % farewell gift.
