  "text": "Audiophile turntables have two types of takers: those who want them for use at home and casual DJs who want to scratch some records. Either way, a turntable that blends convenience and high-quality sound is always in demand, case in point, the McIntosh MTI100 turntable. Its lack of complexity and plug-and-play nature has made it a fan favorite all these years, since its launch in 2019, and it’s only for the first time that the turntable is getting a revisit: in a limited edition. Same fun, more authority! This time, the McIntosh MTI100 is Sun Records approved, yes, the label that gave the likes of Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash their first records. McIntosh x Sun Records Limited Edition MTI100 Integrated Turntable is customized with the label’s branding on the glass plinth and on the felt slipmat. Over and above that, the turntable remains pretty much what it was. Designer: McIntosh If you want to create a single system with turntable and a pair of speakers with preamp, amp, etc, you are at the wrong place. McIntosh’s special-edition MTI100, like its base model, is an integrated turntable with all the features built in. The turntable, preamplifier, and amplifier all in one, with Bluetooth and auxiliary inputs. What you don’t get is speakers. So just pair speakers, add your music and go. McIntosh x Sun Records Limited Edition MTI100 Integrated Turntable is recommended to pair with the company’s own XR50 bookshelf or XR100 floorstanding speakers, though users have the choice to connect it to any audiophile-grade loudspeaker for a full and comprehensive audio system, or even attach the headphones for a private music session. This is a one-of-a-kind turntable is should thus make a first choice of an audiophile who wants maximum flexibility from their audio system at home audio system, without occupying the space of a large audio system. Like the McIntosh MTI100, its new special edition variant also plays both 33-1/3 and 45 rpm vinyl records and features the interesting vacuum tube preamplifier on its back lacquer finished plinth and lime-green glow elements complementing the McIntosh logo. If you’re interested in the same audio proof of the MTI100, with the new co-branding, you can now get the McIntosh MTI100 (Sun Records Limited Edition) integrated turntable for $8,500. There is no word on how many examples of the turntable will be made, but we learn that McIntosh and Sun Records are releasing an 18-track record, remastered from original analog tapes, to honor Johnny Cash. It can be played at 45 RPMs and comes for $150, which is over and above the cost of this special edition turntable.",
