  "text": "This Savvy Luxe living room setup combines comfort and style, using upscale colors and nice-feeling materials to create a peaceful, fancy-looking space. Style: Savvy Luxe Color Combination: Soft beige, warm bronze, light gray, pale silver Who is it for: This space is perfect for a discerning homeowner who appreciates refined aesthetics. Budget: $$ Savvy Luxe living room shopping list Below we present a curated list of products presented on the board: Tips and suggestions Play with shapes: Contrast the linear sofa with curved elements like the round coffee table and sculptural vases.  Mix metals: Incorporate both gold and silver tones through accessories and furniture finishes for a curated, collected look. However, spread out the metallic touches: don’t cluster all your gold or silver items in one spot. Balance upscale colors: use the 60-30-10 rule – Make about 60% of the room your main color (taupe or light gray), 30% your secondary color (ie silver), and just 10% your accent color – gold. And remember, these colors can look different depending on the light. Ground the space: The rug’s understated design allows it to support the room without competing for attention. Its neutral tone harmonizes with the floor and furniture, creating a cohesive base that lets other elements, like the artwork or pendant light, stand out more prominently. Keep it uncluttered: Maintain a sense of luxurious spaciousness by carefully editing accessories and embracing negative space. No need to fill every inch and corner here. Illuminate thoughtfully: The modern pendant light adds a focal point, while additional ambient lighting can enhance the room’s cozy atmosphere – play with the possible shapes. Create balance: Use the large sectional as a foundation, then add smaller pieces like the accent chair and nested coffee tables to maintain proportional harmony. Pro art tip: when hanging the triptych (the set of three wall arts) above the sofa, slightly angle the outer pieces inward by about 15 degrees. This will create a more cohesive and intentional grouping while also drawing the eye inward, making the room feel more intimate. Best of all, this room is fancy enough to impress guests, yet very cozy for lazy Sunday mornings with coffee and a good book. The space that welcomes home in the most stylish whisper.",
