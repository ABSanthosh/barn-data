  "description": "The owners of this Lower North Shore property purchased the 1930s bungalow with plans to extend, but assumed a two-storey addition wasn’t possible due to heritage restrictions. Studio Prineas overcame these obstacles to create a recessive, yet deliberately distinct extension that adds valuable space and optimises the existing architecture. It’s now a home connected to its garden, embracing the naturally sloping block.",

  "text": "Until recently, this 1930s bungalow in Artarmon featured multiple dilapidated elements that had been added to the property over time. The upwards sloping block resulted in a garden above the living level, and no indoor-outdoor connection. ‘Our clients dreamed of a two-storey addition to provide space for their growing family, however, assumed it was not possible in the heritage conservation area where the home resides,’ says Eva-Marie Prineas, principal of Studio Prineas. The brief was simple: sympathetically navigate restrictions in order to expand the home, and connect the interiors with the outdoors. Studio Prineas’ response honours the integrity of the original architecture with a visually distinct, two-storey rear addition. Eva-Marie explains the design process, ‘In developing the upper level, a key challenge was to create a recessive form, almost invisible from the street. ‘Embracing a rectilinear form, angled from the southern boundary, the addition achieves a stealthy architectural presence, with rough-cast render and timber batten screens — unified in deep green — harmonising with the surrounding tree canopies.’ The original house connects to the pavilion via a glazed link with landscaped courtyards on either side that draw light into the previously dark living rooms of the bungalow. ‘The planning of the new addition is minimised in footprint and maximised in experience through its connection to external courtyards and the swimming pool,’ says Eva-Marie. Materials are likewise drawn from the landscape, including terrazzo pavers that flow seamlessly onto outdoor terraces, paired with olive cabinetry, eucalypt-toned mosaic bathroom tiles, and Dolomite stone in the kitchen all echoing the colours of nearby trees. Eva-Marie says additions and alterations have enhanced the ‘already special’ home. ‘It’s delightful to see a contemporary addition sitting harmoniously and quietly within an established heritage conservation area. ‘The main design moves are hidden from the streetscape, yet make dramatic impact within the home and for the family that live there.’",
