  "description": "While we always appreciate a classic country bathroom, recently we’ve fallen in love with a new bathroom trend that incorporates farmhouse-style flair in a more modern, contemporary way. We’re talking about those bathrooms that feel like they could be plucked from a charming country cottage in Europe: think checkerboard-tiled floors, and elegant claw-foot baths, punctuated with textural details. See how to get this look below with products from our Design Directory!",

  "text": "A fresh and fun take on the stereotypical country-style bathroom has emerged, and we think it’s a great guide for creating a bathing space that’s full of character. The look is a little bit vintage, and a little bit French-cottage inspired, with classic details like freestanding baths, rustic tapware, and checkerboard tiles. But when done right, this style can also look wonderfully contemporary. The key lies in being selective about which more ‘traditional’ elements you want to incorporate, and layering them correctly. The aim here is to balance some of the more bold features, with a warm and neutral backdrop for that contemporary edge. Avoid anything that feels too stark and instead go for tonal, sun-kissed hues like creamy whites, soft beiges, and warm pastels that will soften your chosen colour palette — whether that’s blushing pinks, or dark navy accents. One of the best ways to recreate this vibe is by embracing pattern through your tile selection. Something like the terracotta and cream colourways from Tiento’s Colori Full Porcelain range is perfect to create fun checkerboard flooring, or a feature wall in the shower. A statement bath like Reece’s Kado Era Freestanding Bath is a must-have for a luxurious, country-inspired interior — especially when paired with slightly ornate tapware, or a detailed wall sconce above. Focusing on natural materials that have some sort of unique detail, like pink travertine stone benchtops or handmade ceramic basins, will also help add a rustic edge without feeling overtly ‘country’. Because unlike traditional farmhouse interiors, this style of bathroom would look perfect in any space, from an inner-city cottage to an eclectic coastal home!
