There are a lot of things to consider when hanging your curtains, but once you get it right, it’ll do wonders for the room. One simple misstep, though, can leave it feeling off. Here, we’ll walk you through the essential dos and don’ts of hanging curtains, helping you avoid common mistakes and create a professional look. Let’s break it down together. DO Measure Twice Accurate measurements are key to a good curtain setup. Measure the width and height of your windows carefully, and consider how much you want the curtains to extend beyond the frame. Curtains that are too short or too narrow can look awkward and ill-fitted. Always double-check your measurements. It’s tempting to estimate, but even small inaccuracies can throw things off. Give yourself room for adjustments, and always err on the side of extra fabric for a fuller, more luxurious look. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator DON’T Hang Too Low One of the most common mistakes is hanging curtain rods too close to the top of window frame. Low-hung curtains can make your ceiling feel lower and the room smaller. Instead, position the rod several inches above the frame, closer to the ceiling, to create the illusion of height. This trick works wonders in making a room feel spacious and airy. A little extra effort in getting the height right can completely change the atmosphere of the space. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / ashishk75 DO Invest in Quality Hardware Curtain rods and brackets may seem like minor details, but they play a big role in the final look. Flimsy or mismatched hardware can undermine even the most beautiful curtains. Choose rods and brackets that complement your room’s style and are sturdy enough to hold the fabric. Invest in quality hardware that’ll last longer and prevent sagging. Think of these pieces as an extension of your décor, meant to blend in seamlessly rather than stand out unflatteringly. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Redzen2 DON’T Ignore Fabric Weight The weight of your curtain fabric matters more than you might think. Heavy fabrics, like velvet, demand stronger rods and brackets, while lighter options, like sheer panels, need more delicate hardware. Using the wrong combination can result in drooping curtains or overburdened supports. Consider how the fabric will drape and how it interacts with the room’s natural light, since fabric weight also changes how much light is let in when closed. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz DO Layer Them Layering curtains, while less common, adds a lot of dimension to your windows. Pairing sheer curtains with heavier drapes gives you more control over light and privacy while still creating a polished look. This also adds nice visual interest, making the window a focal point in the room. When layering, ensure the colors and patterns complement each other. You don’t need bold contrasts, subtle variations of hue or tone often work best, or any color curtain paired with neutral, sheer panels beneath. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / molenira DON’T Skimp on Length Curtains that are too short can make a room feel incomplete and awkward. They should either just kiss the floor or puddle slightly for a more dramatic effect. Avoid stopping the fabric several inches above the ground, as this makes the window look stunted. If you’re unsure, opt for longer panels and hem them if necessary. The right length makes a big difference in creating a cohesive and elegant look. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz Hanging curtains might seem small, but the impact is big. Taking the time to measure, choose the right hardware, and plan your setup makes all the difference here. When done thoughtfully, curtains can transform your space into something truly special.
