Click here to view more Award-winning designs from the Red Dot Award: Design Concept Red Dot Award: Design Concept 2024 Best of the Best Winners Innovative Design of Products and Systems for Forest Fires by Jiangnan University Jiangnan University’s project focuses on designing innovative systems and products for forest firefighting, especially in the face of increasing forest fire risks due to extreme weather. It emphasizes a modular and portable equipment system tailored for the challenging conditions of the Daxinganling area in Heilongjiang, China. This system integrates six key dimensions of firefighting operations: function division, information transfer, firefighting modes, mobility, resource mobilization, and emergency risk avoidance, making it ideal for professional forest firefighting teams. The tailored equipment encompasses a range of advanced solutions for specific firefighting scenarios. This includes full-body protective gear with a multi-functional helmet featuring heads-up display (HUD), communication systems, nightlight, respirator, and environmental detectors. Additional features include an emergency fire cover, oxygen cylinder, coolant valve, vital signs monitoring, protective clothing, and a powered exoskeleton for better mobility and protection. The conceptual fire suppression module employs innovative foam agents for efficient fire extinguishing, while an off-road motorized sprayer enhances material deployment and firefighter maneuverability. Additionally, underground fire detection is facilitated by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and auxiliary robots, assisting in the critical task of residual fire clean-up. This project aims to optimize integration and control for improved firefighting efficiency, safety, and risk management, leveraging existing command systems to address the unique challenges faced by forest firefighters in this region.
