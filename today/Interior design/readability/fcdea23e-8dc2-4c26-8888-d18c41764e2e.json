  "text": "There’s a lot to love about this elegant terrace in Carlton. Located at 196 Drummond Street, the Renaissance Revival-style residence was originally built in 1864, designed by Italian architect Alexander Martelli. But its most recent owner, interior designer Kate Challis has just treated the property to an impeccable, bespoke renovation. It was a fitting passion project for Kate, who considers herself ‘a bit of a history nerd’ and oversaw the entire restoration. ‘When I saw it, it was a typical boarding house, run down and in need of some love. I wanted to pay homage to the history of the building, while updating it for modern living,’ Kate says. In addition to restoring the incredible facade, everything from the original sash windows, floorboards, plumbing, insulation and wiring was refurbished. ‘The house was a bit of a rabbit warren and the first thing we had to do was to strip back all of the itsy-bitsy alternations and additions which had happened over the past 80 years.’ They also opened the central courtyard — which had been enclosed and made into an awkward passage — to become the focal point of the ground level. Fitzroy Nursery designed the landscaping, planting a curved palm tree they’d been saving for a special project. ‘All rooms enjoy a view into this little oasis now,’ Kate says. The new interiors lean into a European aesthetic, with custom lime-washed walls by Scanlan and Makers, soaring ceilings, open archways, and sophisticated lighting by leading local designers Christopher Boots and Articolo. Large slabs of Breccia Capria marble on the kitchen island and splashback add some drama to the serene space, while vintage Murano chandeliers imported from Italy hang at the top of the staircase and overhead in the living rooms. The main bedroom and ensuite are also especially dreamy, overlooking the lush nature strip on Drummond Street and surrounding terrace houses. It’s hard to imagine anyone would ever want to leave, and even Kate admits she thought this would be her forever home. ‘Everything has been considered, and done to the highest standards,’ she adds. But she’s caught the renovating bug, and already wants to start the process all over again — leaving the beautiful home open for someone new. 196 Drummond Street, Carlton, is listed with Peter Stephens from Nelson Alexander and will go to auction at 1pm Saturday May 17.",
