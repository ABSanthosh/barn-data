  "text": "LVMH Watch Week is one of the biggest annual events on a watch enthusiast’s calendar. With the dawn of the new year, the sixth edition of Watch Week is already underway and the event features the finest names in LVMH tutelage showcasing their latest creations. One of the new attendees is the L’Epée 1839, which has made its first major release since its acquisition by LVMH in 2024. L’Epée was first founded in 1839 and has been a phenomenon amid mechanical Swiss watch fans through the years. For me, its exceptional table clocks have always stood out from the rest, not to mention its watches in collaboration with MB\u0026F. Of course, then you would expect larger-than-life complications and complexities in their creations. However this one time, the Maison has chosen to keep it simple and revealing which is interesting. Designer: L’Epée 1839 Introducing the L’Epée transparent watch box – which is nothing more than what the name suggests precisely. But for some integrity, it has mechanical functioning to become an enticing presentation box. Meant excessively to offer a full view of the watch beating under its hood, the translucent box mechanically elevates your precious timepiece to wear or simply impress your friends. L’Epée Watch Box measures 215mm long, 150mm wide, and 140mm high. It is made from inox, acrylic glass and microfiber, and is hand-finished painstakingly with polished, satin and lacquer. The mechanical elements of the box are brass-plated supposedly. Owing to its construction it weighs 3.4 kg which is quite heavy. The watch box comes to life from a dull translucent container into a lively mechanical lift system with the push of a button on its acrylic housing. When the button is pushed, the mechanical system on the inside elegantly opens the top lid and lifts the watch-securing cushion up and out of the box. At this point, you can choose to remove the watch and wear, or push it back down when you’re down showing off. Pressing the housing down rewinds the mechanical system to settle the cushion platform back in the box. Of course, L’Epée Watch Box does not wind nor secure your timepiece inside, but if you like the idea of a transparent watch container with an elevating display, you can get it now for 9,900 CHF (approximately $12,000). Quite a lot for a watch box but if you can afford it, the price doesn’t matter!",
