Ed and I spent the weekend in Charlottesville to help our youngest celebrate her 35th bday. We had a nice time just hanging out, going out to eat at two of the many restaurants in town and went bowling with family and friends on Saturday afternoon. I haven’t been bowling in years. Having spent an afternoon at the bowling alley was a reminder that bowling with family and friends is a fun winter pastime. We are on our way back to SC today. This week, B-B-I-L home improvement contractors are going to remove the popcorn ceiling in my bedroom and fix a few things on the high wall in the foyer. I will keep you posted on that and more this week. Now onto this week’s links.
