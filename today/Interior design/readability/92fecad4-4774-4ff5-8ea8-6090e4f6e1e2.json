  "description": "Enzo Mari introduced his Autoprogettazione movement back in 1974, encouraging DIY furniture making. Today, five decades later, German company 1x1 Systems continues the movement with a digital twist, providing 3D print files for objects you can assemble and complete yourself.This Delta Lamp, by German industrial designer Christoph Hauf, is one of 1x1's offerings. It's a series of customizable connectors and a lampshade. Joined with a standard light bulb socket and a dowel, it becomes a wall lamp. The user-determined length of the dowel determines the standoff distance from the wall. \"Delta is a material-efficient wall lamp based around a simple wooden stick that can be easily upcycled from old broomsticks or discarded furniture. The design is highly adjustable both in height and angle while always staying in place thanks to the constant tension of the cable.\"\"The lower wall mount consists of two parts through which the cable runs, allowing the lamp to swing across the room while staying perfectly aligned. The double-walled lampshade is also 3D-printed and includes a thread to fit E14 light sockets.\"\"This is our most complex parametric design to date; both cable guides and lampshade adjust to match any width of the used stick as well as the total dimensions of the lamp.\"\"Delta Lamp costs €30 and includes custom print files based on your configuration, as well as a custom manual. It is available via 1x1.systems and can be previewed in AR via your phone.\" See Also:1x1 Systems' Axon Connector",
