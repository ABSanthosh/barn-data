  "text": "New York-based Gachot Studios has redesigned the patrons lounge at The Metropolitan Opera, imbuing the space with rich materials like textured wallpaper, black granite and brass accents. Gachot Studios transformed the Keebler J Straz Lounge while keeping the 1,861-square-foot space aligned with its ornate surroundings. The bar at the refreshed Keebler J Straz Lounge features a matte brass front and black stone topStudio founders and opera lovers John and Christine Gachot have a personal connection to the venue, which is part of the Lincoln Center complex designed by American architect Wallace K Harrison and opened in 1966. \"Our son, who attended LaGuardia High School, would walk past The Met Opera every day on his way to school,\" said the couple. \"As New Yorkers, we value city institutions like The Met with its incredible history and cultural influence.\" Wall-to-wall carpet in a rust hue complements the palette chosen for furnitureThe lounge was originally designed by late American decorator Billy Baldwin, and Gachot Studios referenced his layout and some of the furnishings as part of the redesign. \"It had an intimate residential feel with various deep sofas defining seating areas,\" said Gachot Studios. \"The new furniture layout draws inspiration from Baldwin's thoughtful arrangement with four lounge seating groups.\" Brass accents including bar-top lighting are found throughout the patron's loungeA series of upholstered screens that were once used to delineate the different lounge areas were reinterpreted as walnut-framed panels that direct guest flow from the entrance and conceal the back-of-house door. The arc-shaped bar is fronted by matte brass panels and topped with a curved slab of black granite. Seating and tables from Roche Bobois were customised to accommodate guests of all agesBronze-tinted mirrors in the back bar area reflect the room's gold-painted ceiling and provide a mount surface for delicate shelving and a vintage clock. Sheer drapes are hung across the windows, and the wall are covered in textured wallpaper between vertical bands of polished brass. Rust-coloured wall-to-wall carpet provides a plush finish underfoot, and complements the palette of furniture pieces in cream, blush, caramel, oxblood, and various brown and black tones. The seating and tables from French brand Roche Bobois were customised \"to accommodate for patrons of all ages\" Gachot Studios said. Textured wallpaper sits between vertical strips of polished brassA dining area behind the bar is also provided for those wanting to sit more formally or use the space for meetings. Architectural lighting is kept to a minimum so as not to detract from the ceiling, while sconces, floor lamps and table lamps by Hudson Valley Lighting offer a warm glow. Black and white photos from The Metropolitan Opera's history adorn the wallsThe majority of the furniture and decor can be rearranged to accommodate events beyond the use of the space before performances or during intermissions. \"In a building that requires a balance between grandeur and practicality, the lounge is no different,\" said the studio. Gachot Studios reinterpreted the screens originally designed for the lounge by Billy BaldwinElle Décor magazine collaborated with the opera and the studio to secure furnishings and fittings for the project. Founded in 2012, Gachot Studios has completed several hospitality and commercial projects across the US. These range from boutique hotels in Detroit and Washington DC, to the New York flagship store for cosmetics brand Glossier. The photography is by William Jess Laird.
