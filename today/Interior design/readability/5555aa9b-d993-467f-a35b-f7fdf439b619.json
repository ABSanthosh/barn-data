  "text": "‘Fill the Gap, Trace the Path, Hang the Loop’ by Inkyoung LeeWhat role does furniture play in a space? ‘Fill the Gap, Trace the Path, Hang the Loop’ by Inkyoung Lee explores this question, offering designs that prompt immediate interaction using hardware systems commonly encountered in daily life. Objects in empty spaces shape our actions, often instinctively. They provide clues—not only through their form but also through their materials, intended usage, and familiar contexts. These accumulated experiences guide our interaction with new objects, ultimately shaping our actions.Fill the Gap uses door catches to create curiosity and guide user interactions | all images courtesy of Inkyoung LeeFurniture Redefines Space Through Exploration and EngagementIn ‘Fill the Gap,’ door catches are positioned on the top, bottom, and sides of acrylic boxes. While the boxes resemble shelves, their fronts are blocked, encouraging the user to interact with the open gaps. The transparent acrylic reveals the door catches inside, sparking curiosity. As objects are inserted, the interaction naturally conveys the door catch’s purpose. Even without a floor, the door catch secures the object, creating a floating effect and offering a new perception of space.‘Trace the Path’ incorporates four pipes with movable handles on the front and sides. Users observe the path layout, recognize the handle’s ability to move vertically, and fit it into side grooves, where it locks into place. This understanding of the mechanism invites users to move and reposition the handles freely, encouraging further experimentation and creative utilization. In ‘Hang the Loop,’ 48 and 20 hooks are arranged in rows and columns. Each hook features a steel bead at its base, allowing it to move up and down when picked up. This movement prompts users to engage with the hooks, attempting to hang them and exploring various arrangements. Designer Inkyoung Lee demonstrates how objects and furniture can subtly guide human behavior, inviting exploration and interaction while challenging conventional notions of spatial use.acrylic boxes with blocked fronts invite users to engage with open gaps and explore their purposetransparent materials reveal hidden elements, prompting curiosity and explorationdoor catches secure objects without a floor, creating a striking floating effect",
