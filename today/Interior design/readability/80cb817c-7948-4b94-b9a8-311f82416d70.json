  "text": "Designed by GN Architects, the Seaside Pavilion is the winning design in the ‘Hello, Island’ competition. This pavilion, now gracing Chaishan Island, symbolizes the region’s rejuvenation. The island once housed a vibrant fishing community, but now the population includes less than 100 elderly residents, as many have relocated to urban centers. In response, the Zhoushan Government initiated the ‘Hello, Island’ project to transform Chaishan into a center for art, design, and culture. The pavilion’s design seeks to offer a romantic touch to the island’s simple and serene lifestyle, creating a destination that is both functional and poetic. Drawing inspiration from traditional Chinese village gateways, where large trees signify gathering places, the pavilion establishes a welcoming sense of arrival and fosters a sense of community. Designer: GN Architects This unique design attempts to evoke a powerful sense of arrival at the island’s gateway, enriching the village’s ambiance and crafting a unique identity. At first, the concept harnessed tidal movements to create motion, allowing visitors seated in the pavilion to experience the gentle rise and fall of the waves and structure over time. But to better cater to the primary audience, tourists, the design was altered to utilize wind power for immediate visual effects. The team has also refined the structure’s form to make these changes more prominent. Following several site surveys, the ideal location was selected – a disused cargo pier from the 1960s, nestled between the new passenger terminal and the village. The site is quite perfect as it is blessed with jagged rock formations and a background of blue skies and sea. The design showcases long, slender blades hanging from a sturdy frame, gracefully swaying in the sea breeze and moving in sync with the waves. This imaginative yet functional design brings the old pier to life by making some necessary repairs and installing new railings, thereby transforming it into a welcoming space for the island’s elderly to gather and relax. The Seaside Pavilion evokes the image of white feathers dancing in the wind, serving as a symbolic tribute to the island. This installation embodies two core ideas – it serves as a psychological landmark called the Long Pavilion, defining its location and spatial structure. Secondly, as a fusion of poetic realism called The Feather of Chaishan, it shapes its distinct aesthetic. The Seaside Pavilion was prefabricated and transported to the island, featuring 36 blades, each seven meters long, grouped in sets of three. Computer simulations precisely determined each blade’s initial position, balancing weights for optimal movement. Each blade connects to the main support via a bearing, with a counterweight block at the tail to adjust balance. To prevent collisions, linkages and limiters are installed between the blades. After considering various options like flexible springs and hydraulic buffers, rubber was selected for its simplicity and resistance to UV and corrosion. The coastal installation uses corrosion-resistant steel with anti-rust coatings. The blades use high-strength fishing ropes for enhanced durability and wind resistance. The blades gently sway in a breeze and move noticeably in stronger winds. During a typhoon, they can be securely tied to the frame for protection.",
