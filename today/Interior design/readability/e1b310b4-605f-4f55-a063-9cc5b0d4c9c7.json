Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Who loves the idea of dishes as decor? {Raises hand high} I just bought the cutest dishes at Walmart (this isn’t sponsored or gifted)–and they are SO affordable! Since we’ve been talking about hanging plates and decorating with platters, I wanted to share these and some more ideas with you. Honestly I was actually more excited about this set of dishes for decorating shelves more than serving. These are bamboo melamine and while I try to avoid plastic while serving every day food, they do say they are BPA free so I think they would be perfect for summer entertaining outdoors or as extra plates when you have a big crowd. So in addition to wanting them for decorating, I bought a few pieces with summer serving mind! Walmart and Better Homes + Gardens really knocked the design out of the park on this collection.  Here are the items from the collection I ordered: Chip and Dip Tray 12 Piece Dinnerware Set Serving Tray (3) Serving Bowl Click here for all above sources I wish I had bought some of the other items like that basket caddy! Somehow I didn’t see a few of these things when I was ordering so use this link so you won’t miss them, too! I bought three of the platters because I thought they might be pretty for display on shelves or on a plate stand on the counter — and they will be!  I’ll play around with ideas for styling now that they arrived (so stay tuned, you’ll probably see these again!) but I wanted to share them with you right away in case they have limited stock. Chip and Dip Serving Dish Here are a few quick decorating ideas and tips: Imagine the platters across a kitchen shelf or on a wall, or hanging the set of plates. Bonus, you’d never have to worry about these breaking or crashing to the ground!  Picture the bowls stacked on shelves. Simple and affordable styling. My favorite way to decorate is with items we love and use–so dishes can be both practical and pretty. And even when these are no longer available or not your style, remember to keep your eyes peeled for plates, bowls and platters at second hand stores. Chip and Dip Serving Dish If you love this collection, run to grab them while they are still available! You can buy pieces or some in a bigger set. They come in two colors, too. Mine are the blue. You can watch a video of these dishes on my LTK here. I also suggest you download the LTK app. This is the place where I add my favorite finds every day. I’ve used this for years and it’s getting better all the time. It’s so handy and simple for people to use. You get to see the items I add and if you want them, you can shop right from the app. Since I can’t create a blog post on each item or send a newsletter fast enough to alert you to all of these finds or sales, if you have the app you’ll get notified right when I add something I think you’ll like! With the LTK app, you will be the first to know and not be as likely to miss out on some of the great deals and finds. Plus I often show videos there so you can more easily see the items and see them in my home, too. Last but not least, you’re invited to join us in HomeBody Gathering Place! We are there to create sanctuaries, so we offer what we call Home Therapy every week, as well as beautiful and inspiring resources to simplify decorating and find more joy in our homes every day. It’s all organized in what we call our HomeBody Library, which you get full access to as a member! It really is the ideal place to ask decorating and home-creating questions or get advice, too! We all speak the same home love language there as HomeBodies and it’s really nice to have the resources right there to be of help. You can even post photos of your home or projects in our HomeBody Facebook community! I offer Home Therapy each week to inspire you, plus I am available to offer ideas or suggestions to HomeBodies, too! So if you are a HomeBody and have questions on all things home, homemaking, a kitchen renovation, furniture placement, decorating a room, styling or increasing curb appeal, or just want to share your progress on projects — I’m there for you (and all of our HomeBodies are so nice and supportive, you’ll love them!). I would be so happy to see YOU in the HomeBody Gathering Place this spring and summer.",
