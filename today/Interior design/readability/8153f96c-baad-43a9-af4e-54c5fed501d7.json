  "text": "The Vipp Tunnel is an impressive new structure designed as a sturdy concrete tunnel, embodying a luxurious brutalist aesthetic. It has been meticulously integrated into the surrounding landscape and operates entirely off-the-grid. The Vipp Tunnel was crafted by Australian studio Room11 and is situated on Bruny Island in Tasmania. Accessible by car and ferry, the building extends slightly over a hill on an expansive rural site. The tunnel-shaped home measures 30 meters (98.5 feet) in length and offers 160 square meters (1,722 square feet) of floor space – all on a single level. A smaller building is located nearby, and is intended for use as an office, yoga studio, or similar purpose, and features its own bedroom. Designer: Room11 The main home boasts expansive glazing, including impressive floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing for abundant natural light and stunning views of the surrounding landscape. It is partially furnished with products from design firm Vipp, ensuring a cohesive and stylish interior. While the extensive use of concrete may not appeal to everyone’s taste, the decor is quite sophisticated and luxurious, featuring a spacious living room that perfectly frames the picturesque scenery outside. A thoughtfully designed central courtyard separates the living and kitchen areas from the bedroom and bathroom, providing both privacy and a sense of openness. The home also features a decorative light well at its far end, offering a unique focal point and enhancing the overall ambiance of this tunnel-like structure. “Inspired by the area’s natural phenomenon known as Aurora Australis, or Southern Lights, when the night sky is transformed into a dreamscape of color, Room11 has added chromatic glazing to the building’s central skylights,” said Vipp. “Polished concrete floors and walls further enhance the effect, reflecting the ever-changing interplay of light that dances throughout the otherwise understated interior like an ever-changing artwork.” To ensure a reliable power supply, the Vipp Tunnel’s west-facing facade is outfitted with solar panels, which are connected to an advanced battery array for energy storage. The home features heated flooring throughout and air conditioning, ensuring a consistently comfortable temperature year-round. Water needs are met through an efficient rainwater collection and filtration system, showcasing the home’s commitment to sustainability. During the design process, Room11 conducted comprehensive surveys of every tree on the site, carefully planning roadworks and construction to minimize any impact on the natural landscape. The Vipp Tunnel is the latest addition to Vipp’s series of guest houses, following the success of its Bolder Star Lodges. For those interested in experiencing this unique vacation home, a stay will cost around US$610 per night, offering a luxurious and environmentally conscious retreat. It has a free-flowing and brutalist aesthetic that makes it a pleasure to spend time in, allowing you to gift yourself and your loved ones a one-of-a-kind experience.",
