  "text": "Canada-based Rover Tiny Homes’ latest Cypress model was downsized quite interestingly. It isn’t mounted on a trailer, which makes it not very portable, but quite spacious with a roomy interior that is apt for a family. The Cypress is intended to be installed on permanent foundations, so it isn’t a towable option if you’re seeking one. It features a length of 44 feet, making it one of the bigger models on the market, and a width of 12 feet. Designer: Rover Tiny Homes The home features a finishing in metal siding paired with cedar trim and generous glazing, which allows the interior to fill with natural light. You can enter the living room through double glass doors. The living room is spacious and open and features a tongue-and-groove pine ceiling. It also includes some trim made from 100-year-old reclaimed barn wood, a sofa, chairs, and small tables. The kitchen is closely located, including a breakfast bar for three people, an oven with a four-burner stove, a microwave, a dishwasher, cabinetry, and a sink. A second entrance is included in the kitchen as well. The bathroom is located near the kitchen, and it includes a bathtub/shower, which isn’t usually seen in most tiny homes. It also hosts a vanity sink, a flushing toilet, a stacked washing machine, and a dryer as well. The tiny home is equipped with one downstairs bedroom, which has plenty of headroom to stand upright. There are stairs located next to the bathroom which offer access to another bedroom. Even though the bedroom is upstairs, it has ample amount of headroom to stand straight. There is another bedroom on the upper story, but like most tiny home bedrooms, this one has a low ceiling. This tiny home is relatively spacious, truly testing the boundaries of what a micro-home is. It is larger than most tiny homes on the market, but it serves as a comfortable and excellent option for larger families who may not be able to fit in the truly tiny houses. The Cypress is priced at US$143,000.",
