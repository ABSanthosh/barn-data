  "text": "The year 1950 brought to the world an invention so useful, we’d be living an altogether different lifestyle had it not been there. I’m talking about the Solid-State Drives (SSD) that have evolved from large bulky pieces of hardware into pocketable accessories that’s the holy grail for most of us. The transfer speeds have improved exponentially, and so have the reliability and performance. Seagate has been part of this evolution for over a decade, virtually earning a major chunk of the SSD market. The California-based data storage specialist has now unveiled an SSD so small, it’ll give your flash drive nightmares. That I say because this ultra compact accessory will eventually supersede your trusted USB drive, since it is superior both in performance and reliability. Not to mention the palm-sized form factor that’ll make it a go-to accessory for every kind of user – be it a video creator, coder, or gamer. Designer: Seagate The Ultra Compact SSD designed by Seagate is a USB-C thumb drive that can handle large files or performance-intensive processes like running an operating system without any hassle. Created in 1TB and 2TB capacities, the portable SSD is far smaller than any of the known compact SSDs on the market. Now, that is both a design and functionality evolution. With transfer speeds of 1,000 MB/s, the accessory will be a staple for photographers and videographers who require portable storage solutions with at least a 1TB capacity and performance that can handle current generation OS. Measuring just 70 millimeters in length and 20 millimeters in width, the Seagate SSD is lightweight at just 24 grams. It comes with an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, and comes with a rubber sleeve protection to guard against any sudden drops or falls of up to 3 meters. Keeping in mind the eco-friendly manufacturing methods, the SSD is made using 35 percent recycled materials. For convenience of use, it can be plugged right into your gaming console, handheld console, Windows, Mac, Android phone, or Apple device courtesy of the USB-C port connectivity. Seagate has a lot of confidence in its hardware solution and this compact SSD is no different. It comes with a 3-year limited warranty and 3 years of Seagate Rescue Data RecoveryServices for complete peace of mind. The portable peripheral comes included with some more freebies including an intuitive Seagate Toolkit backup software to backup important files and sync ongoing projects to the drive. It comes with a 6-month Dropbox Backup to back up one computer and one drive automatically to the service. Additionally, you can also utilize the free 6 months of Mylio Photos+ service to organize and edit your photos or videos. Seagate will make the Ultra-Compact SSD available worldwide this month for a price of $100 for the 1TB version and $180 for the 2TB variant. It is a good deal if you require a portable SSD that can do more than just data transfer, and I’m sure it’ll become a holy grail of your everyday carry essentials.",
