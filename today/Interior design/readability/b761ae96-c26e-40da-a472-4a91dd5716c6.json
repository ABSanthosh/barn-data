  "text": "At first glance, what appears to be a hilly, forested landscape is, in fact, a newly designed natural history museum by the renowned Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG). This eco-friendly structure, primarily built from wood, features a design that enables visitors to explore its elevated form by walking over it. The Hungarian Natural History Museum is set to be located within the Great Forest on the outskirts of Debrecen, Hungary’s second-largest city. Designer: Bjarke Ingels Group The museum will span an impressive 23,000 square meters (nearly 250,000 square feet) and is ingeniously designed to resemble a manmade hill. This architectural marvel will consist of three overlapping ribbons, each adorned with lush greenery, creating a seamless blend with the natural environment. The design allows visitors to stroll across the top, allowing them to take in breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. From a structural standpoint, the building will mostly feature timber, chosen for its sustainability and aesthetic appeal. The facade will be crafted from charred wood, adding a unique texture and durability to the exterior. The structure will also be partially embedded into the ground, enhancing its integration with the terrain and contributing to its energy efficiency. This thoughtful design minimizes the building’s environmental footprint and also enhances the visitor experience by connecting them more intimately with nature. “Constructed from mass timber, the building features a facade of locally sourced charred timber panels that emerge from the ground, blurring the lines between architecture and wilderness,” said Hanna Johansson, partner at BIG. “The museum draws on the thermal mass of the ground and integrates on-site energy systems, including geothermal loops and photovoltaic panels, to ensure a stable indoor climate year-round. Rather than simply preserving the site, the building restores and enhances it – regenerating biodiversity while quietly adapting to its surroundings.” The interior design of the museum is reminiscent of BIG’s innovative Plus furniture factory, showcasing the exquisite natural beauty of wood throughout its spaces. The design makes excellent use of this material, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. At the heart of the museum lies a spacious reception hall, which serves as a central hub for visitors, providing them with access to the various surrounding exhibition wings. Above this central area, visitors will find a thoughtfully designed library and a restaurant, offering a serene environment for reading and dining with views of the natural surroundings. These upper-level spaces are intended to enrich the cultural and social experience of the museum. The lower levels are dedicated to more interactive and educational activities, featuring a variety of workshops, play spaces, and research labs. These facilities are designed to engage visitors of all ages, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of natural history and science. The thoughtful arrangement of these diverse spaces ensures that the museum caters to a wide range of interests and activities, making it a dynamic and enriching destination.",
