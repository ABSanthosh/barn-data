  "description": "In this age of disposable furniture, you know you've got a winning design when people are still talking about it a decade after its debut. Veteran industrial designer Todd Bracher created this timeless Trea chair in collaboration with Humanscale in the mid-2010s. The elegant, lobster-exoskelton-inspired form has been popular enough to warrant multiple spin-offs; the original Four Star four-legged office chair on casters has been joined by a taller High Task verison, a caster-less Four Leg version and a Cantilever model. Now the entire Trea series, which won a Red Dot Award upon its debut in 2015, has snagged a 2025 iF Design Award, besting thousands of entrants in the Office category. \"Merging simplicity with sophistication, Trea delivers intuitive ergonomic support to any workspace. Designed in collaboration with renowned designer Todd Bracher, Trea's innovative solid-state recline mechanism provides seamless, natural movement without manual adjustments. Its contoured shell is thoughtfully crafted to support the body's curves, enhancing lower back support and mimicking the hips' natural rotation. With a minimalist aesthetic and versatile design, Trea is ideal for professional, home, and 'third place' environments, offering both comfort and style.\" \"Inspired by nature, Todd Bracher collaborated with Humanscale to create the Trea Task Lite and Stool. Adaptable to both office and home environments, Trea's four-star, cantilever, stool, or four-leg bases are interchangeable, allowing it to be customised for different settings while maintaining visual consistency. True to Humanscale's belief in achieving more with less, Trea is crafted with fewer parts than a standard task chair, reducing its environmental impact while maximising efficiency.\" The Trea series is Living Product Certified, meaning it is climate, water, and energy positive. Congratulations to Bracher and Humanscale!",
