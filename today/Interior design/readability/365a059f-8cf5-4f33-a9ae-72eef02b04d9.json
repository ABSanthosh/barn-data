  "text": "Interior design in 2025 will honour the century-old principles of art deco, favouring statement objects made to last in a departure from the neutral minimalism that characterised last year, designers tell Dezeen. As the new year gets underway, Dezeen spoke to interior designers about their trend predictions for 2025. The creatives were united in acknowledging the ever-growing urgency of sustainability, but without compromising on much-needed escapism in myriad forms. \"Last year, we saw a lot of organic architecture and humble interiors,\" reflected Dorothée Meilichzon, who was crowned interior designer of the year at November's Dezeen Awards. \"Maybe now it's time to move in the opposite direction while reusing elements from the past,\" said the French designer. Dorothée Meilichzon is known for eclectic spaces including the Montesol Experimental in Ibiza. Photo by Karel Balas\"Reality is super tough all around the world,\" she added. \"We might need to go back to dreaming! I am wondering if we will be back to grandiose and bigger-than-reality. A bit out of scale, revisited baroque – old-school interiors twisted.\" Smita Thomas, founder of Bengaluru studio Multitude of Sins, agreed. \"The era of monotone, single-colour, single-material spaces is fading into oblivion,\" she told Dezeen. \"This shift will emerge from a collective yearning for authenticity and connection in a world that feels increasingly fragmented.\" That sentiment was echoed by Julien Sebban, founder of Paris studio Uchronia and the 2023 winner of the Dezeen Award for emerging interior designer. \"While 2024 has been about minimalism and earthy tones, 2025 will take a bolder step towards experimentation and self-expression,\" he said. \"The focus will shift from simply functional and neutral to more dynamic, emotionally engaging designs.\" \"Mavericks will emerge\" Retreating from minimalism will not be as simple as coating everything in bold colours and textures, said Thomas. Rather, she acknowledged a collective desire to add personality and meaning to interior spaces after a sustained trend for beige and often bland homes. \"We'll move beyond simply making a splash,\" speculated the designer. \"It'll be about depth and nuance. We'll see a surge of creativity that breaks free from convention.\" \"I believe we're on the cusp of a seismic shift in design, where more trailblazers and mavericks will emerge, creating space for liberated and authentic work,\" she added. London restaurant Kioku highlights Pirajean Lees's \"appreciation for craft\". Photo by Polly TootalExecuting statement interiors does not necessarily mean more is more, acknowledged James Lees, co-founder of London studio Pirajean Lees. \"We're embracing a lifestyle of less, where every piece we own carries meaning and fosters an emotional connection,\" he suggested. \"There's a renewed appreciation for craft – celebrating the handmade and finding beauty in the natural imperfections of materials and objects,\" added Lees. \"The spotlight is on quality materials, rich textures and expert craftsmanship,\" added fellow co-founder Clémence Pirajean. Recovery from marble \"overdose\" This year marks 100 years since art deco – short for arts décoratifs – emerged at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts, held in Paris in 1925. The centenary not lost on interior designers, some of whom believe that it offers a chance to revisit the style's core values. \"At a time when sustainability is essential, the art-deco style attracts with its focus on high-quality materials and objects designed to last,\" said Paris collaborators Samantha Hauvette and Lucas Madani. \"Unlike ephemeral trends, art deco favours well-constructed furniture and robust materials in line with today's desire to reduce rapid consumption and favour pieces that will stand the test of time,\" they added. Samantha Hauvette and Lucas Madani, designers of this Paris apartment, predict a return to the art-deco style. Photo by François Coquerel\"Some trends are in danger of disappearing rapidly because of the speed with which social networks spread fashions, and the responsiveness of manufacturers to produce cheap copies,\" continued Hauvette and Madani. \"This phenomenon creates a saturation point that makes certain pieces, initially highly prized, almost boring.\" The designers cited beige boucle round-shaped furniture, ceramic or plaster-clad lighting and the \"indiscriminate use of marble\" as tired and overexploited. \"These trends were initially appreciated for their originality. But their massive popularity, fuelled by excessive production, quickly led to an aesthetic 'overdose',\" said Hauvette and Madani. \"Art deco's elegance, timeless quality and symbolism of resilience make it a style that responds to today's aspirations and challenges.\" \"Localisation should become more pronounced\" Unsurprisingly, designers were concerned about sustainability. Tokyo creative Keiji Ashizawa called for the localisation of interior design to minimise the international transportation of materials. \"This is an essential trend that is sustainable and necessary to preserve local culture, creating individuality in each place,\" said Ashizawa, known for using Japanese wood and other high-quality natural materials. \"Localisation should become more pronounced with each passing year,\" he added. \"I think designers will be required to develop materials and participate in production.\" Renowned for projects championing efficient insulation, Barcelona studio Takk envisaged moving away from a typical residential model based on closed rooms accessed through \"endless corridors\". \"Spaces nested within each other instead of placed along corridors allow us, in addition to reinventing privacy, to control the climate of each room, saving energy,\" said studio co-founders Mireia Luzárraga and Alejandro Muiño. Takk experiments with improving insulation, as seen in this Barcelona home. Photo by José HeviaThe designers cited local wood, cork, cotton and wool as sustainable materials that provide warmth to domestic spaces. \"We are increasingly going to move towards more generous spaces without so many dividing walls, where even spaces traditionally designed for individual use such as bathrooms will become spaces that can be used in company, as is the case with kitchens,\" they continued. \"Multi-functional spaces remain a priority [for 2025], with designs that seamlessly adapt from home to workspace or transition effortlessly from day to night,\" agreed UK-based designer Tola Ojuolape. Ojuolape echoed the desire for a \"remixed maximalism\" that moves away from neutral boucle and soft textures. The designer also put her faith in \"the power of colour\" and refined and sleek materials, including stainless steel. \"These trends reflect a rising desire for greater individuality and spaces that combine comfort with inspiration and distinctiveness,\" suggested Ojuolape. \"The focus on grounded richer colours and hybrid functionality highlights evolving lifestyles and a deeper connection to personal expression.\" Designer of this Montreal office Ménard Dworkind studio strives to stay away from trends. Photo by Alex LesageIn 2025, the very concept of design trends is also being questioned. Hong Kong designer André Fu, for example, suggested they are becoming less relevant. \"The world of interiors is no longer trend-driven and the underlying value of design lies in its ability to provide a point of difference and a way to express the familiar with a fresh perspective,\" he reflected. \"Visual stories that are culturally rooted should prevail.\" \"We strive to not follow trends – easier said than done – and create work that is a bit more timeless and follows our personal design language,\" echoed David Dworkind, co-founder of Montreal studio Ménard Dworkind. \"So I try to not have an ear to the beat of what's trending.\" The main image is by David Mitchell and shows the art deco-informed Smith \u0026 Mills restaurant by Woods Bagot, inside New York City's Rockefeller Center.
