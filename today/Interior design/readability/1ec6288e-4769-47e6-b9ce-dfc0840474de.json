  "text": "Tiny homes are meant to be tiny, and we’ve seen a whole bunch of truly compact homes over the years, but we’ve finally come across the ‘world’s smallest tiny home’. Designed by Levi Kelly, this super tiny home occupies around 19.4 sq ft. It is based on a single-axle trailer that was picked up from a truck. It is equipped with jacks for support and stability when not on the move. The home is extraordinarily compact and displays a pretty clever space-saving design. The tiny home is made up of a stick frame structure, and a painted cedar exterior, topped with roof shingles. Designer: Levi Kelly The interior of the home includes one room, and it is quite snug and comfortable. The entrance leads you to a bench seating area that can hold three people. It is equipped with integrated storage and an air-conditioning heating and cooling unit. The kitchen is quite simple with water tanks for freshwater and greywater, a filter and a pump system, as well as a water heater. It also includes a mini-fridge for drinks or food items. An electric cooktop is accommodated in a drawer when not in use. The sink features a folding tap, and a cutting board insert covers it when not in use. These little details make for excellent space-saving solutions in such a compact home. The bedroom comprises a fold-down bed which is a bit uncomfortable to access. It is equipped with hooks to hold it up in the ceiling, but the resident will need to step on the kitchen countertop and climb onto the bed, which isn’t the most comfortable feat. The bathroom is divided into two sections – the front-facing wall near the entrance contains the outdoor shower, while the back wall features a storage box with a small camping-style toilet. The box could be taken into the home if privacy was needed. The world’s smallest tiny home is powered by two roof-based solar panels that are connected to a battery to provide juice through the night. The budget for this tiny home was US$5,000, making it pretty economical. The designer owned the trailer, and did all the work himself, ensuring costs were kept low.",
