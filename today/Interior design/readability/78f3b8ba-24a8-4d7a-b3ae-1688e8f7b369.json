  "description": "Architect and director of Zarq Studio Zac Evangelisti and his wife Megan Garden purchased a 1920s Perth home in fair condition, albeit with several ‘bizarre’ and inconsistent modifications. Its weatherboard addition needed to go, and the original rooms called for a lot of love, but Zac and Megan were attracted to the area and its ‘blank slate’ appeal. They spent over two years restoring the front rooms and adding a glamorous Italian-inspired extension connected to the garden and sky. There’s something in every room designed to draw the eye, from textured limewash walls, to swirling marble, and greenery outside cascading from newly established roof gardens.",
