  "text": "Modern design comes together with artistic expression in the Nouvelle Apartment (by Elemental Design). Every detail—from the deep sienna hues to the bold architectural lines—makes sure the home is as visually striking as is functional. As rounded archways soften structured forms, this space acts as a testament to intentional design. Let’s walk through the Nouvelle Apartment to unveil its design secrets. The living room is designed to be both dynamic and visually striking. The neutral walls provide a refined backdrop. These allow bold accents and sculptural furnishings, including the Togo lounge chair, to take center stage. The glass coffee table with metallic finishes reflects light in an interesting way. Beneath it all, a plush, geometric-patterned rug introduces softness. Anchoring the room is a sleek, modern fireplace, subtly framed by an organic-textured surround. Finally, a bold abstract painting injects character. The base in the kitchen is set with a checkered floor. This is paired with natural wood cabinetry and marble and tiled backsplash, adding visual interest. We also see dark gray accents for the fridge and cabinetry. These add contrast. In one corner, a bench with curves and soft upholstery gives residents a spot to have a quick seat. The dining area in the Nouvelle Apartment is as organic as it gets. A cylindrical-shaped table is paired with curved wooden chairs. Illumination is provided with the floor-to-ceiling window as well as the floor lamp. This bedroom quite gives the apartment its name: ‘nouvelle’ or trendy. Beige and white stripes adorn the walls, while a blue striped rug adds visual interest to the wooden floor. The bed is minimalist but uses a bold blue color to make a statement. A special mention for the wall feature with curves and wooden recessed shelving to display decor pieces. There’s also an ergonomic workstation, continuing the color scheme of white and blue. Another bedroom in the Nouvelle Apartment uses black and gold accents on a neutral base. A wooden nightstand houses a black flowerpot lamp, while a compact desk, paired with a curved chair, provides room to work the day away. The textured wall behind the bed factors in warmth, while the monotony of the cabinetry is broken with a wooden console. Finally, a large plush chair acts as an accent piece. The bathroom is an affair of white, black, and dark brown. Residents have ample room to store essentials with the modern rustic cabinetry. The black tones of the floor are continued into the hardware—also seen in the glass partition segregating the shower cubicle. An organically shaped mirror adds functionality as well as style.",
