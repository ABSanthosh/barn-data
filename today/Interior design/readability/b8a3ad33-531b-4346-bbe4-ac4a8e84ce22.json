Happy Easter to all of you that celebrate. Ed and I usually spend Easter weekend with family and enjoy colorful egg hunts, Easter brunch and a day spent relaxing. This year however has been a little different. We are still with family helping our youngest and her hubby paint a few rooms in a house they just bought and closed on, on Friday. To paint the rooms before they move their furniture in, she chose light and cheery colors so the colorful part of Easter and being with family still happened, but with paint brushes, not dying eggs or a pretty table and an Easter ham. I will share more about the house with you soon. Now onto the links I found for you this week. If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
