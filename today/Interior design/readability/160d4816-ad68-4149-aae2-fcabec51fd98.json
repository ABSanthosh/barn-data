The collection of furniture pieces is characterized by delicate bubble patterns devised from a new expression technique, exploring the infinite aesthetic potential of paper.The series employs a unique heat application technique to create intricate bubble patterns on paper, with the materials then fashioned into simple hollow blocks. They are assembled into consoles, coffee tables, and side tables, with the modular concept allowing the pieces to expand or adapt based on the size of each module. all images courtesy of Yerin Jungyerin jung enables infinite possibilities of configurationsBloom Block Series is shaped from translucent, hollow bricks that are strengthened with epoxy and finished with a matte texture, ensuring durability without compromising the paper’s delicate appearance.
