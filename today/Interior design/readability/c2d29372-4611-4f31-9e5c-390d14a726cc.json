  "description": "Beach house style can often be reduced to minimal white walls and pale blue accents. But not for interior designer Edwina Glenn, who uses patterned wallpapers, textural furniture and saturated pastels, to inject a sense of ‘low-key’ luxury into coastal spaces, with an eclectic and elevated edge. Below, Edwina takes us through her top five tips for re-creating this eye-catching style, along with her top picks from our Design Directory.",

By inviting colour, texture, layering and pattern into your space you can push yourself out of your usual everyday aesthetic. Below I show you how. Colour. Soft pastel interior tones are a welcome relief from the harsh glare of an Australian summer. I regularly use colours that borrow from exterior landscapes to foster a sense of indoor/outdoor connection. This feels particularly relevant where interior space is limited — as often is the case in the humble Aussie beach shack. Mix these pastels with the neutral sandy tones and textures of sisal and seagrass floors. Lighting. Soft lighting is essential. Reduce downlights and focus instead on pendant lighting and lamps. Ask your electrician to put all lighting on dimmers and separate circuits for added control. Where possible, minimise the appearance of technology and conceal screens. Keep it functional. Comfortable furniture, woven textures, natural fibres, crushed linens, vintage cane, cork, patinaed brass and handmade tiles — i.e. surfaces that can take a beating — all work pretty seamlessly for this holiday aesthetic. It’s also a good idea to provide hooks for hanging in every room to reduce clutter as unpacking is rarely at the top of the holiday maker’s agenda. Less is more, but more is also more. I find that the more pieces go in, the less relevant any individual item becomes. Be patient and enjoy the hunt. BUT, don’t be afraid to get playful with shape and pattern! Layers! I enjoy sourcing handmade elements and vintage furniture pieces with modern comforts, such as feather-filled sofas. Layering these pieces with inviting throws, textured rugs and globally-sourced ceramics helps to create an interior that feels intimate and unique.
