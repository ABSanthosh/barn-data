  "text": "Butakushi + Yakitori (Japanese Pork + Chicken Skewers) (Serves 4-6) 500g skinless chicken thighs, cut into 2cm pieces 500g boneless pork belly, rashers, cut into 2cm pieces 4 spring onions, white and light green parts only, cut into 2cm lengths Tare 100ml soy sauce 100ml mirin 50ml sake 50g caster sugar 2cm piece of ginger, finely grated 2 garlic cloves, to serve Cabbage and cucumber salad ¼ white cabbage, finely shredded 2 Lebanese cucumbers, finely sliced 4 spring onions, green parts, finely sliced 2 tbsp soy sauce 1 tbsp sesame oil Juice of half a lemon Salt and pepper, to serve Steamed medium grain rice (such as Koshihikari), to serve Yuzu kosho, to serve Method:  The night before, soak bamboo skewers in cold water. Make the tare by combining all of the ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Simmer for 1-2 minutes or until slightly thickened then set aside. Thread the bamboo skewers with the chicken, set aside. Thread the spring onion and pork belly on skewers in an alternating pattern. For the salad, combine all ingredients in a bowl, toss to coat and season to taste. Set aside. Heat a grill or charcoal barbeque over medium-high heat and cook the skewers, brushing them with the tare as they cook. Turn them frequently, brushing each time. Cook until golden and just cooked through — around 5-6 minutes for the chicken and 4-5 minutes for the pork. Serve the butakushi and yakitori with the salad, steamed rice and yuzu kosho. What else I’m cooking: Simple galettes made with ripe summer tomatoes and an olive tapenade on the base. What else I’m eating:  The cheeseburger at Goldy’s in Clifton Hill!",
