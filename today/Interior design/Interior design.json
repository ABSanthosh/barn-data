    "description": "Sure we're biased, but we feel industrial design covers a range unmatched by any other design field. The sheer breadth of the ID case studies we saw this year attests to that. Look at the sheer range of items your average ID firm might be called on to design:A 24-hour hot meal vending machine by Spanner. A backpack for carrying oddly-shaped items by StudioFAR. A beautiful modular mouse, designed with fanaticism by Orbital Works. A carry-on roller that transforms into a stroller by Tricycle. A corrective brace for teenagers by PDR. A grocery packaging elimination system by 219 Design. A new form for the air conditioner by Fresco Design. A robotic massage system by Whipsaw. A wearable VR hand tracker/guider by Hatch Duo. An innovative tool for improving cable connections by Design 1st. Biometric firearm security by SGW Designworks. A better tow-behind bike trailer by DesignThink. Experimental steering wheels by Mixer Design. Minimal's solution to combat single-use package design. An accessible backpack by Nike's in-house design team. Pelican's first backpack line by Studio FAR. This beautiful deflectometer by Eskild Hansen Design Studio. Pensa updates Zero Halliburton's classic aluminum suitcases. This surgery simulator by Acorn Product Development. Lastly, Frost Produkt turned a concept into a successful product acquired by Leica.",

Whatever the reason, I'm way behind this year. I wanted to have this tour up weeks ago...but here we are! I hope you enjoy this Christmas home tour and it inspires you! I plan to put a video tour together, I'll update this when I get that up. The only space I didn't include this year is our basement family room and bar, but you can check out the basement tour from last year. I don't change up the holiday decor down there too much so it looks almost exactly this same this year. ;) BedroomLet's start in our bedroom! This room got a big makeover early this year when I installed some vertical tongue and groove molding to brighten up the space. I'm so pleased with how it came together. I like to add a few Christmas touches in our room every year, like our flocked, snowy tree: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This year I did all silver and white ornaments on that tree, but didn't hang them everywhere. I kind of cascaded them around the tree, in a band of ornaments. It's just a different look and I really like how it turned out! I draped some of my favorite Norfolk greenery on our standing mirror: It needed a little something, so I made my own bell garland with some green floral wire and these tiny brass bells:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to create sentimental and beautiful custom ornaments with these tiny DIY vintage frames. These photo ornament ideas are so easy to DIY and add a personal touch to your Christmas tree! I'm sharing a few I've done over the years, including my most recent (and favorite!) version.  I love celebrating the events and special moments of each year by adding photos to our holiday decor, and the tree is the perfect place to display them.  EASY PHOTO TREE Years ago I did the simplest version of this by printing out photos from my phone and just tucking them into the tree:  I mean...you can't get easier than this!  For a nostalgic touch, I edited them with a sepia tone before printing.  This tree decorated with photos was so sweet and I loved looking through the pictures throughout the season. It was surprisingly pretty on the tree too!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Is that just me? :)  Well this is a great way to add a little something sentimental that doesn't overwhelm the tree or your decor.  ACRYLIC DIY ORNAMENTS A couple years ago I added some DIY photo ornaments to our mud room chalkboard. This was a fun one and was super inexpensive and easy to do! I took some round acrylic ornaments from the craft store and used Mod Podge to glue the photos to the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
