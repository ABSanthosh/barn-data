    "description": "Niigata, Japan gets a lot of snow. Way back in the 1960s, they figured out a way to keep the roads clear of snow without requiring plows. Groundwater warmed by geothermal heat is pumped through a network of pipes below the road surface, and sprayed onto the asphalt using sprinklers:The system is called shosetsu. Because the warmed water flows along the grade of the roads, it doesn't freeze and turn into ice—at least in Niigata, where the temperatures don't often dip below the freezing point. (Icy Hokkaido, where the system is not in use, would be a different story.)Niigata reportedly has some 571 kilometers (355 miles) of roadways equipped with shosetsu.It's better on cars than salt.",

    "description": "As we saw with his Smoke Glass, Italian industrial designer Joe Colombo loved smoking and drinking. And, apparently, poker; he designed this Poker Table in 1968. A precursor to the gaming tables of today, the table featured four flip-out wings that allowed players to stack an additional vice on top of gambling. The legs are stainless steel, and the table surfaces are laminated plastic. The ashtrays simply sit in an open hole. Here you can see that you remove them for cleaning by pushing up on the bottom. The wings were reportedly designed to hold both ashtrays and tumblers (Colombo being fond of booze), but in every photo I can find, it's always staged with only the ashtrays.The table originally came with a removable playing surface made of baize, a felt-like fabric, trimmed in leather. With many of the tables you'll see for sale secondhand, the playing surface did not survive. The Poker Table went into production by Italian furniture company Zanotta in 1968. They still feature the table on their website and have it in CAD, so apparently you can still order it.",

    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     This brass planter was in great condition: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
