    "description": "The UK's Wine Society, a member-owned community of oenophiles, has contracted some unusual packaging for some of their wines: Flat-shaped plastic bottles, made from recycled ocean plastic, and recyclable themselves. After conducting a study, the group has concluded that using this recycled PET, and in this shape, is more sustainable than using glass.\"Our packaging report showed that rPET bottles have a significantly lower carbon footprint than single-use glass bottles; they're less energy-intensive to make, smaller and less breakable than glass so can be packed more tightly, and of course significantly lighter (63g compared to an average of 453g for glass bottles).\"Furthermore, they say the plastic is inert and doesn't affect the flavor, though they do recommend it only for wines with a one-year-or-less shelf life.",

    "description": "Texas-based Massimo Modular offers this stunning, futuristic take on the prefabricated home.Their Model E9 is trucked to site, where you need to have laid the foundation in advance and prepared for utilities, then craned onto the foundation. It's been designed with anchor points in the bottom to connect it to the foundation (should your municipality require it). You'd then have a general contractor connect the water, electrical and sewage or septic lines. The structure is 37.7' long, 10.8' wide and 10.5' tall. It's got an underfloor heating system, wiring, plumbing, and HVAC already built in. The electrical requirements are 150-amp 220V dual-phase, and the company says you'd be able to run the refrigerator, stove, washer, dryer, HVAC and heated floor all at the same time. The asking price (not including delivery/installation) is about $100,000. The company reckons it takes just two hours to \"install\" one of these. Meanwhile, the lifespan of the structure is estimated to be 70 years.Lastly, as seen above they're currently setting up \"Modular Communities\" in Las Vegas; Malibu, California; and three locations in Texas. A further two are planned for Florida and Louisiana.",

    "description": "In all workshops, subtractive tools come in one of two flavors: Bring the tool to the workpiece (e.g. a router), or bring the workpiece to the tool (e.g. a shaper). But Chinese manufacturer Tyvok has created a sort of hybrid with the Spider X1S. It's a large-format laser cutter with a compact form factor.It consists of a laser cutter head (both 10W and 20W units are available) that rides on a gantry supported by blocks on either end. These blocks have wheels on them, that can either ride on rails or on the worksurface itself. By choosing the length of the gantry and rails, the idea is that you can achieve the following:With a scheme like this, the devil is in the UX details; in practice, how easy or difficult is it to set up and index the system? If used without the rails, how perfect does your worksurface need to be in order for the wheels to track properly? While there are a rash of product reviews on YouTube, it appears the company has simply seeded influencers with free units, so I'd take those with a grain of salt. But the thinking behind the tool is clever. Pricing starts at $580.",

It was designed by Dutch architect Casper Schols, who planned to sell pre-fabricated versions of the house for roughly $100,000. Now production has arrived, but it has crashed into reality along the way. The company Schols set up to commercialize the design, Cabin Anna, is offering two rather strangely-named options: Anna Elements, a list of a la carte options, and the Anna Collection, which is the whole she-bang.Anna Elements pricing:Base structure: €259,000 (USD $284,295)Mechanical, electrical and plumbing: €23,000 (USD $25,243)Bathroom with toilet and shower: €13,000 (USD $14,268)Kitchen with refrigerator and stove: €15,000 (USD $16,463)Wood-burning stove: €6,000 (USD $6,585)Black stained exterior cladding: €14,000 (USD $15,365)All of that adds up to €330,000 (USD $362,180).The Anna Collection is all of the above, plus a queen-size \"in-floor storable bed,\" an in-floor bath and a mezzanine bedroom. This brings the price up to €437,000 (USD $479,804), excluding VAT. \"This price doesn't include shipping, installation and local taxes,\" the company points out. Price aside, all ten units they plan to build in 2024/2025 have already been reserved, and the company is taking pre-orders for 2025/2026.Oh, to be rich.",

Harvard students AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio proved, as a safety warning, that you can use a pair of Meta's Ray-Ban 2 sunglasses to instantly access the personal data of anyone you see. They pulled it off by simply using face search engines, public databases and an LLM to string the information together. They call the project I-XRAY.As a frightening example from the demonstration, they encounter a young woman they don't know, and instantly have her home address and her parents' names. In another instance, they're able to quickly gain background information on two strangers on public transportation, then approach them and feign recognition in one case, and acquaintanceship in another. \"Hey, aren't you [so-and-so]? We met at [event I know you attended].\"See the demo: It's not difficult to imagine how bad actors could abuse this technology. Imagine approaching an elderly person, for instance, and claiming that you're friends with his grandson, rattling off enough names and relevant locations to quickly convince him that you're a friend of the family.\"Initially started as a side project, I-XRAY quickly highlighted significant privacy concerns. The purpose of building this tool is not for misuse, and we are not releasing it. Our goal is to demonstrate the current capabilities of smart glasses, face search engines, LLMs, and public databases, raising awareness that extracting someone's home address and other personal details from just their face on the street is possible today.\"Nguyen and Ardayfio have posted a Google Doc that shows you how to remove yourself from some of the public databases they accessed in the project.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/133838/UX-Design-Case-Study-Starbucks-Behind-the-Counter-System",
    "description": "This project, \"Bringing Interactive Unity to All Starbucks In-Store Connected Devices,\" is by design consultancy Tactile. The firm straightened out the coffee chain's behind-the-counter systems by tackling the work in five phases.Starbucks Professional Design SystemAt the heart of the Starbucks café experience are their employees–an essential factor in delivering the perfect treat to customers. No minor feat, given the wide array of choices available. So, to help streamline the beverage-building process, Starbucks asked Tactile to craft a common UX strategy and UI design system for all their connected behind-the-counter equipment, now and into the future.Tactile's hands-on experience and direct working knowledge of Starbucks' device ecosystem left us well-positioned to take on such a challenge. The resulting design system helped Starbucks realize more intuitive, enjoyable, and effective devices that balance the needs of both employee and customer. All this was done in an effort to continually deliver a better, more cohesive Starbucks experience.Unifying the Starbucks EcosystemStarbucks employees (also known internally as \"partners\") rely heavily on their trusted tools to craft thousands of delicious beverages per day. This load capacity emphasizes the need for a seamless and efficient work experience, one supported by equipment that's immediately recognizable and easy to use across all locations.The resulting Starbucks Professional Design System is crafted from a foundation of highly functional interactive components and visually intuitive patterns. This system helps Starbucks and their partners realize a more accessible, enjoyable, and effective device experience.Our ApproachTo develop this unified vision for current and future connected devices, we began by establishing a strong foundation of knowledge. Tactile interviewed stakeholder groups from across the Starbucks business in order to establish a core set of guiding UX principles prior to establishing the foundational UI patterns that make up the system.In the end was a newly defined design language that was integrated into the product development process. Our work with Starbucks elevated the quality and consistency of Starbucks device UI in order to create a more cohesive family of equipment. It is a system intended to be more modular, flexible, and scalable across different users and types of equipment, now and into the future.Phase 1Insight Driven Research16 stakeholders, 11 teamsEach interview was conducted as a virtual one-on-one that covered questions from current design and development processes to existing and upcoming equipment, and in-store experiences.The goal of these interviews was to gain an understanding of the current device landscape and processes, as well as gather any intel on current needs, desires, and areas of opportunity.Once the interviews were complete, we evaluated the feedback to identify common themes. These insights highlighted strengths and challenges associated with current and past Starbucks equipment. At the same time it helped to establish a clear set of priorities and opportunities, bringing focus to our ongoing design work.The themes were distilled into six essential design principles. The intention being to guide decision-making, while also defining the experience for key product features and functionality. This helped the system strike the right balance between business goals, in-store partner experience, and customer convenience.Phase 2Device Audit and Deep DiveIn this auditing phase, we took a closer look at current and past equipment. Evaluating the various UX/UI implementations, we gained a clearer understanding of existing features, patterns, and functions.Using our six design principles as a guide, we audited device experiences to identify areas of alignment and opportunities for improvement. This work would steer our path forward for the new design system.Phase 3Building Common UX PatternsLeveraging the findings from the research and audit phases, we began design exploration for a prioritized set of foundational UX components and UI patterns. These would act as a basis for all devices, drawing on common features and functionality within the ecosystem.We started with device agnostic wireframes that described basic pattern behaviors for common features like alerts and sequenced tasks. Each pattern was documented in a living file that was incrementally updated and refined as we moved ahead into the validation phase.Phase 4Validation + RefinementUsing Tactile's ongoing device development projects, we were able to begin implementing and experimenting with the core UX patterns. Through this process, we gained valuable learnings in an effort to optimize the experience and validate solutions before moving forward with design refinement. This is where the Starbucks Pro Design System really began to take shape–by intentionally crafting unity between the brand, their apps, and all the connected devices that baristas use every day.While approaching visual design for the system, we employed a minimal color strategy of black and white plus copper accentuations. The simple use of the copper color gives all baristas a sense of craft pride by referencing physical materials seen in the higher-end Starbucks Reserve stores.These were just some of the elements that helped elevate important information without distracting customers or disrupting partner attention. Other aspects included high contrast text (adhering to strict accessibility guidelines), clear iconography, and simple, intentional typography. All of which came together to create a better informational hierarchy that's easy to read and understand. And always foundational to the process was the ability to build with enough flexibility to scale across a wide range of device types and sizes.Phase 5Finalization + System GuidelinesTactile worked closely with a variety of Starbucks stakeholder groups, over the span of a year, to deliver a holistic and intuitive design language for all of their connected equipment. The resulting Starbucks Pro Design System improves device usability by reducing steps and streamlining the engagement experience for partners. It also helps optimize the Starbucks product development process. Our work with Starbucks helps pave the way for a more coherent and connected equipment future.

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

(This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

These wood picture ledge shelves can be customized to the length and width you need and are a great way to display art and photographs!If you do a lot of DIYing, you may have enough scrap wood on hand to make these. If not, they can be made affordably with basic pine from the hardware store. When we moved into this house, I knew immediately I wanted to do something fun on our staircase walls. This project in particular was on the wall under the stairs: It needed something -- and I imagined some simple display shelves with photos along this wall. First I stuck some painter's tape to the wall to figure out the sizes of each one and get an idea of how it would look. I built three, four and five foot shelves. I wanted to go down low on the wall as much as possible because it just felt right visually to me. These shelves only come out about four inches from the wall. To build these you'll need three pieces of wood -- one 1x2 for the front, one 1x3 for the base, and one 1x4 for the back, all cut to the length you want. You can also make the shelf with a 1x4 on the bottom so it would be a bit deeper. I found the three inch to be fine but if you plan on leaning a bunch of frames I'd go with the four inch. You can see what I mean here:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

This one may inch out my chicken and wild rice. It's that good. This chicken and noodle recipe calls for the thicker noodles, so it's more of a hearty meal than a typical chicken soup. If you like a creamier \"soup\" that you can pile high over mashed potatoes, this one is for you!  I found this recipe floating around on Facebook years ago, but there was no source.  I could tell from the photo that there was more to it than the few ingredients listed. So I added a few and it was absolutely delicious.

I've been hard at work transforming my home office with wallpaper and painted bookcases!  I know, I know...I say this a lot. But this space is turning into one of my all time favorite makeovers. I don't think I could love this room more!  I shared the design plan for this office makeover a few weeks ago. This project is really entails just finishing up this room more than redoing anything.  I've already built the wall of green bookcases and created a huge upholstered pin board on the opposite wall: The room looked great, but I wanted to add some warm finishing details and change a couple of things up.

I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     After a few tries with different wallpaper designs, I landed on this neutral grasscloth peel and stick wallpaper for the walls:  It worked perfectly with the built ins and was much calmer and easier to work with than the other designs I looked at. I'm so glad I found it! Years ago I shared a tutorial on installing peel and stick wallpaper. I find it kind of satisfying to hang. It has plenty of stick, so you can readjust over and over if needed.  You will need clean walls and it is recommended to wait four weeks after painting to apply removable wallpaper.  During the install, I had to work around some art. I had a symmetrical set of ten Audubon prints on the long wall in my office, as you can see in this before pic: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Not only because it's so fresh and delicious, but because it's a recipe my late father-in-law passed down to us.  He grew up in Mexico and loved to cook for his loved ones. So much so, that once a year we would invite our friends over and he would cook for the huge group.  If a brave soul dared to help prep...they were subject to my father-in-law's scrutiny while they chopped or mixed. ;)  He was a stickler about his cooking and rightly so...every single thing he made was absolutely delicious and authentic. He could be intimidating at first, but was a big softie at heart and cooking for family and friends filled him with joy! Thankfully this is one of the recipes he handed down to us. I'm sure it's pretty standard as far as salsa recipes are concerned, but it's special to us because it brings back such happy memories when we make it: This quick salsa recipe is easy and so flavorful!  Here's my mild version of his salsa:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to create a beautiful and rustic woodland themed fall mantel.  I went out of my comfort zone with my fall mantel this year, but I'm so glad I did! This time I added decor I've only traditionally used at Christmas.  This is my favorite fall mantel EVER. It has everything I love...overflowing with full fall leaves and beautiful, warm autumn colors.  This time of year I definitely feel the need to nest, and in the fall and winter that means making the house feel as cozy as possible. In general I prefer less decor in the spring and summer, but in the cooler months give me all the layers and textures and colors! Last year I decorated our mantel with some fall stems I found online:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "I share this post every year because it's important to me that we have a visual reminder of this day, now more than 20 years ago. Can you even believe it? It's crazy to me that there is a whole generation that wasn't even alive when 9/11 occurred. If you've read my blog for long, you know New York City is near and dear to us. It's a city we love so very much. I always knew I'd love it, and when my husband took me on my first trip (just a few days before September 11, 2001) I found out I was right.  This photo always gives me chills. We're at the top of the Statue of Liberty and you can barely see the towers behind me: This was nine days before 9/11. Nine days later and the towers were gone. My husband was a band director at the time, and a few months after the attacks we were supposed to travel to Japan for a band trip. He canceled that trip and instead we took the students to New York City. SO many New Yorkers stopped us numerous times and thanked the kids for visiting. These first photos are from the Ground Zero Museum and tell the story of that day. This location is separate from the new museum — it used to be closer to Ground Zero but it looks like it’s moved to 14th street. If you visit the city I highly recommend visiting both. I let the photos do the talking (forgive the quality, all were taken with a phone over the years):Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I'm excited to make this room even warmer and cozier.  If you've read TDC for a while, you know I tend to slow down in the summer. I did some research a few months ago and am quite sure I have summer Seasonal Affect Disorder.  For as long as I can remember, I lose my energy and mojo in the heat. The sweating, humidity, bugs (mosquitos LOVE ME), the heat...it drains everything out of me. But once these slightly cooler days hit, I feel like myself again! I am happier, more energized and ready to tackle new projects! I love fall so very much. I accomplished a bunch of DIY projects before the summer, and this office redo is the first I want to tackle in the second half of the year. I hate to call it a redo...I'm just adding to what I've already done.  This room started out very pretty and light, but there wasn't a lot going on design-wise:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYRw13BwfzPVIvL9tqBzDjh85gAml-mcHgAPUGqKxBoFCk6B-c1jVHhaBjg0igkKzR1PCZqnPKzno4f3dSCRw6szebKY1zrQY0k0F7QHFLB9M3JP1TV-Ind3UVqtKZPrBiivSk8EPt3bjA-pSfzqRBYKNzQqTO-Kk-xazmb5_XyMLZPYVPmopCcQx5Nes/s16000/office%20with%20floating%20desk.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I've shared a couple of them here...if you have old, yellowed cans with halogen bulbs, it's super easy to replace your old recessed lights with beautiful LED versions.You can also add character and detail where a recessed light is installed by using a simple kit that screws into the to change it to a hanging pendant light. For this method you need to have the a canned light that has a screw in light bulb.I did this in our little blue and white floral wallpapered hallway: And in our foyer vestibule when I added (you guessed it)...wallpaper there as well: Both of those options are SUPER simple and take no electrical knowledge at all!I do have some electrical experience, so I thought this next one would be especially easy. Although it turns out you don't need to know much other than how to wire a light fixture to do this one. So I thought...easy! 😣You know how sometimes what you think will be super difficult turn out to be a breeze, and projects you think will be easy turn out to be much harder than you thought? This was one of those harder than I thought ones.Shortly after finishing my closet makeover over the past couple of weeks, I thought about some updates I'd like to make to the little hallway outside the closet as well.It's a small space, but as you can see above, I love treating spots like that as tiny rooms I can decorate. :) We have a recessed light in this area that I knew would look great with a hanging light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

It's easy to make fabric pumpkins and no sewing machine or experience is needed.  They are an easy knock off of the expensive Pottery Barn teddy bear pumpkin pillows. :) When I first saw those adorable stuffed pumpkins, I knew I had to make some of my own.  I ended up making a bunch of them for the price of ONE from the store.

I thought they were the cutest pumpkins/pillows -- so soft and fluffy!  But the price...nope. At least when I knew I could recreate them for a fraction of what they are charging.  I went to the craft store in search of the softest, fluffiest fabric I could find. I got three colors in very similar fabrics -- one light cream, one medium brown and one dark brown.  They are all SO SOFT and cozy. I just loved all three. The dark fabric is what I think is considered the true \"teddy bear\" fabric, but they all worked beautifully for this project.  I've never made my own fabric pumpkins, but I figured it out along the way. My first method worked OK, but then I did a little research and will be sharing the instructions I ended up using for the rest of the pumpkins.  This DIY fabric pumpkin how-to will work with both the fluffy fabrics I'm using and thinner options for cotton or velvet pumpkins.  First up, cut a rounded square or circle out of your fabric in the size you want:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I prefer to use inexpensive, unfinished cabinets for my projects and then dress them up. If you're willing to put the time and effort in, you can completely customize your stock cabinets with some time and sweat equity. I rounded up my ten favorite ways to update inexpensive cabinets and make them MUCH more functional and high end looking. 1. Paint your cabinets! OK, this one is the most obvious, but is also the DIY that makes the biggest impact for sure. If you want to transform your cabinetry by painting them, make sure and take the correct steps. Doing this correctly will make them super durable and looking beautiful for years!I painted all of our kitchen cabinets in our last house: Check out my cabinet painting tutorial (with a paint sprayer) to find out how I did it!Don't underestimate the difference a couple coats of paint will make -- this is my number one recommendation for updating your kitchen or bathroom.2. Extend cabinets to ceilingI've added this custom cabinetry touch in both of our homes. If your cabinets don't go to the ceiling, closing in that space can make them look more high end.I first tried this out at our last house by adding open shelving on top of our kitchen cabinets: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Since we had about 18 inches to work with between the top of the cabinets and the ceiling, I opted to create a thick header, as well as the open decorative shelves at the top of the kitchen cabinets. Figuring out the balance is important if you want to try this DIY project. I've seen some people fill in a very large opening with just open spaces and no header -- this can look off if that open space is too tall. The cabinets and open shelving end up competing against each other. Adding a header with molding at the top helps to balance everything out. I've also seen some close in a large space with just a header, and that can feel super heavy. I recommend doing a combination of additional cabinets and/or open shelving and a header if you have significant empty space over your cabinets. I used much taller upper cabinets in our basement kitchenette, so we only had a small space to fill in above: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I mean, who wants to spend a fortune on pillows that will only be out for two to three months?  I've shared this little hack a few times, because it saves me so much money. The investment is in my time, but I'm so quick at these now it doesn't take long at all.  I like seasonal decor that can be used more than a couple weeks and that's easy to store away. These always fit both of those criteria. OH, and cheap. Also checks that one off.  I always love the Pottery Barn selection of fall pillows, but they are like $30+ each for just the pillow covers. When I want one, maybe. When I want a bunch, no way.  Years ago, I started looking at other ways to get the same look, for way less!  I found this runner at Marshall's (they have similar ones at TJ Maxx and HomeGoods too) and my plan starting coming together:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Never forget a paint colorWe've all been there -- you need to touch up a spot, or you love a color so much you want to use it again. But did you use eggshell or satin?

    "description": "Building a DIY basement bar and kitchenette, from start to finish!  I'm finally sharing a full tour of our basement kitchenette that I've worked on for the past two years! We love this space so much and it's about time I show you the whole room.  I tackled so many DIY projects for this kitchen build and learned a ton along the way. I even had a few do-it-myself firsts during this process.  The value of our home was definitely increased with this project as well. (Although I will never leave this house if I can help it!)  We waited about five years to tackle this space after moving in. It was kind of a catch all spot before:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgxcAv62CUvfqccHzHqqCu_nBzmW_y_Zp9DfwW54TitYU87CHbfZFLUn0cbT0Ky8xn5bI4jfBIloybs6Z9WIMD6bvbpE9sW233GRvyYhu76zv63I0UOn-gACJPtu2-WFD-2FuxVscO7u9qGlZCDNSKPs1_ZOr5rWxnXU_BfAEoQMHP2tZJAlAAfH5TGbM/s16000/basement%20kitchen%20plan.jpg\"\u003e I didn't have the builder carpet this area, thinking we would start this process right away. I was a little off on the timeline. ;)  We had wine fridges down here, and a microwave to make popcorn, but that was about it.  We had all of the water and plumbing (water line for fridge and plumbing for sink) roughed in when we built the house.  After I cleared everything out of here, it was time to start building a fun and functional space for my family to enjoy.  Before I could start anything, we had the outlets moved to fit the layout and up to counter height:   src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjocYJOjcMszoWDofypo9MQCq6SnI1A1faLJtfZ_yE9qzsDJbAVGsubOkTubh8gDacAYXwZOY1f56rHtu6GJiE3jO-MSFwGkw6ZUpDvg2hnra7RfYT9Uuhk0Fx2mvfZpc15oQN6f6SSvYL1FM0K3ag7X1TQe6GHfBB7bqeX2NkGWhPqEEnwbXBwAEOui7Y/s16000/unfinished%20kitchenette.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

We could have fit a whole kitchen in here! (This is probably twice the size of all of my kitchens up till our last house.)  I'll take you through the steps of this project (with links to full tutorials) and then I'll share the final reveal at the end of the post.  I am so incredibly proud of this room because I did almost every project on my own. I thought the massive kitchen makeover I did at our last house was a lot of work -- this one beat that by far! It took me more than a year to complete the space.  Building and installing cabinets  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "The quickest and easiest way to install tile (no mortar needed!). The tile project I'm sharing today is one of my favorites I've ever done -- first of all because it was SO easy, thanks to this awesome product, and because it is beautiful!  I fell hard for a square, slightly shimmery tile called Zellige. Turns out it was very trendy a few years ago...as usual I'm way behind on the trends. (And I'm fine with that.)  It has a wavy texture that makes it look handmade...and usually it is! The real stuff is VERY expensive, but I really wanted to use it for the small backsplash in our laundry/mud room: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     You can install in a straight stacked look like this for a more modern look, or in a brick pattern for a more traditional look. The thing is, authentic Zellige tile is handmade from clay and has an imperfect look that I don't always love. Also, it's usually installed very close with small grout lines (which adds to the imperfect look).  I've always preferred the more uniform versions I've seen, with a bit of contrast with the grout.  I did some research and found this ceramic version pictured above that still has the handmade look, but is very affordable! Plus each tile is uniform and the same size, but still has the pretty details that I loved about the real stuff.  It went into my cart! I was even more pleased in person -- they were so lovely! I had a couple hiccups in this tile process along the way because I didn't order enough at first. I had to wait on backorders and then the second shipment was much shinier than the first. I was able to pick and choose out of the boxes to find some that matched better. You'll probably be able to avoid this by buying all you need at once so they are from the same lot number. But overall the install process was a breeze! I used a non-mortar install product that makes the tile installation SUPER quick and mess-free. Before you start tiling, figure out the middle of the area you'll be working on. Since ours was the backsplash, I marked the middle and centered a tile on that:  I then lined up the tiles each direction to make sure I wasn't going to have any tiny slivers at the ends.  When I was sure of my layout, I pulled out the item that made the process go so quickly. It's a tile setting mat that you use instead of mortar:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

There are always some great deals, but I like to round up and share some of my favorites every year instead. Last year I gathered 30 of my favorite Amazon items under $30. This year I decided to put together a list of my most useful finds from Amazon. I've been writing down my favorites for a few weeks now.I start my holiday shopping during Prime Days, and it's so nice to get some items off of my list early. Most of these items would make great gifts for loved ones.A lot of these products are what I would call \"things you didn't know you needed.\" 😊 I'm including a mix of home, DIY and beauty products in this round up. This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Find ALL of my favorites at my Amazon storefront by clicking here!1.

    "description": "Cheap and easy hack to frost a window for privacy.You don't need expensive privacy films to cover your doors or windows! This easy solution is inexpensive and gives you instant privacy. This DIY is so simple and cheap, and helps with an annoying privacy problem that would be expensive or messy to fix otherwise. I've actually shared this \"hack\" before (a looong time ago), but it's one that's worth sharing again!I've used this for frosting glass on glass doors and interior windows and it is a great, inexpensive solution. Plus, it's easily removed if you ever change your mind. You can easily do this to any flat glass surface with very few tools and a little time. The first time I did this was on our glass pantry door ten years ago: I was able to frost our glass pantry door for next to nothing! (Although getting the film placed perfectly on those panes was a PAIN.) A few helpful readers told me about this trick forever ago. Who knew transparent contact paper is the easiest and cheapest way to make a window private? I was so pleasantly surprised when this actually worked!  We had a big bathroom window in the old house that I made private with this as well. I didn't think I'd need to do it again, until we moved into this house and realized the powder room window was placed in a less than ideal spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Ha! Just...not the best. I've always felt for our guests especially. 😝 I don't know what took me so long, but I finally did this private window trick again and it worked like a charm.Now there are a few ways to do this, but I promise you this is the easiest. You can buy frosted window film, but those options are more costly. You can also use a frosted glass spray paint, but that's messy -- you have to worry about overspray and fumes...and it won't hold up well over time on a window or door that gets a lot of use.You can also use a glass etching cream to do this permanently, but I would only try that in extreme cases.  For this DIY method of frosting glass, you'll need transparent matte Contact paper: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Not only is it cheaper than storebought stuff like Windex, it also cleans better and without streaks! Plus, it only takes 2 ingredients (although more can be added). So grab an empty spray bottle and come see the light with us! That's supposed to be a clean window pun, btw... Continue reading The Easiest Homemade Window Cleaner at Young House Love.",

We named both of our kids after our grandparents – one on J’s side and one on mine. I recently heard names like that for baby girls being called \"old lady names.\" Not sure how I feel about that - but a timeworn and classic name just feels like it's lovely and enduring. A friend of mine recently had a baby girl and it was fun to talk about all the names they were considering for her. And since I already shared a list of 100 classic boy names, I also loved compiling this list of my favorite classic old-fashioned baby girl names.

It is SO easy, SO simple, and SO SO SO effective. It requires no special or harsh cleaners and will restore your sink to its original sparkle within minutes.

So here’s a snapshot of not only every 2024 Color of the Year, but also how they compare to each company’s previous selections. Buckle up, fellow color nerds! As more and more companies jump on the color forecasting bandwagon, we’ve decided to focus on the major paint and color companies in the post. Many brands also release yearly palettes instead of one single color. For simplicity’s sake, we’ve omitted those as well. So apologies if we’ve missed your favorite niche paint brand below.

These annoying pests are pretty common but luckily, it doesn't take a lot of money, supplies, or effort to get rid of them. In fact, you can probably find everything you need in your cabinets! We recently had a fruit fly problem in our home (the first time in over four years here - we have no idea what brought them in). So I seized the opportunity to test 7 different methods of eliminating them. Yes, there were copious notes taken and even a spreadsheet.

It was a surprising and wonderful departure from our usual family trips, so I wanted to share some highlights in case anyone else is interested in breaking out of the more typical beach or theme park vacation routine. Growing up on the East Coast and now living in Florida, I haven’t spent much time in the upper Midwest. So these sights may be old hat for some of you. But just like our trip to the California desert earlier this year, this was a chance for us to soak up some new-to-us geography. Why We Vacationed In South Dakota South Dakota is home to lots of epic vistas, charming towns, and outdoor adventures. Continue reading A Summer Trip To South Dakota at Young House Love.",
