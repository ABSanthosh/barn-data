    "description": "Freedom Communications is an American manufacturer of communications gear. To create their R-9000 analyzer, they turned to industrial design consultancy Mixer Design. Freedom R-9000 Communications AnalyzerThe Freedom Communications R-9000 brings together a wide range of radio equipment testing capabilities--whether out in the field or on the test bench. The rugged R-9000 high-performance device allows for multiple orientations and configurations. Our Industrial Designers developed a benchmark visual language for the Freedom Communications brand while our Mechanical Engineers tackled high power thermal dissipation, durability and manufacturability. Users First The User Experience of this device addresses the many environments where it operates. This could include an electrical bench in a lab or high atop a communications tower. The Mixer team built many weighted prototypes to experiment with strap locations and adjustable feet until they came upon a just-right mix of features. Build - Learn - RepeatOur designers and engineers have direct access to our well-equipped shop to discover new ideas, build complex assemblies and trouble-shoot designs. We are open to many sources of inspiration and believe that if a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand pictures. Beyond the BoxThe Mixer Design team helped Freedom set the benchmark with the R-9000's new brand look. We also helped them project their new brand with the design of a trade show booth, product graphics and digital assets for their marketing team. You can see more of Mixer Design's work here.",

If you'd like to see everything we did in the old backyard, be sure to check out these posts!  Our backyard was just so pretty and magical, and we definitely missed it after moving. But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry! It won out here too, does that surprise you? :)  A couple of years ago I moved seat configuration around a bit to give us a little more walking room along the side. Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset.
