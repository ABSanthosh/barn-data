    "description": "Steel rulers are a mainstay in many a workshop. From a design standpoint, you'd think there isn't much to them: Add a satin finish so they don't glare under shop lights, and make the numbers easy to read. With their \"Pick Up\" line of rulers, Japanese manufacturer Shinwa has met these first two criteria……and they've also added a brilliant third feature we've all needed, but never thought much about. If you've ever struggled to pick up a ruler that isn't at the edge of your workbench, you'll appreciate it. The ruler has a slightly kicked-up tail, like on a skateboard. Once it's tilted back, you can easily grab the thing, even if you've just cut your nails. To me, that's a designer or engineer going the extra mile. (Er, kilometer.)",

    "description": "The Core77 Design Awards Transportation \u0026 Mobility category features vehicles, systems, or modes of transportation used to get people or objects from one place to another, for private, public, commercial, or industrial purposes. Examples include planes, trains, automobiles, buses, bikes, boats, mass transit systems, or transportation infrastructure. Biomega EV, an electric vehicle designed for the future by Skibsted and his team.You can get pretty far on a bike if you keep pedaling. That's certainly been true for Jens Martin Skibsted, who has climbed to the top of his field as an award-winning designer, entrepreneur, and design philosopher. Jens Martin is a Global Partner at Manyone who also helped found design consultancies including Skibsted Ideation and KiBiSi. He reached design peaks with his bike designs for Biomega, the Danish design brand he founded in 1998 to create bikes that could replace cars in urban environments. Jens Martin has collaborated with high profile designers including Marc Newson and Bjarke Ingels, and his designs can be found in the collections at the MoMA, LeCnap, Designmuseum Danmark, SFMOMA, and more. Jens Martin and Christian Bason's book EXPAND: Stretching the Future by Design.In addition to serving on the board of the Danfoss Foundation, Biomega, and Manyone, Jens Martin is the former Chairman of the Danish Design Council, Vice Chair of World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on Design Innovation, Co-Chair of World Economic Forum's Global Future Council on Entrepreneurship, and a Young Global Leader alumnus. He is a noted speaker, blogger, and contributor to the Huffington Post, Harvard Business Review, Forbes, and Fast Company.The BER Biomega's new e-bike from Skibsted.Jens Martin's wheels really get turning over the BER, Biomega's new e-bike. \"Outside of Biomega's unique bells and whistles, the charger sits in the head stem tube – making it the most comfortable e-bike to charge,\" he says. He's also excited about Manyone's new AI-enabled design process. As far as concerns in the design world, Jens Martin worries that there might be \"a little too little thinking in design 'thinking.'\" He also expresses some trepidation over the leadership future of the world's three biggest nuclear powers and two biggest \"gas guzzlers.\"To Core77 Design Awards entrants, Jens Martin advises them to align their world views with their team and client – \"and trust it.\"Springtime Design for Scootility was the 2024 Winner in the Transportation Category.The 2024 winner in the Core77 Design Awards Transportation \u0026 Mobility category was Springtime Design for Scootility, a utility scooter that's also a cargo vehicle suited to urban environments.

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Step-by-step tutorial to recover a seat cushion with new fabric. You can give almost any upholstered dining or accent chair a brand-new look with minimal time and effort!  I've recovered quite a few chairs over the years, and some were easier than others. One of my most difficult DIY projects ever was recovering our upholstered dining room chairs years ago.  All six had fabric on the seat as well as the back, and removing all of it was one of the most tedious and annoying projects I've ever taken on. ;) I would rather not do that ever again.  But the process of cover the chairs with new fabric wasn't that bad at all! The easiest process when you have a chair with an upholstered seat cushion that is removable.  My latest project was in my office. I've had this more modern chair in there for years (this is the best pic of it with the new wallpaper and paint):  But the more I transformed this room, the more it felt of out of place. I wanted something a little cozier, a little warmer that fit in better.  I found the perfect chair on Facebook Marketplace. I loved the warm, dark wood tone and the caning on the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
