    "description": "The Tempo Walk, by golf cart manufacturer Club Car, is an autonomous golf caddie. Developed before the pandemic, the original version was pretty utilitarian-looking:When it was time for a design upgrade, Club Car contacted industrial design firm Cardboard Helicopter for help.\"At Cardboard Helicopter, our team was delighted to collaborate with Tempo Walk to create an innovative and cutting-edge autonomous golf caddie. Our goal was to provide golfers with a unique and immersive experience on the golf course. From the initial stages of industrial design sketch concepts to the final manufacturing production of 3D CAD and engineering, we were deeply involved in the development process.\" \"We pushed the boundaries of design to ensure the caddie was not only sleek and stylish, but also practical, marketable, manufacturable, and most importantly, adored by golfers.\" Client and company CEO Timothy Doane gave Cardboard Helicopter a rave review:\"The folks from CH were great to work with. They combine a unique blend of creativity, artistic ability, and innovation. Their work helped us create an industry shocking design for our new Tempo Walk product which increased sales from the start. If you are looking for an eye-catching new look you can't go wrong with CH!\"You can see more of Cardboard Helicopter's work here.",

I love seeing pics of friends and family with their hot coffee and comfy clothes out finding the deals.  WAY back in the day I would wake up early to shop, but those days are long gone! Now it would take an act of God to get me up super early the day after Thanksgiving, ha! If you're like me and prefer to shop from your computer instead of trekking all over, this is for you! This post is so fun to pull together every year -- check out my ten themed gift ideas from last year. I added ** two asterisks ** before each item that is an Amazon Black Friday Deal! Beauty finds Let's start with a bit of beauty, specifically nails! I prefer to do my own -- I used to get gel or dip nails before a vacation or big event, but it's rare that I do that anymore.  I've found a few items that make my nails look great and thought I would share them.  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "Upgrade your plain Christmas wreaths with these easy and inexpensive DIYs! Wreaths are one my favorite ways to decorate for the holiday season. There are so many easy ways to add festive touches to inexpensive, plain wreaths.  I put wreaths of every size all over our house when I decorate for Christmas. I realized this year that it takes me forever to put all of our holiday decor out because I can't leave well enough alone...I LOVE to tweak things and add my own touch. I've done that with wreaths a lot over the years, and even more so this year. I've gathered a bunch of DIYs for basic wreaths to give you some inspiration for this season!

I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     I think evergreen wreaths are quite beautiful on their own, especially with some twinkling lights. I wanted this simpler look for the bookcases in my office that's been undergoing a makeover.  I picked up a couple of these Norway spruce wreaths from At Home:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_IjzAjSLtroC1bI_h0IccAs-9ShtgnUtOlSvwr4joScdWnKaH92CACARASQw4Qemgn8_HrkSSuJqACSNA5zIdwo1Fg17TwmQw_bf95sHTVsFxfwMorH-jEzo_AQgThB_qD4_Y9jaU-83grsKGlV54mHUvOn4CMh8zJntdIPCUPGLhOp1VGRyxacOb1KI/s16000/Norway%20spruce%20wreath%20At%20Home.jpg\"\u003e They come in a two and three foot width, mine are the smaller versions.  I grabbed some of my pinecone stems that I use every year (from Hobby Lobby) and secured them together with some green floral wire: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvq6HwgZEOG5D_sslqiBPv0MY4QUXk_rDMyI1u6aMkVGzB11SPSxJVsynDE0QTOB96tVOmYLv9tdkN0yk6pr9XsDNfWKZWFjjTAi-iKfVb99mkYzfSuExdg6SR6AJ-E5S_cHwIJ2HIi3zCU0pGD2skEg48KKB1mtSO99Z5_yO7TVcOhzTbdZ3EW05uPN4/s16000/green%20floral%20wire%20for%20wreaths.jpg\"\u003e Then I used that same wire to attach the pinecones to the bottom of the metal base on the wreath.

    "description": "The Cross Street Flats in Carlton were designed in the early 1970s by Earle Shaw and Partners — a lesser-known but significant contemporary of Merchant Builders, Graeme Gunn, and other influential practices addressing Melbourne’s shortage of medium-density housing — with involvement from Australian architectural historian David Saunders. The project is still highly respected today by designers and residents, including architect and multiple housing leader at Wardle Jack Davies, and Aesop development manager Elizabeth White, who live in one of the apartments with their newborn son, Gus. They purchased their Cross Street apartment for its progressive design, described as the ‘first large-scale urban project in Australia that consciously articulated an understanding of its historic environment.’ With a $70,000 budget, Jack and Elizabeth have renovated the apartment (virtually untouched since the 1990s), while respecting the building’s architectural integrity.",

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).
