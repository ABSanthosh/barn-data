    "description": "Saudi Arabia is currently building the largest urban park in the world. At six square miles the King Salman Park, which should be completed around 2026, will be five times the size of New York's Central Park. The Visitor's Centre was erected last year. Designed by Adjaye Associates, the firm headed by Ghanaian-British architect Sir David Adjaye, the structure features rammed-earth walls precisely placed to create passive cooling. What really caught my eye is this handrail detail that I've never seen before:I poked around and found a couple other examples of recessed handrails (they're pretty rare). This is at Bloomberg's Hong Kong office, designed by Neri \u0026 Hu: And this is at a private residence in Toronto, designed by PLANT Architect Inc.: I prefer Adjaye's design over the other two. There's something decidedly unfriendly about the right angle corner the latter two designs present you with.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137154/From-Germany-In-Curb-EV-Chargers",
    "description": "Embarassingly, the U.S. is a laggard when it comes to EVs. Stateside they make up just 7.5% of new car sales. In Europe, the figure is 25%, projected to grow to 60% by 2030; in China, it's 60% today. We're getting left in the emissions-free dust.All of which means new charging station designs and innovations will likely happen overseas. As one example Rheinmetall, a German defense and automotive technology company, has developed this Rheinmetall Curb Charger. In Germany, as in many European countries, they have standards for curb stones. These transition points between the sidewalk and street can be made of natural stone or cast concrete, but have consistent dimensions within municipalities. Rheinmetall's design follows these standards, fitting precisely within the space for a single curb stone. The charger is encased in concrete, stainless steel and aluminum, and is completely resistant to both the elements and temperature extremes. Users do need to provide their own charging cables (in Europe, it's common for EV owners to carry their own). They interact with the charger, which is connected to the grid via 4G and/or ethernet, via RFID, QR code or app.It delivers Level 2 charging, which generally adds 20 to 60 miles of range per hour, and can top off a 60 kWh battery in four to eight hours. Maintenance is straightforward; the components within are modular and can be popped in and out for servicing.Last year Rheinmetall rolled out four of these for a pilot project in Cologne. After a year of real-world testing, they found the units performed with 99% reliability and were positively reviewed by users.One potential downside to the ground-mounted design is that infirm or elderly users may find plugging in difficult. In these shots of an earlier design, where the plug flips up, you can see that it still requires bending over to plug in. Another potential drawback, if you can call it that, is that the design is so invisible that users may not know it's there. Your standard charging station announces itself by virtue of its freestanding design. Rheinmetall's design, at least for now, is more of an IYKYK kind of thing. But perhaps one day, at least in Europe, people will look down at curbs in parking areas and expect to see these.",

But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate. Or sugar. This peanut butter pie is a great recipe for the warmer months, because there's no oven needed! But it's also a staple for a holiday meal.
