    "description": "Verge Next, a subsidiary of Estonia-based Verge Motorcycles, invented this Donut Motor. It's designed to drive a hubless wheel. Although once seen as something that simply looked cool in renderings, the company says the hubless arrangement brings performance and manufacturing benefits, \"delivering unmatched torque and power density with minimal weight.\"For one thing, there's no chain, belt or drivetrain required. Secondly, it frees the body of the bike from the task of holding the motor—everything is now contained within that rear wheel. That means the entire body of the bike can now be filled with batteries, adding range. Furthermore:\"The Verge Next Platform redefines vehicle design, drastically lowering the threshold for creating new two-wheelers. By eliminating unnecessary moving parts, the architecture and engineering processes become significantly simpler and more streamlined.\" \"Our solution brings multiple benefits: decreased weight leads to greater efficiency, reduced manufacturing complexity minimizes costs, and fewer components translate to lower maintenance needs over the vehicle's lifetime.\"The company has not only incorporated the Donut Motor into their own bikes, but is now licensing the technology. Assuming it does what it says on the tin, our future streetscapes will be covered with hubless bikes, scooters and motorcycles.Here's a closer look at a Verge bike and how its design is influenced by the motor:",

    "description": "Having a hard case fitted out with foam inserts to hold your gear is satisfying—until your gear changes. Now that precisely-shaped protection is worthless. To address this, Pelican produces this Re-Set foam protection system, which is endlessly reconfigurable and reusable; there's no cutting required. The system consists of a series of plastic grids and high-density foam pegs. The pegs fit into each square and are held in place by friction. To create a cavity above the grid, you simply push the peg downwards. If the pegs compress over time and lose their grip on the grid, you simply rotate them 45 degrees to refresh their \"bite.\" Here's how it works:The Re-Set kits are available for Pelican's 1700, 1720 and 1750 Protector Long Cases.While Pelican's lawyers won't be pleased, I can almost guarantee we'll see Etsy sellers knocking these off with 3D-printed grids and foam ordered from McMaster.",

If you'd like to see everything we did in the old backyard, be sure to check out these posts!  Our backyard was just so pretty and magical, and we definitely missed it after moving. But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry! It won out here too, does that surprise you? :)  A couple of years ago I moved seat configuration around a bit to give us a little more walking room along the side. Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
