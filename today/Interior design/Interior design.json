    "description": "Studio Uno, as it’s known, is a new standalone backyard unit for Naomi: a full-time carer and mother to an adult child with high support needs. Naomi required a space of her own, but town planning restrictions meant adding a second standard dwelling to her compact Brunswick site wasn’t possible, so the building was designed as a certified dependent person’s unit that can be dismantled, transported, and reassembled if required in future. Mihaly Slocombe Architects went beyond functionality to design a site responsive, flexible, and nourishing self-contained residence on a 31-square-metre footprint to enrich the client’s quality of life.",
