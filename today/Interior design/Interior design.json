    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "link": "https://www.thriftydecorchick.com/2021/04/hide-tv-components-use-remote.html",
    "description": "A decorative, DIY way to hide TV electronics and components in style. While I was designing our HUGE entertainment center project in our basement, I wanted to make sure we could hide the cable box and stereo system receiver out of the way. I didn't want to look at them every day, but we needed to be able to access them easily of course.  Thankfully there's an easy way to do that if you are stashing these electronics inside a cabinet or console. I've shared how to add metal sheeting to cabinet doors before, (you can see the fireplace makeover at our old house there) but this time it was even simpler. I figured I'd share how I did it.  Why add metal sheeting you ask? Well when you hide electronic components hidden away, it's best to give them some air flow. Otherwise they run hot and that will shorten the life of the components. Also, your remotes won't work through a wood cabinet door, but will through metal sheeting.**You can also use an RF remote control system that allows you to keep your TV electronics in another room -- I'll add a link to that at the end of the post. We didn't want to use that because we use the voice controls often.  Here's a reminder of how this project ended up:  This is one of my favorite projects I've ever tackled!     I cut the back out of two of the bottom bench cabinets in preparation for the electronics to be added later. We knew we'd have a receiver down there at the very least, and I wanted to allow for more air flow and access from the backs of the cabinets.  A few weeks ago we had the first part of our sound system installed, and every time we turned on the TV we had to open the cabinet to get the remote to work. Then a cat or two would crawl back there...so I knew it was time to get those door fronts replaced.  I removed the cabinet doors from the hinges and used a large drill bit to make holes in the four corners of the front panel. This gives you a spot to insert your jigsaw blade:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. This is where I did things a little differently than last time -- I sawed right up to the edge of the center panel against the cabinet frame. This takes a little bit more of a steady hand but it doesn't have to be perfect! I had plenty of spots that weren't perfectly flush: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
