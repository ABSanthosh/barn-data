In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.

    "description": "Building on a rocky coastal hillside might yield spectacular views, but it also requires heavy excavation and an environmental cost. Faced with a challenging plot of land on Albania's coast, JA Joubert Architecture of Holland and UNS Architects of Albania found a way to work with the land rather than against it. Here are the plans for the Zig-Zag Resort the two firms co-designed: \"Architecture should not dominate the land; it should respond to it,\" says Marc Joubert, of JA Joubert Architecture. \"At Zig-Zag, we created a design where nature dictates the structure—ensuring that every guest experiences this amazing landscape.\"The resort harmonizes with the natural terrain through its signature zig-zag layout, ensuring that each guest enjoys uninterrupted views of the breathtaking surroundings. The project prioritizes sustainability and seamless mobility, incorporating a funicular system, pedestrian pathways, and drop-off points for intuitive navigation. It is built with locally sourced Berat Stone, blending regional craftsmanship with modern luxury while optimizing passive cooling and solar energy efficiency. With minimal land disruption, rainwater management systems, and an indoor-outdoor architectural flow, Zig-Zag integrates ecological sensitivity into its design. The resort's sea-water infinity pool and private coastal access further enhance its connection to the Albanian Riviera, making nature a core part of the guest experience. The project spans 30,000m², including hotel accommodations, gardens, and various amenities, and is currently in the design phase.",

    "description": "Wick cord, or wicking rope, is a hack used by some gardeners and plant enthusiasts. A cord or rope made of cotton or nylon is used to connect a water source with the soil surrounding the plant. Capillary action causes water to slowly move from the water source to the plant. On a roofing forum on Reddit, one poster had a problem unrelated to gardening. He recently replaced the flat roof on his house with a new one. Flat roofs are notoriously poorly draining, and the poster observed standing water on their roof, an 8-square-foot puddle. For four days, the puddle would not evaporate nor drain. Seeking a solution, the poster put one end of a wicking rope in the puddle, weighing it down with stones, and routed the other end through a scupper into the drainpipe.\"It seems to work great!\" the poster writes. \"The puddle went from 8 sq ft and an inch deep to totally dry in less than 12 hours.\" It's cheaper, and a lot less hassle, than having to pump the standing water out.",

But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate.

This beautiful flowering perennial is easy to grow once you find the perfect spot in your garden. Peonies are one of my all time favorite cut flowers -- the blooms are so full and lush and sometimes incredibly fragrant!

Kollab directors Hayley and Mick Barrett and their three children lived here for 15 years, before demolishing their previous home and building their dream home on the same site, designed by Pleysier Perkins. The new house combines references to the original timber home and mid-century modernism, to form a breathtaking escape that captures its remarkable Mornington Peninsula locale.

It’s now like a multi-purpose treehouse, tucked neatly beside a family’s much-loved Alistair Knox-designed retreat on Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula.",
