    "description": "Playgrounds have traditionally been the domain of elementary schools. But Pennsylvania-based playground equipment manufacturer Playworld reckons that folks of all ages would benefit from using them. They've thus designed two systems, ENERGI and LifeTrail, aimed at older users.Each system consists of low-maintenance outdoor equipment and signage. Their ENERGI system, aimed at junior high and high school kids, has five components that offer 120 different body-weight-resistance exercise between them. The weatherproof signage contains graphics demonstrating the exercises, and the company also offers online instructional videos. Their LifeTrail system, designed for seniors, consists of five stations and an additional two that are ADA-approved and can be used by wheelchair users. The graphics on the signage are printed large, for easier visibility. Designed in collaboration with a kinesiology and gerontology specialist, the LifeTrail system provides 21 different exercises to help seniors keep fit. Both systems feature exercises broken into beginner, intermediate and advanced levels, in a bid to maximize inclusivity. The ENERGI system is targeted at middle schools and high schools, while the LifeTrail market is parks, senior centers and retirement communities.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137646/A-Modular-Platform-System-to-Make-Warehouses-Livable",
    "description": "This reminds me of ad hoc NYC loft spaces in the '90s, where we built interior structures and partitions to make industrial spaces livable. Spain-based architecture firm Atienza Maure was tasked with renovating an old warehouse in Sant Adrià de Besòs, a municipality outside of Barcelona. The idea was to turn it into a live/work space. The project began with a 1:1 prototype—a structural module assembled on-site to test the stability and behavior of the system. Built with slotted galvanized steel profiles and post-tensed tramex panels, with threaded rods, the mock-up allowed us to refine connections and test the structural stability of the proposal. The structure was conceived as a reusable system made from cheap industrialized, lightweight components. The system is intended for easy on-site assembly and disassembly, allowing these elements to be fully dismantled and reused somewhere else. Functioning as buffer zones between the domestic and office areas, the resting platforms are elevated structures that mediate the transition between both worlds. Each platform is accessible from two different staircases, allowing movement from either side of the program. This dual access supports programmatic adaptability: a guest room can become a workspace, a reading nook can host informal meetings—spaces shift functionally without needing to be redefined. To realize the project, Atienza Maure collaborated with realty company Giagchico and artist Abel Iglesias.",
