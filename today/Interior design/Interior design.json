    "description": "We all know that military technology eventually trickles down to the consumer sector. GPS, microwaves, the internet, digital photography, and even duct tape all began with defense applications.One of these that's often overlooked is cargo pants. A British invention from 1938, they met World War II's need for British troops to carry maps, extra ammunition and medical supplies. American paratroopers adopted them shortly thereafter; because these soldiers jumped out of planes wearing anywhere from 70 to 160 pounds of kit, being able to distribute some of the load into leg pockets was a welcome innovation. Throughout the 1950s, '60s and '70s, cargo pants were something civilians could only find in an Army-Navy store. But in the 1980s they entered mainstream fashion, propelled by hikers, outdoorspeople and fashionistas seeking novelty. Here in 2025, we're now seeing the most extreme version of cargo pants yet. An Italian company called Minimal Organised Wear (MOW) acknowledges that \"we've come to rely on expensive electronic devices that accompany us everywhere, yet we often lack the protection and organisation they demand,\" they write. The company's mission is to \"embrace the challenges of water, weather, and unpredictability to design extreme waterproof solutions tailored to modern nomadism.\" MOW's solution is these Caligo All-Terrain Travel Adventure Pants. They feature no less than 18 freaking pockets, which can carry objects as large as camera lenses and 10-inch tablets. There's even an RFID-blocking pocket for carrying sensitive gear.The pants are lightweight and breathable, being made from ripstop nylon, and feature weatherproof YKK zippers. MOW says the pants are durable and can stand up to harsh weather conditions, and that they've both used recycled material to create the pants and that they are themselves fully recyclable. Here are some examples of the extreme stuff they can carry:Demand for these is startlingly high. They've been successfully Kickstarted with over $160,000 in pledges at press time, with 2 days left to pledge. Buy-in starts at €95 (USD $104) and they expect to ship in September.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136137/Seventh-Times-the-Charm-The-Ring-Mouse-Offers-Finger-Borne-Gesture-Control",
    "description": "Wearable tech is now common, arguably thanks to the Apple Watch. That product struggled upon its 2015 launch, but the eventual additions of features people wanted—health and fitness monitoring, ecosystem integration—pushed it into the mainstream within a few years.Competitiors have since popped up, and the wrist is now as viable a product battleground as the pocket or desktop. But one wearable tech location that no one's cracked yet is the finger. Many have tried. By our count at least six companies have attempted to launch a smart ring that would allow gesture control, dating as far back as 2009. The Loop Pointer, the Nod Ring, the Padrone Ring, the Tap Strap, the AirPoint Ring; have you heard of any of them? And the Mycestro ring from 2013 failed at spectacular cost, garnering $354,000 in pledges before struggling to deliver and eventually evaporating.But the tech world is filled with optimists, so here we go again. This time a startup called Ring Mouse is holding a Kickstarter for their eponymous product. \"This one happens to control your entire digital universe,\" the company promises. Offered in stainless steel or titanium alloy, the Ring Mouse is offered in sizes 4 thru 15. It features a swipeable touchpad for scrolling, and two buttons for tapping, zooming, advancing, etc.The idea is that you can use it for interacting with apps or media while you're doing other things, like washing, cooking, exercising or strolling around a presentation stage.Here are some projected use cases:The included charging case provides 10 hours of battery life. The Ring Mouse has been succesfully Kickstarted, with 23 days left to pledge at press time. Buy-in starts at $90, and they expect to ship in June.",

    "description": "A decorative, DIY way to hide TV electronics and components in style. While I was designing our HUGE entertainment center project in our basement, I wanted to make sure we could hide the cable box and stereo system receiver out of the way. I didn't want to look at them every day, but we needed to be able to access them easily of course.  Thankfully there's an easy way to do that if you are stashing these electronics inside a cabinet or console. I've shared how to add metal sheeting to cabinet doors before, (you can see the fireplace makeover at our old house there) but this time it was even simpler. I figured I'd share how I did it.  Why add metal sheeting you ask? Well when you hide electronic components hidden away, it's best to give them some air flow. Otherwise they run hot and that will shorten the life of the components. Also, your remotes won't work through a wood cabinet door, but will through metal sheeting.**You can also use an RF remote control system that allows you to keep your TV electronics in another room -- I'll add a link to that at the end of the post. We didn't want to use that because we use the voice controls often.  Here's a reminder of how this project ended up:  This is one of my favorite projects I've ever tackled!     I cut the back out of two of the bottom bench cabinets in preparation for the electronics to be added later. We knew we'd have a receiver down there at the very least, and I wanted to allow for more air flow and access from the backs of the cabinets.  A few weeks ago we had the first part of our sound system installed, and every time we turned on the TV we had to open the cabinet to get the remote to work. Then a cat or two would crawl back there...so I knew it was time to get those door fronts replaced.  I removed the cabinet doors from the hinges and used a large drill bit to make holes in the four corners of the front panel. This gives you a spot to insert your jigsaw blade:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. This is where I did things a little differently than last time -- I sawed right up to the edge of the center panel against the cabinet frame. This takes a little bit more of a steady hand but it doesn't have to be perfect! I had plenty of spots that weren't perfectly flush: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "EASY and inexpensive ways to clean gunk out of a drain There are two simple and very effective ways to clean to clear gunk and hair out of your drains without using harsh chemicals. And with one method you'll have everything you need in your kitchen.  One of these drain clearing methods works better in the kitchen on built up foods and fats, and the other works well in bathroom sinks and showers where the clog culprit is most likely from hair down the drain. We used to grab the Drano (and an even more caustic product once -- never again) every time the water started to slow in our sinks. No more! These methods work every time and it only takes a few minutes to use each drain cleaning hack.  Why you should clean your sink drains Well I think most of us understand why. At least we know when sinks start to drain slow they need to be cleared out. But I'm guilty (and I think a lot of us are) of not doing it enough.  In a kitchen, there are fats, oils and other foods that gunk up pipes over time. (Did you know even pasta is bad for your pipes?) In the bath, it's the dreaded hair. And unless you're diligent and stay on top of it all the time, clogs happen eventually. If you're not treating your drains right, eventually you'll need to clear out the pipes.  And your sink will probably be stinky. Ever had a foul smell in the kitchen you can't place? This is probably it. Cleaning out the food goo and gunk This one is typically used in kitchens where you have the thick build up of fats and gooey food. I used to use the old school method of hot water, then baking soda and finally vinegar to clear a kitchen drain.  But years ago I heard of a more effective and even easier way to get it done...and I've never gone back! I try to do this every six months or so, but as we've already discussed...drains aren't usually something I think of cleaning regularly. You'll only need a couple \"ingredients\" to flush the built up food and fats in your kitchen drain.  First up, boil a saucepan full of water. If your drain is already backed up or running slow, you may need to do this numerous times or boil a lot more water to start: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
