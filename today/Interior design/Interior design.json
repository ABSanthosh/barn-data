But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate.
