    "description": "As usual, we saw all manner of tools this year, and they continued to split into ever-finer categories: Utilitarian, artisanal, DIY, hi-tech, designey. Here are 25 that stood out to us.Eye-catching handmade outdoor tools by Neru Design Works.Festool's new ExoActive exoskeleton. Specialty tools: A straw splitter. A smart design for dispensing dangerous chemicals: The Justrite Plunger Can. Woodworker Takurou Seino's clever jig for producing the naguri pattern in wood. Ergonomic Partners' zero-gravity tool arm. The BullseyeBore is a laser gizmo that helps you drill straight. Collet fans are a clever, low-tech solution for clearing chips while CNC milling. This crazy on-body camera rig provides pivoting POVs.A space-efficient tool storage system for firefighters: Slide-out and swing-out tool boards. A look at the design of quick-release tool mounts for firefighters. A portable alternative to the bench vise: A DIY panel wedge. An incredible sidewalk craftsman demonstrates using a bow lathe. Workshop jigs with beautiful forms. Hatchet as objet d'esign.A different design approach to stair-climbing handtrucks. A combination carabiner/rope tightener. This Jetlaser strips finishes in just seconds. Clever design: A face shield that integrates with a baseball cap. Hozo Design's laser level with better UX. A designey, no-mess fire extinguisher from Sweden Arrowmax's designey hand tools. The Mambapod, a mini tripod with an F-style clamp in one leg. And finally, a guy clearing ice off of a roof with a leafblower.",

    "description": "In addition to plain ol' beautiful furniture designs, this year we saw a lot of unusual pieces that demonstrated really outside-of-the-box thinking. Here are 21 of our faves.The Brico series of chairs, by furniture designer Martin Kechayas, are made of offcuts from the production of other chairs. We think of bamboo as an extraordinarily hard material, but industrial designer Brian Chang figured out a brilliant way to use bamboo to create comfortable, springy seating. Industrial designer Eva Dugintseva designed Som, an easy-to-assemble 3D printed chair. Jef and Jess Behnke, a/k/a Two Moose Design, have a creative take on tambour cabinets.These cantilevered Tripod Tables are by Fernweh Woodworking. Willy Guhl, one of Switzerland's first industrial designers, created these radical fiber cement Loop Chairs in the 1950s. Simone Giertz's swivel-arm chair valet is simply brilliant.Korean artist/designer Oneseo Choi makes furniture from aluminum extrusions. These SAI 39 benches, by industrial designer Robin Bourgeois, are made from plywood industrial waste. Mitten State Woodworks works in an unusual furniture design niche: Behind-the-sofa consoles. Chinese company Cluvens makes these over-the-top, powered \"computer cockpits.\"Carpentopod, designed and built by Netherlands-based game developer Giliam de Carpentier, is a coffee table that walks. The hooks on this simple Charlotte Perriand wall rack are pure form follows function. Italian design brand Mavimatt produces this UFO (\"Unidentified Furniture Object\") rocking chair. This South African builder has made a series of clever, transforming space-saving workshop furniture designs.This one is here in the \"strange\" category because airplane seats usually suck. In contrast, there are a lot of nice design touches in Cathay-Pacific's new Premium Economy seats. There's also lots of nice, functional design details in Grovemade's handsome standing desk. And some unusual design details in this Hans J. Wegner sewing table. This FurnSpin system, by Hettich, features a surprising cabinet mechanism.Speaking of surprising mechanisms, furniture designer Jory Brigham shares this clever furniture hack: How to make invisible cabinet hinges by using ball bearings. Lastly, not a furniture piece, but a pleasing trend for cat owners: Repairing cat-damaged furniture with embroidery.",

    "description": "2024 Thrifty Decor Chick Christmas home decor tour!Is it me or did Christmas arrive a month earlier than usual? 😂 Anyone else feel like this season has FLOWN by? It must be because Thanksgiving was later this year? Whatever the reason, I'm way behind this year. I wanted to have this tour up weeks ago...but here we are! I hope you enjoy this Christmas home tour and it inspires you! I plan to put a video tour together, I'll update this when I get that up. The only space I didn't include this year is our basement family room and bar, but you can check out the basement tour from last year. I don't change up the holiday decor down there too much so it looks almost exactly this same this year. ;) BedroomLet's start in our bedroom! This room got a big makeover early this year when I installed some vertical tongue and groove molding to brighten up the space. I'm so pleased with how it came together. I like to add a few Christmas touches in our room every year, like our flocked, snowy tree: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This year I did all silver and white ornaments on that tree, but didn't hang them everywhere. I kind of cascaded them around the tree, in a band of ornaments. It's just a different look and I really like how it turned out! I draped some of my favorite Norfolk greenery on our standing mirror: It needed a little something, so I made my own bell garland with some green floral wire and these tiny brass bells:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

These photo ornament ideas are so easy to DIY and add a personal touch to your Christmas tree! I'm sharing a few I've done over the years, including my most recent (and favorite!) version.  I love celebrating the events and special moments of each year by adding photos to our holiday decor, and the tree is the perfect place to display them.  EASY PHOTO TREE Years ago I did the simplest version of this by printing out photos from my phone and just tucking them into the tree:  I mean...you can't get easier than this!  For a nostalgic touch, I edited them with a sepia tone before printing.  This tree decorated with photos was so sweet and I loved looking through the pictures throughout the season. It was surprisingly pretty on the tree too!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Is that just me? :)  Well this is a great way to add a little something sentimental that doesn't overwhelm the tree or your decor.  ACRYLIC DIY ORNAMENTS A couple years ago I added some DIY photo ornaments to our mud room chalkboard. This was a fun one and was super inexpensive and easy to do! I took some round acrylic ornaments from the craft store and used Mod Podge to glue the photos to the back: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
