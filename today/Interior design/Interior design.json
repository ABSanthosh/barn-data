    "description": "Here's a wonderful piece of physical design from industrial design studio DesignWright. The London-based firm created this Flip Alarm Clock, which has no pesky \"off\" button to fumble for. Instead you simply flip it over. (The display flips too, obviously.) The large letters leave no ambiguity as to whether you remembered to set the alarm or not. The Flip is in production by Paris-based design brand Lexon. They offer the Flip in three flavors: Mini, Classic (both rubberized) and Premium (with an aluminum finish).",

    "description": "The build quality on this product looks like a sophomore ID student project, but that hasn't stopped it from being funded on Kickstarter. This Versa Air Sprayer from China is an airbrush that requires no external compressor—and never needs to be cleaned (at an environmental cost). The rechargeable-battery-powered tool can generate up to 30 PSI. It features a somewhat gimmicky laser that shows you where the paint will land. Color changes are achieved by swapping paint bottles.As mentioned earlier, you don't need to clean the nozzles, because \"Instead of washing, we have introduced disposable nozzles in all sizes, so you can just put on a new one next time,\" which may not sit well with some. \"It turns out a new nozzle costs less than the thinner required to wash it,\" the company writes. \"Biodegradable plastic is used to minimize environmental burden.\" Sounds like a suspiciously breezy solution.Four nozzle sizes are offered.While you can buy your own paint, the obvious downside to this tool is that the bottles and nozzles are proprietary, and can only be purchased for the company. So you'd be spending $80 (Kickstarter price) or $140 (retail price) on the tool, then keeping your fingers crossed that the company stays in business long enough to resupply you. As usual, these concerns have not stopped eager backers from reaching the funding target. At press time there were 10 days left to pledge.",

If you'd like to see everything we did in the old backyard, be sure to check out these posts!  Our backyard was just so pretty and magical, and we definitely missed it after moving. But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry! It won out here too, does that surprise you? :)  A couple of years ago I moved seat configuration around a bit to give us a little more walking room along the side. Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
