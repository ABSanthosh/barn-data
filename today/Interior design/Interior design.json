    "description": "If you're an industrial designer working on aluminum or steel products manufactured in the U.S., we know the recent Section 232 tariffs on those metals have been a nightmare for you. And while we don't have great news, we do have some decent news. Fictiv, the California-based global manufacturing platform, has reached out with the following development (boldface ours):\"Recent updates to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) website and FAQ's state that the prototype provisions of aluminum and steel are not subject to tariffs or duties from all countries of origin.\"Fictiv has confirmed this with our customs and broker partners and have successfully imported aluminum and steel prototype parts duty free once again.\"\"As always, Fictiv will continue to monitor this situation closely and communicate any developments as they arise. If you have additional questions about these updated prototype provisions for aluminum and steel, please contact your dedicated Fictiv account executive or hello@fictiv.com.\"",

    "description": "Our favorite handy finds for around the house, all $10 or under!It's that time of year! This time the Amazon Prime sale goes for four days -- running from the 8th through the 11th of this week. I know there are a bunch of great deals on more expensive finds, but I prefer to share affordable items we actually use and love. Last year I shared my top favorites under $30, and the year before some of my best finds under $25. This year I went even lower and put a list together of handy home items, all for $10 and under! I wasn't meaning to gather things that I find particularly helpful, but it turned out that way. :) We use every item on this list of useful products, and all are super affordable, even without prime day discounts.This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I know, I know...Christmas is a long way off! But I use these discounts to shop early and I'm always so thankful I did! It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I got this one for myself last Christmas -- this puzzle \"scoop\" is also a magnifier and has a handy click on light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
