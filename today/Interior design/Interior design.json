    "description": "Decorating ideas for an inspired Santa-themed entryway. I pulled together a fun Christmas Santa display for our foyer this year and absolutely love how it turned out!  In general, tabletop and bookcase decorating are the hardest for me to get right. I find it much easier to decorated smaller spots, especially for the holidays.  Usually I'm overwhelmed by all of the display space our long Everett entryway table has. Last year I just lined up our cute lighted village: And it was very pretty! But I wanted to do something a little more Christmasy this time.  This year I decided to place the DIY wood \"believe\" sign I made a few years ago on the bottom shelf.  Each letter is individual and I made them to stand up, so I spread them out along the bottom and then added some small decor accents like greenery and pinecones: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "link": "https://www.thriftydecorchick.com/2020/12/fluffy-yarn-Christmas.html",
    "description": "How to make the cutest and (fluffiest!) yarn wrapped Christmas tree decor.  This is one of my easiest holiday DIYs yet! These Styrofoam yarn trees can be changed up with any material you'd like to use.  I wanted some new holiday decor for our basement but didn't want to spend a ton of money -- I came up with this idea and they turned out better than I imagined. At first I was going to use basic yarn on Styrofoam cones, but wanted a fluffier look.  Enter this finger knit yarn I've had forever -- for the blanket I still haven't made yet, ha!:  It is SO so soft and fluffy and I had an idea -- I wondered how it would work wound around the cones instead of regular yarn. Well, I'll tell you...it worked ADORABLE. 😁 This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   These DIY yarn Christmas trees are quick to make with just a few easy steps. I started with basic craft foam forms:  I got my soft looped yarn and foam cones from Michael's.  And used my hot glue gun to attach the yard at the bottom of the cone first:  I started the first line of yarn about an inch from the bottom because this yarn drapes so much.  I went up about 3/4 inch to an inch each pass around the cone:  Just do a bead of hot glue and then lightly press the top portion of the yarn along the glue.  I just kept wrapping...this was a great mindless craft to do while watching TV. They go together fast:  When I got to the top of the very top of the cone, I cut just enough excess yarn and then wrapped it up on the very tip with hot glue. This finger knit looped stuff is very forgiving! I did three different sizes -- one was about six inches, one was 11 inches and the final was about 17 inches but I cut those two down a bit: I used one skein of yarn for all the trees and had a bit leftover. It's like a snowy, fluffy forest! :) I think they are the cutest. You don't even have to do anything to cover the white foam -- it disappears behind the yarn:  I giggled every time I finished one. They are adorable and SO easy and inexpensive! The foam products are often on sale, or you can use a coupon at one of the craft stores. I added some of the fairy lights I showed you here for a bit of twinkle:  You can also have them glow from \"inside\" by running those tiny lights under the yarn around the tree:  You can dress this Christmas tree craft up in so many ways! Add a pop of color by sticking in red beads here and there to look like berries.Use embellishments like these adorable tiny plaid bows, mini pine cones or holly berry leaves throughout the trees. (I may have to add those bows!)This would be a REALLY cute idea for a kid's room in a variety of bright colorful yarns. Stick a small dowel rod into the top with a star or angel glued on for a finishing touch. Pom poms glued all around or attached with pins would be adorable as well! I wanted something simple but fun on this table in our basement and these were perfect!I went super cozy and a bit rustic with the decor down there, so they fit right in:  See more about our Disney prints here! I love our \"snowy\" fluffy trees! I think they may have to go on the mantel next year instead. :)I used the Bernat brand finger knit yarn in cream (here are all the colors they offer!) but the cream seems hard to find right now.  You can pin this craft for later using this image:  Now I'm off to make a scarf with the remaining yarn I have! ;) If you have extra foam cones laying around when you're done, try my Santa hat cone craft: Check out a bunch of my favorite, easy Christmas crafts here!  See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.  This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.

    "description": "When the owners bought this 1875-built property, it had been used as an architect’s office for a few decades. They engaged architectural practice BUNSTON with a relatively simple brief, asking for a new kitchen, bathroom and more storage. But the real challenge was turning a former workspace into a familial and functional home. The resulting Kesterson House has been reconfigured around a central courtyard garden, where original bricks and bluestone have been given a new life as part of the building’s inviting new iteration.",

    "description": "It's pretty ironic that AR glasses, which promise to deliver you to augmented or virtual worlds, themselves require a brick-and-mortar experience in order to sell them. Because you'd have to try them on, to see for yourself how compelling or effective the visual effects really are. Without that experience, you're just looking at press images and guessing at how accurate they are. This month Chinese manufacturer Xreal released their new One and One Pro AR glasses. These feature Sony Micro-OLED screens and a built-in Bose sound system. And in contrast to Apple's Vision Pro, the Xreal offerings resemble an ordinary pair of Ray-Bans, though they do sit off of your face a bit. (They can also accommodate prescription lenses.) They're also a heckuva lot cheaper than Apple's offering, at $499 for the One and $599 for the One Pro, versus the Vision Pro's $3,500 asking price. Here is the company's depiction of what using them is like:As for the difference in the two models, the One Pro has slightly better stats than the One: A wider field of view, better image quality and clarity and enhanced brightness.The One is expected to ship later this month, with the One Pro coming out early next year.",

    "description": "I'm not crazy about this structure, but the other design blogs love it. Bjarke Ingels Group has designed this Softshell structure for Nokken, a company that manufactures habitats for the hospitality industry. The Softshell has a timber structure and a tent-like canvas skin. Inside is a bed and a woodburning stove, and above is a netted surface. What I dislike about it is that these are meant to be sited out in nature, yet make no effort to work with it nor blend into the landscape. Whereas traditional soft-sided structures like yurts and tipis have circular footprints, the better to handle wind, the form of the Softshell is an aggressively modernist statement meant to symbolize human dominance of the environment. While that concept is not foreign—houses obviously do that—I guess I'm not used to seeing it in an environment that would ostensibly draw the nature lover. Then again, this targets the glamping market, which is not about enjoying nature. It is about being as comfortable as possible, and enjoying \"luxury,\" by subverting nature to your will. I would also like to hear what these things sound like when the wind picks up.",
