    "description": "This captivating, hobnail-textured bottle contains La Petite Victoire, a non-alcoholic sparkling beverage. It's by global package design firm Stranger \u0026 Stranger. I wasn't able to find any details about this specific project, though I did learn that Stranger \u0026 Stranger is a sort of hit-machine firm for the alcoholic beverages industry. In an interview with industry periodical SevenFiftyDaily, writer Alia Akkam reveals that the firm's packaging rebrands \"have tripled sales for some wine and spirits labels.\"Stranger \u0026 Stranger founder Kevin Shaw reveals a little of the company's secret sauce, and notes a particularly effective package design turnaround:Each label Stranger \u0026 Stranger makes is a distillation of a brand's distinct narrative. \"You dig,\" Shaw says. \"You keep asking questions and probing until you find something ownable, hopefully unique, something enticing and interesting.\" He points to the reboot of Aberfeldy Scotch as an example. Originally, the label featured a squirrel, an image that confounded Shaw. On learning that the springwater Aberfeldy uses at the distillery contains gold dust, Shaw immediately knew this would become the focus for the new design—a gilt-hued label. \"A golden dram,\" he says. \"That's something unusual, something that's rooted in truth, something you can build a brand on. Consumers love stories like that. A year's worth of stock sold out in 12 weeks.\"If you're interested in design business, the full interview is worth a read, and covers the unlikely way that Shaw started the firm in 1994. To date they've done over 5,000 projects.",

    "description": "This funky rotomolded Limbo Chair is by Icelandic industrial designer Hlynur Atlason. It's in production by furniture brand Heller, whose CEO, John Edelman, gave Atlason a simple brief: \"Design us a comfortable modern lounge chair.\"The Icelandic designer responded with a statement-making chair that's not only supremely comfortable but also suitable for indoor-outdoor use, and sustainably made. With a swooping, sculptural form that holds the body in a comfortable position, Limbo is a playful chair, \"but we were very serious about how it's made,\" says Hlynur. \"It took a lot of thinking, research, and testing to make it look this effortless.\" To ensure a circular lifecycle, Limbo is fully recyclable and made with a high percentage of recycled post-consumer plastic (the exact percentage varies by color, with black having the highest percentage). Limbo is available in a choice of warm, muted colors that harmonize with the natural environment. These run $940 for a pair.",

I pulled together a fun Christmas Santa display for our foyer this year and absolutely love how it turned out!  In general, tabletop and bookcase decorating are the hardest for me to get right. I find it much easier to decorated smaller spots, especially for the holidays.  Usually I'm overwhelmed by all of the display space our long Everett entryway table has. Last year I just lined up our cute lighted village: And it was very pretty! But I wanted to do something a little more Christmasy this time.  This year I decided to place the DIY wood \"believe\" sign I made a few years ago on the bottom shelf.  Each letter is individual and I made them to stand up, so I spread them out along the bottom and then added some small decor accents like greenery and pinecones: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to make the cutest and (fluffiest!) yarn wrapped Christmas tree decor.  This is one of my easiest holiday DIYs yet! These Styrofoam yarn trees can be changed up with any material you'd like to use.  I wanted some new holiday decor for our basement but didn't want to spend a ton of money -- I came up with this idea and they turned out better than I imagined. At first I was going to use basic yarn on Styrofoam cones, but wanted a fluffier look.  Enter this finger knit yarn I've had forever -- for the blanket I still haven't made yet, ha!:  It is SO so soft and fluffy and I had an idea -- I wondered how it would work wound around the cones instead of regular yarn. Well, I'll tell you...it worked ADORABLE. 😁 This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   These DIY yarn Christmas trees are quick to make with just a few easy steps. I started with basic craft foam forms:  I got my soft looped yarn and foam cones from Michael's.  And used my hot glue gun to attach the yard at the bottom of the cone first:  I started the first line of yarn about an inch from the bottom because this yarn drapes so much.  I went up about 3/4 inch to an inch each pass around the cone:  Just do a bead of hot glue and then lightly press the top portion of the yarn along the glue.  I just kept wrapping...this was a great mindless craft to do while watching TV. They go together fast:  When I got to the top of the very top of the cone, I cut just enough excess yarn and then wrapped it up on the very tip with hot glue. This finger knit looped stuff is very forgiving! I did three different sizes -- one was about six inches, one was 11 inches and the final was about 17 inches but I cut those two down a bit: I used one skein of yarn for all the trees and had a bit leftover. It's like a snowy, fluffy forest! :) I think they are the cutest. You don't even have to do anything to cover the white foam -- it disappears behind the yarn:  I giggled every time I finished one. They are adorable and SO easy and inexpensive! The foam products are often on sale, or you can use a coupon at one of the craft stores. I added some of the fairy lights I showed you here for a bit of twinkle:  You can also have them glow from \"inside\" by running those tiny lights under the yarn around the tree:  You can dress this Christmas tree craft up in so many ways! Add a pop of color by sticking in red beads here and there to look like berries.Use embellishments like these adorable tiny plaid bows, mini pine cones or holly berry leaves throughout the trees. (I may have to add those bows!)This would be a REALLY cute idea for a kid's room in a variety of bright colorful yarns. Stick a small dowel rod into the top with a star or angel glued on for a finishing touch. Pom poms glued all around or attached with pins would be adorable as well! I wanted something simple but fun on this table in our basement and these were perfect!I went super cozy and a bit rustic with the decor down there, so they fit right in:  See more about our Disney prints here! I love our \"snowy\" fluffy trees! I think they may have to go on the mantel next year instead. :)I used the Bernat brand finger knit yarn in cream (here are all the colors they offer!) but the cream seems hard to find right now.  You can pin this craft for later using this image:  Now I'm off to make a scarf with the remaining yarn I have! ;) If you have extra foam cones laying around when you're done, try my Santa hat cone craft: Check out a bunch of my favorite, easy Christmas crafts here!  See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.  This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.
