    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137743/Bentleys-Experimental-Assymetrical-EXP-15-Concept-Car",
    "description": "Aside from the eye candy factor, there's not much to glean from concept cars by high-end luxury manufacturers. However, Bentley's new EXP 15 concept stands out. Not because it's attractive—in fact, I think it's hideous—but because the designers have addressed something few auto design teams have: The fact that climbing in and out of a car is actually very ergonomically awkward.First off, the car's overall looks. It looks unobjectionable from the top, which is an angle you'd never see it from in real life. Looking at the car from a real-world angle, however, reveals a regrettable form. It's as if the designers tried to beautify a brick. They were undoubtedly not helped by their mandate. The concept was inspired by the 1930 Bentley Blue Train which, like most luxury cars of that era, had an extremely high beltline and a train-like form. But the beltline for the EXP 15 can't maintain the same height, and drops it into no man's land, where it's too low to evoke the Blue Train and too high to yield pleasing proportions between top and bottom. Matters get worse when the car is viewed head-on. Despite being an EV, the EXP 15 pointlessly retains an elaborate grille. This is nonsensical and speaks of a what-do-we-do-about-the-front-end conversation that was never resolved. The back end isn't much better, resembling a smiling clown, hardly the image Bentley wants to put forth.Where it does get innovative is with the interior. Most cars of this caliber feature two doors and four seats, or four doors and four seats. Bentley's designers have opted for three doors and three seats instead. The driver's side features the driver's seat and a single rear passenger seat behind it. The passenger side, in contrast, has a single seat that can slide back and forth on a track. Special attention has been given to the ingress/egress of this seat—and this seat only. It can not only slide back and rotate 45 degrees, but a section of the roof over it also opens, easing entry and exit. (I have no idea why the marketing imagery instead draws attention to a pampered CG dog.)Overall it's a very strange concept, and I can't think of any other designers who've been brave enough to go assymetrical with the interior layout. I'd like to see a little more experimentation in this area in the future (though hopefully wrapped within a more pleasing form).This is a concept car only; there are no production plans.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137742/The-US-Militarys-Robot-Coyotes",
    "description": "Here's an unexpected solution to a military problem.The U.S. military is keen to keep birds away from their airfields, as errant birds can unwittingly down a multimillion-dollar airplane, not to mention endanger the lives of its crew, by flying into an air intake. It fell to the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) to come up with a solution.Take One was robot dogs, using a Boston Dynamics model. The idea was that the dog 'bot could tirelessly patrol runways, scaring birds off. It didn't work. \"What we found out quickly was, because [the robot dog] had such a slow approach speed,\" explains Dr. Jacob Jung, an ERDC research wildlife biologist, \"that it did more of just pushing animals out of the way once it finally got close enough to them, than it did really scaring them off.\"They then struck upon the idea of using a chassis from Traxxas X-Maxx, a manufacturer of off-road RC cars. These can zip around at up to 20 mph. But birds don't necessarily recognize a miniature monster truck as a predator, so the researchers purchased a plastic coyote figurine from a forestry supplier. As it turns out, these are two great tastes that taste great together. The resultant \"Coyote Rovers\" did the trick.These are categorized as UGVs, for Unmanned Ground Vehicles. The ERDC says the demo system cost was \"between $2,500 and $3,000,\" though it's not clear how many Coyote Rovers that yielded. In any case, they've given demonstrations at airfields in Tennessee and Florida, and say the cost is worth it. The conventional way to reduce bird presence at airfields is to keep the surrounding grass short, so that birds don't have a place to hide. \"Even at a small number of airfields, if you can give them one more week between mowing, that ends up being a huge [cost savings],\" says Shea Hammond, an ERDC research biologist. I imagine the next step will be placing the coyote figurines on top of lawn-mowing robots.",

    "description": "How to build a wood burning stone fire pit on top of a concrete patio. There are a few safety issues to consider when building a DIY fire pit on a concrete surface. I'm sharing the how-to here!Years ago we had a large patio poured in our back yard. The best part was a 14 foot circular fire pit area we designed off to one side. I shared how this part of the patio looked the day of installation:  One big project I had to hold off on was the DIY fire pit. The concrete contractors advised we wait a bit because the stone for the pit is so heavy. The patio had to cure for a couple of weeks.  Before I started, we got a quote for a small stone retaining wall around the circular fire pit area as well as a fire pit with stone that matched our house. The quote came back at almost DOUBLE what the entire PATIO cost. Lordt.  Soooo we decided to do it ourselves with a kit and it was crazy easy. It doesn't look custom, but it does the job...burns wood. ;) Here's the kit we got from Menards:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Our favorite handy finds for around the house, all $10 or under!It's that time of year! This time the Amazon Prime sale goes for four days -- running from the 8th through the 11th of this week. I know there are a bunch of great deals on more expensive finds, but I prefer to share affordable items we actually use and love. Last year I shared my top favorites under $30, and the year before some of my best finds under $25. This year I went even lower and put a list together of handy home items, all for $10 and under! I wasn't meaning to gather things that I find particularly helpful, but it turned out that way. :) We use every item on this list of useful products, and all are super affordable, even without prime day discounts.This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I know, I know...Christmas is a long way off! But I use these discounts to shop early and I'm always so thankful I did! It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I got this one for myself last Christmas -- this puzzle \"scoop\" is also a magnifier and has a handy click on light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
