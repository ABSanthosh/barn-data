    "description": "A California-based company called MarsCharge is dedicated to developing EV infrastructure. To design their flagship product, a freestanding commercial charger that can top off two EVs at once, they turned to industrial design consultancy DesignStein Studios. After extensive industry feedback, MarsCharge realized that there was a huge demand for large, standalone EV charging station chargers that actually work. The client built a highly-engineered prototype freestanding DC fast charger that can fully charge most EVs in approximately 20 minutes, which is nearly twice as fast as most standalone DC fast chargers, and arguably one of the fastest on the market today. However, they found it lacking a beautiful design and easy-to-use interface. Styling was paramount. Our client did not want a clunky, boxy-looking charger like most of what exists on the market today. After collaboration with them, we selected three design themes that would embody the charger's design: Monolithic, Annular and Premium. Monolithic designs aren't simply large, their presence stops you in your tracks. Annularity promotes a natural, swooping flow, eliminating the slightest hint of \"boxiness\" in our design. Premium structures stand alone. You know them when you see them. Together, these Mood Board elements became the inspiration for our sketches.MONOLITH, ANNULAR, PREMIUM With our mood board completed, we explored multiple design directions (below). The first drawings below, with the pencil sketches behind them, are the initial configurations: Our client loved them, and through the collaborative process we encourage with all our clients, they evolved into these detailed concepts: The video below has the full story on how we employed our process with MarsCharge, and helped them use this design to increase their profitability.You can see more of DesignStein Studio's work here.",

    "description": "How to keep your houseplants from dying. One of my most commonly asked questions is about our plants! It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

    "description": "Top DIY projects and makeovers of 2024! I've gathered my biggest DIY makeovers completed in 2024 and what I hope to accomplish this year! This is always a fun post to write, as it makes me feel super accomplished after a VERY lazy Christmas break. :) I tackled a bunch of big projects last year and am super proud of what I created. 1. Linen closet redo Since it's the season of decluttering and organizing, let's start with the closet that was a huge pain in my butt for years: I finally got down to business and removed the shallow wire shelving and replaced them with deeper wood shelves: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    SO much better! I added a pretty touch to the back wall with some leftover wallpaper. It's a sweet hint of color when you open the door. 2.

By embedding the home to its hillside site, and pairing it with extensive green roofs by Ben Scott Garden Design, much of the structure is concealed from the street to prioritise views of Yarra Flats Park opposite. The house itself was designed to look like a ‘modern day farmhouse’ that engages with the outdoors at every opportunity. The result is masterful, epitomising Archier’s commitment to designing spaces that enrich the lives of inhabitants, while respecting the natural environment.",

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
