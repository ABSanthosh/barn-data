Developed before the pandemic, the original version was pretty utilitarian-looking:When it was time for a design upgrade, Club Car contacted industrial design firm Cardboard Helicopter for help.\"At Cardboard Helicopter, our team was delighted to collaborate with Tempo Walk to create an innovative and cutting-edge autonomous golf caddie. Our goal was to provide golfers with a unique and immersive experience on the golf course. From the initial stages of industrial design sketch concepts to the final manufacturing production of 3D CAD and engineering, we were deeply involved in the development process.\" \"We pushed the boundaries of design to ensure the caddie was not only sleek and stylish, but also practical, marketable, manufacturable, and most importantly, adored by golfers.\" Client and company CEO Timothy Doane gave Cardboard Helicopter a rave review:\"The folks from CH were great to work with. They combine a unique blend of creativity, artistic ability, and innovation. Their work helped us create an industry shocking design for our new Tempo Walk product which increased sales from the start.

    "description": "Upgrade your plain Christmas wreaths with these easy and inexpensive DIYs! Wreaths are one my favorite ways to decorate for the holiday season. There are so many easy ways to add festive touches to inexpensive, plain wreaths.  I put wreaths of every size all over our house when I decorate for Christmas. I realized this year that it takes me forever to put all of our holiday decor out because I can't leave well enough alone...I LOVE to tweak things and add my own touch. I've done that with wreaths a lot over the years, and even more so this year. I've gathered a bunch of DIYs for basic wreaths to give you some inspiration for this season! This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     I think evergreen wreaths are quite beautiful on their own, especially with some twinkling lights. I wanted this simpler look for the bookcases in my office that's been undergoing a makeover.  I picked up a couple of these Norway spruce wreaths from At Home:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_IjzAjSLtroC1bI_h0IccAs-9ShtgnUtOlSvwr4joScdWnKaH92CACARASQw4Qemgn8_HrkSSuJqACSNA5zIdwo1Fg17TwmQw_bf95sHTVsFxfwMorH-jEzo_AQgThB_qD4_Y9jaU-83grsKGlV54mHUvOn4CMh8zJntdIPCUPGLhOp1VGRyxacOb1KI/s16000/Norway%20spruce%20wreath%20At%20Home.jpg\"\u003e They come in a two and three foot width, mine are the smaller versions.  I grabbed some of my pinecone stems that I use every year (from Hobby Lobby) and secured them together with some green floral wire: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvq6HwgZEOG5D_sslqiBPv0MY4QUXk_rDMyI1u6aMkVGzB11SPSxJVsynDE0QTOB96tVOmYLv9tdkN0yk6pr9XsDNfWKZWFjjTAi-iKfVb99mkYzfSuExdg6SR6AJ-E5S_cHwIJ2HIi3zCU0pGD2skEg48KKB1mtSO99Z5_yO7TVcOhzTbdZ3EW05uPN4/s16000/green%20floral%20wire%20for%20wreaths.jpg\"\u003e Then I used that same wire to attach the pinecones to the bottom of the metal base on the wreath. I added a bow with my camel colored velvet ribbon that I hung from the top:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6ewIYP0rtoQBv5N82_WLVMWHZU-4prdbNVxJ7z0KencgqaPUE-4rmJ9_Cstz0xchS36CAMMRbmJfjOEmi5pEEwyKNSzqhjZ09NnmO_7ZMFcBqRnmPKNd8iFcAoekxFQZC-3vx4tdrhlrkapLBYvYCqhXRXsoMQvZ933kzJyFh52xjqYWPYecdnfhtgAk/s16000/DIY%20evergreen%20wreath%20with%20pinecones.jpg\"\u003e And then used three long pieces of the ribbon to hang from the bottom of the wreath as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Twenty beautiful Christmas mantel decorating ideas.I've gathered a bunch of absolutely gorgeous Christmas mantels to give you some inspiration this holiday season! If you have a fireplace, you know it's a focal point all year, but even more so during the holidays. If you decorate just that one spot it will make the room feel so festive!Even if you don't have a fireplace, a TV built in or console can be decorated similarly. If holiday decor intimidates you but you want to add some festive touches, I would suggest tackling the tree and a mantel and/or TV stand. My Christmas mantels have varied big time over the years -- from bright, traditional colors to more neutral moody vibes. I'll share a few of my favorites first, and then I have more beautiful examples from talented DIY and decor bloggers. At our last house, I finished up tiling our stacked stone basement fireplace right before the holidays. I loved how it looked with our flocked tree: The stone and long wood beam stole the show, so I didn't need to do much otherwise. Just some simple greenery along the top was perfect. The thorn in my side at that house was our corner fireplace in our family room. I thought it would be such a cool design feature, but I ended up hating it. 😂At first I added some box molding to the walls above it and tried to take advantage of all of that mantel space for my Christmas decor: We later built out that corner fireplace a bit and brought the wall forward. This changed the game! It was so much easier to work with, and looked like it fit so much better in the room. I was so excited to decorate the new fireplace for Christmas! The longer mantel was fun to decorate, and those hanging lanterns added some whimsy: I loved the traditional pops of red, but the next year was one of my all time favorites. I went super simple with inexpensive glass vessels wrapped with pretty scrapbook and wrapping paper:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.

    "description": "The Cross Street Flats in Carlton were designed in the early 1970s by Earle Shaw and Partners — a lesser-known but significant contemporary of Merchant Builders, Graeme Gunn, and other influential practices addressing Melbourne’s shortage of medium-density housing — with involvement from Australian architectural historian David Saunders. The project is still highly respected today by designers and residents, including architect and multiple housing leader at Wardle Jack Davies, and Aesop development manager Elizabeth White, who live in one of the apartments with their newborn son, Gus. They purchased their Cross Street apartment for its progressive design, described as the ‘first large-scale urban project in Australia that consciously articulated an understanding of its historic environment.’ With a $70,000 budget, Jack and Elizabeth have renovated the apartment (virtually untouched since the 1990s), while respecting the building’s architectural integrity.",
