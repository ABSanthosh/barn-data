    "description": "The staggering size of the Salone del Mobile requires a targeted approach, and the first tightening of scope necessary is determining how many days you wish to explore it in. If with time constraints you are limited to one, as we were, it is going to be, A. a very long day, and B. a compromise from your first step. Core77 has always favored the youngster's endeavors on display at the Salone's Satellite area, and time spent there means even less to make one's way through the labyrinthine halls to see what the titans of the field have on show. Here are three exhibits we enjoyed:MagisFun, eclectic, Twain chair, Konstantin Grcic, 2024 Tacito storage cabinets - years of prototyping shows in the way the doors open and shut on these.

    "description": "Norwegian aluminum producer/energy company Hydro exhibited a commissioned set of designs at Capsule that centered the company's efforts to green-up aluminum. Hydro's prior exhibit and design-industry project (RIP Cake) have featured their more eco-conscious lines of material but this time attention is also paid to the impact of transportation on total carbon cost of the end product. Looking at their investor news it does in fact seem like \"commercialization of low-carbon and recycled aluminum\" is of some importance to the company. Nice. We're inclined to mark this as ethically sourced eye-candy!Form and finishes were beautiful and clever but more exciting to designer-types visiting the show were the dies used to produce the extrusions, displayed in a row at the edge of the room.

Before the room was very dark, with dark gray paint and trim.I replaced all of the dark paint with vertical tongue and groove in a crisp white paint:This allowed me to incorporate more color into the room -- before it was difficult to find tones that worked well with the dark paint color and accents. We ended up with a much brighter but still soothing bedroom with cottagey decor touches: I've been adding a few newer additions over the past few months, and it all started with this beautiful art I found at HomeGoods:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
