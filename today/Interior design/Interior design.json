    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/133959/Architecture-Student-Develops-Structural-Modeling-Kit-Now-Sells-Them-Worldwide",
    "description": "As an architecture student, Marcio Sequeira wanted to better understand structural behavior. Seeking a more hands-on way than equations and diagrams can provide, Sequeira began building structural models using elements connected by magnetics. He started off with wooden dowels, and experimented with plastic and rubber components before settling on springs. After gaining his architecture degree in 2005, Sequeira pursued a Masters in Civil Engineering. For his thesis project in 2008, he demonstrated the scientific validation of his structural modeling system. Sequeira subsequently sought investors, seeking to mass produce his structural kits for educational use. After finding no takers, in 2014 he successfully Kickstarted his Mola Structural Kit 1. Today Sequiera's company, Mola, offers multiple kits and sells them in over 100 countries. Over 800 universities, including MIT and Switzerland's EPFL use Mola Kits to teach students; roughly 600 architecture and engineering firms have purchased them as well. Here's their latest Kit, the Mola Kit 4, which was recently (successfully) Kickstarted:You can learn more about Mola Kits here.",

    "description": "While hammering nails isn't difficult for those of us with average dexterity, it can be tricky for others. And junky though these nail-holding pliers look, they actually hew to form-follows-function admirably.The two cylinders on the butt end of the handle, along with the flat back of the jaws, allow the user to hold the tool flat against the wall while still leaving clearance for fingers. It can grasp multiple gauges of nail, and offers two different starting depths, better accommodating those with grip issues or clumsiness.I love the engraving on the hammer.I've never heard of the company that makes these, Jelanry, and their copy is hilarious:\"Usage scenario guide: Christmas tree or Christmas decorations, shower curtain or curtains installation.\" I'd love to see the Christmas tree at the copywriter's house.",

    "description": "A tour of our FUN and playful basement Halloween decor. I decorate our main living areas for fall every year (fall decor tour coming soon!), but the outside of our house and basement family room is where I have FUN with Halloween decor. I started going all in on the Halloween down in the basement a few years when one of my sisters and I started a Hocus Pocus movie night tradition with our kids. Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This witch hat set came with 12 hats and a bunch of cute plastic bat cutouts as well. (This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
