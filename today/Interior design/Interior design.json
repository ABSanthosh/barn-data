    "description": "Yesterday in Hollywood, Tesla opened the Tesla Diner, a retro-futuristic eatery that's also the world's largest Supercharging station. It features 80 Supercharger stalls, though they in themselves are not the most eye-catching feature: That credit goes to two gigantic, 66-foot LED screens towering over the parking lot, and playing a mix of sci-fi, family and classic movies alongside Tesla and SpaceX promos. The diner is modeled after both 1950s drive-in movie theaters and drive-in diners, with carhops who'll bring the food out to your car. Alternatively you can eat inside or on the roof deck; the total seating capacity is over 250 people. The burger containers have been designed to resemble Cybertrucks. The Tesla Diner is open 24-7, and the charging stations are open to all EVs.It was reportedly designed by architecture firm Stantec, but at press time, was not listed as a project on their website. Here's a walkthrough of the space:",

This time I thought it would be cool to share this space in the evening, with the soft glow of our accent and landscape lighting. Over the past few years I've worked on a few DIY projects in the backyard that I'll share. This is our favorite place to be from the months of about April to October. At least when I'm not sweating bullets!I already shared a look at our covered patio a few months ago: That shaded spot is always lovely, especially with a light breeze going through. About a year after moving into our house, we had a long patio added off the covered porch. It's a great spot for our outdoor dining table and a couple of other sitting areas: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Usually by now our container flowers are starting to get a little crispy, but I've been babying them all summer. Thankfully they're still doing beautifully this season! :)We purchased our dining table years ago, and I've given up on finding a remotely affordable outdoor table that lasts more than two years. It looks great from far away: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "One of my favorite things to do in every season is just putter around the house. In the winter, it’s an indoor rhythm—quiet and cozy. I’ll make a hot drink, light a candle, tidy up a corner or maybe move a few things around just to make the space feel a bit more inviting. It’s not about tackling a big project—it’s about being present and making the home feel better in small ways. In the summer, I’m still holding a warm mug (anyone else a hot coffee year-round person?), but the experience feels a little different. The doors are always open so a fresh coastal breeze comes through. I might step outside on a whim to clip herbs or snip some flowers, and come back in the kitchen to put them in a vase. While I'm there I might clear the counters or rearrange a shelf, but only if I'm inspired to. Most of the time I'm just puttering around the house, doing any small thing that makes me happy but also doing nothing in particular.",

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.
