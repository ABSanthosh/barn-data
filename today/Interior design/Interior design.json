    "description": "If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from our Renovation Diaries, it’s that a project’s timeline is very tricky to predict. This is especially true in the renovation of art therapist Sylvie Sliskovic’s Melbourne unit, which came together across two parts, spanning 10 years. The two-bedroom Brunswick East apartment now feels like more of a townhouse within a boutique block of 1970s flats, and the dark and dated interior has been replaced with a modern take on retro style. See how Sylvie created her family’s haven (and the tight budget she managed to stick to) below!",

It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

    "description": "In November of 2020, we published a post called “What’s It Like To Downsize” after living in our smaller home for 6 months. We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.

    "description": "LG, Samsung and Lenovo have all been working on stretchable screens for at least two years. It looks like Lenovo will be the first to market; they've announced their ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, a laptop whose screen expands from 14\" to 16.7\". While that doesn't sound like much, the company says it adds \"nearly 50%\" of additional screen space.\"With its rollable screen, the device offers an extended vertical display ideal for applications such as document review, coding, project management, and content creation. Professionals in creative fields and technical roles will appreciate the split-screen functionality that supports multiple window layout without sacrificing screen space.\"Here you can see the screen unrolling:It's a neat parlor trick for sure, but these days my assumption is that everything will break. Where do you send this thing when the motors conk out? Also, I can't be the only one picturing the motors dying when the screen is in the extended position.There's also the question of how long-lived an innovation this will be; will we be wearing screens in front of our eyeballs in ten years, or still toting laptops around?In any case, Lenovo showed off a working prototype this month at CES, and here Engadget gives it the once-over:They expect to start shipping the $3,500 laptops this June.",
