    "description": "How to make your builder grade cabinets look custom with simple trim. Adding just a bit of inexpensive trim makes a big difference on the sides of your kitchen cabinets! I've been hard at work in our kitchen finishing up a few smaller projects. I LOVE our kitchen, but I've planned all along to add some small details that add some interest and character.  You know character is the name of my game! My goal for the past couple decades of home ownership has been to add custom touches to our homes. :)  I started with adding \"legs\" to the sides of our island. That project made the island feel so much more substantial, and we can still access the cabinets underneath.This one is a quick project that I never had to address in our old kitchen makeover because we didn't have any exposed cabinet ends:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Basic cabinet side panels don't bother me -- but I do see them as an opportunity to make the kitchen look more custom!  I considered a bunch of different designs, but in the end went with the simplest. My friend Jenny shared a bunch of great options for dressing up the ends of cabinets here.  First I had to remove all of the trim along the side -- the quarter round, baseboard on the wall and the trim along the back of the cabinet. I used a pry bar and my hammer to pull those off.  Because the cabinets have a small \"lip\" on the front, I needed to make everything even so I could add the trim on top. Most cabinets will have that face part that will make things uneven on the side. I had a piece of luan cut to the size I needed and then I nailed it on to the cabinet with my nail gun:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.

    "description": "Last year we looked at Bateman Labs, the Canadian outfit that created a new furniture category: Modular armchair-based workstations and gaming stations. Their Envy line of armchairs used mortises in the frames to accept tenons for various accessories and platforms. Now they've created a more simple and refined design, the Encore. Rather than mortises, concealed magnets hold the removable worksurface attached. When not in use, the worksurface sticks to the back of the chair. The Encore is available in White Oak or Walnut, with five different fabric color options. The $1,200 chair will start shipping this fall, though the company is taking pre-orders for the reduced price of $1,000. More magnetic accessories, they say, are forthcoming.",

    "description": "The 1991 Wim Wenders movie \"Until the End of the World\" had a fascinating premise, about a scientist inventing a device to allow his blind wife to see. The invention, connected to the scientist's head by electrodes, records the biochemical event of seeing. The device would then be physically connected to his wife, and it would transfer the visual data to her brain, bypassing her eyes, and allowing her to \"see\" whatever had been recorded.However, the wife dies due to an illness, and it's subsequently discovered that if you leave the device attached when you go to sleep, it can be used to record your dreams. People then become addicted to watching their own dreams the next morning, with it being presented as more alluring than any drug.Now a Dutch design studio and think tank called Modem claims to have developed a similar machine. Their Dream Recorder is a \"magical bedside device\" billed as \"a portal to your subconscious.\" The idea is that when you wake up, you describe your dream to the device, and a \"dream weaving\" AI model generates video of its interpretation of your dream. It's then played back on the device's screen for you.Ultra-Low Definition DreamscapesDream Recorder translates your subconscious into ultra-low-definition, impressionistic dreamscapes. After you recount your dream in your preferred language, it's transformed into a short-form reel, rendered in a preselected visual style.The Ultimate Dream JournalDream Recorder brings dream journaling into the intelligence era, preserving your dreams as visual records. Replay your dream and reflect on its symbolic meanings, tracing patterns that echo into waking life.In the Wim Wenders movie, there's only one dream-recording prototype, and multiple parties and government agents are trying to get their hands on it. Modem has a very different idea. Their Dream Recorder isn't a secretive prototype they're guarding or a commercial product they're flogging. It was created in the name of research, and the design is available to all:DIY by DesignDream Recorder is built with a DIY spirit. The entire device is fully open source, including the code, hardware documentation, and the 3D-printable glow-in-the-dark shell. Download everything from GitHub, gather the off-the-shelf components, and assemble it yourself. No soldering required. You can learn more here.",
