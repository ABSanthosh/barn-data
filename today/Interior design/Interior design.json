    "description": "While client work pays the bills, successful industrial design firms know that doing internal projects can keep the creative juices flowing. One such project is this Dovetail concept, by Atlanta-based Formation Design Group: Dovetail is a modernization of the mobile lounge concept, developed by Formation to reduce aircraft turnaround times, enhance the passenger experience, and create a more accessible air travel experience. Enabling a Brighter Future for Air TravelThe Dovetail concept is a modern evolution of the original mobile lounge vehicles designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1950s for the Washington Dulles Airport. Leveraging independent drive hubs, advanced sensors, and autonomous navigation technology, Dovetail efficiently and safely ferries passengers between aircraft and the airport without interfering with ground operations, dramatically improving the passenger experience and unlocking new levels of airport optimization. Dovetail can be implemented in existing airports adjacent to jet bridges to enable aft-door loading and unloading of passengers, resulting in up to 30% shorter turnaround times for narrowbody aircraft. This effectively increases the daily flight capacity and passenger seating area of an airport gate without requiring any additional real estate or infrastructure changes. This passenger boarding concept offers significant improvements in accessibility over traditional boarding methods, offering seamless wheelchair accessibility without isolating those passengers or delaying boarding procedures while waiting on specialized equipment or vehicles. Dovetail also enables an entirely new paradigm of airport design through remote servicing of all aircraft, eliminating the need for fixed gates, jet bridges, air stairs, and pushback tractors. By utilizing Dovetail mobile lounges, the square footage of an airport terminal could be significantly reduced, resulting in shorter walking distances for passengers and increased retail traffic in a much more convenient layout. This change has the potential to enable existing airports to handle much greater passenger capacity in the near future without needing to expand their land area footprint. The concept was featured in Aircraft Interior International Magazine's 2024 Showcase.You can see more of Formation's work here.",

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     But it still wasn't functioning as well as it could. So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Despite being in a busy pocket of Sydney, this home transports its owners to a lush paradise thanks to clever planting by Dangar Barin Smith. The garden has been designed not just to be a pretty backdrop, but to be intertwined and completely connected with the interiors… quite literally.

The result feels like an extension of nearby Koonya Beach, translated to fit a residential context.",
