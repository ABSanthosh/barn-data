We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon. We worry that we are making a design or budget mistake, even if our heart knows it's what would bring us more joy.",

    "description": "How to hang patio lights over your patio, deck or yard.The ultimate guide on how to hang outdoor patio lights and all of the products you'll need!There's nothing quite as charming as beautiful cafe lights draped over a deck or patio -- they add so much character and ambience to outdoor living spaces in the evening. Now that we've had them at two homes, these outdoor string lights are a staple for our outdoor spaces. There are a lot of things to consider if you're planning to install these exterior lights yourself. You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time.

They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
