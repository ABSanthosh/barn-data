    "description": "At the end of last summer, Ross Lovegrove and Portugese brand JNF Architectural Hardware announced they would collaborate on \"disruptive collections\" of objects. Now they've released teaser images of the first, a line of 3D-printed doorknobs with Lovegrovian spirit:\"Recognising the growing challenge of sameness in architectural hardware, Lovegrove sought to redefine the landscape of door handles and door accessories by exploring the limitless possibilities offered by advanced manufacturing processes. Each piece is designed to be functional and durable, making a strong visual impact—hallmarks of Lovegrove's work. The result is a product line that enhances the architectural experience while embracing a more mindful and responsible approach to using our planet's resources.\"Though the three pieces won't launch until next month, they've already won a 2025 German Design Award. The Ross Lovegrove x JNF collections will be officially unveiled at next month's Dubai Design Week.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134036/The-Prada-Designed-Spacesuit-for-Axiom-Will-Actually-Fit-Normal-Human-Beings",
    "description": "This month Axiom Space, the private aerospace company partnered with NASA, revealed their Prada-designed next generation spacesuit. Though a disguised version of the suit was shown last year, now they've unveiled the real deal, fittingly at an event in Milan. It's officially called the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) spacesuit, and as you'd guess it's pretty darn stylish:You're undoubtedly wondering what I am, which is why on Earth (er, in space) is Prada involved? Axiom says the fashion brand's \"in-depth knowledge and experience on materials and production processes supported innovative work…. Prada's expertise enabled advanced technologies and innovative sewing methods to bridge the gap between highly engineered functionality and an aesthetically appealing white outer layer, providing astronauts with an increased level of comfort while improving the materials' performance.\"To hear Prada CMO Lorenzo Bertelli tell it: \"Going beyond our limits is one of the company's values that perfectly reflects the spirit of the Prada brand and my parents' vision. I'm very proud of the result we're showing today, which is just the first step in a long-term collaboration with Axiom Space. We've shared our expertise on high-performance materials, features, and sewing techniques, and we learned a lot. I'm sure we'll continue to explore new challenges, broaden our horizons, and build new scenarios together.\"The space threads deviate from Prada's usual runway offerings in more ways than one: Firstly they'll be used in a lunar environment during NASA's upcoming Artemis III mission. Secondly, the spacesuit will actually fit normal human beings, as opposed to runway models: \"The suit accommodates a wide range of crewmembers, including males and females from the first to 99th percentile (anthropomorphic sizing).\" In the video below, the development team discusses the suit's design and intended functionality.",

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "A tour of our FUN and playful basement Halloween decor. I decorate our main living areas for fall every year (fall decor tour coming soon!), but the outside of our house and basement family room is where I have FUN with Halloween decor. I started going all in on the Halloween down in the basement a few years when one of my sisters and I started a Hocus Pocus movie night tradition with our kids. Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.
