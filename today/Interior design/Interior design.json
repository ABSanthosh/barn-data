    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136308/GM-Opens-New-Design-Studio-Tasks-Several-with-Corvette-Concept-Work",
    "description": "It's lousy timing: You open a new design studio overseas to help expand into that market--just as a tariff war potentially kills access to that region. But that's the world we live in, and now GM, which has just opened its fifth design studio after what we assume were years of planning, must roll with the punches. GM's new Advanced Design Studio outside of Birmingham, England brings their global studio tally to five. (The others are located in Detroit, Pasadena, Shanghai and Seoul.) The new 24,584-square-foot facility is staffed with over 30 designers and support staff, and they've been busy working on a project already, creating a Corvette-saluting concept whose unveiling was meant to coincide with the official studio opening.\"Our advanced design team's mandate extends well beyond creating production vehicles,\" said Michael Simcoe, senior VP of global design. \"While they collaborate within our global design network on production and concept vehicle programs, these teams are primarily tasked with imagining what mobility could look like five, 10, and even 20 years into the future and driving innovation for GM.\" The car greatly resembles the B2 stealth bomber from the front, borrowing a feature you've seen on the '63 Corvette's rear: A split window. It might seem an odd choice, but intriguingly, it obviates the need for A-pillars (at least in renderings), providing a semi-panoramic windshield; the roof has a halo structure to compensate. This central spine continues from front to back, splitting the car from left to right. Interestingly, the designers also say the car is divided into two distinct halves from top to bottom:The exterior design includes a distinctive division between the upper and lower halves of the vehicle. The upper half captures the Corvette's classic design elements, but in a futuristic manner. The lower half focuses on functional technical design, including EV battery technology embedded into the structure and aerodynamics elements designed to channel air efficiently without the need for wings or spoilers. You might wonder why GM tasked the studio based in the UK, a land not exactly dripping with Corvette history, to pay homage to that model. As it turns out, they weren't the only ones given this homework assignment:\"As part of the Corvette creative study, we asked multiple studios to develop hypercar concepts, which we'll see more of later this year,\" says Simcoe. \"It was important that they all pay homage to Corvette's historic DNA, but each studio brought their own unique creative interpretation to the project. That is exactly what our advanced design studio network is intended to do – push the envelope, challenge convention and imagine what could be.\" There are no production plans; this is a styling exercise only. And perhaps an early test for this new studio's designers, to see how their concept work stacks up against the forthcoming deliverables from the other studios.The UK studio is headed up by veteran designer Julian Thomson, Jaguar's former Design Director and the man who penned the Lotus Elise S1.",

It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     But it still wasn't functioning as well as it could. So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
