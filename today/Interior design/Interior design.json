    "description": "Two years ago we spotted this gimmicky-looking MagicH chair, an \"ultra adaptive support home office chair\" by Chinese manufacturer Newtral. People went bonkers for it on Kickstarter; it landed $1.8 million. Now the company's back with a new offering, the Freedom-X, a \"multi-position chair\" with a built-in desk and cupholder, as well as swing-down armrests. The video gives you a better look at the product, where you can see that the build quality and upholstery stitching isn't exactly Herman Miller quality:Does anyone have any faith that this chair will last? If you read through the comments on the MagicH's campaign page, you'll find some brutal feedback. Let's just say you won't be passing that chair down to your grandkids; multiple buyers report mechanical failure around the six-month mark.That said, the Freedom-X has once again captured the crowdfunding masses. While Newtral was seeking just $10,000 to get this thing going, at press time they were at $780K-plus, with over a month left to pledge. Caveat emptor.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135016/Industrial-Design-Case-Study-An-Experimental-Furniture-Design-Incorporating-Rope",
    "description": "This experimental Modern Weave 3.0 chair is by KEM Studio, an industrial design and architecture firm based in Kansas City, Missouri. The idea was to produce a non-molded outdoor chair with a modicum of cushioning, using rope. Modern Weave is a continued exploration of reinterpreting a traditional technique (weaving) in a modern way. The original exploration (1.0), done on an Eames Side Chair, was entered in and won the Eames Good Design Challenge and was then auctioned off to raise money for the Ronald McDonald House Charities. From there we took this concept of modern weaving and refined it, still using an Eames Side Chair, creating a simplified linear pattern that provided tailored comfort in the seat of the chair (2.0). After this second exploration we asked the question, \"how do you design an outdoor chair that doesn't require tooling, incorporates elevated ergonomics and can utilize this 'modern weave' as the method of providing extra cushioning?\" Modern Weave 3.0 addresses those opportunities. Made out of bent rods that are welded together at points of interaction, each individual segment has a place and a purpose ergonomically. The grid system that is created from these interactions presents a natural canvas to add the weave and explore from a sense of material, comfort and aesthetics. Traditional techniques are highlighted with this chair (bending rod, welding + weaving) creating a robust, comfortable and beautiful chair that can have its place indoors just as well as outdoors. This chair breaks the mold of outdoor chairs… legitimately… there is no molding required. With this chair, comfort is tunable. It doesn't rely on foam for a pad but instead allows for a human-centered and user-specific comfort as well as encouraging their own creativity and artistry. Any material that can be woven can be used which allows the user to swap out the weave at any time, whether for wear, comfort or aesthetic reasons, change the pattern or even remove the weave material altogether. You can see more of KEM Studio's work here.",

It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

    "description": "Top DIY projects and makeovers of 2024! I've gathered my biggest DIY makeovers completed in 2024 and what I hope to accomplish this year! This is always a fun post to write, as it makes me feel super accomplished after a VERY lazy Christmas break. :) I tackled a bunch of big projects last year and am super proud of what I created. 1. Linen closet redo Since it's the season of decluttering and organizing, let's start with the closet that was a huge pain in my butt for years: I finally got down to business and removed the shallow wire shelving and replaced them with deeper wood shelves: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    SO much better!

    "description": "When looking to buy her family home in Wellington, New Zealand, director of House Party Interiors Karla Devine prioritised finding an immediately liveable property with plenty of scope for cosmetic improvements. She found a 1940s weatherboard home in  Seatoun, kickstarting a major renovation as time and money allowed over multiple years to improve its function and form. The finished project is distinctly ‘Karla,’ featuring an inviting use of colour and plenty of hidden details to make her family’s everyday life easier. It’s a home designed for them and them only — not potential buyers who may walk through the house when it’s possibly on the market in many years to come!",

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
