    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136385/Low-Cost-Robot-Hands-Made-of-Measuring-Tape",
    "description": "The humble tape measure is easy to take for granted, but it's a marvel of modern engineering. A 25-foot-long piece of spring steel, far less than 1mm thick, can be coiled into something that clips to a pocket. Unfurled, a curve is induced across its width, giving it a beam-like strength that allows it to hold a rigid, straight shape.Researchers at the University of California San Diego found another application for tape measures beyond measuring: Being used as robot hands. Those companies currently developing humanoid robots will tell you that developing artificial human-like hands is expensive. The UCSD researchers reckon tape measures can accomplish a lot of gripping and conveying tasks at a fraction of the cost. \"We like to look for non-traditional, non-intuitive robot mechanisms,\" says Nick Gravish, an Assistant Professor at UCSD's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. \"The tape measure is such a wonderful structure because of its combined softness and stiffness together.\" The gripper has two \"fingers,\" made of two spools–each made of two rolls of measuring tape bound together. Each spool is rolled up, in a compact configuration, with only a small part extending out in a triangle shape to form a finger. These triangle sections are controlled by four motors each that control the finger's motion. Each finger can move independently. The triangle sections can lengthen to reach objects that are farther away. They can also retract to bring objects closer to the robot arm the gripper is mounted on.The dual-conveyor-belt configuration means their invention, called GRIP-tape (Grasping and Rolling In-Plane), can rotate objects in place:In a fruit-picking application pursued by the team, the two fingers can rotate a lemon to break it off at the stem:For now, the invention requires remote control. The team's next steps will be to add sensors and AI, in hopes of achieving autonomous function.",

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together!
