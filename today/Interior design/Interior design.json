    "description": "Here's a strange pairing of objects, from Chinese manufacturer Olight. Their Baton 4 Premium Edition is a tiny LED flashlight—less than 2.5\" long--that comes with its own charging case. Despite its tiny size, the Baton 4 has a 1,300-lumen output, and the company claims it can throw its beam 170 meters (558'). Though the press image isn't so aspirational. The charging case, which can double as a powerbank, has a built-in 5000mAh battery; the company says it can fully charge the Baton 4 up to five times, providing 190 days of runtime.The fanatical EDC crowd loves flashlights, stashing stuff inside other stuff, and charging longevity. This object seems tailor-made to scratch all three of those itches. These run $95.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134231/Two-Striking-Urban-Vehicles-The-Duo-and-the-Bento-by-Mobilize",
    "description": "A French mobility company called Mobilize has designed a new type of vehicle from scratch. Two, actually: The Duo, an enclosed two-seater electric quadricycle, and its sibling the Bento, which ditches the back seat for a large storage box.Both vehicles were meant to be strong urban design statements, and to not draw on outdated references. \"The Duo's greatest strength is its unique design,\" says Jean-Philippe Salar, Mobilize's Design Director. \"What we wanted for this vehicle was to avoid imitating a car. It's in effect a little spaceship, a little lunar capsule on 4 wheels.\"Not being a car, the diminutive Duo can be driven by folks as young as 14 in France. The tandem seating arrangement, rather than side-by-side, is to make the vehicle as narrow as possible, the better to slip through traffic. The gullwing doors allow ingress and egress even in tight spaces. The charging cable sits in a dedicated compartment in the vehicle's nose. And, surprisingly, the vehicle features an airbag for safety. The company refers to the single-seater Bento as a micro utility vehicle; it boasts a cargo box on the back that can swallow nearly a cubic meter. The Bento requires a proper driver's license, as its more powerful electric motor can top out at 80 km/h (50 mph). It's targeted at last-mile delivery services and tradespeople who travel with tools. Intriguingly, the dashboard of both vehicle was inspired by an icon of 1980s urban culture: The boombox. \"The design of Duo et Bento, both on the outside and inside – with its dashboard that refers to boomboxes – deliberately goes against the grain of classic automotive language,\" says Salar. The designers also decided not to include a screen, reckoning that most people are already carrying one these days.Both vehicles require half the space to park as a car. The construction of the vehicles is decidedly un-car-like: \"It's based on a metal birdcage structure to which we simply glue plastic panels,\" says Benoit Abadie, Mobilize's Director of Engineering. \"We have around 300 parts in Duo, that's 5 times less than in a normal car, which has around 1,500.\" Mobilize is a subsidiary of Renault, and both vehicles are manufactured at Renault's factory in Tangiers. \"It's an ISO 14001 plant that's working towards carbon neutrality,\" says Wafa Boujguenna, the company's Industrial Project Manager. \"Duo and Bento are eco-designed vehicles, made from 40% recycled materials, battery included, and are 95% recyclable, including the battery.\"The vehicles will be sold in France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. No word on if these will come to the U.S.There's a great interview with the design team below, explaining what they were going for:",

    "description": "How to add a DIY library paneling molding look to your walls.Install your own wall molding (and save a ton!) that gives you that classic library/dark academia look. Last I left you on my office makeover, I had installed the peel and stick wallpaper, removed and installed the new baseboards, installed the chair rail and given everything a couple coats of paint: That pretty green paint color is called Vintage Vogue -- it's a Benjamin Moore color, but I have it mixed at Sherwin-Williams. You can read all about that process and the grasscloth wallpaper I used here. After that, I stalled out on the DIY stuff (because: marching band season) till recently. My goal for the lower third of the wall was to create a library paneling type of look. There are so many ways to add character to your walls with molding. For this room, I wanted it to be a simple but beefy look that adds some detail to this room. Step One: Deciding on your designI ended up doing a classic look using two pieces of molding. Simple, primed one by twos and this cove trim: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   When those curved pieces are placed on each side, it really makes that thin 1x2 feel much more substantial:The curved molding is actually a paintable vinyl product that is great for outside and in bathrooms. I like that it's lightweight, easy to cut and cheaper than wood. I had already added the curved trim to the top of the chair rail. Usually I would go with a simple 1x2, but I really like how this turned out with that coved look on top and bottom of each piece of trim. Before I got started, I needed to fix some gaping in the baseboards and chair rail. It was only bad along the long wall in the room: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

They would be great in multiples along a shelf or console table. Thread some fairy lights throughout and you have a beautiful vignette in just a few minutes. The cream trees have more of a traditional look, and the green ones are softer and more rounded. There are also skinnier red versions that I didn't see in my local Walmart. Bonus: they fold up flat to store away for next year. **I discovered these at Hobby Lobby as well!

Let me tell you, the joy of packing light (only for yourself! not the whole fam!) and having a few nights of sleepovers in a fun new place and exploring so freely (just us eating dessert for breakfast if we want to!)… it’s euphoric. And our latest trip that we enjoyed was a completely new spot for me! She grew up going to Sedona with her family, but I had never been! She didn’t have to work hard to sell me on it though – the gorgeous views, the warm temperatures, magical mystical vortexes, shops full of crystals, and this pool? Sold!

This model allows the client to take a back seat, knowing InForm will both construct the home, and manage the relationship with leading residential architect Pleysier Perkins, who InForm collaborates with on every project. The model has produced dozens of high-end homes showcasing a refined simplicity of form, material restraint, and considered detailing, including the family home of its company director Jon McKimm located in Hampton, Melbourne.
