    "description": "Startup Small Wonder seeks to shake up the packaging and delivery methods of haircare products, making them more sustainable. To realize their goals, they turned to Scott Wilson's Chicago-based ID firm Minimal. Tiny Footprint, Lasting ImpactSmall Wonder is a company on a mission to produce no-compromise, salon-grade, powdered beauty care products, all while reducing or eliminating the reliance on single-use plastic containers in the beauty industry. MINIMAL designers and engineers worked to design and develop a reusable, refillable package that makes dispensing powdered haircare products easy, consistent and mess-free.Unlike dry shampoo, Small Wonder's products are meant to be used in the shower. Traditional shampoo is 75%–85% water, with the remaining volume made up of active ingredients. Powder concentrates are the opposite: they are 100% active ingredients and no water. Consumers simply add water to Small Wonder's powder in the shower, eliminating the need to ship the one thing everyone already has in their shower—water. Rubbing both wet hands together for about 10 seconds will activate the powder into a thick and luxurious lather. SustainabilityInvesting in ReusabilityPurchasing shampoo or conditioner normally means buying a single-use plastic bottle that will end up in a landfill. To change this paradigm, Small Wonder created a system that pairs a reusable powder-coated aluminum bottle with small, 100% recyclable refill tubes. Consumers receive the reusable bottle with their initial purchase, and subsequent purchases include a paper tube containing enough powder concentrate for 3–6 months of daily use. With Small Wonder, less truly is more—less waste, more product. Design ProcessElevating the Experience of Powder Hair-Care Powder hair care is more sustainable than traditional products, but Small Wonder will only fulfill its sustainability mission if people enjoy using it and replace their plastic shampoo bottles. Together Small Wonder and MINIMAL went the extra mile to ensure a user-friendly, mess-free, and delightful experience. We created over 50 prototypes to prove out the functionality and design of the bottle. Our reusable bottle includes a patented cap design that is a novel way to dose and dispense powder hair-care products. An internal silicone diaphragm seals the bottle, protecting the powder from the steamy shower environment, while allowing easy and consistent dispensing every time. The hourglass bottle design is not only colorful, playful, and iconic, but also functional. The bottle opening faces down and the top surface is domed. These features discourage upside-down storage, which might lead to water pooling around the opening and leaking into the powder. The bottom of the cap provides a stable base, but is also used to activate the dispensing mechanism by simply pressing the bottom of the bottle against your hand. And when it's time to refill, the compostable paper refill tube is designed to perfectly fit into the bottle, ensuring the powder ends up in the bottle and not on the bathroom floor. You can see more of Minimal's work here.",

    "description": "European company Buildner organizes design competitions, typically for architects. This one, however, veers more into ID territory. And despite the contest's name, you needn't be an architect to enter.\"Introducing the Architect's Chair Competition, an exciting opportunity for architects and designers to showcase their versatility and creativity by designing a signature piece of furniture. Inspired by the long-standing tradition of iconic architects creating custom furniture as an extension of their architectural work, this competition challenges participants to distill their design approach into its core components and represent their unique style in a single piece of furniture – the architect's chair.\" \"Throughout history, renowned architects such as Charles and Ray Eames, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, and Arne Jacobsen have successfully designed iconic chairs that embody their distinct design philosophies. The Architect's Chair #3 competition seeks to continue this tradition by inviting architects and designers to explore new materials, construction techniques, and ergonomic solutions within the constraints of a chair design, ultimately producing a functional and aesthetically compelling piece of furniture.\" \"As the third installment in a new series of competitions focused on custom furniture design, the Architect's Chair #3 competition encourages participants to think beyond the boundaries of architecture and delve into the realm of product design. By creating a signature chair that reflects their individual style and vision, architects and designers can demonstrate their versatility and contribute to the ongoing dialogue between architecture and design.\" While the prize money isn't gigantic…1ST PLACE: €3,000 (USD $3,267)2ND PLACE: €1,500 (USD $1,634)3RD PLACE: €1,000 (USD $1,089)Buildner Student Award: €1,000 (USD $1,089)Buildner Sustainability Award: €500 (USD $545)…winning would really about the publicity: Buildner says they can get your design in front of roughly one million followers of their social media and newsletters.Registration ends January 15th, 2025.

    "description": "Early Christmas decor finds for this holiday season!I don't usually buy a whole lot of new Christmas decor each year, but I found some cute items this year that really caught my eye! Many of you aren't even considering holiday decor just yet, and I totally appreciate that. :) It's crazy how early the stuff comes out in stores now, but it's even crazier how fast it sells out! These finds were different than most of the Christmas items I've seen out and about this year, and nearly everything was on sale when I purchased!I'm sharing a few simple ways to display these holiday decorations as well. The first decor items I found were these really cute accordion (they are also calling them honeycomb) trees in cream and green: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   I thought they were so unique, but after I purchased them I started seeing this style ALL over the place. It's definitely the trend this year. I'm trendy on time for once! 😂The trees assemble in seconds -- they connect together with magnets. They would be great in multiples along a shelf or console table. Thread some fairy lights throughout and you have a beautiful vignette in just a few minutes. The cream trees have more of a traditional look, and the green ones are softer and more rounded. There are also skinnier red versions that I didn't see in my local Walmart. Bonus: they fold up flat to store away for next year. I found a couple really cute entertaining/serving pieces recently as well. This Christmas platter from Michael's had the sweetest little details: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Where to find the best throw pillow covers for under $20!I'm back to share my favorite resources for cute and affordable pillow covers. I love sharing where I find home decor at a great price.  Pillow covers are one of those things I switch out more often than any other decor item. If you get them for a good price, they're an easy way to change up the accent colors in a room. I also like to use different textures and colors for the seasons.  I've found some sources for budget-friendly throw pillow covers (and inserts) over the years -- the prices are so good! ALL of the throw pillow covers I'm sharing have a zipper and are under $20, and most are well under that, or come in a set of two. This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I prefer covers instead of store-bought pillows these because they cut down on the storage space significantly. I wash and store them away for different seasons and holidays and then reuse the removable inserts in the new cases. I find softer down-like inserts more comfy than the traditional pillow stuffing. I've been using these lightweight down alternative pillow inserts because you can get them in SO many sizes. The prices are hard to beat! When you order your inserts, order one size larger than your pillow cover for a fuller look!  1. Amazon pillow covers Amazon has a ton of throw pillow cover options under $20. I LOVE these neutral windowpane pillow covers on our bed: The quality is great -- I've washed them numerous times. They are SO pretty. There's a similar striped version I usually have on our dining room window seat as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Barrister Hannah Douglas bought a worker’s cottage in Brunswick, Melbourne in 2018 that changed the course of her life. The kitchen and bathroom had previously undergone a simplistic 1990s renovation, but a west-facing light well provided a rare abundance of natural light for a terrace, and the home had good energy. Working with a dream team of collaborators (and leaning on many friends for their advice), Hannah has now renovated the home to introduce a sophisticated interior, and connections to outdoors. It’s still the compact inner-city house she fell in love with — just the more stylish and functional version!",

She didn’t have to work hard to sell me on it though – the gorgeous views, the warm temperatures, magical mystical vortexes, shops full of crystals, and this pool? Sold!
