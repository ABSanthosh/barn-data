    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137055/The-Newave-A-Modular-Surfboard-that-Breaks-Down-for-Transport",
    "description": "For dedicated surfers, surfboards are wonderful things—when you're riding them. At every other point in time, they're a hassle. You have to have the room in your home to store them. The need to transport them influences your choice of vehicle. If you want to transport one on a plane or a train, be prepared to pay extra fees, and keep your fingers crossed that they don't get destroyed during the baggage handling process.Ewen Mahévas and Hadrien Nauroy are two French surfers who met in engineering school. Frustrated with the hassles of transporting their boards, the two spent several years designing a sturdy surfboard that could be broken down. They also wanted to be able to assemble it in less than a minute, without the use of tools. Their resultant modular design is called the Newave:The boards are made of fiberglass, foam and resin, and feature a unique W-shaped connection point made of reinforced nylon. You join the pieces by locking pins into place by hand. The pair developed their design after strenuous strength testing to ensure the boards' performance. They make seven different components, which you can shape into nine different configurations. Obviously you only buy the components you want, and can later pick up different ones to mix and match. The Newave board comes with a backpack to carry them in. These have been successfully Kickstarted, with 22 days left to pledge at press time. The boards start at $731 for the shortest configuration, going up to $1,117 for the 9' longboard.",

    "description": "When patience pays off! My amazing second hand dining table find.   I shared my new obsession love for Facebook Marketplace (and a few helpful shopping tips) a few months ago. I've discovered so many beautiful and unique finds for our home at a great price! I love this method of shopping because I can browse at my leisure (usually right before bed 😂), or if we're looking for something very specific, it allows me to \"save\" a search for specific keywords and/or set up alerts to notify me of new listings.  There was one big item I'd been looking into for some time. I've looked here and there for years, but more recently the hunt started when I painted this cane buffet table earlier this year:  It turned into a pain of a project, but it was all worth it -- we LOVE the end result. That warm wine color is so lovely!   But as often happens, one little change created an itch to make another one. We've had our dining table for seven years and I loved the wood top:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I've been dreaming up ways I could change out the metal legs, but never moved forward with it because the planked wood top was what really didn't fit in.  Plus, it was starting to drive. us. crazy. that we couldn't push the upholstered chairs at the ends all the way in.  As time passed, I was envisioning a more traditional table in this space. It would be nice to have something larger as well.  The dining room is part of our open concept living area. It was labeled as a \"morning room\" on our plans and is full of windows and natural light.  It's not a traditional, stuffy dining room, but I was craving a little bit of a traditional style in there. Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer. You can see how I built this shelf to hide the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer at our old house: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I started by figuring out the middle spot between the two machines. I hung a piece of scrap wood and drilled it into studs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
