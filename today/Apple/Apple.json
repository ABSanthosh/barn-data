    "description": "Macworld We here at Macworld love AirPods so much that it can be easy to forget Apple also sells Beats, another fantastic brand of headphones. And today you can grab a pair for the lowest price we‚Äôve ever seen: Amazon is selling the Beats Studio Pro headphones for $160, an insane $190 off the MSRP and the best price we‚Äôve ever seen. We loved the Beats Studio Pro in our testing, giving these a 4.5-star rating and our Editor‚Äôs Choice award. We appreciated how lightweight they are and the excellent battery life. Along with Bluetooth, these headphones also allow you to experience audio via USB-C and 3.5mm (which can‚Äôt be done on the latest AirPods Max). ‚ÄúEven if they weren‚Äôt $200 cheaper, we‚Äôd recommend these over the AirPods Max. The lack of ear detection is a bummer, but Beats Studio Pro delivers better sound, battery life, controls, and compatibility, and they weigh a lot less, too,‚Äù our review reads, which is a big recommendation, especially considering how much we loved the AirPods Max (other than the price). If you don‚Äôt want noise-canceling, Amazon also has the Beats Solo 4 for $100, half off the MSRP. When we reviewed the Beats Solo 4 and gave them a 4-star review, loving the fact that they work so well with both iOS and Android devices. They have a great battery life, and they don‚Äôt just work over Bluetooth, but also via USB-C or 3.5mm, both of which enable you to listen to lossless audio. So there you have it‚Äîif you want a pair of great headphones, you won‚Äôt find a better bargain than the Beats Studio Pro for $160 or the Beats Solo 4 for $100. But act fast, because we don‚Äôt know how long they‚Äôll last after Cyber Monday. Buy the Beats Solo 4 at Amazon Buy the Beats Studio Pro at Amazon",

If you are looking for discounts on other Apple gadgets we have gathered all the best Apple deals for Black Friday. MacBook deals for Black Friday 2024: Our advice There are a few things to consider before you make a purchase. Apple released the newest M4 MacBook Pro models in late October 2024. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models bring new M4 chips, but they also offer more RAM than the previous generation. This means that when considering deals on older M3 Macs it is important to account for the fact that there may be less RAM in those models, especially since Apple usually charges $200/¬£200 to upgrade from 8GB to 16GB. Also M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBooks also had less RAM previously, now they have 24GB RAM as standard, rather than 18GB. This doesn‚Äôt only apply to the MacBook Pro. When the M4 MacBook Pro was introduced, Apple also doubled the RAM in the M3 MacBook Air from 8GB to 16GB as standard, effectively a $200/¬£200 price cut. So it is important to pay attention to how much RAM is included in an M3 MacBook Air, or you might not be getting the bargain you think you are.

Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.S.) Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.K.) However, there are plenty of good deals to be found, as detailed above. Just make sure you are buying the 16GB RAM model or getting a reasonable discount if not. Black Friday shopping tips We tend to find that the biggest savings are on older models, but be aware that these aren‚Äôt always the best value for money. Check the generation of the model that is discounted to make sure you know exactly what you are buying and what it‚Äôs really worth. We‚Äôve seen resellers switch to selling refurbished or used when the stock of brand-new models run out, so check that the model discounted isn‚Äôt actually a used Mac and therefore not as good a deal as it might look. That‚Äôs not to say you should avoid refurb models ‚Äì you just need to make sure that you aren‚Äôt buying refurb without knowing. Mac deals aren‚Äôt limited to Black Friday. We see good deals all year round, so don‚Äôt feel pressured into buying during Black Friday. Where to get Black Friday Mac deals Many resellers offer Black Friday discounts.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
