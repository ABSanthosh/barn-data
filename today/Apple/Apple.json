    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld We love the Apple Watch Ultra 2, so we were rather happy to see it on sale for $739 at Amazon. That‚Äôs a $60 discount for one of the best-featured smartwatches around. At $739, this isn‚Äôt the best price we‚Äôve seen for the Ultra 2, but then again, it‚Äôs only $20 away. Unless you want to wait a few months to get it at its all-time low of $719, now‚Äôs a good time to add it to your cart. In our review of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, we gave it a four-star rating, appreciating the bright screen and the slick operating system, as well as how great it is for tracking sports and random workouts. ‚ÄúUltimately, the Watch Ultra 2 is the best smartwatch Apple has made yet,‚Äù we wrote. The rugged build will survive any of your outdoorsy activities, even withstanding long swimming sessions and dives. The watch will keep track of your location, help you get to your destination, and tell you how your workout went, whether you‚Äôre at the gym, cycling, or hiking. It also comes with advanced sensors that can detect irregular heart rhythms, know when you take a fall, and more. Thankfully, the battery life on this model is vastly better than on the first model, which is obviously something you‚Äôll need when you‚Äôre off the grid. So go ahead and order your very own Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $739 while you still can. Go on adventures with the Ultra 2Buy now at Amazon",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/668938/best-password-managers-2.html",
    "description": "Macworld Remembering the numerous passwords we use on a daily basis can be a real pain. Whether it‚Äôs logging into Amazon to order a new book, checking your online banking or settling down to watch something on Netflix, seeing the log-in box appear can make your heart sink. Then there‚Äôs the fact that each site seems to require a different length or combination of certain characters, meaning you need different ones for nearly every site or service (which, sadly, is also a good idea). How are our limited human brains supposed to store all these weird strings of letters, numbers and special characters? All I want to do is stream Star Trek: The Next Generation for the 50th time, not prove my intellectual prowess! Password managers can help you manage all your passwords and login information across your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. Apple offers iCloud Keychain, but is that the best password manager for Mac and iPhone, or is there another password manager for Apple devices that would do a better job. PROMOTIONRoboForm Premium: Just $0.99/Month! Secure your passwords with RoboForm Premium‚Äînow only $0.99/month, a massive 60% off! Exclusive to Macworld readers. Offer ends soon. Grab it today! $11.90/yr at RoboForm These carry the burden of remembering everything for you, as you just have to create one master password, after which the app takes care of logging into all other accounts. They even make recommendations for really secure passwords, so you don‚Äôt rely on the mixture of your birthday and the name of your first pet. Having only a single login to remember? That sounds good to us. Need some help coming up with a safe and secure password? Read our tips to make your passwords even stronger. Updated with details of Apple‚Äôs Password app. How password managers work The idea of password managers is to simplify the way you access your various accounts. Instead of having to memorize multiple complex passwords for each of the services you use you need only recall one password ‚Äì or provide a fingerprint or Face ID ‚Äì and the password manager will automatically fill in the required details for you. Just remember this is only as safe as the password you use to unlock access to all your passwords ‚Äì so don‚Äôt lock them all behind an easy-to-guess password, like your pet‚Äôs name. The password managers also offer various other features. For example, they can generate random, highly secure passwords for your accounts, they can warn you if your password has been compromised, and some can advise you about existing insecure passwords and support your efforts to update them. Obviously, security is a high priority‚Äîas the manager apps have the virtual keys to your kingdom‚Äîwhich is why all of the options listed below use high-grade encryption to protect your details. Many also feature digital wallets so your bank details can be safely stored and used to make purchases online without having to root around in your pocket or bag for the card number and expiry date. A good Password Manager makes it easy to use strong, unique passwords everywhere on the web, no matter what platform or browser you happen to use. But to get the most out of them, you need to pay a subscription fee. Do you need a password manager? Is Apple‚Äôs Password app enough? Now that Apple has its own standalone Passwords app (which arrived in iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia) do you need another Password Manager? As you will see from our review below, and our full review of Apple‚Äôs Passwords app, most users can replace their paid password manager with Apple‚Äôs free solution. Most people don‚Äôt use a password manager at all, so getting them in the door this way is a good thing ‚Äì and Apple Passwords is definitely good enough for most everyday users. The problems arise if you are trying to switching from an existing Password Manager. Indeed, the biggest annoyance we ran into was making the switch and getting everything transferred over, as you can see if you read: Apple‚Äôs free Passwords app can replace your paid password manager (kinda). If you just love your current password manager and use it to connect to multiple platforms and browsers, it may well be worth continuing to pay its subscription fee. If you‚Äôre thinking of switching to save the fee for your existing password manager, by all means move, just expect it to take a little time.

It stores and fills login passwords, Wi-Fi passwords, 2FA codes, and passkeys. It warns you of easy-to-guess passwords, reused passwords, and passwords that appeared in major data breaches. It‚Äôs also relatively easy to securely share passwords with others. Apple also provides its own suggested passwords for new signups. It doesn‚Äôt give you much in the way of other features‚Äìstored credit card and identification info to autofill in forms, secure document storage or notes, and so on. Apple has other apps that do those things in encrypted ways, but if you use other platforms and browsers, this information is not easily available. Increasing the font size on the 2FA codes by a few points would help. There‚Äôs text at the top of the Codes screen that shows you how long until the codes reset, but it scrolls off the top of the screen when you scroll down your list‚Äìit should stay anchored at the top of the screen.

It‚Äôs not only your account details that you can store in Dashlane, you can store bank details, your address and important documents like your passport and driving licence. There‚Äôs also a section for any secure notes you wish to keep safe. The app also supports Passkeys, which are the latest innovation which seem set to replace passwords in the long run. All your transactions between the app and sites are end-to-end encrypted using 256-bit AES technology. There‚Äôs also 2-factor authentication available, with the Dashlane app acting as an authenticator, and you get a VPN service as part of the paid tiers. Dashlane is available on a wide range of platforms, with dedicated apps for iOS/iPadOS and Android, plus extensions for Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox. Dashlane costs $59.99 (approx ¬£48) per year for the individual account. There is a free tier available, which acts as a taster for the full package, and you can use it indefinitely, but with a limit of only 25 passwords.

The service offers a really impressive range of capabilities on its free tier, so with this app, you get what you don‚Äôt pay for!¬† Without signing up for a premium account you get unlimited storage for passwords, credit cards, notes, and online account IDs, secure text messaging with individuals, a secure password generator, two-factor authentication, plus the ability to either have your data stored on the Bitwarden servers or one you host yourself. Oh, and you can sync all your devices, rather than the single one offered by most other free tiers.¬† Should you want to expand the features, then the Premium tier costs $10 (approx ¬£8) per year and adds secure file sharing, 1GB of encrypted file attachments, additional two-factor authentication options, password safety analysis, and access to your account by family if you die or become sick. Encryption is high-grade stuff, with Bitwarden deploying end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256, all of which are down locally on your machine.¬† Apps are available on a wide range of platforms, including macOS, Windows, Linux, pretty much every browser you can think of, Android, and iOS, and there‚Äôs even a secure web version if you find yourself without your device.¬† If you‚Äôre looking for value when it comes to password managers, it‚Äôs very hard to look past Bitwarden.¬† NordPass ‚Äì Easy To Use Password Manager Price When Reviewed: Free 30-day trial; $2.99 per month (currently $1.49), $35.88 a year (currently $35.76 for two years) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price NordPass (first two years) $35.76 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $35.76 at NordPass (first two years) One of the newest additions to the password manager arena is NordPass, which is made by the same fine fellows at NordVPN. The latter is one of our favorite VPNs, as you‚Äôll see from our Best VPN for Mac roundup. NordPass offers full desktop apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux, plus the standard iOS and Android offerings. You can also use NordPass through browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Edge, and Safari.¬† NordPass has all the features you‚Äôd expect from a modern password manager, with quick importing of existing passwords from other services, zero-knowledge architecture, local encryption, 2-factor authentication, password generation, and secure storage for credit details and notes. There‚Äôs of course autofill for logging into accounts, folders to store passwords for work, home or other classifications, security monitoring for password hacks, support for biometrics, plus a neat interface to manage all of your various data. NordPass offers a decent free tier, which supports unlimited passwords, stores credit card details, and secure notes, plus has the ability to sync across all your devices. The main drawback is that you can only be logged into one device at a time. But if you can work with that it‚Äôs a service you should definitely investigate. The paid tiers start at $35.88/¬£28.68 p/a for a single Premium account, but there are frequent deals (currently $35.76/¬£28.56 for two years). Read our full NordPass review Roboform ‚Äì A solid password manager Price When Reviewed: $29.97 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price RoboForm (annually) $11.90 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $11.90 at RoboForm (annually) RoboForm works across iPhone, iPad and Macs, plus you can use it on Windows and Linux as well as Android. Set up is simple. Download the relevant app or extension, then sign up for an account. There‚Äôs a free trial that gives you access to the Premium tier features for 14-days, then you can either continue to use it for free on the limited tier or sign up to a fully-functional paid variety. As well as passwords you can store personal details (e.g. address and phone number), your passport, driving license and other sensitive data. You can import your existing login details from other services or your browser. The Mac interface is a little basic‚Äìthe desktop client looks like a Finder window. On iPhone, the main page has buttons along the bottom that allow you to navigate between Identity (passport, etc.), the built-in Browser, Authenticator, Tools section, secure share, and Emergency Access feature (for family, should something happen to you). The browser version features Roboform‚Äôs one-click login where you select the site from your logins or history that you want to access and Roboform opens the page and automatically log into your account. Most people will probably stick with their normal browser, in which case Roboform acts like any other password manager, prompting you with stored account details when you attempt to login. The password generator does a good job of helping you choose new passwords. You can select the number of characters, numbers, symbols, upper or lower case, and create passphrases. There‚Äôs a built-in authenticator and Roboform can handle two-factor authentication. You can also use passkeys instead of passwords. There‚Äôs a Security Centre that analyses your password integrity. This includes how many times you‚Äôve used the same ones, how complex they are, and if they‚Äôve been involved in hacks. Everything you do is end-to-end encrypted via AES 256-bit encryption, with PBKDF2 SHA256. Roboform offers a limited free tier (one device with unlimited passwords). The Premium tier (which used to be called Roboform Everywhere), adds the security center, access on all your devices, customer support, and web access to your account. It‚Äôs available for $29.98/¬£29.99 p/a but at the time we reviewed it there was a deal for $11.90 a year. Read our full RoboForm Premium review Keeper ‚Äì Best Of The Rest Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $2.29 per month, $34.99 a year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Keeper Security (annually) $34.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $34.99 at Keeper Security (annually) Keeper can store unlimited passwords, auto-generate strong new ones, and sync passwords across multiple devices, all while holding credit card details and other important payment details in its secure vault. There‚Äôs also support for Passkeys, which is good. AES 256-bit encryption is all performed locally, so Keeper can never know your details, but there is the option to securely share folders and passwords with friends and family if they need to access any of your accounts. The included secure messaging service is also useful for communicating these requests There‚Äôs also support for Touch ID on the Mac and iPhone, with the latter also working with Face ID, plus Apple Watch compatibility and the option of using two-step authentication. Keeper Unlimited Password Manager is available from $34.99/¬£24.99 per year, but there is a free tier that is limited to one device and ten passwords. LastPass Price When Reviewed: Free tier (one device); $3 per month, $36 per year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price LastPass (annually) $36 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $36 at LastPass (annually) LastPass is probably one of the best-known password manager, thanks to it being one of the original pioneers in the field, however, in recent years it‚Äôs lost its crown after being hit with several hacks, including at least one that stole encrypted customer data. This recent history makes it harder to recommend. Not that security measures aren‚Äôt there, the company explains that it uses ‚ÄúAES 256-bit encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256 and salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud.‚Äù The app does all of its encryption locally, so LastPass never knows your master password, and the Premium tier also supports a form of two-factor authentication for another layer of security. You can either use LastPass locally on your device via dedicated apps (macOS, iOS and iPadOS), or via the web with plugins and extensions available for Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge all of which allow you to automatically access login details for sites and accounts or have LastPass autofill the login fields on your behalf.¬† Just like with other managers you have access to a vault where all of your passwords are stored, and these can be changed to more complex alternatives at the touch of a button. LastPass will also advise you on how secure your passwords are for your existing accounts. Getting set up is easy too, as you can import existing passwords from web browsers, email, and other password managers. One drawback is that, at the time of writing, LastPass doesn‚Äôt yet support Passkeys, although the company says that the features is on its way. The app offers a digital wallet to store your card details, plus another area for official ID such as passports and driving licenses. The Note section is a place where you can keep Wi-Fi passwords, insurance details and any other important documents that you need to access. It‚Äôs also possible to securely share account details and logins with friends and family, even if they don‚Äôt have LastPass.¬† There is a free tier, although this is limited to one device, so if you want to sync across your Mac and iPhone you‚Äôll need to move up to the Premium tier. At the time of writing, this will cost $36/¬£31.99 per year. Those wanting more scope can opt for the family plan which includes six user accounts and only costs $48/¬£40.80 per year. One of the advantages of a paid plan is an Emergency backup which means that, should you suffer an accident or even pass away, your family will be given access to your account. Read our full LastPass review Enpass Price When Reviewed: Free tier; From $1.99 per month, $23.99 a year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Enpass (annually) $23.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $23.99 at Enpass (annually) Those looking for a simple, secure solution that doesn‚Äôt break the bank would do well to consider Enpass. The macOS client is completely free, but if you want to add the same features to your iPhone or Android device then you‚Äôll need to move to the Enpass Premium tier that costs $23.99/¬£19.49 per year. If you prefer to buy a lifetime license, you can pick one up for $99.99/¬£82.99.¬† Enpass doesn‚Äôt store any of your information on its servers. Instead, everything is encrypted and kept on your personal device so you never lose control of your data.¬†Details can be synced securely via iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box, or ownCloud/WebDAV, to keep all of your devices in step. You still have the classic features of other password managers, such as auto-fill forms, security analysis of your passwords and generating complex replacements easily, secure storage for sensitive information, passkey support, and AES 256-bit encryption, plus support for iOS, Android, and Apple Watch devices. There are plenty of fine-tuning options for those who are a little bit more hands-on, but we like the no-nonsense approach and the fact that your data never leaves your device.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
