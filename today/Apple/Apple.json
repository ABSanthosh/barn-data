Here's what to expect from Apple, as soon as next week.Apple's iPhone SE 4 could debut in February 2025.For the past two iterations, Apple's iPhone SE has maintained a dated look, with thick bezels and a Touch ID Home button that make it virtually indistinguishable from an iPhone 8. All of that is set to change quite soon, as the budget-friendly iPhone SE is going to receive its first major redesign in years.Alongside its new design, the iPhone SE 4 will gain a variety of new hardware features, many of which are carry-overs from more recent iPhone models.

    "description": "Macworld Privacy and security have been central themes for Apple for years now, and the company sees itself as a market leader in making sure your data is shielded from prying eyes. While encryption and privacy are important issues for many tech companies, Apple has gone much further than most to make sure that your data is only accessible to you, unless you explicitly say otherwise. A new secret government order in the U.K. seeks to absolutely destroy that for every Apple user around the world. That’s right: over 2 billion Apple users globally would have their privacy and security obliterated by an undisclosed order from the British government. The Washington Post got tipped off by insiders about the order, issued last month, from the office of the Home Secretary. Called a “technical capability notice” and calling on powers afforded to the office by the U.K. Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, the British Government has secretly ordered Apple to “create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud,” according to the Post. What the U.K. government is asking for is the ability to access the encrypted cloud data for every Apple user around the world. That is, frankly, a comically authoritarian and draconian order and well beyond the jurisdiction of any individual government. According to The Washington Post’s sources, Apple can appeal the decision to a technical board, but it is not permitted to delay compliance while the appeal is underway. As a result, the company is likely to stop offering encrypted cloud storage in the U.K. (a huge problem in itself) or remove other iCloud services. But even those extreme measures wouldn’t satisfy the requirements handed down by the U.K. government. As bad as the order is, it is just as worrying that it was made in secret and that Apple is legally forbidden from even acknowledging that it has received the order at all. The law makes it a criminal offense to even reveal that one has received such an order. The encryption built into every iCloud account is at risk due to the U.K.’s new rule.Apple What is at stake By default, many Apple cloud services are encrypted, but they are encrypted in transit and on the server, so Apple has the encryption key. Photos, Notes, Reminders, iCloud Mail, and Calendar contacts are examples of this data that Apple can decrypt. The company has done so many times in the past when issued a lawful order from law enforcement. However, Health data, Home data, Messages in iCloud, and other types of data are end-to-end encrypted, with the encryption key stored on your Apple device and locked to your passcode or biometric (Face ID and Touch ID). Apple has no way of decrypting this data even if it wanted to. In 2022, Apple began offering the Advanced Data Protection option, which brings end-to-end encryption to nearly all Apple cloud services. If enabled (go to Settings \u003e Your account \u003e iCloud and look for the Advanced Data Protection option), only iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendars will be stored encrypted with the key in Apple’s hands. Apple has a support document with a table showing which data is end-to-end encrypted and which Apple has the key to, for both standard and Advanced Data Protection settings. The U.K. rule essentially demands that all data that Apple stores for its cloud services be retrievable not just by Apple, but by the U.K. government—no longer requiring a legal process to request that Apple provide targeted data—and for this to apply to every Apple user in the world. Of course, if a government has access to a back door to your data, it is only a matter of time before that backdoor escapes the bounds of a government agency, and is in the hands of outside agencies, governments, criminals, or even sold on the black market. It is far too valuable a thing to believe that it would stay confined to a security agency within the U.K. and that they would only use it sparingly and when absolutely necessary. In short, there is no such thing as a “secure back door.” On its face, if fully complied with, the security of cloud storage for every Apple user in the world (estimated at around 2.2 billion) would be not only diminished but basially nonexistent. A less strict interpretation may allow Apple to get away with only ruining the privacy of its users in the U.K., or halting valuable and popular cloud services for all of them. What is not at risk, from our understanding of the reporting on this issue, is the sanctity of your Apple devices themselves and their storage. The order apparently only applies to cloud data and does not require a backdoor to access your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or any other device or the data stored locally on it. Apple is surely not the only recipient of such an order. Google’s encrypted backups for Android phones, WhatsApp’s encrypted messaging data, and other similar cloud services would be as big or bigger targets for the U.K. government. Again, if these companies have gotten orders to make this encrypted data accessible to the U.K. government, and whether or not they have complied with it, it would be a criminal offense to even let it be known. We are at the mercy of whistleblowers and leakers to know if our privacy is being secretly, globally, violated.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s Studio Display is as expensive as it is beautiful, so we’re always on the lookout for deals. Today we’ve got one of the best ever: The Apple Studio Display is down to $1,300 at Amazon, a savings of $300 and just a few dollars away from its all-time low. When we reviewed the Studio Display, we loved its gorgeous design and the good image quality, as well as an impressive sound system with spatial audio, which isn’t something we find often in monitors. “There’s no question as to the quality of the Studio Display—it’s a great all-around display that’s well-suited for general use and production environments alike,” our review reads. While we truly appreciate Apple’s sleek designs, it’s the fact that this 27-inch monitor delivers 5K visuals that really captures our attention. That means images will be incredibly sharp and detailed, which makes this monitor perfect for work, creating images, video editing, and even gaming. The monitor also features a 12MP ultrawide camera with Center Stage so it will always keep the focus on you even if you move out of frame. So go ahead and get your own Apple Studio Display for $300 off at Amazon while the deal’s still available. Buy now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
