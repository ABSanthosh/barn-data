    "description": "Macworld LayerX Labs on Tuesday posted its finding on a new phishing attack that originally targeted Windows users, but now can be found on Macs. The phishing attack attempts to get a user’s username and password by making the user think their Mac is compromised. The attack involves fake security warnings that appear while browsing the web. Alerts appear stating that the Mac has been “compromised” and “locked” and the webpage appears frozen to heighten the sense of a compromise. A window appears prompting the user to enter their Mac’s username and password, along with a phone number to contact for “support.” LayerX Labs LayerX Labs provided a screenshot of the phishing attempt, though the attackers may modify the alert to make it more convincing. It has several telltale signs that it is fake, such as the design that doesn’t conform to Apple’s style and the incorrect styling of the name “macOS.” Macworld called the phone number in the screenshot at 11 a.m. Pacific and got a message stating that they were not available and to call back between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., so it’s a fake number that no one answers. LayX Labs states that users run into these attacks inadvertently by making typos in the URLs entered into the browser. These mistyped URLs led users to compromised domain parking pages with the phishing attack. The phishing attack initially focused on Windows users but Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla implemented new security features in their browsers that effectively blocked the attack. This caused the attackers to turn to Mac users. How to protect yourself from web phishing attacks The easiest way to protect yourself from this attack is to verify the URL you have typed into your browser. Bookmark the sites you visit frequently so you don’t have to type in the URL every time. In some instances, you can use a search engine, type the name of the place you want to visit, and then click on the link after looking at the URL it goes to. For example, type “Macworld” into the search engine you use, and then click on the link that’s designated at www.macworld.com. This way isn’t as efficient but if you make a typo, you’ll see it in the search and Google will steer you in the right direction. Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so installing them as soon as possible is important. If you use a third-party browser, Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on whether or not you need antivirus software, a list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a comparison of Mac security software.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2642878/eu-orders-apple-to-open-up-ios-connectivity-features.html",
    "description": "Macworld With the Digital Markets Act adopted in 2022, the European Union has identified Apple’s iOS (as well as other companies’ products) as “Gatekeepers” that have such a stranglehold on the market that they should be required to comply with certain rules about interoperability and openness to competing software and services. Users in Europe have already seen some results of this. Compared to iPhones in the rest of the world, iOS in Europe offers unique capabilities: EU users can sideload apps and use alternative app stores, access different payment processors with Apple Pay, use apps Apple doesn’t allow elsewhere such as BitTorrent clients and clipboard managers, and can set default applications for a variety of common phone tasks. Apple has always insisted that these changes will compromise their user’s privacy and security, harm the user experience, and hinder Apple’s ability to make great products. So far, the changes don’t appear to have had such a deleterious effect, but the EU says Apple is not fully in compliance with the Digital Markets Act and ordered Apple to make new specific changes to comply with its interoperability directives. There are two new directives (case DMA.100203 and DMA.100204). One specifies ways in which Apple must create better interoperability with third-party apps, services, and devices. The other details how Apple must communicate and administer its interoperability functions to developers. The new EU rules may force Apple to open up Bluetooth and NFC features to third-party developers.Foundry Here is how the European Commission has described the feature changes Apple must make to enhance interoperability: iOS notifications: Allows connected devices, such as smartwatches, to show and react to iOS notifications. Background execution: Executes certain actions with respect to connected physical devices “in the background,” i.e. without the user looking directly at the app. For example, the iPhone can fetch the latest weather information and synchronize it to a smartwatch, without the need for active user interaction. Automatic audio switching:  Allows users to switch between two devices, for example between a smartphone and a computer, when listening to audio with supported headphones. High-bandwidth peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections: Establishes a high-bandwidth Wi-Fi connection between an iOS device and connected physical devices. This high-speed connection can be used to share large files between two devices, or to cast on an iPhone what can be seen on virtual reality glasses. Close-range wireless file transfers: Allows devices to access the same iOS-controlled features as Apple’s services in third-party file-sharing apps, creating, for example, alternatives to AirDrop. Media casting: Allows developers to develop an alternative media casting solution to AirPlay by granting them access to required software features in a non-discriminatory way to AirPlay. NFC controllers: Allows apps on an iPhone to communicate with connected devices, such as rings or bracelets, to provide them with information such as a user’s payment card details. The end user can then use the ring or bracelet in a shop to perform payment transactions like with a payment card without the presence of the iPhone. Moreover, physical smart cards can easily be read for instance to activate or secure mobile banking. Proximity-triggered pairing: Allows connected physical devices to pair with an iOS device through a simplified procedure. For example, when the user brings a new headset near the iPhone it should be able to pair immediately through a simple and streamlined procedure, independently of whether the headset is an Apple product or a third-party brand.  Automatic Wi-Fi connection: Allows devices to access information about local Wi-Fi networks saved on the iPhone and connected physical devices to seamlessly join these networks.  In other words, third-party headphones have to be able to provide the same easy proximity-pairing and automatic audio switching as AirPods do. Non-Apple devices have to be able to show and react to notifications the way Apple products do (this is a big one for third-party watches, such as the new Pebble). Developers have to be allowed to develop and publish alternatives to AirDrop and AirPlay that aren’t hamstrung compared to Apple’s solutions. And Apple has to fully open up its NFC implementation. The EU further specifies that Apple has to enable interoperability features through complete, free, and well-documented APIs, that they have to be equally effective as the solutions Apple uses (no more “Apple can use functions nobody else can” stuff), and Apple has to make new functionality within these interoperability categories available to third parties at the same time they are available to Apple. If you’re excited about the prospect of third-party hardware that works better with your iPhone, you should know that these features are only required on iPhones sold within the European Union. Already, iOS has access and openness within the EU that it doesn’t in other locations. Apple may make some of these changes globally, but thus far its DMA compliance measures have been exclusive to iOS users within the EU. Apple’s response Naturally, Apple isn’t happy about this. Whenever a court or government tells Apple what it has to do, the company pushes back hard, claiming that compliance will cause irreparable harm to users. In a statement to several media sites, Apple said: “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.“",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today.
