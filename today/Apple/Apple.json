    "description": "Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the¬†Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10, Watch Ultra 1/2). You won‚Äôt find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch‚Äîincluding some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods. Here, we round up some of the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands‚Äîsome of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying. There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks. We‚Äôve tested a lot and selected our favorites here. Best simple Apple Watch chargers Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel chargers Best Apple Watch power banks Simple Apple Watch stands Best simple Apple Watch chargers Every Apple Watch comes with the company‚Äôs Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / ¬£29 it‚Äôs not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable ‚Äì Best Apple Watch charging cable Pros Fast charge Watch Simple Cons One use only Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: $29 at Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 1m cable Weight: 2.6oz (73g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10 and Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch SE (including the current model) and Series 6 and earlier Watch models shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function. Both cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck. The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable‚Äîcharging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking. Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you‚Äôd use to charge an iPhone; find our recommended best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger. While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there‚Äôs little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Third-party Apple Watch Chargers ‚Äì Beware cheap imitations Pros Affordable Cons Pot luck on quality Slow charging No name brands Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: $5.09 at Amazon Watch fast charge: No Size: 1m cable Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple‚Äôs official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch‚Äôs pretty dreadful battery life. Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple‚Äôs simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We are sure that the Satechi USB-C Magnetic Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy but it‚Äôs actually pricier than the Apple and doesn‚Äôt support fast charging‚Äîso why bother? There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters‚Äîmany of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can‚Äôt vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. Satechi USB-C Magnetic Apple Watch Charging Dock ‚Äì Portable Apple Watch charger Pros Portable Cons No Watch fast charge One use only Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Amazon$39.99 at Satechi Watch fast charge: No Size: 2 x 1.73 x 0.45 inches (5.1 x 4.4 x 1.1cm) Weight: 1.1oz (31g) Colors: Space Gray Requires USB-C charger: Any USB-C charging port Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port‚Äîfor example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad,a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank. When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don‚Äôt always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger ‚Äì Best simple Apple Watch charging stand Pros Fast charge Watch Nightstand Portable Cons Expensive for one use only Price When Reviewed: $59.95 Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Apple$59.99 at Best Buy$64.91 at Walmart Electronics Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches (9.7 x 9.7 x 1.6cm) Weight: 6.8oz (192g) Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) The Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It‚Äôs one of the few Apple Watch accessories that can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and, weighing just 6.8oz (192g), is portable, too. The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There‚Äôs a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch. It is available from Apple. Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. 1. Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger ‚Äì Best portable 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.95 at Apple$129.99 at Twelve South Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 2.8 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches (7.1 x 6.1 x 2.35cm) Weight: 4.2oz (119g) Colors: Aluminum Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included Twelve South makes our favorite 3-in-1 iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger, the HiRise 3 Deluxe reviewed below, and it has triumphed again with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously. Technically it can‚Äôt be beaten‚Äîit is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode. It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ. The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. You can buy a cheaper ($99.99) version in three different colors‚Äîthe Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn‚Äôt ship with a wall charger. Read our full Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger review 2. Native Union Voyage 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger ‚Äì Excellent portable 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W Qi2 for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Native Union Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (Qi2) Size: 2.8 x 2.6 x 0.8 inches (7.1 x 6.6 x 2cm) Weight: 3.7oz (105g) Colors: Sandstone, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (27W minimum) Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyager is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it‚Äôs a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly‚Äôs 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs. It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack‚Äîthe included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly. Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn‚Äôt come with a wall charger so you‚Äôll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE. It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyager will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly‚Äôs notch. Take a look at the Voyager and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. 3.

Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly. The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can‚Äôt be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the¬†Anker 3-in-1 Cube.¬† It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up. All the charging points are top-end‚ÄîiPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W‚Äîso all can be fast-charged. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in¬†iOS 17‚Äôs StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees.

Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Twelve South. There is a cheaper version, the¬†Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1. 3.

We also like Anker‚Äôs 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below‚Äîbut while it‚Äôs gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn‚Äôt feature Watch fast charging.

It‚Äôs a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand. It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can‚Äôt take advantage of iOS 17‚Äôs StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it‚Äôs charging‚Äîand it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply.

The Apple Watch charging module flips up so the Watch can be shown in Nightstand mode; it can also lie flat. It is also the only one to offer fast charging for the Apple Watch. None of them offer 15W certified MagSafe charging for the phone‚Äîfor that you‚Äôll need a less flexible 3-in-1, of which we have reviewed several here.

Best Apple Watch power banks Many of us have discovered how handy it is having a portable power bank to carry around for when our phones need a charge when we‚Äôre away from a power socket. As the Apple Watch has such a short battery life, having a power bank that is built for the Watch is even more useful when your Watch gives you that dreaded 10% battery warning and you are an hour or more away from your USB charger. We‚Äôve tested a bunch of Apple Watch power banks and battery packs and here are the best. 1.

The 5W Apple Watch charging module will fast-charge your Watch and is adjustable so allows for Nightstand mode. It‚Äôs not a wireless charger but with its own built-in USB-C cable you don‚Äôt need it and get 30W wired charging that is so much faster than 7.5W MagSafe compatible or even 15W MagSafe/Qi2 wireless. That cable can also be used to charge the power bank itself. In our tests, an Apple Watch Series 10 was charged by 65% within 30 minutes. The iPhone 15 also charged quickly; we measured a 50% increase in 30 minutes. We even gave our MacBook Air a boost using the power bank. The cute power display also showed that the Apple Watch Series 10 charged at times at 4W, the iPhone 15 at 23W and the MacBook at 29W.

The Apple Watch battery life is notoriously short between charges so fast charging is a great way to keep your smart timepiece topped up and ready for action. Using a Fast Charger cable, such as the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, or stand, such as the Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, you can charge a Watch 33% faster than using an older cable or stand. Fast charging will get a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will power your Watch for eight hours of sleep tracking. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger. See How to fast charge Apple Watch for more information. 2. Which Apple Watch models can fast charge? The following Apple Watch models support Fast Charge: Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2. The Apple Watch SE does not support Fast Charge. 3. How can I see my Apple Watch battery percentage? To see how much power remains on your Apple Watch, hold the bottom of the screen and swipe up to open the Control Center. You can add the battery life percentage to the watch face by adding a battery complication, in this way: Hold the display, then tap Edit Swipe left to the end to see if the watch face includes a possible battery complication Tap the complication to select it, then turn the Digital Crown to choose the battery complication To save your changes, press the Digital Crown, then tap the face to switch to it. You can also add a battery widget to show the battery percentage of a connected Apple Watch on your iPhone. 4. How to save battery power on the Apple watch When you can‚Äôt get to your Apple Watch charger fast enough and the Watch battery is dangerously low, you can eke out the remaining battery charge by saving power. The easiest way save battery life is to turn on Low Power Mode. This turns off Always On Display, background heart rate and blood oxygen measurements, plus heart rate notifications. Cellular access is also turned off in Low Power Mode. If you‚Äôre just going for a walk, then maybe you don‚Äôt need the heart monitor on‚Äîalthough this may impact your Exercise score, it could keep your Watch going till you get back to base and a charging socket. To turn on Low Power Mode, tap the side button on your Apple Watch to open Control Center, and select the battery percentage. Then tap Low Power Mode. Apple states that ‚Äúother notifications may be delayed, emergency alerts may not arrive, and certain cellular and Wi-Fi connections are limited‚Äù in Low Power Mode. When the Watch battery is charged to 80%, Low Power Mode turns off automatically. Other Apple Watch battery saving tips include: Don‚Äôt use an Exercise or other tracking. If you are exercising you can still save some battery by turning on Low Power Mode‚Äîopen the Watch app on your iPhone, and scroll to Workout where you can turn Low Power Mode on by tapping the slider on the right. To further conserve battery life, turn on Fewer GPS and Heart Rate Readings by tapping the slider. Turn off Always On Display in the Settings app Turn off the Wake Screen so that when you raise the watch to your face the screen doesn‚Äôt automatically turn on. Tap the screen or press the Digital Crown to manually wake up the screen instead. Open Settings on your Apple Watch. Select General \u003e Display \u0026 Brightness. Turn off Wake on Wrist Raise by tapping the slider. Turn off background apps: push the side button (not the digital crown) and release it; then scroll through the running apps using the digital crown; close the apps by swiping from left to right and tapping on the ‚ÄúX‚Äù Turn off the heart rate monitor and advanced health tracking in the Watch app on your iPhone: Privacy Turn off voice assistant Siri‚Äîwhich is always listening for your commands‚Äîin Apple Watch Settings Turn on Theater mode, which prevents the Apple Watch display from turning on when you raise your wrist, and also turns on Silent Mode Turn on Silent Mode Use a darker watch face as black pixels use less power than bright ones such as Mickey Mouse or the Activity Face In extreme circumstances when you know you‚Äôll need your Apple Watch later but not right now, turn off your Apple Watch by pressing and holding the side button until you see the Power Off slider Unpair AirPods from your Apple Watch in Settings. Always keep your Watch software up to date. Some Watch software updates are specifically to improve battery life, while others keep your Watch operating as efficiently as possible. In the Watch app on your iPhone, go to My Watch \u003e General \u003e Software Update. Optimized Battery Charging is turned on by default when you set up your Apple Watch, but check it‚Äôs on by opening Settings on the Apple Watch,a nd then selecting Battery \u003e Battery Health. Turn Optimized Battery Charging on via the slider. See more on Optimized Battery Charging below. See: How to improve Apple Watch battery life for more advice. 5. How to turn on Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch When its battery charge falls to 10% or lower, your Apple Watch alerts you and suggests that you enter Low Power Mode. Hold the bottom of the Watch screen, then swipe up to open Control Center. Tap the battery percentage icon, then turn on Low Power Mode. Scroll down, and tap Turn On Low Power Mode. 6. Optimize Apple Watch Charging The Apple Watch Optimized Battery Charging feature uses on-device machine learning to discover your charging habits over time along with your daily usage to either charge the Watch to an optimized level or charge it to full in order to improve the lifespan of your Watch battery. This will slow down the wear on your Watch battery to improve its lifespan by reducing the time your Apple Watch spends fully charged. When turned on, your watch delays charging past 80% in certain situations, so that the battery level remains between 75-80%. Optimised Battery Charging is only activated when your watch predicts it will be connected to a charger for an extended period of time, and still aims to ensure your Apple Watch is fully charged when removed from the charger. If, for example, you mostly leave your Watch on charge overnight, Optimised Battery Charging will slow down the charging to make it more efficient over the period you are usually asleep, while still making sure that the battery is full and ready for your daytime usage by the time you wake up.",

    "description": "Macworld Here at Macworld we‚Äôre extremely fond of Apple‚Äôs AirTag, which we consider by far the best Bluetooth tracker for an iPhone or Mac user. However, one complaint raised in our AirTag review was that it doesn‚Äôt have a hole, which means you‚Äôre forced in most situations to buy an accessory to put it in. Want to attach it to your keys? You need to buy a special key ring. Want to attach it to your luggage? Special luggage label. An ecosystem has quickly sprung up offering straps, loops, pet tags, cases and holders for AirTag owners. But which ones are worth buying? We‚Äôve been testing out all the AirTags accessories we can get our hands on, so we can help you find the best AirTag holder for your needs from key rings, luggage tags, wallets and more. Best AirTag Key Rings Apple AirTag FineWoven Key Ring Pros Made by Apple Cons Fabric can scuff Price When Reviewed: $35 Best Prices Today: $25 at Amazon$32.99 at Best Buy There are cheaper alternatives, but this is the classic AirTag key ring‚Äîreplacing the previous Apple Leather Key Ring, now that Apple has gone fully vegan in honor of its legendary co-founder Steve Jobs. It‚Äôs light, attractive and reassuringly well-made. It‚Äôs easy to put the AirTag inside, but the metal popper won‚Äôt let it escape. And we love the large, chunky (but quite flat) ring, although we‚Äôd recommend testing it out in a shop if you‚Äôre planning on attaching car keys with a small aperture. This reviewer‚Äôs Nissan and Skoda keys were both a tight fit. The fabric covering protects the AirTag‚Äôs edge from drop damage but leaves most of its chassis, both front and back, open to the elements and liable to scuff a little‚Äîa complaint publicly made about Apple‚Äôs FineWoven iPhone cases. We think this is worth it for the pleasing look, and scuffing is both inevitable and minor, but if you want total protection you‚Äôll need to look elsewhere. It‚Äôs available in five colors: Black, Coral, Taupe, Mulberry and Pacific Blue‚ÄìDavid Price Belkin Secure Holder with Wire Cable for AirTag Pros Feels more secure than Apple ring Cons Plastic feel Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $13.99 at Amazon$19.95 at Apple Belkin‚Äôs Secure Holder is made of hard plastic, which gives it more of a budget feel, but it‚Äôs reassuringly robust, and looks tough with its wire cable that includes a hex key to lock the AirTag in place. As with Apple‚Äôs key ring, both faces of the AirTag are left exposed, but the plastic surround sticks out more and thus provides more drop protection. It‚Äôs available in white or black.‚ÄìDavid Price OtterBox Rugged Case for AirTag Pros Super protective Cons Larger than most Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $12.99 at Amazon$19.95 at Apple$19.95 at Apple United States OtterBox is a company known for its ultra-protective phone cases, and its Rugged Case for AirTag continues this tradition, as its name suggests. The protective perimeter is increased to allow for larger bumps and mishaps than most AirTag key rings. OtterBox also has a Rugged Passport Series of the Rugged Case that is styled with the coordinates of iconic cities, such as New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, as well as a large range of other AirTag cases and key rings.‚ÄìSimon Jary Nomad AirTag Keyrings Pros Range of AirTag keychain options Price When Reviewed: From $15 Best Prices Today: $15 at Nomad Available in black and white, the Nomad Rugged Keychain is built with a polycarbonate frame and TPU overmold, and ships with two enclosure options: a closed back option and an open speaker option. It is rated IP66 for water and dust resistance. With a Rustic Brown option, the Nomad Leather Keychain carries your AirTag in a good-looking, thermoformed, American Horween Leather holder. Over time, the raw, vegetable-tanned leather will patina to create a unique lived-in look. Adding a third available Natural (tan) color, the Nomad Leather Loop for AirTag is a Horween leather loop that attaches to your AirTag with a powerful 3M adhesive. The AirTag battery, however, remains easily accessible for replacement.‚ÄìSimon Jary OtterBox Core Series Case for AirTag Pros Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $14.22 at Amazon The OtterBox Core Series Case is the most sustainable AirTag key ring‚Äîmade from a FSC-certified recycled and recyclable material. Its speckled looks shows off an authentic recycled appearance.‚ÄìSimon Jary Orbitkey Leather Holder for AirTag Pros Leather Cons Covers one side Slight wobble Price When Reviewed: $39.90 Best Prices Today: $39.90 at Orbitkey Orbitkey‚Äòs leather offering is well worth your consideration. It costs roughly the same as Apple‚Äôs non-leather key ring but it has a nice-looking design and a couple of advantages up its sleeve. One is the slenderness of the ring itself. Whereas Apple‚Äôs broad, flat ring can be awkward for attaching car keys with a narrow aperture, this will fit into holes of the smallest dimensions. The second advantage lies in the innovative way keys are attached: an initially baffling locking system that, once mastered, is far quicker and easier (and far less painful) than prising apart the traditional two-layer ring with your fingernails. The only real quibble is that the leather fob is quite a lot bigger than the AirTag itself. It has more space than it needs and wobbles around slightly inside the pocket. The key ring thus takes up more room in your pocket than it needs to. This does also give the AirTag far more protection than Apple‚Äôs version. It‚Äôs less likely to get scuffed than with the other key rings we tried out. If the price tag puts you off, Orbitkey also makes a much cheaper Slim Case with a similar locking system.‚ÄìDavid Price ElevationLab TagVault: Keychain Pros Waterproof Cons Reduces volume of AirTag sounds Price When Reviewed: $12.95 (single); $39.95 (4 pack) Best Prices Today: $12.95 at ElevationLab$37.95 at Amazon Elevation Lab‚Äôs¬†TagVault: Keychain claims that it is fully waterproof. This rugged case has a gasket that prevents water intrusion while passing through ultra-wideband and Bluetooth signals and allowing about two-thirds of the AirTag‚Äôs sound volume. It has an integral loop for a keychain ring and comes with a simple but robust one.‚ÄìGlenn Fleishman Read our full TagVault: Keychain review Caseology Vault Pros Rugged Karabiner attachment Cons Larger than most Price When Reviewed: $13.99 Best Prices Today: $14.69 at Amazon$14.99 at Walmart How about a properly rugged key ring accessory for your AirTag? The Caseology Vault is made from military-grade thermoplastic polyurethane, with a nicely grippy sandstone finish that makes it less prone to drops. Like the Olixar Silicone it features a karabiner attachment. This is removable, which makes the Vault a versatile accessory. It‚Äôs just as happy tracking rucksacks as keys.‚ÄìDavid Price Best AirTag luggage tags Apple AirTag Loop Pros Made by Apple Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: $11.37 at Amazon$29 at Apple$29 at Best Buy Apple‚Äôs AirTag Loop is made of polyurethane and feels and looks smart, with two of the color options (Electric Orange and Sunflower) particularly bright and cheerful. This will also help you to spot your suitcase on the conveyor belt. The AirTag clips in using a metal clasp that‚Äôs easy to use and secure; you then put the strap around your luggage‚Äôs handle and loop the head part back through the slit in the tail. It looks slightly delicate at first glance‚Äìthe strap gets quite thin at a certain point‚Äìbut proved resistant to moderate tugging and should be fine under non-military usage conditions. Like Apple‚Äôs key ring, it protects the edges of the AirTag but not the center of its two faces, so expect some scuffing.‚ÄìDavid Price Belkin Secure Holder with Strap for AirTag Pros Robust Price When Reviewed: $12.95 Best Prices Today: $9.95 at Amazon$10.99 at Best Buy$12.95 at Apple Belkin‚Äôs Secure Holder is also available with a robust string for attaching it to the handle of a suitcase or bag. Like the strap-style loops provided by other manufacturers this threads back through itself to easily attach to your luggage. It‚Äôs available in white, black, blue, and pink with a matching string. Since the front and back sections, string and key ring are all detachable, you could create a multicolor accessory by mixing and matching more than one holder.‚ÄìDavid Price Casetify Customisable AirTag Holder Pros Colorful design options Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: $29 at Casetify The principal appeal of Casetify‚Äôs AirTag holder is the sheer range of designs and colors you can choose from. The ones pictured are, from left, Colorful Floral in Turquoise and Pink (with Peach background); Flowers for you by Matthew Langille (with Licorice); and Egg Tart with Mice (with Avocado). That last one is our favorite, but there are hundreds of options.‚ÄìDavid Price Best AirTag wallet and card holders It‚Äôs not just keys and luggage that‚Äôe easy to lose. Misplacing your wallet or card holder is a common occurance, and as long as you also haven‚Äôt lost your iPhone, finding one with an AirTag pocket is an easy solution. Artpaxy Wallet with AirTag Holder Pros Full bifold wallet with AirTag pocket Price When Reviewed: $29.99 Best Prices Today: $29.99 at Amazon This traditional-looking bifold wallet includes a front-mounted pocket for an Apple AirTag, and then does the usual wallet business with 13 card slots, two cash pockets and two ID windows. It also claims to include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) blocking to stop device scanning. Bosca Old Leather AirTag Seven Pocket ID Card Case Pros Slim and stylish AirTag wallet ID window Cons High International shipping fees Price When Reviewed: $85 Best Prices Today: $85 at Amazon$85 at Bosca This slim, stylish and minimalist hand-stained, vegetable-tanned leather card case comprises of a surprising seven small pockets to store your cards and cash, with a snap-close AirTag pocket on the front so you be able to loate it when it‚Äôs left in another jacket or trouser pocket‚Äîor left behind on the bar. Two or three of the pockets can be sued for bank notes or business cards, three are definitely for creadit or other types of card, and there‚Äôs a clear ID card window on the side opposite the AirTag. It‚Äôs available in three colours: Saddle (tan), Dark Brown and Black. Customers outside the U.S. will encounter quite stiff customs and shipping charges. Bazza AirTag Card Wallet Pros Colorful, fun AirTag card wallet Cons Feels a little plasticky Price When Reviewed: $22.99 Best Prices Today: $22.99 at Bazza This super-lightweight card wallet from Italy nicely nestles an AirTag in a selection of attractive and fun colors. It feels a little plasticky but is in fact made from sustainable, recyclable plant-based materials‚Äîthere‚Äôs not even any glue introduced into the manufacturing process. You can buy with the AirTag preinstalled, or fit in your own. The Bazza AirTag Card Wallet is available in pink, yellow, red, dark blue, light blue, white, black and green. Best AirTag pet collars ElevationLab TagVault: Pet Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $19.95 at Amazon$19.95 at Elevation Lab$30.25 at Walmart Electronics The TagVault: Pet uses screws with the small Torx T6 star-shaped drive for the portion that contains the AirTag and maintains the waterproof seal. These screws are piercing, self-tapping screws with a T10 slot. They‚Äôre used to hold a hard plastic anchor to provide further stability when attached to a pet collar that you provide‚Äìthough the case may be too big for smaller collars. The kit includes a steel Torx T6 L-shaped wrench with screw tips on both ends.‚ÄìGlenn Fleishman Read our full Elevation Lab TagVault: Pet review Best AirTag wallet holders ElevationLab TagVault: Wallet ‚Äì card holds AirTag Pros Securely holds AirTag Best Prices Today: $9.95 at Amazon$9.95 at ElevationLab Designed to hold an AirTag firmly in place in a wallet, it comes in two form factors: standard, 3.25 by 1.5 inches (83 by 38 mm), and compact, 2 by 1.5 inches (51 by 38 mm). Both are 0.05 inches (1.3 mm) thick. The more rectangular style works well in billfold slots; the squarer design in other parts of a wallet. With the AirTag exposed front and back, there‚Äôs no additional blocking beyond your wallet to block wireless signals for tracking and Precision Finding.‚ÄìGlenn Fleishman Read our full TagVault: Wallet review Nomad Card for AirTag Pros Securely holds AirTag Price When Reviewed: $20 Best Prices Today: $20 at Nomad Though it tapers to the edges, the Card for AirTag is 3.2 by 2.1 by 0.2 inches (54 by 82 by 5 mm) at its largest. The AirTag sits like a gem in its center, bulging slightly outwards to 0.3 inches (8 mm). A combination of soft and hard materials‚Äìpolycarbonate and TPU rubber‚Äìprovides both a nice outside feel and the rigidity and flexibility to insert an AirTag into the Card‚Äôs opening with a satisfying click.‚ÄìGlenn Fleishman Read our full Nomad Card for AirTag review Best AirTag mounts Olixar AirTags Adhesive Silicone Pocket Price When Reviewed: $11.99 Best Prices Today: $11.99 at Mobile Fun If the thing you want to track hasn‚Äôt got a handle you can loop the AirTags to, or a pocket you can slip one inside, then the next option is stickiness. These neat silicone pockets (which come in a pack of four) both protect the tracker from external damage, and give it a strong and reliable adhesive surface to cling to a jewel box, schoolbag or games console. Despite the unobtrusive look of the pocket the AirTag is still fairly obvious and easily slipped out, so this solution isn‚Äôt ideal for tracking down stolen property (unless there‚Äôs a more discreet internal surface you can stick it to). But for locating TV remotes‚Äìand for sheer versatility of application‚Äìthey‚Äôre indispensable.‚ÄìDavid Price Pelican Protector Sticker Mount Case for AirTag Devices Pros Strong adhesive connection Cons No built-in water resistance Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: $9.99 at Amazon$9.99 at Walmart Electronics$19.99 at Pelican Outdoor If you‚Äôre looking for an AirTag mount that can stick to almost any surface and allows for easy AirTag removal, the Pelican Protector fits the bill. It‚Äôs not discreet, it‚Äôs not rugged, and it doesn‚Äôt offer additional water protection, but as a mount, it works well. Pelican relies on 3M VHB adhesive for attachment, which creates a near-permanent mount that becomes stronger over time.‚ÄîGlenn Fleishman Read our full Pelican Protector Sticker Mount Case for AirTag Devices review Other types of AirTag cases and holders ElevationLab TagVault: Bike ‚Äì AirTag bike tracker Pros Built for bikes Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: $19.95 at Amazon$19.95 at Elevation Lab The TagVault: Bike is a lozenged-shaped plastic shell that houses the AirTag AirTag nestles inside its waterproof seal. It attaches to a bike via the bike‚Äôs water bottle mount, using longer screws to attach the bottle cage, or shorter screws if you don‚Äôt attach the cage. The case is a matte black, rendering it unobtrusive. Screwed in between a cage and the frame, a thief would first have to recognize it and then work hard to remove it quickly.‚ÄìGlenn Fleishman Read our full Elevation Lab TagVault: Bike review Pitaka PitaTag for Lighter Pros Never lose your lighter Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: $69.99 at Pitaka Lighters are easy to leave behind or lend to someone and forget to ask for it back. One solution is to hide an AirTag inside the lighter so you can track it down and get it back when this happens. This refillable lighter, crafted like the company‚Äôs iPhone cases, from military-grade aramid fiber and premium zinc alloy, looks like a card case rather than a cheap off-the-shelf lighter. Pitaka claims that the lighter‚Äôs blue pyramid-shaped flame is unaffected by wind, and that it features a built-in gravity lock pin to ensures that it can‚Äôt create a flame when upside down. Nomad Hydro Flask AirTag Tracker Pros Easily track your Hydro Flask Cons For specific models only Requires Medium Flex Boot Price When Reviewed: $15 Best Prices Today: $15 at Nomad Hydro Flask water bottles are popular but also surprisingly easy to leave behind after a run, bike ride, or visit to the park. The Nomad Hydro Flask Tracker is a hidden inner AirTag compartment in a slim TPU body that fits between your Hydro Flask and the Medium Flex Boot (accessory sold separately) and features It works with 32oz or 40oz Wide Mouth Hydro Flasks. If the Apple AirTag is just not right for you, check out these Bluetooth tracker recommended AirTag alternatives. What you can expect in an AirTag case Because the AirTag comes in a single variety, you don‚Äôt need to choose which kind to acquire.¬†Apple sells them¬†singly ($29) and in a four-pack ($99). Engraving is free. An AirTag regularly broadcasts 2.4GHz Bluetooth signals with an encrypted device ID for other Apple devices to pick up and relay along with those devices‚Äô locations. The 2.4GHz band penetrates solid objects well, but case designers need to be mindful of materials that have the potential to block the signal. In our survey of AirTag cases, we didn‚Äôt find a case so far that had that design problem. AirTags also use ultrawideband (USB) technology for Precision Finding, exclusive to Apple‚Äôs own Find My items. Precision Finding lets an iPhone with UWB identify the direction and distance within inches when it‚Äôs within about 15 to 30 feet (4.5 to 9 m). Consider to what use you may put an AirTag to determine the features you want: Purpose:¬†Cases exist in enough variety that you can find one designed as a luggage tag, another as a stylish keyring, and another to resist enormous amounts of damage. Figure out where you want to put the AirTag and match the case to it. Water resistance:¬†Many cases feature some degree of water resistance, some using the IP rating that defines precisely how much. If you‚Äôre using an AirTag outside or on a pet‚Äôs collar, you may want one with a high degree of resistance. When attaching to a bag or keyring, it may seem less important or not important at all. Ring, clip, loop, or carabiner:¬†Case makers offer many variants on attachments. Some include a simple hole to attach a keychain, while others incorporate a keychain as part of the product and may include a keyring. You can purchase multiple cases built into a carabiner, including one with a three-digit combination lock. You can also get a string or similar loop design, in which the case passes through a loop and pulls tight on a handle without a knot. Removable or adhesive:¬†You might want an AirTag case that‚Äôs easy to move about or attach and reattach. Other cases include adhesive for semi-permanent fixed attachment. Hidden for theft recovery:¬†Some cases are designed to hide an AirTag, making its presence less apparent and thus less likely to be discovered if stolen; others are obvious, such as in a keychain or luggage tag. Temper hideability with the knowledge that Apple‚Äôs anti-stalking features built into AirTag tech makes them discoverable to criminals with a smartphone.Shows the front:¬†Conversely, some cases show off an AirTag, revealing its front where you might have had added custom engraving from Apple with an emoji or text. You might want to see that engraving to differentiate among AirTags you own. Cost:¬†Cases generally cost from about $20 to $35‚Äîaround the price of a single AirTag. However, there are outliers below $10 and above $40. It‚Äôs all about the function, ruggedness, and complexity of purpose. Some charge extra for style. How we test AirTag case features For each kind of case, we rated them based on specific features around which they were designed. These include: Easy to insert the AirTag for secure retention:¬†Every case has a slightly different approach to getting an AirTag inside. Some cases have an elaborate locking procedure or require removing and restoring four tiny screws to preserve a waterproof seal. Others are simple as sliding the tag into a holding or popping it into a rubber ring. Attaches securely for attachable cases:¬†We tested cases that market themselves as attachable at how well they succeed at that task. Cases may come with or be part of a keyring, carabiner, wrist strip, or pet collar, or may have an adhesive to stick on to objects, like the inside of luggage. Access for battery replacement:¬†Apple expects an AirTag battery to last for about a year in everyday usage, which it defines as one case of Precision Finding and four tones played per day. A case should allow access that isn‚Äôt maddening for replacing the battery every several months to a year. Robust against bumps and bangs:¬†Only a few kinds of cases can avoid the wear and tear of bumping against other objects. Most need to be constructed with that in mind. For cases exposed to other surfaces, we look at whether the materials and build quality give confidence in them provide lasting value. Blocks access to remove:¬†A handful of cases provide a security element intended to prevent access to an AirTag without excessive force‚Äîthe AirTag would have to be destroyed to remove it. We rate these cases on whether they seem able to prevent or deter everything but destruction.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
