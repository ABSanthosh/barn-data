    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2826056/the-ipad-pros-bezels-could-be-getting-even-thinner.html",
    "description": "Macworld While the iPad Pro may have gotten slimmer over the years, one thing hasn’t changed much since its most recent redesign: the bezels. While they’re not exactly large, the bezels have basically stayed the same since Apple dumped the home button in 2018. But that could be changing—recent reports indicate that Apple is working on implementing iPad Pro display technology that could result in slimmer bezels and an even smaller footprint. The Elec reports that Apple is considering LX Semicon’s display driver IC (DDI) that uses LG Innotek’s chip on film (CoF). The CoF attaches the DDI to display panels through heat compression on film, which delivers the DDI’s data to the display panel. This implementation allows for tighter hardware integration, which could then allow for smaller bezels and more usable screen real estate without having to make the iPad itself bigger. The current iPad Pro uses Samsung System LSI’s DDI. The Elec notes that LX Semicon is seeing increased competition and Apple is working to diversify its supply chain, so LX Semicon may be very accommodating to make this deal work. The report does not clarify when this new technology will be implemented in the iPad Pro. The current M4 iPad Pro was released in May 2024, and reports have stated that the next iPad Pro may be available at the end of this year or in early 2026. So if Apple wants to implement this new DDI for the upcoming cycle, it needs to make a decision on it soon, since production would start in the next few months, so this technology is likely to debut with the M6 or M7 in 2026.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2599594/m5-ipad-pro-specs-features-design-release.html",
    "description": "Macworld While the iPad update schedule is somewhat unpredictable, Apple has established an 18-month cycle with the iPad Pro, and the current M4 iPad Pro was released in May 2024. Several reports state that Apple is scheduled to release an M5 iPad Pro in the fall, which would be right on schedule. That means we’re going to start seeing more reports about the new iPad Pro as the release date approaches. This article keeps track of all the rumors so you can keep up with what’s going on and make a proper decision if you’re in the market for a new iPad Pro. Updated June 24, 2025: A report states that Apple is considering new technology that would allow for smaller bezels on the iPad Pro, but it is unclear if this would be ready for the M5 iPad Pro. M5 iPad Pro: When will the new iPad Pro be released? The M5 iPad Pro is expected to arrive in September 2025 or later in the year On March 31, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the M5 iPad Pro is on schedule to ship in the second half of the year. In January 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the M5 iPad Pro won’t ship until late 2025 or early 2026. In December 2024, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the M5 iPad Pro will “enter mass production” in the second half of 2025. In April 2025, Gurman reported that iOS 19 will be ready “around the time new iPad Pros with M5 chips are likely to be ready.” iOS 19 is expected to be revealed at WWDC25 in June and be released in the fall. Here’s when the past five iPad Pro models have launched: M4 iPad Pro: May 2024 iPad Pro (6th gen): October 2022 iPad Pro (5th gen): April 2021 iPad Pro (4th gen): March 2020 iPad Pro (3rd gen): October 2018 M5 iPad Pro: How much will the new iPad Pro cost? Prices are likely to stay the same, starting at $999/£999 (11-inch) and $1,299/£1,299 (13-inch), but… With the M5 iPad Pro, Apple increased the price by $100/£100 across the different storage configurations. (Apple redefined the M5 iPad Pro base model with 256GB of storage, instead of 128GB that was in the M4 iPad Pro. When comparing prices, we start with the 256GB models.) Apple rarely increases prices two years in a row, but there are ongoing talks by the Trump administration in the U.S. of implementing tariffs on chips not made in the U.S. Apple’s M5 chip is made in Taiwan by TSMC, and could be subjected to a tariff. Should it go into effect, it could raise the price of the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. The M4 iPad Pro’s 12MP camera with a LiDAR scanner will carry over to the M5 iPad Pro.Brady Snyder / Foundry M5 iPad Pro tech specs: What upgrades will the new iPad Pro have? An M5 chip That’s about it On March 31, Mark Gurman reported that the M5 iPad Pro will be a “chip and ship” product. That means it will get the new M5 chip and no other new features. The M4 iPad Pro from 2024 had several major upgrades to components and features that don’t typically change from generation to generation, including: New OLED displays An option for nano-texture glass ($100/£100) Moving the front-facing camera to the longer side Upgrade to the main camera to 12MP with True Tone flash and a LiDAR scanner Eliminating the 128GB storage option and setting the base level to 256GB Those features aren’t expected to change with the M5 iPad Pro, so the only major component to change will be the chip from the M4 to the M5. Apple’s new C1 modem is unlikely to make an appearance until a model with mmWave arrives, likely in 2026. The Elec reports that Apple is considering LX Semicon’s display driver IC (DDI) that uses LG Innotek’s chip on film (CoF). This implementation allows for tighter hardware integration, which could then allow for smaller bezels and more usable screen without having to make the iPad itself bigger. We’ll keep updating this article as more information becomes available. Until then, you should check out our best iPad Pro deals to see if you can bag yourself a bargain on the current range.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
