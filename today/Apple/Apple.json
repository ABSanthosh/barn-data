Here's what the rumor mill thinks is coming.Apple is expected to debut an ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim in 2025.The long-rumored iPhone 17 Air, or iPhone 17 Slim as it's sometimes called, is set to launch alongside the standard iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. It will, however, replace the Plus variant of the iPhone, which hasn't seen significant popularity with end consumers.Just as the iPhone 14 Plus replaced the iPhone 13 mini in 2022, the iPhone 17 Air will appear in place of the Plus model for 2025.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Apple has planted its own flag in the streaming wars with Apple TV+, its in-house streaming service that focuses almost entirely on original programming rather than an extensive library of existing TV shows or movies. This guide will list all the Apple TV+ content you can watch today, divided into episodic shows or series and movies. There’s also a ton of new content in the works for Apple’s $9.99-a-month service. If you want to know what’s on the way, check out our list of upcoming Apple TV+ shows and movies. Updated April 25, 2025: Family-friendly series WondLa enters its second season, and Jane enters its third. Mentioned IN THIS story Apple TV 4K (2022, 3.

You can subscribe to Apple TV+ on Apple’s website here, or via the Apple TV app on your device. It costs $9.99/£8.99 a month, which you can cancel at any time (Read: How to cancel and Apple subscription). You can also opt for a one-year subscription for $99/£89, which essentially gives you two months free each year. Apple also offers various trials so that you can try out Apple TV+ before you subscribe. Take a look at our article explaining all the ways you can watch Apple TV for free, and the best Apple TV+ deals you can get. Students can get Apple TV+ for free with an already subsidized Apple Music subscription. Best shows on Apple TV+ There’s far too much content on Apple TV+ to sift through it all yourself. If you’re looking for something to watch and don’t know where to start, here are a few of the Macworld staff’s favorite shows, series, and movies.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2752247/the-apple-watch-is-boring-heres-how-apple-can-change-that.html",
    "description": "Macworld After a decade of development, the Apple Watch is basically the same as it was when it launched in 2015. Yes, the technology inside has gone through significant improvements its early days a dacade ago. Bigger, brighter displays. More powerful processors. An ever-growing suite of sensors to detect everything from your heart rate to incredibly fine movements. But outside, the Apple Watch still looks like the Apple Watch—more so than any other Apple product. From 10 feet away, you wouldn’t be able to tell if someone has a new Series 10 or an old Series 4. Perhaps that is by design, but with major new health technologies like blood glucose monitoring still years away and even the blood oxygen sensor “on pause” for over a year and counting, it’s hard to find something to look forward to in a new Apple Watch. Apple doesn’t need a new health sensor to make Apple Watch exciting again. It needs to take some risks. Shake up the shape The shape of the Apple Watch hasn’t changed in a decade. There have been slight variations in thickness, size, or curvature, but you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference without holding one next to another. Imagine if the first decade of the iPhone was like that! By the time iPhone X celebrated the tenth anniversary of Apple’s smartphone, the device was already drastically different from its first few years. So play with the shape, Apple. Give us a watch with flat sides—I loved the mockups people made of such a watch back when it was rumored that the Series 7 would sport such a look. It’s a shame this rumor was dead wrong, I love this design.Jon Prosser Or offer two kinds of Apple Watch, one rectangular and one—gasp—round! Android watches have been circular for years now without major compromises to features or battery life, surely Apple could make it happen with a few tweaks to the OS. And what happened to colors? Of course, silver and black are the most popular watch colors, but these days, rose gold is the only other option. Where did the colorful green, blue, and red offerings of the Series 7 go? Or the pink Series 9? Like the iMac, the fashion-forward Apple Watch is an opportunity for Apple to have some fun. Do something with bands There are a million Apple Watch bands out there, but they’re kind of…well…the same. The materials and colors might be different, but none of them add anything to the watch other than a little style. How about a new clasping mechanism that allows for a tiny amount of power and data transfer, just enough to power some tiny microelectronics and send a few kilobytes of data every now and then. Add a few developer frameworks, and both Apple and third-party developers could make smart bands. There have been various rumors over the years about a new mechanism, and one could imagine smart bands adding custom sensors for specific kinds of activities, or even a small, thin secondary screen that shows a “complication” of sorts. An Apple Watch that supports new “smart bands” would be a major reason to upgrade—more than yet another health sensor, really. Heck, I would buy a smart band that just had a button on the wrist side that I could set to one of a dozen different functions just like the Action Button on the iPhone and Apple Watch Ultra. Software, software, software Obviously there’s a lot Apple can and should be doing with software on the Apple Watch, starting with making Siri great. Even before Apple Intelligence, the experience on the Apple Watch wasn’t as good as the one on our iPhone. Since none of the current Apple Watch models support Apple Intelligence, it’s only going to get worse. Apple needs to find a way to bring the new Siri to the Apple Watch. If the Siri models are too big to run entirely on the watch, the watch could simply work as a “speakerphone” for Siri on your iPhone most of the time. When I watch people use their Apple Watch, I’m struck by how much of the core interface goes completely unused. Control Center is just as bad on Apple Watch as it is on iPhone—so many people don’t know what it is or where it is, don’t know what it can do, and when you tell them, they struggle to actually access it. It’s taking a bunch of core iPhone (or Apple Watch) functions and deliberately stuffing them in a hidden and confusing menu, and as far as the average user is concerned, it might as well not be there. Then there’s the weird honeycomb app grid that’s like an annoying little game to find what you’re looking for (List View should really be the only option), the limited watch faces… with basic customization that still seems beyond the average user. Most people I see just stick with the defaults, maybe change the color, but have no idea what complications are or how they work at all. But all of these things—software that simultaneously does way too much and not enough, and whose best features are opaque to the average user—should be fixed on all existing Apple Watches. Maybe the shift to the new design with iOS 19 will spur Apple to rethink watchOS 12 as a turning point for a rethink of the Apple Watch interface. But new software only goes so far. It’s a new direction for hardware that’s needed to really make Apple Watch exciting again. Apple seems so laser-focused on the next big heath and fitness sensor that it seems to be ignoring all the other ways it could change up the Apple Watch line—a little fun and some outside-the-box thinking.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
