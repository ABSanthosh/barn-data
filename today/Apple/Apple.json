These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today.

    "description": "Macworld If you‚Äôve got a to-do list this weekend, we‚Äôve got one more item for it: update your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. An update was released this week that patches a vulnerability first spotted way back in December 2023. According to Apple‚Äôs release notes, the fix affects iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2, as well as Safari 18 for macOS Ventura and macOS Sonoma users. The release notes say the updates include unknown bug fixes, but the big reason to update is a single security update across all devices: Impact: Maliciously crafted web content may be able to break out of Web Content sandbox. This is a supplementary fix for an attack that was blocked in iOS 17.2. (Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.) Description: An out-of-bounds write issue was addressed with improved checks to prevent unauthorized actions. WebKit Bugzilla: 285858 CVE-2025-24201: Apple Apple is credited with discovering the flaw, which was initially patched on December 11, 2023, with iOS 17.2 and macOS Sonoma 14.2. It‚Äôs unclear which WebKit patch fixed the original vulnerability. So far this year, Apple has fixed three zero-days, which are defined as flaws that were previously unknown. While Apple‚Äôs language implies this threat was used in targeted attacks, you should definitely update your devices if you haven‚Äôt already.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2630712/iphone-usb-c-charging-display-storage-ethernet-controller.html",
    "description": "Macworld It took the iPhone an eternity to strike Lightning in favor of the universal USB-C port. Now that it‚Äôs here on all models, including the low-end 16e, many users still limit its use to charging, overlooking the slew of other advantages it offers over Lightning. If you‚Äôve got an iPhone 15 or 16 model, you can expand the USB-C port‚Äôs functionality beyond battery fill-ups, and we‚Äôve got a few ideas to share. 1. Charge another device Rival companies, like Samsung, have long supported reverse wireless charging, letting users turn their smartphones into portable Qi pads. However, it‚Äôs not all that practical, forcing users to flip over their phones and rendering both unusable. With the iPhone 15 and newer models, Apple introduced its own version that works via the USB-C port. Your iPhone can now deliver up to 4.5W of power, letting you charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, or even a friend‚Äôs Android phone. To do so, simply plug your USB-C cable into the iPhone and the other end into the USB-C port on the other device. 2. Increase your storage Even with 128 GB as the standard, we‚Äôve probably all come across the iPhone‚Äôs full storage alert. While data stored in iCloud can easily be offloaded from the local memory, not all users trust cloud storage. Fortunately, the iPhone 15 and 16 support a wide range of external storage devices, including USB sticks and hard drives. This makes it easy to free up space by moving large files to a separate drive. To get started, connect a compatible flash drive to your iPhone using its USB-C port. You can then view, manage, and transfer data using the built-in Files app. One of the solid options out there is this tiny Samsung Type-C Flash Drive, which supports regular file transfers and real-time ProRes video storage. As a Pro exclusive, those with the highest-end iPhone 15 and 16 models can directly record ProRes video to a compatible external storage device. Given the considerable size of raw footage, being able to write the data directly onto a separate device can help you shoot for longer periods and avoid filling up your iPhone‚Äôs memory. Your iPhone‚Äôs USB-C cable can do more than just charge your iPhone.Foundry 3. Connect a keyboard While iPads and Macs are better suited for long-form typing, iPhones‚Äîespecially the near-7-inch Plus and Pro Max models‚Äîcan still handle productivity tasks effectively. To make the most of the relatively small screen, though, you may want to pair it with a dedicated keyboard. Fortunately, iOS natively supports this through the USB-C port. Most standard keyboards should work with your iPhone just fine. Or if you want to always have a keyboard with you, you can opt for a Clicks case, which connects to your USB-C port so it‚Äôs always ready for a text or email. 4. Amplify your microphone In the era of TikTok, everyone is a content creator, so a high-quality microphone is an essential tool. Fortunately, your iPhone‚Äôs USB-C port can support a wide range of them, letting you pair your footage with crystal-clear high-quality audio. One reliable option is the Rode Wireless Micro, which utilizes your iPhone‚Äôs port while maintaining the convenience of wireless recording. 5. Add an SD card Photographers and videographers love the handy SD card slots on board the newest MacBook Pro and Mac Studio, but that convenience doesn‚Äôt extend to the device that does most of your shooting. Fortunately, that can be easily remedied with a wired SD card reader. While newer cameras generally support wireless photo transfers via their respective companion apps, the process tends to be slower than the wired alternative. Apple‚Äôs USB-C to SD Card Reader connects to your iPhone through its charging port and should work with all relevant SD cards. You can also use this same dongle with your Mac or iPad when editing on a larger screen. With the right cable, you can connect your iPhone to any display.Willis Lai / Foundry 6. Hook up an external display If you‚Äôre staying at a hotel that blocks wireless media casting, you may be able to mirror your iPhone‚Äôs screen to the TV using a wired solution. Apple‚Äôs USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter transforms your iPhone‚Äôs charging port into an HDMI connector, allowing you to watch 4K content on bigger displays using a regular HDMI cable. 7. Plug in a game controller Thanks to the A17 and A18 chips, the latest Pro-tier iPhones can run some AAA games. Notably, though, these titles typically need a controller, as touch controls don‚Äôt always offer the best gameplay if they‚Äôre available at all. While Sony‚Äôs DualSense controller supports Bluetooth pairing, opting for the wired mode using the iPhone‚Äôs USB-C port can minimize latency and enhance overall performance. 8. Connect to ethernet¬† Speaking of gaming, the iPhone 15 and 16 models fully support ethernet dongles, allowing for faster download and upload speeds. While Wi-Fi and 5G are sufficient for most users, Ethernet can come in handy when seeking an even more dependable connection. Belkin‚Äôs USB-C to Ethernet Adapter is one of the solid options that is guaranteed to get the job done. 9. Do it all The biggest detriment of the iPhone is that there‚Äôs just one port, but a USB hub can give you much more. We recommend the Plugable 7-in-1 USB-C Hub Multiport Adapter, which will bring a headphone jack, USB-C charging, HDMI, an SD card reader, ethernet, and even a couple of USB-A ports for good measure. It‚Äôs not exactly small, but if you need to use several ports at once, there‚Äôs no substitute. Your iPhone‚Äôs USB-C port is a multi-purpose connector for displays, hard drives, and other accessories.Connor Jewiss / Foundry One port, many possibilities While some of these functionalities were previously possible with Lightning iPhones, the shift to USB-C has greatly expanded the port‚Äôs capabilities. You can now perform a wide range of desktop-class tasks right from your smartphone, thanks to tethered accessories. Perhaps the best part is that most USB-C accessories you‚Äôve been using with your iPad or Mac should work with your iPhone 15 or 16‚Äîeliminating the need for Lightning-to-USB-C dongles. Whether Apple will introduce new USB-C upgrades with the iPhone 17 remains to be seen.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
