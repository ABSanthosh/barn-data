While we’d never forget where the big desktop charger is situated, the smaller and more portable chargers have a frustrating habit of disappearing… “Can I borrow your charger for a minute?” is the plaintive plea that most charger owners will hear every now and again or far too frequently in a large office or family. That minute can stretch far enough to the point where when you next need to charge your phone or laptop you suddenly find it’s not where it should be—maybe your colleague or family member didn’t even ask you and just took it “for a minute”. Short of taping an AirTag onto your charger you have little option but to go hunt the office or house power sockets for it. Or maybe you left it in a suitcase that has gone missing. Accessory maker Twelve South has a cunning product that could make that hunt all the easier. Its PlugBug With Find My charger has a locator built into it. The locator is hidden away in a back compartment, so looks better than a sleek charger with an AirTag strapped on. It works just like an AirTag, and you set it up the same way and check for it in the Find My app’s Items section. You can make it sound an alert and all the other features available to Find My app items. Like the AirTag it requires a replaceable battery—one is included—that is easy to swap out when it runs out in a couple of years. Not just a big AirTag The principal purpose of the PlugBug is as a USB-C wall charger, and it comes in two models. Twelve South The PlugBug 50 has two USB-C ports, each rated at 50W. Use both at the same time and one will charge at 30W and the other at 20W. 50W is powerful enough to charge a MacBook Air. MacBook Pro owners would be better served with the more powerful 120 model. The PlugBug 120 has four USB-C ports, each rated at 120W. Use all four at the same time and they will charge at 1x 50W, two at 25W and the last one at 20W, or one 50W, two 20W and one 25W. Three might configure as 65/35/20W, and two at 70/30W. The charger detects dynamically delivers the right amount of fast charging power to each device being charged so you don’t have to worry about which port to connect each device to. Twelve South Design The PlugBug With Find My is long but thin so is especially suitable in those hotel rooms with power sockets tucked into hard-to-reach places behind desks or nightstands. It features a fetching red section that makes it visually easy to spot, too—which could come in handy when you try to distinguish it in a busy café or airport environment. While the PlugBug is a more than capable home charger, it is especially useful on your travels. The U.S. model has folding prongs for extra travel slimness. The PlugBug 50 measures 3.3 x 1.9 x 0.9 inches (8,3 x 4.9 x 2.2cm), and weighs 3.9oz (110g). The PlugBug 120 measures 4.1 x 2.4 x 1.2 inches (10.4 x 6 x 3.1cm), and weighs 8.8oz (250g). Twelve South The U.K. and E.U. versions ship with plugs attachments for both regions. The U.S. model features just the foldable North American prongs. Apple sells an exclusive Twelve South PlugBug Travel Set, which includes interchangeable international adapters for U.S., U.K., E.U., AU, KR and CN and a travel case, for both the 2-port and 4-port models ($79.95 and $129.95). Price In the U.S. the PlugBug 50 costs $69.99 and the PlugBug 120 is priced at $119.99, direct from Twelve South or via Amazon. See also the value-for-money Travel Set sold exclusively through the Apple Store. In Canada the two models are priced C$99.99 and C$169.99. In the U.K. its £69.99 and £119.99. And in the E.U. it’s 79,99 and 139,99 Euros. For more USB-C charging options check out our recommendations for the best iPhone chargers and best MacBook chargers. Verdict We thought we’d seen it all from the wide range of USB-C chargers but the powerful Twelve South PlugBug With Find Me is a great travel charger with a built-in locator to give you peace of mind that you should never lose your trusty charger again. It won’t stop you forgetting it and leaving it at home only to slam into your thoughts as your reach the airport or hotel, but at least you’ll know exactly where it is.",

    "description": "Macworld With the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, Apple offers standard configurations to make it easy to pick a laptop. They seem straightforward, but if you start to think about all the things you do on a Mac–whether you’re a student or a professional–you can start to wonder about which model to choose and maybe even find it difficult to decide. It’s a decision you don’t want to take lightly. You’re investing a considerable amount of money, and you don’t want to end up with a Mac that isn’t up to the task or a Mac that has more than you need. This guide was created to help shoppers figure out what to look for when buying a MacBook. We’ll cover the main components you need to consider: the CPU, the GPU, the amount of unified memory (RAM), the SSD, the display, the battery, and the ports. We’ll go over what your use case may be, and which component configurations would work best to help you get the most bang for your buck. The M System on a Chip overview: CPU, GPU, unified memory, SSD Let’s first start with a brief overview of the heart of every Mac: the M System on a Chip. It’s called a System on a Chip (SoC, or just “chip”) because, unlike past chips, it has more than just a CPU that does the main job of processing work. It also houses the graphics processors (GPUs), the unified memory (a combination of CPU and GPU RAM), and the SSD for file storage. In the past, these were all separate components. Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (M3, 256GB/16GB RAM, 2024) Price When Reviewed: $1,099 Best Prices Today: $1,024 at Amazon$1099 at B\u0026H$1099 at Best Buy Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (M3, 256GB/16GB RAM, 2024) Price When Reviewed: $1,299 Best Prices Today: $1,232.68 at Amazon$1299 at Best Buy A benefit of having all these components under one unified part is that it helps with performance and power efficiency. A drawback is that the user cannot upgrade the components after purchase. So, it’s even more important than before to carefully consider the specifications you need for what you do. CPU: Processing cores and how many you should get The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the main data processing component and is divided into processing cores. There are two types of cores, which Apple divides into performance and efficiency cores. Generally, the more cores in a CPU, the faster the processing speed. Apple currently offers five CPU models in its MacBooks: the M2, M3, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. The M2 and M3 has the lowest CPU core count, while the M4 Max has the highest. Which one is right for you? Let’s break it down based on tasks. M2 (8-core CPU with 4 performance and 4 efficiency cores): a good chip for everyday usage and can handle tasks in media editing apps. M3 (8-core CPU with 4 performance and 4 efficiency cores): you do the usual everyday tasks and work, which includes web browsing, light productivity apps (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Microsoft Office), media streaming, light gaming, easy media production (iMovie, GarageBand). M4 (10-core CPU with 4 performance and 6 efficiency cores): a lot like the M3, but a bit faster. M4 Pro (12- or 14-core CPU with 8 or 10 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores): you are regularly performing work that’s a bit more in-depth, such as complex Excel spreadsheets, multi-layer image editing, and creation in Photoshop or other graphics apps, production of video and audio shorts, databases, serious gaming. M4 Max (14- or 16-core CPU with 10 or 12 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores): you make a living as a media producer (Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Autodesk Maya, etc.), software developer, or any other work that requires multitasking and long hours with heavy work. Keep in mind that the base M4 is robust enough to handle the tasks that the M4 Max is designed for–it just takes longer to finish. If you only occasionally need to do those high-end jobs or you’re learning how to do them, you can live with the M4. The M3 and M3 chips offer different CPU, GPU, memory, and SSD configurations.Macworld.se GPU: Graphics processing power The GPU (graphics processing unit) is primarily used for rendering graphics and video on the screen. However, because GPUs offer parallel processing, a GPU can be used for other jobs, including AI, though the NPU (which is the same across all MacBooks) handles much of that workload. As with the CPU, the GPU has processing cores, and the more cores, the better the performance. Apple partners the increase of CPU cores along with the increase of GPU cores, so you don’t have to worry about, say, getting a M3 Pro chip with not enough CPU cores. Which one is right for you? Let’s break it down based on tasks. M2 (8-core CPU): capable of everyday tasks and casual games. M3 (8- or 10-core GPU): general tasks and everyday work, media streaming, easy media production, light gaming. M4 (10-core GPU): like the M3, general tasks and everyday work, media streaming, easy media production, light gaming. M4 Pro (16- or 20-core GPU): moderate to serious media production and gaming. M4 Max (32- or 40-core GPU): professional-level media production and hard-core gaming. Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) Price When Reviewed: $1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999 Best Prices Today: $1,549 at Amazon$1599 at Apple$1599 at B\u0026H Read our full Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro) Price When Reviewed: $1,999 | $2,399 Best Prices Today: $1,949 at Amazon$1999 at Apple$1999 at B\u0026H 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Max) Price When Reviewed: $3,199 Best Prices Today: $3,131.82 at Amazon$3199 at Apple$3199 at B\u0026H Unified memory: More RAM is always better Apple’s M chips use unified memory, which is where the chip reads and writes the data it is working on. It’s called “unified memory” because it’s used by both the CPU and GPU. It’s often referred to as RAM (random access memory). (Traditionally, “RAM” referred to the memory used by the CPU only, and the GPU used video RAM or VRAM). Each M-series chip comes with a standard configuration of unified memory. Here are the standard memory configurations Apple offers and where you may want to upgrade. 16GB: Good enough if you’re doing general productivity work, internet access media streaming, and easy media production. 24GB or 32GB: Nice amount for moderate media production, graphic work, podcasting, and gaming. Even for people who don’t do processor-intensive work, this is a better fit. Above 32GB: Professional-level graphics and media production, software development, hardcore gaming.  Remember, you can’t add RAM later, so make sure you consider spending a little more to customize your Mac at purchase. For example, the M3’s standard configuration is 16GB, but an option for 24GB is available for $200. It’s not cheap, but we recommend getting as much memory as you can afford. You can’t go wrong with opting for more memory than the standard configuration–it helps with performance. When Apple originally introduced the MacBook Air in March 2024, the standard configurations came with 8GB of RAM. When Apple introduced the M4 series of MacBook Pro in October 2024, it increased the base standard configuration to 16GB. The MacBook Air also got the boost without a price increase. So, now all MacBooks have a minimum of 16GB of RAM with some standard configurations that have more. SSD: file storage The Mac uses a solid-state drive (SSD) to store your files, apps, and other data. But in addition to data storage, the SSD can play a role in a Mac’s performance. The larger the capacity, the better the performance, mostly in instances that involve very large files. The higher the SSD capacity, the more NAND chips Apple uses. The more chips in use, the faster the performance, because the data can be accessed in parallel. For example, a 10GB file saved over four SSD chips is faster than the same file saved over two SSD chips. For smaller files used by most people, the difference is still there but isn’t noticeable. So there are two considerations for the SSD size: How much room you need, and how big are the files you create. With that in mind, here are some recommendations. 256GB: General productivity work, internet access media streaming, and easy media production. 512GB: Frequent work in iMovie, GarageBand, and other consumer-level media production apps. 1TB or more: Professional media production in apps such as Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Compressor, etc., software development, graphics. These considerations don’t involve photos that can accumulate quickly and take up a lot of space or the Photos app. If you like having local access to your photos, consider an external storage device. This also doesn’t consider cloud storage, such as iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, and other services. You don’t want to work directly on files in cloud storage because it’s not an efficient way to work. But cloud storage is a viable way to manage the space on an SSD–you can move files you won’t need immediately to the cloud. The MacBook Air (left) has an LED display,. while the MacBook Pro (right) has a Mini LED screen.Foundry Display: Looks are everything Apple uses different display technology for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The Air uses a tech that’s more affordable to implement, and it looks good, but it doesn’t look as good as the tech used for the MacBook Pro. Of course, you’ll pay more for the better Pro quality. Here are the two display technologies and who they are suited for. LED (MacBook Air): General-purpose use, but it can also handle consumer-level video and photo editing that you would do in apps such as Photos, Adobe Photoshop Elements, iMovie, etc. Also good for steaming videos from YouTube, Apple TV+, Netflix, etc., and moderate gaming. Mini LED (MacBook Pro): Serious video and photo editing and graphics work in pro-level apps (Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) where color and detail are important.

However, the different chips affect the duration because a chip that offers more processing prowess requires more battery power. There are also lots of considerations to think about regarding your specific use case. Here’s a look at how the different MacBooks compare and our recommendations. M3 MacBook Air: Apple cites the same battery life numbers for both the 13- and 15-inch models since both laptops have a 52.6-watt-hour battery (up to 18 hours), though you’ll probably get a little more battery with the 13-inch model due to the smaller screen. Either way, that’s the battery is long enough to last a whole day doing general-purpose work, access the internet, and work in Pages, Keynote, or Microsoft Office. You can even do light media work in iMovie or GarageBand, but heavier jobs will tax the battery. M4, M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a 72.4-watt-hour battery; the M4 can last up to 24 hours, while the M4 Pro/Max lasts up to 22/18 hours. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is rated at 100-watt-hours, and the M4 Pro can last up to 24 hours, while the M4 Max lasts 21 hours. Since the Pro laptops are bigger than the Air, the battery is bigger. If you’re doing production-type work while on location and you can’t plug in, the Pro is the one to get, even if it’s bigger/heavier than the Air. Ports: Making connections All of Apple’s MacBooks have Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. But that’s where the commonality ends. Here’s what you need to know. MacBook Air: Two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. That’s because the Air is meant to serve primarily as a travel buddy in situations when you aren’t connecting too many devices–maybe an external Thunderbolt/USB-C display for presentations, or a drive to save/transfer files. The Thunderbolt ports conform to the Thunderbolt 3 specification, and while its fast, it is the slowest of the MacBooks. MacBook Pro: As a mobile desktop device, the MacBook Pros have an HDMI port for connecting an external display and an SDXC Card slot for file transfers from a camera or other device. All MacBook Pro models have three Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. However, laptops with the M4 chip have the Thunderbolt 4 implementation, while the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips support Thunderbolt 5, which is the fastest specification. The MacBook Pro has an SDXC Card slot (far left) and HDMI port (far right), which are not on the MacBook Air.Foundry For more information, check out the following guides: Best MacBook 2024: Which MacBook should you buy?

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "A hidden feature in iOS 18.1 will automatically reboot a locked iPhone when it is asleep but hasn't been unlocked for a while, presumably as a security measure.The feature has been identified as an \"inactivity reboot,\" and is similar to a feature found on Macs. The Mac version, known as \"hibernation mode,\" saves the state of the device to disk when put to sleep, in case the power fails or the battery runs out before the user can return to the machine.By flushing the last state of the device, iPhone users are better protected from forensic searches by law enforcement or other entities. The change also makes it more difficult for anyone to break into the device using brute-force or other methods.The reboot timer is not reliant on charging or network functions, and is only tied to inactivity since the last unlock. This means the reboot will take place after a period of time, even if network connections are not maintained. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",
