    "description": "For me, one of the biggest issues with making the switch from a MacBook to a was the display aspect of it. MacBooks all have fairly great displays, especially on the MacBook Pro. However, finding a good display that pairs nicely with a Mac desktop always feels like a little bit of a challenge. You either have to go with Apple‚Äôs expensive options, or compromise significantly on the experience with a third party. Some common compromises include poor brightness, a lack of USB-C, or a lack of macOS integration. While the BenQ MA270U certainly isn‚Äôt a replacement, it performs excellently in all of the qualities that matter to me. more‚Ä¶",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2609783/the-new-improved-siri-might-take-even-longer-to-arrive.html",
    "description": "Macworld It‚Äôs been nearly three weeks since Apple released iOS 18.3 and we still don‚Äôt have the much-anticipated iOS 18.4 beta, which has long been expected to include the first look at the new and improved Siri. Well, according to a new report, we‚Äôre going to have to wait a bit longer to see any Siri-related progress. Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman dropped a bombshell on Friday: the Siri overhaul that Apple is working on has faced engineering problems and bugs, ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù Apple‚Äôs plans to issue a Siri overhaul this April with iOS 18.4. Hence, the new Siri may not arrive until May or later with the iOS 18.5 update. The major Siri overhaul involves a heavy dose of Apple Intelligence, which brings the ability to read what‚Äôs on your screen and plug into third-party apps. Apple is testing the new Siri internally and has found inconsistent performance and with the iOS 18.4 beta expected next week, Apple has to make decisions on its ability to deliver. Besides delaying Siri, another option, Gurman says, is to include the enhanced Siri in iOS 18.4 but have it turned off by default until 18.5. The Siri setback is a major one for Apple. The company is already paying catch-up with its AI implementation, and Siri will be at the core of the rumored smart home push, which will reportedly include a new iPad-like home hub, a new HomePod mini and Apple TV 4K, and other accessories. So a Siri delay could cause a domino effect that delays those products as well. From a user standpoint, however, we‚Äôve already been waiting for years for Siri to improve and be useful. What‚Äôs a few more months of waiting so that Apple gets it right?",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2609200/hades-2-review.html",
    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Cons Our Verdict Hades 2 is a lot of fun and a worthy successor to the original Hades, and it‚Äôll be nice treat for anyone that enjoys challenging arcade action. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$29.99 Best Prices Today: Hades 2 Retailer Price Steam $29.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Hades was a huge hit when it first appeared back in 2020, so a sequel was pretty much inevitable and Hades II was released as an Early Access game for Windows PCs almost a year ago. However, the game received a big update at the end of 2024 that added native support for Macs with Apple Silicon. The bad news is that the game requires macOS 12 or later and ‚Äì unlike the original Hades ‚Äì Hades 2 won‚Äôt run on Macs with Intel processors. Take a look at our favourite games on the Mac, see: Best Games for Mac. The first game cast you in the role of Zagreus, the son of Hades ‚Äì the god of death from Greek mythology ‚Äì as he attempted to escape from his father‚Äôs underworld and eventually reach the home of the gods on Mount Olympus. This time around it‚Äôs Zagreus‚Äô sister, Melino√´, who takes centre-stage, and faces an even greater challenge as she attempts to find and defeat Chronos, the ancient god who was father of Hades and is now waging war on Olympus itself. Foundry Hades was one of the few ‚Äòroguelike‚Äô games that have been released for the Mac in recent years, and Hades 2 follows that formula. Roguelike games don‚Äôt allow you save the game as you go along and then simply reload when you die, so each death means that you have to go right back to the beginning and start again. That can be frustrating, but you can find new weapons and learn new skills as you progress through the game, as well as earning ‚Äòboons‚Äô from the gods that make you more powerful. You also get to keep these skills and upgrades even after you die, so each time you start again you‚Äôre a little bit more powerful and should be able to fight further into the game and beat stronger enemies. And, if that gets too frustrating, or if you simply prefer to focus on the story that unfolds as you encounter the various gods of Olympus throughout the game, then there‚Äôs a God Mode that gives you a power boost right from the start, making it easier for you to plough through your enemies with fewer deaths to slow you down. But while Hades 2 follows the same basic formula as its predecessor, there are still some important differences that give this sequel its own distinct flavour. Even in Early Access, the developers at SuperGiant Games say that Hades 2 provides more areas to explore, and more gods and monsters for you to encounter than the previous game. More important is the fact that Melino√´ is a sorceress with powerful magical abilities, whereas Zagreus was essentially a hack-and-slash melee kind of guy. Melino√´ can use melee weapons such as daggers and axes, so hand-to-hand combat is still an option if that‚Äôs how you prefer to play, but she also has a wide range of magical abilities available too, casting long-range and area-of-effect spells against her enemies from a distance. Screenshot Foundry Melino√´ uses mana to power her spells, so resource management also becomes more important in this game as you now have a mana bar to keep an eye on, as well as the all-important health bar. This magical element also means that crafting is more important in Hades 2, as you can collect various herbs and minerals to upgrade your weapons and skills. I don‚Äôt really have the reflexes for sword-swinging melee combat, so I quickly felt more comfortable with the long-range magical skills of Melino√´, and the magic and crafting elements also add a touch of Diablo to the roguelike format as well. We would recommend a games controller, though ‚Äì casting spells is fairly straightforward as long as you have a two-button mouse, but the movement controls feel a little awkward when using a keyboard. Foundry Should you play Hades 2? Although Hades 2 is still in Early Access ‚Äì and looks likely to remain that way for most of 2025 ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty solid and stable, with no noticeable bugs during my time with the game. The hand-drawn graphics style looks great too, but the relatively simple 2D shaded graphics mean that you don‚Äôt need a particularly powerful Mac to run it and I was able to get 60fps using High graphics settings, even at 4K resolution using a MacBook Pro with M2 processor. Roguelike games don‚Äôt suit everyone, but even in Early Access Hades 2 is a lot of fun and a worthy successor to the original Hades, and it‚Äôll be nice treat for anyone that enjoys challenging arcade action.",

    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
