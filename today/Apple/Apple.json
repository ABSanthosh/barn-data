    "description": "Apple’s been toying around with the idea of a cheaper iPhone in the lineup for quite some time, though it’s never been a consistent thing. Obviously, there was the iPhone 5c back in 2013 as a cheaper offering compared to the iPhone 5s. It didn’t sell too well, but it was certainly its first venture into this market. Afterwards, there was the lineup, which had an average of 3 years between each refresh. Now, it’s looking like the ‘cheaper’ iPhone will become a regular part of the iPhone lineup, per recent reports. more…",

    "description": "Macworld If you’re stocking up for summer BBQs, road trip snacks, or just trying to cut down on weekly grocery bills, Sam’s Club can be a lifesaver. And right now, your first year of Club membership could be just $20 if you act fast. It’s the lowest price we’ve ever seen, but you only have through tomorrow, July 13, to grab this deal before it disappears. Think about it: Who wouldn’t want to buy mountains of snacks, enough toilet paper to build a fort (okay, maybe not), and TVs bigger than your average apartment window? Plus, you could score deals on everything from groceries to electronics, which means more money in your pocket for, well, whatever you want. But here’s the real kicker: A Sam’s Club membership also unlocks discounts on travel, entertainment, and movie tickets. So, basically, your $20 membership fee is working overtime to earn itself back in a dozen different ways. You have until July 13 at 11:59 p.m. PT to grab this $20 Sam’s Club membership deal (reg. $50). No coupon is needed to save 60%. 1-Year Sam’s Club Membership with Auto-RenewSee Deal StackSocial prices subject to change.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2846899/this-terminal-trick-brings-back-launchpad-on-macos-26.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple last month announced macOS 26 Tahoe, the next major update to the Mac operating system. While it comes with a lot of new features, including the Liquid Glass interface, Live Activities, and a powerful new Spotlight, the update also killed off a feature that has lived on the Mac for over a decade. With macOS 26, Apple replaced Launchpad with a new app launcher integrated with Spotlight. But if you’re like me and miss Launchpad, there’s a way to bring it back. For those unfamiliar, Launchpad on the Mac is essentially a “home screen” that shows all the apps you have installed, just like on the iPhone and iPad. It was introduced with OS X Lion in 2010 at a time when Apple wanted to bring more of the iPad experience to the Mac. While some users never got used to having Launchpad on their Mac, I always liked having a way to organize my apps the way I wanted. For instance, Launchpad lets me create multiple pages and place apps in folders, so I don’t need to remember the name of an app I rarely use; I just need to remember where it is in Launchpad. But macOS 26 has changed that, as the list of apps is now integrated into Spotlight, so you need to search for everything. While the new interface is certainly more minimalist, it doesn’t let users organize apps the way they want. The new Spotlight is so powerful that it replaces Launchpad on your Mac.Apple How to bring Launchpad back in macOS 26 Luckily, there’s a way to reverse this, at least for now. If you’re running the macOS 26 beta on your Mac and want Launchpad back, just follow these steps. A word of warning: Messing with commands in Terminal, especially the sudo (superuser do) command, is not something casual users should do, as it could cause issues to your machine and require a reinstallation of the OS. And we recommend backing up your files before installing a beta for the same reason. Open the Terminal app inside Applications \u003e Utilities. Write the following command and hit Return: sudo mkdir -p /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain Enter your Mac’s password and press Return (you must be logged into an admin account) Write the following command and hit Return: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain/SpotlightUI.plist SpotlightPlus -dict Enabled -bool false Reboot your Mac Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to use Launchpad again in macOS 26 beta. However, this command also brings back the old Spotlight experience without the enhancements introduced with macOS 26, such as clipboard history and integration with the Shortcuts app. If you want to revert to the new Spotlight (and consequently disable Launchpad), redo all the same steps above but enter the following command instead: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/FeatureFlags/Domain/SpotlightUI.plist SpotlightPlus -dict Enabled -bool true Keep in mind that while this trick works on macOS 26 beta 3, Apple might break it in future versions of macOS. macOS 26 will be released to the public this fall. A public beta is expected to be available in the next few days.",

These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
