    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2790350/after-google-ios-big-ai-reveals-my-iphone-has-never-felt-dumber.html",
    "description": "Macworld I can’t believe I’m about to state this, but I’m considering switching from iOS to Android. Not right now, but what I once considered an absurd notion is rapidly becoming a realistic possibility. While Apple may have an insurmountable lead in hardware, iPhones and Android phones are no longer on par with each other when it comes to AI and assistants, and the gap is only growing wider. At its annual I/O conference on Tuesday, Google didn’t just preview some niche AI gimmicks that look good in a demo; it initiated a computing revolution that Apple simply won’t be able to replicate anytime soon, if ever. Actions speak louder than words The first thing I noticed during the main I/O keynote was how confident the speakers were. Unlike Apple’s canned Apple Intelligence demo at last year’s WWDC, Google opted for live demos and presentations that only reflect its strong belief that everything just works. Many of the announced features were made available on the same day, while some others will follow as soon as this summer. Google didn’t (primarily, at least) display nonexistent concepts and mockups or pre-record the event. It likely didn’t make promises it can’t keep, either. If you have high AI hopes for WWDC25, I’d like to remind you that the latest rumors suggest Apple will ignore the elephant in the room, possibly focusing on the revolutionary new UI and other non-AI goods instead. I understand Apple’s tough position—given how last year’s AI vision crumbled before its eyes—but I’d like to think a corporation of that size could’ve acquired its way into building a functional product over the past 12 months. For the first time in as long as I can remember, Google is selling confidence and accountability while Apple is hiding behind glitzy smoke and mirrors. Google’s demos at IO showed the true power of AI.Foundry Apple’s tight grip will only suffocate innovation A few months ago, Apple added ChatGPT to Siri’s toolbox, letting users rely on OpenAI’s models for complex queries. While a welcome addition, it’s unintuitive to use. In many cases, you need to explicitly ask Apple’s virtual assistant to use ChatGPT, and any accidental taps on the screen will dismiss the entire conversation. Without ChatGPT, Siri is just a bare-bones voice command receiver that can set timers and, at best, fetch basic information from the web. Conversely, Google has built an in-house AI system that integrates fully into newer versions of Android. Gemini is evolving from a basic chatbot into an integral part of Google’s ecosystem. It can research and generate proper reports, video chat with you, and pull personal information from your Gmail, Drive, and other Google apps. Gemini is already light-years ahead of Siri—and it’s only getting better.Foundry Google also previewed Project Astra, which will let Gemini fully control your Android phone, thanks to its agentic capabilities. It’s similar to the revamped Siri with on-screen context awareness (that Apple is reportedly rebuilding from scratch), but much more powerful. While, yes, it’s still just a prototype, Google has seemingly delivered on last year’s promises. Despite it infamously killing and rebranding projects all the time, I actually believe its AI plans will materialize because it has been constantly shipping finished products to users. Unlike Apple, Google is also bringing some of its AI features to other platforms. For example, the Gemini app for iPhone now supports the live video chat feature for free. There are rumors that Apple will open up some of its on-device AI models to third-party app developers, but those will likely be limited to Writing Tools and Image Playground. So even if Google is willing to develop more advanced functionalities for iOS, Apple’s system restrictions would throttle them. Third-party developers can’t control the OS, so Google will never be able to build the same comprehensive tools for iPhones. Beyond the basics Google’s AI plan doesn’t strictly revolve around its Gemini chatbot delivering information. It’s creating a new computing experience powered by artificial intelligence. Google’s AI is coming to Search and Chrome to assist with web browsing in real time.  For example, Gemini will help users shop for unique products based on their personal preferences and even virtually try clothes on. Similarly, other Google AI tools can code interfaces based on text prompts, generate video clips from scratch, create music, translate live Meet conferences, and so on. Now, I see how dystopian this all can be, but with fair use, it will be an invaluable resource to students and professionals.  Meanwhile, what can Apple Intelligence do? Generate cartoons and proofread articles? While I appreciate Apple’s private, primarily on-device approach, most users care about the results, not the underlying infrastructure. Google’s Try It On mode will use AI to show how something will look before you buy it.Foundry The wrong path During I/O, Google shared its long-term vision for AI, which adds robotics and mixed-reality headsets to the equation. Down the road, the company plans to power machines using the knowledge its AI is gaining each day. It also demoed its upcoming smart glasses, which can mirror Android phone alerts, send texts, translate conversations in real time, scan surrounding objects, and much, much more.  While Apple prioritized the Vision Pro headset no one asked for, Google has been focusing its efforts on creating the sleek, practical device users actually need—a more powerful Ray-Ban Meta rival. Before long, Android users will be rocking stylish eyewear and barely using their smartphones in public. Meanwhile, iPhone users will likely be locked out of this futuristic experience because third-party accessories can’t read iOS notifications and interact with the system in the same way. Apple is running out of time iOS and Android launched as two contrasting platforms. At first, Apple boasted its stability, security, and private approach, while Google’s vision revolved around customization, ease of modding, and openness. Throughout the years, Apple and Google have been learning from each other’s strengths and applying the needed changes to appease their respective user bases.  Apple Intelligence had priomise but Apple has failed to deliver its most ambitious features.Foundry Recently, it seemed like the two operating systems were finally intersecting: iOS had become more personalizable, while Android deployed stricter guardrails and privacy measures. However, the perceived overlap only lasted for a moment—until the AI boom changed everything. The smartphone as we know it today seems to be fading away. AI companies are actively building integrations with other services, and it’s changing how we interact with technology. Mobile apps could become less relevant in the near future, as a universal chatbot would perform the needed tasks based on users’ text and voice prompts.  Google is slowly setting this new standard with Android, and if Apple can’t keep up with the times, the iPhone’s relevancy will face the same fate as so many Nokia and BlackBerry phones. And if Apple doesn’t act fast, Siri will be a distant memory.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple last updated the Mac Pro in 2023 when it was the last Mac to be outfitted with an M-series chip–three years after Apple started to use its own silicon in Macs. The Mac Pro may be on a longer update cycle than the other Macs because it’s an expensive machine with features that address the needs of a niche audience. But if you’re part of that audience, you’ll want to know when the next model will arrive, so we’ll be tracking the news and rumors about the Mac Pro. This article includes information about the potential updates to the Mac Pro, as well as offers a perspective on what those rumored updates mean to Apple’s Mac lineup. Mac Pro M4: Release date With no new Mac Pro appearing in 2024, despite the arrival of the M4 Max, it looks like we will be stuck with the M2 Ultra Mac Pro until 2025. The lengthy wait isn’t surprising. In an April 2024 report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman about Apple’s plans for its AI-enhanced M4 chip, he suggested that Apple would not update the Mac Pro until 2025. In June 2024, Gurman again reported that the Mac release schedule had not changed. The M4 Mac Pro is not expected until the second half of 2025. In August, Gurman reiterated that the M4 Mac Pro will be released in 2025. With WWDC25 in June, it seems like it would be an opportunity for Apple to update the Mac Pro. But no reports have been made of any hardware announcements during the keynote on June 9. Mac Pro M4: Processor With the long wait, you may think we might get an M5 Ultra Mac Pro, but it looks like we will see the M4 Ultra in June 2025. In October 2024, Gurman reported that Apple “continues to work on an M4 version of the Mac Pro.” In his April 2024 report, Gurman stated that the Mac Pro will be part of Apple’s AI focus and will be upgraded with an M4 with enhanced AI capabilities. Gurman did not offer any details on how those AI enhancements will be implemented or any other specifications about the M4. Since that report, Apple has unveiled the M4 chip, first in the iPad Pro, then in the iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro. In our Geekbench 6 tests of the M4 Max chip that arrived in October 2024 we found it to be faster than the M2 Ultra. Read: How Apple’s M4 chips dispelled all my fears about buying a new Mac. Apple also released the M3 Ultra Mac Studio, making it the fastest Mac in Apple’s lineup. If Apple wanted to use the M3 Ultra in the Mac Pro, it would’ve updated that Mac by now. While this is bad news for the M2 Ultra Mac Pro, it should mean great things for the M4 Ultra, which is what has been reported as the chip for the Mac Pro. We also know that it has an improved Neural Engine for AI features. Apple’s M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra chips are essentially two Max chips that work together, but there have been reports that Apple will be changing the processor’s architecture, so we could see higher performance than in previous Ultra chips. The Information reported in December 2024 that in the summer, Apple had canceled a “high-performance chip for Macs” to focus on the development of an AI server chip. As John Gruber pointed out, the timing of that Mac chip project suggests that the canceled chip was likely one that is dubbed an “Extreme” chip that would be faster than an Ultra. Based on this report, the Mac Pro will get Ultra chips for the foreseeable future. Mac Pro M4: Design and specs Gurman also reported that Apple wants to dramatically increase the maximum amount of unified memory in the high-end desktop M4 Macs to 512GB. The current limit on the M2 Ultra Mac Pro is 192GB. So, the M4 Ultra Mac Pro could support more than twice the memory as the current M2 Ultra Mac Pro. The Mac Pro will be equipped with Thunderbolt 5. When Apple released the M4 Pro/Mac MacBook Pro, it upgraded to Thunderbolt 5, so the Mac Pro will follow suit. Learn more about Thunderbolt 5. No other reports have been made about the inner workings of the upcoming Mac Pro. Because Apple wants to focus on AI, the Mac Pro could be marketed as an AI development workstation, so Apple could upgrade other components to accommodate these needs. The Mac mini had a redesign in 2024, resulting in a much smaller device. Mac Pro has had its design for 11 years, but no reports have been made about the design, and if Apple changes anything, it is very unlikely to make the Mac Pro smaller as this didn’t work out well last time. The next Mac Pro upgrade is expected to keep the same design, but the internal components will likely change, with the key one being an M4 Ultra upgrade.Foundry Mac Pro M4: Price Here are the prices for the current standard base configurations of the M2 Ultra Mac Pro for reference. Apple expects customers to configure their orders, so prices will vary from these base specifications. $6,999/£7,199/CA$8,999/AU$11,999 Mac Pro Tower: M2 Ultra, 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 64GB Unified Memory, 1TB SSD $7,499/£7,699/CA$9,599/AU$12,999 Mac Pro Rack: M2 Ultra, 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 64GB Unified Memory, 1TB SSD Pricing for the new Mac Pro has not been reported, though we expect pricing to possibly go up because of the U.S. tariffs situation–the components are made overseas. The price may be adapted to more recent exchange rates elsewhere. We predict that in the U.K. the price will be in line with the U.S. for example: £6,999 rather than £7,199.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
