    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "The best Apple deals: Huge savings on Macs, AirPods, iPhones, and more!",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/541154/apple-deals.html",
    "description": "Macworld Whether you’re looking to gift an Apple product or just pick one up for yourself, we’ve scoured the web for the best prices on everything from Macs to MacBooks, iPads to iPhones, Apple Watches to Apple TVs, and more. Apple rarely discounts its own products–even during its annual Black Friday shopping event, which runs from Black Friday to Cyber Monday it elects to give out gift cards rather than actual price reductions. However third-party retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy run sales all year long. So if you want a new Apple device right now, there are plenty of discounts worth grabbing. In this article, you’ll find the top discounts we’ve seen. Plus, for even more deals, we’ve linked to our dedicated deals round-ups for each product category. Apple does offer year-round discounts to students, including a Back To School event where further-education students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products (this giveaway will be running in the southern hemisphere between January to March). There’s also the Apple Refurbished Store where you can sometimes grab a bargain. Use the table of contents to jump to the best deals right now for the Apple product you want—including the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, iPad mini, and all the M4 Macs, which were announced this fall. The Amazon Spring Sale is taking place until March 28 and we are seeing some discounts on older Apple products. These generally represent only small savings on the newer models, so we would recommend buying the newer model if you can afford to. Looks out for Amazon Spring Sale deals below. Best AirPods deals Foundry New AirPods were announced by Apple in September 2024. We saw some deals on the AirPods 4 over Black Friday, and, at least in the U.S., those discounts appear to be continuing for now. Following the launch of new AirPods, the AirPods 2nd-gen and AirPods 3rd-gen were discontinued. You may therefore see deals on those older products until stock runs out, however, we recommend that instead of buying discounted AirPods 3, consider the even cheaper AirPods 4 without ANC, which starts at $129/£129. Apple also introduced a USB-C equipped AirPods Max in new colors and discontinued the older Lightning-equipped models. If you see the Lightning model at a good discount it’s worth buying. U.S. Amazon, AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case): $169 ($80 off, MSRP $249) Amazon, AirPods 4: $99.99 ($29 off, MSRP $129) Amazon, AirPods 4 with ANC: $149 ($30 off, MSRP $179) Amazon, AirPods Max (USB-C): $480 ($69 off, MSRP $549) U.K. Amazon, AirPods Max: £494 (£5 off, RRP £499) See our dedicated round-up of the best AirPods deals Best iPhone and accessory deals Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry In the U.S. specific iPhone deals are hard to come by apart from carrier offers for new signups and trade-ins. We recommend checking Verizon, AT\u0026T, and T-Mobile’s sites if you’re looking to change carriers or add a new line. Apple also offers trade-ins and carrier deals through its website. We also recommend that you look at our round-up of iPhone 14 deals as well as iPhone 15 deals for U.S. readers, and we also track where to get the best iPhone 16 deals in the U.S. In the U.K., we frequently see Apple-certified resellers discount unlocked iPhones. Look for money off at Amazon, Currys, and Very. We are recording all the best prices of iPhone 15 in the U.K. separately and we are tracking the best deals for the iPhone 16, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max separately. It is possible to find discounts on most iPhones in the UK, including older/discontinued handsets, including the following deals, but remember Apple has reduced pricing in the U.K. for the new range of handsets, so the discounts may not be as good as they look. KRCS, iPhone 16e (128GB): £593.01 (£5.99 off, RRP £599) Amazon, iPhone 16 (128GB): £739 (£60 off, RRP £799) Amazon, iPhone 16 Plus (128GB): £849 (£50 off, RRP £799) Argos, iPhone 16 Pro (128GB): £949 (£50 off, RRP £999) Amazon, iPhone 16 Pro Max (256GB): £1,129 (£70 off, RRP £1,199) Amazon, iPhone 15 (128GB): £639 (£60 off, RRP £699) Amazon, iPhone 15 Plus (128GB): £749 (£50 off, RRP £799) Amazon Spring Sale, iPhone 15 Pro Max (256 GB): £989 (RRP: £1,119).

    "description": "Macworld The tiny Mac Mini M4 Pro just dropped to its very best price over at Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. Now available for just $1,249 $1,199, this micro machine is $150 $200 off its usual $1,399. This is easily the most powerful mini PC you can get right now from Apple. We loved pretty much everything about it in our testing outside of its price, but this discount is a great step to alleviate those worries. Running on the latest M4 Pro chip with 24GB of memory and a spacious 512GB SSD, this mini monster can tackle any task you throw its way, from mundane browsing and Netflix watching to more difficult image and video editing. “Apple’s new smaller Mac mini gives up very little after being hit with a shrink ray, and the M4 processors deliver great performance at a reasonable price,” we wrote in our 4-star review. With an M4 chip, it’s also ready for Apple Intelligence, from writing tools to mail summaries and upcoming Siri upgrades, as well as macOS updates for many years to come. So, don’t miss out on this amazing discount for the M4 Pro Mac mini, the first time it’s dropped this low.. This is the best price for the M4 Pro Mac Mini so farBuy now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
