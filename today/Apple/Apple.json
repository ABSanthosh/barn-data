However, a refreshingly honest snippet of an upcoming wider interview showed exactly where Apple sees itself in the bigger picture.Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern sat down with Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi and SVP of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak, and she's shared a seven-minute snippet focused on AI before the larger interview is released. Much of what Federighi discussed on Apple Intelligence echoed what was seen in an earlier conversation with iJustine, but new details emerged once Joz weighed in.

Shortly after the keynote, Apple rolled out the first developer betas of iOS 26 and Xcode 26.Xcode is an application used by developers to create third-party applications for Apple platforms. As such, it includes operating system and device names, but it appears as though Apple accidentally included the name of an unreleased product with Xcode 26.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld While macOS 26 Tahoe is still months away from landing on our Macs, Apple is already gearing up for major changes in the next major version of macOS. After revealing that Tahoe will be the last version to support Intel Macs, Apple is also warning users that another long-standing feature will be deprecated in macOS 27. According to a post on X by user @stellafudge, Apple is giving users notice that the next major version of macOS, presumably version 27, will “no longer support AirPort Disk, or other Time Capsule disks, for Time Machine backups.” Apple discontinued AirPort and Time Capsule in 2018, but has supported the Apple Filing Protocol network protocol in macOS Mojave and subsequent versions of macOS. It’s possible that ending support signals a new Wi-Fi router is on the way. While there haven’t been any specific rumors to support the launch of a new AirPort, Apple is expected to use its own homegrown Wi-Fi chip in the iPhone 17 this fall and expand support to the Mac through 2026 and 2027.  With its own chip, Apple could build in support for the necessary bands and protocols to build a new router. Rumors also suggest that Apple could be combining the Wi-Fi chip with its C-series modem, which could bring the first MacBook with cellular connectivity.",

    "description": "Macworld The best way to ensure there’s absolutely no way to lose your backpack, even when traveling, is to get this HyperPack Pro. Why? Because it comes with built-in Find My compatibility. Usually available for $200, this backpack just dropped to its best price yet of $150, a massive 25 percent discount. This is a 22L backpack that can fit any MacBook up to and including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which means you’ll have a ton of space inside. Of course, it’s not just for your laptop, and it will actually even fit anything you need to carry. This travel-ready backpack is prepared for all your adventures, as it includes an RFID theft protective pocket for your wallet, as well as an extra hidden lumbar pocket. The zippers interlock, too, so there’s no way someone will unzip these when you’re not paying attention. The fact that this is a laptop with a built-in tracker is the best part, however. Instead of buying a separate tracker, the entire bag acts as an AirTag. It has an IPX4 water resistance and it will ping just like your AirTag does when you use the app, while also issuing an alert when it’s out of range. You can even replace the battery when needed. That’s a dream combo if you ask us. So, if you’re going to invest in a backpack for your summer travels, get this HyperPack Pro for $150 while it’s still on sale. This $50 off backpack will tell you when you forget itBuy now at Amazon",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
