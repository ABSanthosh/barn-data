    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2544289/intrepid-diy-project-turns-the-new-mac-mini-into-a-retro-power-mac-m4-cube.html",
    "description": "Macworld The M4 Mac mini might have earned plaudits for its pleasingly petite redesign, but one owner has decided to reverse that decision and set the machine up in a large clear case in the style of a Power Mac G4 Cube. Posted on Reddit (with disappointingly little accompanying explanation) by a friend of the DIYer, the project is simple but striking. The Mac mini has been placed in a thick plastic case which extends down below the device as a hollow stand, raising it up to more than twice its normal height. Less convenient on the desktop, perhaps, but cool-looking in a retro vibe. Reddit The case has one large cutout for the back ports and smaller individual cutouts for the ports at the front, so it seems perfectly usable. But commenters on the thread are less convinced about the thermal efficiency of the mod, because of the way the stand section of the case has been designed: there’s a nice big aperture at the back, but no openings in the side or front panels. As Apple explains on its Mac mini page, the machine takes in cool air from the front (through the vents in its base), then expels hot air out of the back. The way the modified “M4 Cube” is set up, therefore, would appear to inhibit one-half of its cooling operation. The iconic Power Mac G4 Cube.Apple Then again, the raised profile might counteract that problem. The stand means there’s open air below the Mac mini, in a way that wouldn’t ordinarily be the case when it’s placed on a desk; even if this air is circulated via the back only, this arrangement could still be as thermally efficient as normal use. At any rate, this isn’t a commercial product (at least not yet… perhaps the Reddit post is guerrilla marketing for a product that will launch in due course) so the only risk being taken is with the DIYer’s own Mac.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/352902/onyx-review-macos.html",
    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Excellent utility for sorting out accumulated system gunk and errors Amazing level of customization Reliable bug fixes and updates Cons Scheduling feature could use some refinement Intimidating to new users Our Verdict There’s a reason Onyx has been among the tools of choice for Mac techies for such a long time. It offers a great set of tools and an incredible level of customization. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Retailer Price Titanium Software (Donationware) Free View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Price When ReviewedFree Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Titanium Software (Donationware) Free View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket For more than 20 years, developer Joël Barrière (aka Titanium) has gotten it almost completely perfect, his OnyX donationware utility having been released without much marketing or fanfare, but drawing an ever-growing user community around it that has grown to love it, and for good reason. OnyX, which presently stands at version 4.7.1 as of this writing and requires macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later to install the current version, is one of the best utilities on the market because, Barrière, in writing and updating the application, has figured out the powerful underlying tools within the macOS operating system and provides easy access to them. See how Onyx compares to other Mac utilities in our collection of the Best Mac Cleaners. Once downloaded, installed, granted full disk access, and after the program is launched and an administrator password has been entered, you’re able to run powerful sets of customizable scripts to perform functions such as checking volume structures, getting low-level system specifications, repairing permissions, cleaning up system databases, and sorting out under-the-hood level system minutia in ways that have made OnyX an indispensable tool for every day and power users alike. Factor in an amazing level of customizability and it’s easy to access complex system functions such as security, login options, Display Calibrator, Keychain Access, the general maintenance script initiating, closing out open applications, and getting to work cleaning up system level errors that can accumulate over time. Screenshot Foundry All this from a ‘free’ app: OnyX is Donationware, with users asked to send along whatever they believe the program is worth. In as much as Barrière has worked to make a terrific utility, there’s some room for improvement. The Scheduling feature seems a bit vague and seems to only function around specific days, hours, and minutes as opposed to setting aside specific time periods for this, which felt a bit strange. Screenshot Foundry Some of Barrière’s users have complained that support is slow in getting back to them when they send along questions or concerns. This could be due to the fact that OnyX could be more of a side project due to being donationware–Barrière also focusing his efforts on other utilities as well, and this being the downside of functioning as a one-person enterprise. A formal tutorial or set of tutorial videos/an official OnyX tutorial channel on YouTube or another streaming service would also be beneficial. Yes, OnyX is excellent and offers an amazing number of options as to what it can do with your operating system, and the manual explains things well, but a series of introductory tutorials by the author (or a third party hired by the author) could help ease new users into OnyX, alleviate any trepidation they might feel, and show them how to confidently dive into using the program. Should you use OnyX? Despite its free price tag, OnyX has always been one of the best examples of donationware in the macOS universe, and Barrière has always offered a steady stream of updates and fixes with the feeling that he took the time to go through the newest fixes and changes sent out by Apple, definitively understood them, and incorporated them into the latest version of OnyX. The result comes across as a labor of love and devotion to the product, which is always appreciated by the community. Yes, it’d be nice to see a simpler introduction and tutorial setup, as it can feel like you’re plunging into the deep end if you’re a new user coming to the program, but outside this caveat, there’s something great here that’s worth checking out as a standard macOS maintenance tool, no questions asked.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
