    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2631329/master-dynamic-me05-earbuds-review.html",
    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Excellent sound quality Smart, sturdy brass earpiece Lots of ear-tips Cons No ANC Fairly expensive Our Verdict People that prefer wired headphones or earbuds for listening to hi-res music will find that the ME05 provides high-quality sound at a competitive price. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$199 Best Prices Today: Master \u0026 Dynamic ME05 Retailer Price $199 View Deal Master \u0026 Dynamic $199 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Master \u0026 Dynamic makes some great wireless headphones and earbuds, including the excellent ‚Äì but rather expensive ‚Äì over-ear MW75 (included in our round up of over-ear headphones) which includes both wired and wireless options. However, it recently released the new ME05 earbuds, which are completely wired and quite a bit more affordable than the MW75. Somewhat oddly, the price varies depending on where you‚Äôre based. In the U.S., the ME05 is available in four different colours, which all have the same price at $199. However, prices vary in the U.K. and other regions, starting at ¬£169 for the gunmetal (grey) and palladium (silver) models, while the gold and white models cost ¬£196. That‚Äôs still relatively expensive for a set of wired earbuds, but M\u0026D‚Äôs classy design shines through, as well as providing excellent sound quality for people who prefer a traditional wired design over the compromises of Bluetooth and wireless audio. And, as M\u0026D states on its website, the wired design also means that it‚Äôs ‚Äúone less thing to charge‚Äù. See how the Master \u0026 Dynamic ME05 compares to other wired earphones we have tested. The ME05 was originally launched way back in 2015, but M\u0026D decided that it needed a bit of a revamp in order to bring it up to date with the latest audio technologies, such as the use of USB-C for wired audio. The external design hasn‚Äôt changed much, with the main body of each earpiece still made out of brass, which is both smart and sturdy, and also helps to reduce distortion that might affect the sound quality. Inside the earbuds are 8mm drivers made out of ‚Äòbio-cellulose‚Äô ‚Äì a thin and light material that is similar to paper, but is produced as a by-product of growing bacteria in a lab (which sounds slightly gross, but the lightweight material is widely used in headphones and earbuds as it provides very good sound quality at both high and low frequencies). I‚Äôve always preferred wired earbuds, but one disadvantage is that the cables can turn into an irritating spaghetti mess at times. Thankfully, though, the cable on the ME05 is made out of thick ‚Äòtangle-free‚Äô rubber that lets you just pick up the earbuds and quickly plug them in without spending 10 minutes unravelling the cable first. The original ME05 from 2015 just had a standard 3.5mm headphone connector, but Apple killed off the 3.5mm connector with the iPhone 7 in 2016, so the cable provided with this new model includes both a 3.5mm connector and a USB-C adaptor for the latest iPhones and iPads and other mobile devices. There‚Äôs a good set of accessories included too, with a canvas carrying pouch, five sets of silicone rubber ear-tips in different sizes, and two sets of memory foam ear-tips as well. There‚Äôs no Lightning adaptor, though, so owners of older iPhones and iPads will need to provide their own adaptor (Apple‚Äôs own Lightning adaptor has been discontinued in the U.S., unfortunately, although it still seems to be on sale in the U.K. and some other regions). Sound quality is excellent, as I stream the hi-res version of Sing Along by Sturgill Simpson from Apple Music. The track is a riotous mash-up of rock guitars, EDM keyboards and Simpson‚Äôs country twang, but the ME05 balances the dense sound perfectly even at full volume. Wired headphones often seem to have a little more power than Bluetooth, and there‚Äôs a real head-banging energy to the grinding guitar, while the dance keyboards fly through the air like fireworks. The ME05 still manages to pick out lighter details though, including the precise, ticking percussion that drives the song forward, and the bass drop towards the end lands like a punch in the gut. That beefy bass works well for dance tracks too, and the deep, electronic bass on Bad Guy by Billie Eilish has a taut, firm rhythm that‚Äôs hard to resist. The ME05 is equally at home with classical sounds. It shows the lightest of touches for delicate harp that opens Max Richter‚Äôs Sarajevo, but the entrance of soprano Sarah Leonard cuts through with piercing clarity and emotional power. The martial blast of horns brings an ominous mood to the piece, like an oncoming storm, and then the ME05 unleashes the storm as the full BBC Philharmonic erupts in a powerful swirl of strings. The only thing missing is support for active noise-cancellation (ANC), which could be a problem for some users. Should You Buy The Master \u0026 Dynamic ME05? If you prefer the convenience of wireless headphones then the old-school wired design of the ME05 probably won‚Äôt suit you. And, of course, the lack of noise-cancellation may be a deal-breaker for travellers who need good ANC. But people that prefer wired headphones or earbuds for listening to hi-res music will find that the ME05 provides high-quality sound at a competitive price.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
