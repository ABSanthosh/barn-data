    "description": "Macworld Black Friday is here and it’s a fantastic time to pick up a deal on an iPad. While technically just 24 hours (the day after Thanksgiving in the U.S. or November 29, 2024, also known as today) Black Friday has gradually expanded to encompass the whole weekend and Cyber Monday (December 2), as well as the weeks and days leading up and beyond to the big weekend. This means you need to keep your eyes peeled all month long for killer iPad savings. Or, better still, let us keep our eyes peeled for you. This article is where we round up the best-value deals on the various iPad models available in both the U.S. and the U.K., as well as provide automated price comparison tables that will pull in the lowest prices across all the major retailers. Bookmark this page and check back for the best Black Friday bargains as we’ll be updating this page as more discounts come in. Want a list of all the best Apple deals? Check out our round up of the best Black Friday deals on Apple products we’ve seen so far and see how much you can save. Best iPad deals for Black Friday 2024 This Black Friday, Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers in the U.S., U.K., and elsewhere are already slashing prices to all-time lows. Here are the best prices we’ve found so far: 10th-gen iPad deals The 10th-gen iPad is the only iPad that wasn’t updated in 2024. However, Apple cut the price by $100 to $349, making it a far more attractive purchase. It’s the only iPad that can’t run Apple Intelligence, but it still gets our full recommendation for anyone on a budget. U.S. Amazon, 10th gen iPad (64GB): $279 ($70 off, MRSP $349) Amazon, 10th-gen iPad (256GB): $410 ($89 off, MSRP $499) Amazon, 9th-gen iPad (256GB): $280 ($200 off, MSRP was $479 – Clearance) U.K. Amazon, 10th-gen iPad (64GB): £289 (£40 off, RRP £329) Amazon, 10th-gen iPad (256GB): £437.69 (£61.31 off, RRP £499) John Lewis, 9th-gen iPad (64GB): £259 (£110 off, RRP was £369 – Clearance) iPad mini deals The iPad mini was updated in October with an A17 Pro processor and 8GB of RAM so it’s able to run Apple Intelligence, as well as double the storage, from 64GB to 128GB. Otherwise, the display and design are the same. If you don’t care about Apple Intelligence, you can still find a great price on an older A15 model, but remember that you get more storage in the newer one. U.S. Amazon, iPad mini (A17 Pro, 128GB): $459 ($40 off, MSRP $499) Amazon, iPad mini (A17 Pro, 512GB): $764 ($35 off, MSRP $799) Amazon, iPad mini (A15, 256GB): $500 ($149 off, MSRP $649 – Clearance) U.K. Amazon, iPad mini (2024, A17 Pro, 128GB): £467.97 (£31.03 off, RRP £499) Amazon, iPad mini (2024, A17 Pro, 256GB) £559.97 (£39.03 off, RRP £599) KRCS, iPad mini (2024, A17 Pro, 512GB): £783.02 (£15.98 off, RRP £799) iPad Air deals The newest iPad Air now comes in two sizes, 11 inches and 13 inches like the iPad Pro. It has an M2 processor and a repositioned front camera. Otherwise, it’s the same as the M1 model, which we loved. U.S. Amazon, 11-inch M2 iPad Air (128GB): $499 ($100 off, MSRP $599) Amazon, 11-inch M2 iPad Air (1TB): $949 ($150 off, MSRP $1,099) Amazon, 13-inch M2 iPad Air (128GB): $699 ($100 off, MSRP $799) Amazon, 13-inch M2 iPad Air (1TB): $1,199 ($100 off, MSRP $1,299) U.K. Amazon, 11-inch iPad Air (M2, 128GB): £559.97 (£39.03 off, RRP £599) Amazon, 11-inch iPad Air (M2, 512GB): £843.97 (£55.03 off, RRP £899) Amazon, 13-inch iPad Air (M2, 128GB): £749 (£50 off, RRP £799) Amazon, 13-inch iPad Air (M2, 512GB): £1,054.97 (£44.03 off, RRP £1,099) iPad Pro deals The iPad Pro was updated this spring with a new thinner design built around an M4 processor and OLED display. It’s the absolute best tablet Apple (or anyone else) makes, but it’s also very expensive and probably more than most people need. U.S. Amazon, 11-inch M4 iPad Pro (256GB, 8GB RAM): $850 ($149 off with coupon, MSRP $999) Amazon, 11-inch M4 iPad Pro (2TB, 16GB RAM): $1,799 ($200 off, MSRP $1,999) Amazon, 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (256GB, 8G RAM): $1,099 ($200 off, MSRP $1,299) Amazon, 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (2TB, 16GB RAM): $2,099 ($200 off, MSRP $2,299) U.K. Amazon, 11-inch M4 iPad Pro (256GB): £934.97 (£64.03 off, RRP £999) Amazon, 11-inch M4 iPad Pro (512GB): £1,124.97 (£75 off, RRP £1,199) John Lewis, 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (256GB): £1,217.97 (£81.03 off, RRP £1,299) Amazon, 13-inch M4 iPad Pro (512GB): £1,404.97 (£94 off, RRP £1,499) iPad Accessory Black Friday deals U.S. Amazon, Apple Pencil 1st gen: $59 ($40 off, RRP $99) Amazon, Apple Pencil (2nd gen): $80 ($49 off, MSRP $129) Best Buy, Apple Pencil (USB-C): $69 ($10 off, MSRP $79) Best Buy, Apple Pencil Pro: $99 ($30 off, MSRP $129) Amazon, Apple Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pro M4: $250 ($49 off, MSRP $299) Amazon, Apple Magic Keyboard Folio for 10th gen iPad: $199 ($50 off, MSRP $249) Amazon, Apple Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Air M2: $225 ($74 off, MSRP $299) U.K. Amazon, Apple Pencil Pro: £109 (£20 off, RRP £129) Amazon, Apple Pencil (USB-C): £69 (£10 off, RRP £79) Amazon, Apple Pencil (1st gen): £79 (£20 off, RRP £99) Amazon, Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro 11-inch M4: £284 (£15 off, RRP £299) Amazon, Magic Keyboard Folio for iPad (10th generation): £199 (£50 off, RRP £249) For a more comprehensive guide to the available deals–as well as any deals that have popped up since we last updated this article–see our automated tables below for the lowest prices currently available on each iPad model. If you’re not sure which model is right for you, read our in-depth iPad buying guide. To check if the Apple Pencil works with your iPad read: Apple Pencils compared: Which Apple Pencil works with your iPad? Does Apple discount iPads for Black Friday? Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. Apple’s Black Friday shopping event for 2024 includes a $100/£80 Apple Gift Card with purchases of the iPad Pro; $75/£60 Apple Gift Card with the iPad Air, and $50/£40 Apple Gift Card with the iPad 10th gen. You’ll notice that the iPad mini isn’t included–that’s because it is too new and Apple always leaves the newest products out of the deal. Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.S.) Get Apple's Black Friday offer (U.K.) It’s not a bad ‘saving’ if you want to buy more than one Apple product, as you can use your voucher to make a second purchase, or credit it to your account and pay for all your subscriptions for a few months. If you are looking for bigger deals though you will need to look elsewhere.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2535548/who-needs-usb-c-when-the-lightning-airpods-max-are-150-off.html",
    "description": "Macworld There may be a “new” version of the AirPods Max at the Apple Store, but the only thing different is the USB-C port, which can’t be used to listen in wired mode like the Lightning model. So why bother paying $549 when you can save a bundle on the Lightning version: Amazon is selling the the fantastic Lightning-based AirPods Max headphones for $399, a healthy $150 discount from their $549 MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen. Other than the port, these AirPods Max are identical to the USB-C model despite some different colors. They have the same design that’s gorgeous and comfortable and come with the same specs and features, including top-notch noise cancelation with super useful transparency mode, and excellent battery life. In our review of the AirPods Max, we gave them a four-star rating, loving the pleasant sound quality and just how well-built they are. “Are the AirPod Max the best wireless noise-cancelling headphones you can buy? For those who rely on the Apple ecosystem, yes. They offer sound quality on par or even slightly better than their competitors and superior noise-cancelling,” we noted in our review. While the headphones don’t have a physical power button, they have an Apple Watch-style Digital Crown to play and pause music, answer calls, control volume, and skip tracks. They also have some super smart sensors that pause audio when you take them off and power down when not in use for a while. They also provide some 20 hours of battery life, and plugging them in for about 5 minutes adds another 90 minutes of listening time. And they have a feature the USB-C model doesn’t have: you can plug in a Lightning-to-3.5mm cable and listen with a wired connection. So don’t miss out on getting the Lightning AirPods Max at their best price of just $399. Get the AirPods Max for 27% offBuy now at Amazon",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
