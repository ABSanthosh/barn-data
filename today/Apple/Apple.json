    "description": "Macworld Apple has released iOS 18.4.1 and iPadOS 18.4.1, which offers no new features but fixes two critical vulnerabilities. For both fixes, Apple says on its security updates page that it is “aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS.” The release notes are small for this one. Outside of the security fixes, this release only claims to fix a bug with wireless CarPlay. This update provides important bug fixes, security updates, and addresses a rare issue that prevents wireless CarPlay connection in certain vehicles. Even though you may not be a specific individual target of hackers, you should update your iPhones and iPads now. The security bulletins are as follows: CoreAudio Available for: iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 13.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: Processing an audio stream in a maliciously crafted media file may result in code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS. Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved bounds checking. CVE-2025-31200: Apple and Google Threat Analysis Group RPAC Available for: iPhone XS and later, iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 13.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later Impact: An attacker with arbitrary read and write capability may be able to bypass Pointer Authentication. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS. Description: This issue was addressed by removing the vulnerable code. CVE-2025-31201: Apple iOS 18.4.1: How to install To get the latest version of iOS 18 on your phone, head over to the Settings app, then General and Software Update. Then follow the prompts to restart and install the update. If you don’t want to wait until the official update arrives, you can install the most recent release candidate, which will be identical to the public release, by turning on Beta Updates in the Software Update tab.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple TV+, the streaming service from Apple, arrived at the end of 2019 so it’s been here a while now, but it’s only recently come into its own as more and more people have discovered the great shows on offer. If you want to watch shows including Severence, Ted Lasso and For All Mankind, as well as movies like Tetris and Greyhound, and a couple of MLB games every Friday night, you might be wondering if you can really justify yet another subscription. The good news is that you don’t have to commit to a subscription: you can subscribe for a month (for $9.99/£8.99) and cancel Apple TV+ at any time. But there are ways that you can get Apple TV for free and we are here to show you how to do that. From time to time Apple also offers a discount on Apple TV+. For example in April 2025 we were able to re-subscribe to Apple TV+ for $2.99/£2.99 a month for three months, which is a good saving on the usual $9.99/£8.99 price. This deal expires on April 24, 2025. You can get more information about the deal on Apple’s webpage. If you want to learn more about what you can watch on Apple TV+ read everything you can watch on Apple TV+, and our list of the new shows coming to Apple TV+.  How to watch Apple TV+ for free There are a number of ways in which you can watch shows on Apple TV+ for free. Apple offers limited-time trials (discussed below), and the service also allows you to watch the first episode of many shows for free. In fact there are several dozen episodes available to watch for free including the first episodes of Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, See, Trying, and more. Read about What is free on Apple TV+? in our separate article. Beyond the free episodes, Apple offers a free seven-day trial which might be long enough for you to binge a whole series (if you don’t sleep for a week). But there are also longer trials available both from Apple and from other companies who bundle a free Apple TV+ subscription with their services, read on for the details of the best Apple TV deals and free trial codes. For example, there is the option to get a free year subscription to Apple TV+ with T-Mobile (if you live in the US), you can also get three months free Apple TV+ with a PlayStation 5. Find out more about these deals below. Apple TV+ trials Apple offers various trials so that you can try out Apple TV+ before you subscribe. Unfortunately, none of these offers are available if you or your Family have previously accepted an Apple TV+ 1 year free offer from when the service first launched. Once the trial period is up the $9.99/£8.99 a month subscription will start immediately – but you can easily cancel this. To avoid paying you need to cancel the subscription the day before it is due to renew. Get 7 days of Apple TV+ free If you want to watch a show, and have plenty of time in the immediate future, you could activate your free seven-day trial and binge-watch it! The 7-day trial might sound attractive if you think you can watch a whole series in a week. But make sure the whole series is available, as Apple typically adds new episodes on a weekly basis. You can subscribe to Apple TV+ on Apple’s website here, or via the Apple TV app on your device. The 7-day trial will automatically auto-renew into a monthly subscription though, so you will need to be prepared to cancel within the week if you don’t want to be out of pocket. The easiest way to cancel a subscription go to Settings and click on the Apple ID section on your iPhone. Tap on Subscriptions. Locate Apple TV+ in the Active list and then Cancel Subscription. More details on how to cancel your subscription below. Note that you won’t find Apple TV+ in the Active list until the trial ends. Get 7 days Apple TV+ for free Get 1 month of Apple TV+ free As long as you’ve never used Apple TV+ before, you can actually get a free month if you sign up for the one-month trial of Apple One. That trial will also include free one-month trials for Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and iCloud+. At the end of the month’s trial, the subscription starts at $19.95/£18.95 a month as an individual, but there are different plans available. You can cancel at any time. Read: Apple One: What you need to know. Get 1 month Apple TV+ for free with Apple One (U.S.) Get 1 month Apple TV+ for free with apple one (U.K.) Apple TV+ subscription deals Get 3 months of Apple TV+ for free with an Apple hardware purchase Apple offers three months of Apple TV+ for free to anyone with a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac. You can get three months of Apple TV+ when you purchase a iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac from Apple. Apple Watch, HomePod, AirPods, and various other Apple devices do not qualify. In short, your device qualifies if it’s a new Apple device that can actually run the TV app and watch Apple TV+ content. Once the three months is up the $9.99/£8.99 a month subscription will start immediately unless you cancel it. It is necessary to claim the deal within 90 days of setting up your new device. Get Apple TV+ free with an Apple Music student subscription Another way to get Apple TV+ for free is to sign up for a student subscription to Apple Music. If you qualify as a student in Higher Education you will be able to get Apple Music for half price, and as an added benefit Apple is bundling free Apple TV+ subscriptions with student subscriptions to Apple Music. You qualify for free Apple TV+ for as long as you subscribe as a student. A student subscription to Apple Music costs $5.99/£5.99 a month. Head to this Apple page for more details. Get Apple TV+ free with a Student Apple Music subscription (U.S.) Get Apple TV+ free with a Student Apple Music subscription (U.K.) Get three months of Apple TV+ for $2.99/£2.99 a month Apple is offering all new and “qualified returning subscribers” Apple TV+ for $2.99/£2.99 a month for three months. This deal is running until April 24, 2025. That’s essentially three months for the price of one. Get three months for the price of one Get 12 months Apple TV+ for the price of 10 One way to save money is to pay Apple for the year up-front. When you sign up for the service rather than choosing to pay monthly (which has the benefit of being able to cancel at any time) opt to pay yearly. That will cost you $99.99/£89 up-front, which works out at $8.33/£7.41 a month, rather than the standard $9.99/£8.99 a month. Or $9.99/£8.99 a month for 10 months instead of 12. On your iPhone, go to Settings and click on your Apple ID info at the top. Tap on Subscriptions. Beside Apple Music tap on See All Plans. Switch to Individual Plan to save money (you won’t be able to cancel this subscription until the end of the 12 months though). Get two months free with a year's subscription Other Apple TV+ Deals It’s not only Apple that offers free Apple TV+ trials. Some third parties offer even longer deals than Apple does. You’ll find U.S. and U.K deals below. Just remember that at the end of the trial you may need to cancel with Apple if you don’t want the subscription to start. Get Apple TV+ for free with PlayStation 5 There is a 3 month Apple TV free deal with PlayStation 5 (there was a six-month deal, but that deal ended on July 31, 2023.) PlayStation 4 users can also apply for the deal. Get Apple TV+ for 3 months with Sony Playstation 5 U.S. Apple TV+ deals Get Apple TV+ for free with T-Mobile T-Mobile offers Apple TV+ for free on a couple of its smartphone plans. The GoG5 Next and GoG5 Plus plans both offer Apple TV+ as well as Netflix for customers, while the Next option adds Hulu as well. Prices start at $90 a month for one line. Details here.

Follow the prompts to access your digital download, which is a code you can enter for three free months when you first sign up for Apple TV+. The code will work for new or ‘qualifying’ returning subscribers. This code has to be used during signup, so it’s probably the one you should use first, before redeeming other offers like the free 3 months for a qualifying Apple product. Get Apple TV+ for 3 months with Best Buy Get Apple TV+ for free with Roku Roku’s deal means you can get three months Apple TV+ for free. This deal ends on February 3, 2025.

After five days you should receive an email from Currys including the link to get three months of Apple services for free. Sign up for the Currys Perks Loyalty Scheme to qualify. Get 3 months free Apple TV+ with Currys Get 3 months of Apple TV+ for free with O2 O2 is offering three months of Apple TV on eligible tariffs and with purchases of Apple products. Details here. Since you would get three months free Apple TV with a new iPhone it’s not clear what O2 is offing in addition to that. Get 3 months free Apple TV+ with O2 How to claim your free trial of Apple TV+ from Apple Having made a qualifying purchase, or decided to try out the free 7-day trial, all you need to do is: Make sure the device is running the latest software. Open the TV app on your new Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Sign in to your Apple ID. Click on the show you want to watch—you should see the option to Enjoy Three Months Free. Note: This will only appear if you have purchased a new device, otherwise you will only see the 7-day trial offer. Click Continue. Confirm that you want to activate the free trial. You will see a message that the free trial will commence immediately and will run until the end of the trial at which point it will renew for a monthly subscription. If you want to cancel the subscription you can do so. You have 90 days from buying a new device to start the free year’s subscription, so as long as you purchased your new Apple product recently then you should be ok to activate your trial. Also, if you stop the free trial before it ends you can’t restart it. What if you are thinking of buying a new Apple device later? Will you be able to switch from a subscription to the free trial? We think that the way to do this would be to cancel your subscription before signing up again via the three-month trial. How to share an Apple TV+ subscription with your family You can also share a subscription to TV+ with six family members—yourself and five others. To do this you all need to be part of the same Family Sharing group. By linking your Apple accounts together under the Family Sharing group you will all be able to: Share music purchased from the iTunes Store Share access to Apple Music (as long as you have a family Apple Music subscription) Share apps bought from the App Store (in app purchases can’t be shared though) Share Apple Books Access games on Apple’s Arcade gaming platform (with a subscription) Share a News+ subscription Share an iCloud storage plan One of your family members will need to be the family organizer, who basically chooses who joins the group, and has to put up their bank details to pay for any purchases. It’s supposed to be family members in the same household. While you could set this up with other ‘family’ members we think the frustration of having all the payments for everything going through the ‘organiser’s’ bank account could make this a hard sell. However, if does at least mean that you and your partner don’t both have to subscribe to the service in order to watch shows on both of your iPhones. How to cancel an Apple TV+ subscription So that’s a few ways to get Apple TV+ for free, at least for a short time, or by sharing a subscription with a family member. However, we think the best way to get access to Apple TV+ is to subscribe as usual but just cancel at any time. You could watch everything you want this month and then stop subscribing next month and it would only cost you £6.99/$6.99. Sign up for Apple TV+ here. To cancel your Apple TV+ subscription follow these steps: Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap on the Apple ID section at the top with your name. Tap on Subscriptions. Now tap on any subscription you wish to cancel (in this case Apple TV+). On the next page tap on Cancel Subscription. Expired deals Get 1 month of Apple TV+ free Usually Apple only offers 7 days free, and that’s just to new users, but back in January Apple offered a month of Apple TV+ for free to new and returning customers (as long as you qualify). Get 1 month Apple TV+ for free U.S. Get 1 month Apple TV+ for free U.K. If you are in the U.S. click here or if you are in the U.K. it’s here. Click on Redeem Offer. This will open the Apple TV app. Click on Try 1 Month Free. Sign in to your Apple ID with your password. If you are eligible for the offer it will allow you to take advantage of the deal. Unfortunately, this offer is not available if you or your family have previously accepted an Apple TV+ three months free or one year free offer. If you are a current subscriber you will need to unsubscribe to Apple TV before you can qualify for the offer (assuming you have not taken up one of the previous offers). This deal ran until January 30, 2025.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
