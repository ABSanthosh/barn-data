    "description": "Macworld The fantastic Beats Fit Pro earbuds are at their best price now at Amazon, $150, 25 percent off their MSRP, and the best price we‚Äôve seen. We reviewed the Beats Fit Pro and gave them an absolutely perfect score ‚Äì an extremely rare occurrence. Plus, they also got our Editors‚Äô Choice award, marking them for the awesome buds that they are. We found they fit fantastically, they have a good battery life, and they deliver good noise canceling and even an extremely useful transparency mode. Our only quibble is that there‚Äôs no wireless charging on the case, but we can very well survive this ‚Äúordeal‚Äù by sometimes plugging in that USB-C cable. ‚ÄúThe Beats Fit Pro give you all the benefits of AirPods Pro with better fit, sound quality, and battery life. The call quality is slightly worse and there‚Äôs no wireless charging, but the comfort and fit alone are worth the tradeoff,‚Äù we wrote. As mentioned, the earbuds feature three listening modes, namely Active Noise Cancelling, Transparency Mode, and Adaptive EQ. While the first mode will block the world around you, the second will make it possible for you to listen in around you, which is ideal when you‚Äôre walking around at night or crossing the street, for instance. The Adaptive EQ mode will use the microphones on the earbuds to react to changes in your environment, modifying the sound output to maintain a good listening experience in all situations. SO Don‚Äôt miss the chance to save big on the Beats Fit Pro. Order them for $150 at Amazon before the price goes back up. Get some awesome Beats earbuds to exercise withBuy it at Amazon",

    "description": "Macworld Following the announcement of surprisingly strong iPad revenue back in August, it‚Äôs looking like things are heading back to normal for Apple‚Äôs beleaguered tablet division. According to a new report, demand for the latest iPad Pro has fallen well below the numbers Apple initially projected. Earlier this week Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) released an analysis (you‚Äôll need to register to read the full article) indicating that demand for the OLED panels used in the new iPad Pro models ‚Äúhas really slowed down after a strong Q2 2024.‚Äù Shipments were down by 40% in the third quarter, and are expected to fall by another 30 percent by the end of the year. The larger 13-inch model is expected to see an astonishing 90 percent drop in shipments for Q4. DSCC sets this troubling decline against its view that the 2024 Pro has the best display and the thinnest design on the market. But having the best display and the thinnest design doesn‚Äôt get you very far if your tablet costs so much that people can‚Äôt afford it‚Äìand even the smaller of the two 2024 iPad Pro models starts at $999, far more than most potential customers would be looking to spend. The iPad user base is overwhelmingly dominated by casual users who absolutely do not require the high-end specs and features that the iPad Pro delivers, and for that matter do not need to regularly upgrade their devices, which is bad news for the latest edition of the iPad Air and the imminent new versions of the standard iPad and iPad mini. Shortly after those positive sales figures this summer, I argued that they were merely a temporary sales bump caused by bottled-up demand after a long period with no new models and that the fundamental problems‚Äìnot enough pro customers, too many casual customers with little interest in upgrading regularly, iPadOS failing to convince as a work OS‚Äìremained. I challenged the iPad to keep the hot streak going into the next quarter and predicted that it would fail to do so. I take no pleasure in being right.

    "description": "Macworld You might think Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video are competitors but like in any good buddy movie, the unlikely pair are teaming up. The companies announced today that Apple TV+ will soon be available via¬†Prime Video¬†in the U.S. as an add-on subscription for $9.99 per month. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any benefit to signing up through Prime Video other than the convenience of accessing both services through the same app. ‚ÄúWe want to make Apple TV+ and its award-winning library of series and films from the world‚Äôs greatest storytellers available to as many viewers as possible,‚Äù said Eddy Cue, Apple‚Äôs SVP of Services, in a press release. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled that Prime Video will now offer Apple TV+, giving viewers an incredible breadth of viewing options.‚Äù For those who don‚Äôt subscribe, that‚Äôs the same price Apple charges directly through the Apple TV app. The monthly price increased from $6.99 to $9.99 last October. Apple has been pushing to make Apple TV+ available to more users as it works to grow the service beyond Apple users. Earlier this year, it announced a partnership with Comcast that bundles Apple TV+ with Peacock and Netflix for $30 a month. That bundle is only available to new and existing Xfinity Internet and TV customers. To sign up for Apple TV+ through Prime Video, log into your account and click on the Subscriptions tab. Amazon says Apple TV+ will be available later this month.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2473123/the-m4-macbook-pro-may-be-a-near-perfect-laptop.html",
    "description": "Macworld According to reports, Apple will release an update to the MacBook Pro in the next few weeks. That update was initially expected to be nothing more than a chip upgrade from the M3 to the M4. But if new reports hold up, there may be more to this update‚Äìspecifically for the 14-inch base model that would make it a near-perfect laptop for the general consumer. The first report was by leaker VNChocoTaco on X, who posted a photo they received of the box label for the new MacBook Pro revealing key specs. The second report is from Russian YouTuber Wylsacom, who apparently got their hands on the M4 MacBook Pro, laptop and all. If the information in these two reports holds up, and it would be a very elaborate hoax if it doesn‚Äôt, we could be seeing some big changes in the base M4 MacBook Pro. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs being reported and what it could mean. Memory that serves us right The current base M3 14-inch MacBook Pro has one glaring problem: It has only 8GB of unified memory. Apple will tell you that‚Äôs more than enough and 8GB is useable and for many buyers that‚Äôs probably true. But considering how much RAM higher-end software uses nowadays, 8GB in a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù laptop is not enough. Still not convinced? How about this: The MacBook Air, Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù laptop, the laptop for ‚Äúeveryone else,‚Äù also starts at 8GB of memory. The MacBook Pro is supposed to be the workstation laptop for, as the name says, the ‚ÄúPro.‚Äù The other models all start at 18GB‚Äîdoes 8GB seem proper for a MacBook that costs $1,599? Both reports by VNChocoTaco and Wylsacom show what appears to be a specifications label from the base M3 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, that shows a laptop with 16GB of memory. Assuming the model isn‚Äôt a higher-end configuration, that would mean Apple is finally addressing the biggest flaw of the entry-level Pro. With 16GB of RAM, pro users will be able to run their apps and feel comfortable about the laptop‚Äôs performance‚Äìthey may still need more and upgrade to 24GB or more, and even then, it won‚Äôt be as expensive as starting from a standard configuration is 8GB. Bringing the Thunder(bolt) VNChocoTaco‚Äôs photo is low resolution and much of the text is garbled, but it seems to show that the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro will have three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Wylsacom‚Äôs label says the same and he shows off the laptop‚Äôs three ports in his video. This seems to indicate that Apple is adding one more Thunderbolt/USB 4 to the base M4 model. This would put the laptop in line with the higher-end MacBook Pro models with Pro and Max chips; it would no longer have the same two ports as the MacBook Air, another step toward making it an actual ‚ÄúPro‚Äù laptop. Space Black for the masses When Apple introduced the M3 MacBook Pro, it revealed a new Space Black color option available only on the M3 Pro or M3 Max models. According to these reports, Apple is going to make Space Black an option on the base model, too. I‚Äôm currently using a Space Black MacBook Pro, and my first impression of the color was that it was nice, but it should be darker. But after having used the laptop for nearly a year now, I love Space Black and it‚Äôs now my color of choice. If it‚Äôs coming to the M4 MacBook Pro, it‚Äôs going to be a popular choice‚Äîand put the entry level model on par with the others. Finally, a true entry-level MacBook Pro There are other specs revealed by these reports, such as the M4‚Äôs 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and the same starting 512GB SSD. But the three changes above are going to make the base M4 MacBook Pro a popular laptop‚Äìespecially if Apple keeps the price at $1,599. It would be the first time in a long time that buying the least-expensive MacBook Pro didn‚Äôt mean you had to make a significant compromise, such as the 8GB of RAM, fewer ports, hampered performance, or even an old design, as was the case when Apple kept the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar around after the Apple silicon redesign was announced.. If and then this MacBook Pro does ship, it will fit right in with the M4 Pro and M4 Max models in the lineup and give users a real choice, rather than force them to the upper models due to cut-rate specs. Apple will sell a lot of them. Apple is expected to announce M4 MacBook Pro and other M4 Macs at an event later this month, with a rumored ship date of November 1. Learn more about the upcoming M4 MacBook Pro.",

    "description": "Macworld The Find My system for tracking devices (like Macs) and items (like AirTags) lets you keep peace of mind, avoid leaving valuable stuff behind, and potentially even recover stolen goods‚Äìor hope that the police will. But Apple has not yet, and may never, released a native Find My app for Windows. The app is built into iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS. These native apps also let you see the location of people who have given permission to share their whereabouts with you. You can use the Find Devices web app at¬†iCloud.com/find, which, as you can tell by the name, finds just devices. For Apple, a device is an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple Watch, or most Apple and Beats audio hardware, like AirPods Pro. (Audio devices are a strange thing to include in ‚Äúdevices,‚Äù as they can‚Äôt connect to the internet directly to update their location, but have to relay through other Apple hardware, more like an AirTag.) iCloud.com‚Äôs Find My Devices web app lets you see the location of your Apple hardware. iCloud.com‚Äôs Find My Devices web app lets you see the location of your Apple hardware.Foundry iCloud.com‚Äôs Find My Devices web app lets you see the location of your Apple hardware.Foundry Foundry If you‚Äôre in a Family Sharing group, you also see all the devices registered by other members. The location of those devices is shown only if those people share their location with you generally, which then allows device pinpointing as well. Apple reserves people and what it calls¬†items¬†(AirTags and third-party Find My Network trackers) to its native apps for reasons of privacy and security. From all that Apple has published, seeing the location of people and items relies on end-to-end encryption to avoid any possibility of unwanted parties being able to extract that information. Apple‚Äôs end-to-end encryption requires an app running on hardware it makes and you own (and have logged into an iCloud account). If you have lost or misplaced a device, however, you can readily access Find My Devices via iCloud.com from a Windows computer, Android smartphone or tablet, or more exotic operating system with a browser (Linux on the desktop): Go to iCloud.com/find Enter your Apple Account user name. Enter the associated password. Complete two-factor authentication if prompted. Find your device in the list. It may take a minute or longer to update its location, depending on where it is and what other Apple devices it‚Äôs near. You may feel stuck if you have lost whatever you normally use to retain your password, like a password manager on your iPhone. It can be worthwhile to create a¬†memorable multi-word account password¬†or write it down without explanation and stick it in your wallet or bag‚Äìif it doesn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúApple Account‚Äù written next to it, a thief won‚Äôt have any idea what it means. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, which most Apple Accounts do, you may be prompted to enter a code. However, there‚Äôs a nasty catch: if you don‚Äôt have any of your Apple devices and have lost access to the phone number associated with your iPhone, you can‚Äôt receive a code. (I highly recommend adding a trusted friend, relative, or colleague‚Äôs phone number to your list for just this reason. The instructions in ‚ÄúHow to remove or change the phone number linked to your Apple ID‚Äù will help. Note that Password \u0026 Security has changed to Sign-In \u0026 Security in the pathway to get to trusted phone numbers in Settings and System Settings.) Also, don‚Äôt forget that if you‚Äôre in a Family Sharing group that you can typically check with one of the other members to help them locate your device, whether you‚Äôre with them in person or not. If you haven‚Äôt shared your location with them, they can still help by marking a device as lost or erasing it remotely, but this will require your Apple Account password.

    "description": "Macworld At the heart of every Apple device is an Apple processor. Apple has been using its own chips in its iPhones and iPads for some time, while the Mac lineup has completed its transition away from Intel chips. Every product Apple makes is powered by a home-grown chip. What‚Äôs remarkable about Apple silicon is its performance and power efficiency. But all chips aren‚Äôt created equally. Understanding the performance differences between each chip will help with your buying decisions, especially when you‚Äôre deciding between iPhone 16 or MacBook models. Knowing how each chip performs gives you a better idea of what products to buy and whether or not it‚Äôs worth your money to step up to a higher model. Let‚Äôs take a look at how the new processors compare with the rest of the processors in the iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineup and see how each performs and what that means to you. For the sake of consistency, we‚Äôve used¬†Geekbench 6¬†benchmarks. Here‚Äôs every chip and how the benchmarks compare with each other. Update October 10, 2024: Added benchmarks for the A18 Pro and A18 for the new iPhone 16 lineup. Every current processor compared Results are scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. Chips in this chart are currently available in Apple devices. Before we get into the individual processors, let‚Äôs let the chips fall where they may. In the above chart, we‚Äôve only included chips that are in Apple‚Äôs current product lineups for the sake of keeping the chart manageable. The Mac section below includes all of the chips, from the M1 to the current chip. If you‚Äôre looking for scores of chips that are no longer being used in Apple‚Äôs active iPhone or iPad lineups (such as the A12 Bionic), check out the Geekbench Browser. It‚Äôs a somewhat predictable chart, with the fastest Mac chips at the top, followed by a mix of iPads and iPhones. But there are still some fascinating results: owners of the iPad Pro can say their tablet is about as fast as a MacBook Air and that wouldn‚Äôt be much of a reach. And the difference between the $399 iPhone SE and the $899 iPhone 14 isn‚Äôt as huge as their price difference indicates. If you‚Äôre not seeing all the bar chart labels, it may be because your browser font is set larger than the default, or your browser is zoomed in. You‚Äôll need to set the font size and browser view to the default to see all the chart labels. Read about how Apple‚Äôs M1 and M2 processors compare to Intel in our Mac processor guide. iPhone processors Results are scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. Chips in this chart are currently available in Apple devices. Let‚Äôs look at the specifications of the iPhones currently in Apple‚Äôs lineup so we can understand the differences between them.

Not surprisingly, the A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro is the fastest. The difference between the A18 Pro and the A18 in the iPhone 16 is that the A18 has one fewer GPU core. The iPhone 14 and iPhone SE both have an A15 Bionic processor, but the iPhone 14 has one more GPU core than the iPhone 13, so it offers better graphics performance.

The new 10th-gen iPad that was released in the fall of 2022 has an A14 Bionic, an upgrade from the A13 Bionic in the previous model.

With Apple‚Äôs M-series of chips for the Mac, the company‚Äôs release schedule involves the base version in the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac. Apple then modifies it to create higher-end versions. The latest M-Series chip is the M3, which was released with the new iMac and the MacBook Pro in the fall of 2023. The M3 Pro and Max were also released in the MacBook Pro, replacing the M2 Pro and Max in those laptops. The M3 Ultra has not been released, so the Mac Studio and Mac Pro still use the M2 Ultra.

Even with Black Friday just around the corner, we‚Äôre already seeing some excellent prices on Apple gear. The deals will be coming and going quickly, so be sure to bookmark this page so you can keep checking the latest prices. If you are hoping to find some Apple products on sale on Amazon this Prime Day then look no further. Here are the best deals on Apple products we‚Äôve found so far on iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, Macs, and everything else Apple sells, along with some tips for getting the best bargains: How to get Prime Day discounts Some of these discounts are available to everyone, but many items in the Amazon Prime Day Sale are only open to Prime members, so you‚Äôll need to sign in with an active membership to purchase one of the deals. Prime memberships cost¬†$139¬†/¬†¬£95¬†/¬†AUD$59¬†annually, or¬†$14.99¬†/¬†¬£8.99¬†/¬†AUD$6.99¬†every month. New users can sign up for a¬†30-day free trial¬†that can be canceled at any time during the trial window. You‚Äôll also get free one or two-day delivery and access to Amazon Prime Video and all that content.

We‚Äôve reviewed everything we recommend and we won‚Äôt tell you to buy something that‚Äôs not an actual deal.

We know Apple is expensive, so we‚Äôve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction‚Äîand save you big bucks. One tip: When you click on a good deal‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs from a Macworld page‚Äîcheck that the product isn‚Äôt redirected to a refurbished model and that the current manufacturer‚Äôs price is listed, as that can make the price drop look a lot better than it is. And if a product here is listed as sold out on Amazon, we recommend checking back periodically as Amazon has been known to restock Prime Day deals throughout the sale. We‚Äôve highlighted what we think are the best deals, but there are lots of deals below that might just be on the Apple product you want to buy, so go ahead because these will probably be the best prices (at least until Black Friday!) Prime Big Deals Days AirPods deals With Apple revamping the AirPods range in September 2024‚Äìwith the introduction of the AirPods 4 and new colors and USB-C for the AirPods Max‚Äìwe can expect to see some discounts on the older, now discontinued, models over Prime Day.

The new iPhone 16 hasn‚Äôt been here long so don‚Äôt expect big discounts on those iPhones, but we may see cut-price iPhone 15 and older models ‚Äì we recommend you keep an eye on this over the next few days as we expect prices to decrease further. Just check that Amazon displays the current Apple price for the older iPhones as Apple recently dropped the prices on these models. iPhone 15 (128GB): ¬£681 (¬£18 off, RRP now ¬£699 ) iPhone 15 Plus (128GB): ¬£799 (RRP now ¬£799) iPhone 15 Pro (128GB): ¬£899 (¬£100 off; RRP was ¬£999 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 15 Pro Max (256GB): ¬£1,099 (¬£100 off; RRP was ¬£1,199 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 14 Plus (128 GB): ¬£599 (RRP now ¬£699) iPhone 14 Pro (256GB): ¬£999 (RRP was ¬£1,209 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 13 (128GB): ¬£499 (RRP was ¬£599 DISCONTINUED) iPhone SE (2022): ¬£379 (¬£50 off, RRP ¬£429) For more deals see our Best Amazon Prime Day iPhone deals.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2483858/macos-sequoias-iphone-mirroring-feature-could-expose-personal-data-at-work.html",
    "description": "Macworld The latest version of the Mac operating system, macOS Sequoia, is a solid update with a couple of whiz-bangy features‚Äìone of those being iPhone Mirroring, where you can connect your Mac to your iPhone, have it appear on your Desktop, and use the iPhone as if it was in your hands (kinda). It‚Äôs a really cool feature, but apparently, it‚Äôs not perfect. According to a report by Servco Security, iPhone Mirroring has a privacy hole. When using iPhone Mirroring, if you use an app on your iPhone, that app creates an entry in a directory on your Mac. That may not sound like a big deal, especially if you‚Äôre using your own personal Mac. But if you‚Äôre using a Mac from your employer, the IT department is probably running a tool to track what‚Äôs going on with your work Mac‚Äìthat record that was created can be seen by your IT department. Therefore, IT can figure out what apps are on your personal iPhone and they‚Äôll know you‚Äôve been shopping for hair comb cleaners on the Temu app when you should be finalizing the cover sheet for that TPS report. Servco reported the hole to Apple on September 27 and received confirmation on October 3 that Apple was working on a fix. It‚Äôs customary for security firms to publically publish their findings after reporting security bugs to the company that makes the product. A fix will likely appear in a future Sequoia update, possibly as part of macOS 15.1 due to arrive later this month. Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so it‚Äôs important to install them when they are available. If Apple pulls back an update, the company will reissue it as soon as it is properly revised with corrections. In the meantime, the best way to avoid this hole is to not use iPhone Mirroring with your personal iPhone on a work Mac. Servco states that a company may be legally obligated to tell employees not to use iPhone Mirroring on work Macs. Macworld has several guides to help keep your Mac secure, including a guide on¬†whether or not you need antivirus software, a¬†list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a¬†comparison of Mac security software.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple‚Äôs Studio Display is more than a gorgeous 5K monitor‚Äîit‚Äôs also loaded with high-end features you won‚Äôt find on any other display, including spatial audio speakers, a FaceTime camera with Center Stage, and three built-in USB-C ports. All that comes at a high price, of course, but today it‚Äôs cheaper than it‚Äôs ever been: Amazon is selling the 27-inch Apple Studio Display for $1,294 for Prime Day, a savings of $305 and the best price we‚Äôve ever seen. The Studio Display is a fantastic monitor with a 5K Retina display and up to 600 nits of brightness, True Tone, and a P3 wide color gamut. Under the hood, you‚Äôll find a built-in 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage support for keeping you well-framed during calls, as well as a six-speaker sound system with spatial audio support and three USB-C ports with 96W of power delivery, enough to fast-charge a MacBook. In our 4-star review, we liked the Studio Display as ‚Äúan affordable alternative to the Pro Display XDR,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt love its high price. This deal fixes that and at this price, it gets our full recommendation‚Äîespecially if you want to pair it with a 512GB Mac mini, on sale for $690 ($109 off), or a new discounted MacBook. So go grab one before the price shoots back up. Get the Studio Display for more than $300 offView Deal",

    "description": "Macworld Apple‚Äôs Messages app may have lost the global messaging wars, but in many countries‚Äìincluding the U.S.‚Äìit‚Äôs still an incredibly popular way of communicating. That‚Äôs why Apple keeps upgrading it. This fall‚Äôs Messages updates are some of the biggest ever, with the addition of RCS messaging, true emoji and sticker tapbacks, styled and animated text, Send Later, and support for texts via satellite. But as the people in my Messages group chats all upgraded to iOS 18 and started taking advantage of some of these new features, it all became too much for me. All these new features are good, yes, but they can also be spectacularly distracting. This is why Apple‚Äôs next big step in Messages needs to be to give users the power to control when and how we‚Äôre interrupted in ways far beyond what‚Äôs available today. Death by tapback Tapbacks are great. I use them all the time, and so do most of my friends. Now that I can tap back with any emoji, or even stickers that I‚Äôve added‚Äìnot to mention the forthcoming rain of AI-synthesized GenMoji that will be possible with Apple Intelligence‚Äìthe use of Tapbacks will just keep increasing in so many of my group messages. Tapbacks have been expanded to include stickers and other elements‚Äìbut they come with annoying notifications about new Tapbacks. Tapbacks have been expanded to include stickers and other elements‚Äìbut they come with annoying notifications about new Tapbacks. Foundry Tapbacks have been expanded to include stickers and other elements‚Äìbut they come with annoying notifications about new Tapbacks. Foundry Foundry Great! They‚Äôre fun! But they also generate, by default, an additional notification and a haptic tap every time a new one is made. And that means that the average post in a group text thread will now generate three, four, five, or more notifications‚Äìbecause it includes not just the post, but notifications for every single reaction. Right now there‚Äôs not a lot a person can do about this. I don‚Äôt want to turn off all notifications from Messages, of course, because some messages are more important than others. I also don‚Äôt always want to go to the extreme of silencing an entire group chat, because then I‚Äôve got no indication that something is going on that I need to know about. (This happens a lot with a silenced family group I‚Äôm in, where I will sometimes glance at the Messages icon and see the indication that 15 messages have somehow come in when I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.) What‚Äôs a Messages user to do? What I‚Äôm doing is begging Apple to consider adding more granular controls over notifications, and also to apply Apple Intelligence more directly to my group chats. More than all or nothing We all need more control over how Messages notifies us about goings on in our individual chats and group threads. First off, it would be great if I could specify that I wanted to be notified when new messages appeared in a chat, but not when a new tapback reaction arrived. The reaction multiplier in active chats is just too much for me to bear sometimes. Perhaps Apple Intelligence can be applied to notifications for Messages. Perhaps Apple Intelligence can be applied to notifications for Messages.Apple Perhaps Apple Intelligence can be applied to notifications for Messages.Apple Apple Managing notifications should also be smarter. I‚Äôd like to be able to mute notifications for a chat for some time, so I can get back to work and catch up on the chat later. Sure, I can set a Focus mode, but again‚Ä¶ that seems like a workaround when there‚Äôs a more direct way to solve the problem. Namely, ‚ÄúStop bugging me about this chat for an hour.‚Äù Even better, what about using some intelligence‚Äìyou can even brand it as an Apple Intelligence feature if you want, Apple‚Äìto reduce the number of notifications in an ongoing chat? Imagine some clever software analyzing the incoming messages and realizing that there have been 10 posts and 25 emoji reactions in a chat in the last few minutes and that maybe it‚Äôs worth waiting until things settle down a little before summarizing what‚Äôs going on? Apple Intelligence can summarize messages, but I wonder if it could use that analysis to be more aggressive in calming down out-of-control threads. Consider the new Reduce Interruptions Focus mode, and apply it to specific Messages threads. I love that Apple Intelligence can summarize‚Ä¶ well, just about everything. If a thread I‚Äôm on has a huge number of messages and reactions in it, I don‚Äôt necessarily need a play-by-play, nor do I want to permanently mute all notifications from that thread. What about allowing me to subscribe to occasional updates from a thread? That way, if my Family Chat thread suddenly generates a huge flurry of responses‚Äìthis generally happens once a week or so when my brother-in-law posts a bunch of new cute photos of my niece‚ÄìI could continue working uninterrupted until, once everything has settled down, I get a single notification from my device: ‚ÄúMike sent new photos of Mia playing soccer; everyone agrees they are cute.‚Äù That sure beats seeing a message that 15 messages are unread or getting pummeled with dozens of sounds or vibrations over a five or 10-minute period as everyone reacts. Apple, what I‚Äôm saying is: You‚Äôve built a fun communication system with Messages, but your all-or-nothing notification system sucks. It‚Äôs time to apply some more intelligence to the matter, as well as give users more control, such as muting reactions or designating certain threads as ‚Äúsummarize only.‚Äù I love those emoji tapbacks, but I don‚Äôt want them to become so annoying that I end up turning them all off.",

The AirPods Pro do have ear tips, which are extensions of the earbud that fit into the opening of the ear canal. This design creates a seal for the ear canal that muffles outside sound.

The AirPods Pro 2 has the same force touch sensors, but the stems also allow for swipe motions to control volume, and you can hold the stems to switch listening modes.

The AirPods Pro 2 will soon have a new Hearing Air feature that allows the earphone to be used as over-the-counter hearing aids. The feature includes a Hearing Test and a Hearing Protection feature. This will be coming as a free firmware update by the end of 2024; if you already own AirPods 2, you don‚Äôt need to buy anything. The Hearing Air is not available for the AirPods 4. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 battery life The AirPods 4 earbuds last five hours on a full charge. The case stores 30 hours of charge. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation‚Äôs battery life is affected by the ANC feature: With ANC on all the time,¬†Apple states a four-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 20 hours of available charge in the case.¬† With ANC off all the time, Apple states a five-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 30 hours of available charge in the case.

While there are a lot of similarities between the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2, there are a few factors to consider. The obvious decision to make is whether you want Active Noise Cancellation. If not, your only choice is the AirPods 4. If you do want it, then you need to choose between the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2. (You can always turn off ANC if you don‚Äôt want to use it.) If you do want Active Noise Cancellation, decide whether you want ear tips or not. If you think ear tips are uncomfortable or don‚Äôt like the effect they have on sound, then the AirPods 4 with ANC are for you. If you‚Äôre fine with ear tips or want to maximize the effect of ANC, then the AirPods Pro 2 are your pick. Maybe, instead you‚Äôre most concerned with fit and you‚Äôre fine with either ear tips or no ear tips. The AirPods Pro 2‚Äôs ear tips help secure the ear buds in your ear. Apple says the AirPods 4 fit better than ever, but they still sit at the opening of your ear canal and are not as secure as the AirPods Pro 2. The only way to insure a proper fit is to try them on before a purchase. If you absolutely want ear tips, your only choice is the AirPods Pro 2. If you have ruled out the AirPods Pro 2 and are deciding between the two AirPods 4 models, the major difference (beside ANC, which you don‚Äôt have to use) is the charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC‚Äôs case supports wireless charging and has a Find My speaker for alerts. Ask yourself, is the extra $50/¬£50 worth ANC, wireless charging, and Find My alerts? If you want to use the AirPods as a hearing aid, the AirPods Pro 2 is your choice. Keep in mind that that this feature isn‚Äôt available yet and will require a free firmware update that you can do on a Wi-Fi network at home. One last consideration is price. The prices in this article are Apple‚Äôs list prices; you can often find price reductions at third-party retailers such as Amazon. In fact, the AirPods Pro 2 are often on sale for $190/¬£190, just $10/¬£10 more than the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. If you are okay with ear tips, then the AirPods Pro 2 can be had at a good price.",

As part of Prime Day, Amazon has cut the price of the Beats Pill down to $100, a booming 33 percent ($50) off, which is an impressive discount. In our review of the Beats Pill, our expert gave it a 4-star rating, praising the decent volume and sound for its size and the fantastic battery life. ‚ÄúThe weatherproofing, relatively loud volume, and fantastic battery life all make this a really great affordable speaker for hanging out by the pool, listening to some tunes while grilling, or improving the vibe inside your tent the next time you go camping,‚Äù we wrote. Indeed, this speaker is great to take by the pool or to the beach because it comes with an IP67 rating for dust and water. Since you can slip it on a lanyard, you can carry it with you a lot easier, while the soft-grip silicone allows you to get a good hold of it. This is a speaker that works with both Android and iOS devices, so you won‚Äôt have any problems if you‚Äôre not in the Apple universe. So grab yourself one of these Beats Pill speakers for $100 at Amazon and enjoy a marvelous Prime Day deal. Snatch the Beats Pill for its best price everBuy it now at Amazon",

    "description": "Macworld Even at $249, the AirPods Pro 2 have been one of the best noise-canceling earbuds you can buy ever since they arrived in 2023, and with the upcoming Hearing Health features that provide the world‚Äôs first software-enabled Hearing Aid feature, they can also help with hearing loss. And today, they‚Äôre a bargain too: Amazon is selling the AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C charging case for $169, a savings of $80, and the lowest price we‚Äôve ever seen. The AirPods Pro design hasn‚Äôt changed since the original model arrived in 2019 other than a USB-C case instead of Lightning, but it has a slew of upgrades inside. The AirPods Pro 2 have longer battery life (6 hours vs 4.5 hours), better audio quality, and 2X noise cancellation with Adaptive Transparency mode. And this latest model also brings IP54¬†water and dust resistance as well as lossless audio when paired with Vision Pro. In our 4.5-star review, we praised the AirPods Pro 2‚Äôs upgrades, concluding that¬†¬†‚Äúthe sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par.‚Äù And now, the price is just right so go grab a pair.

Whether you‚Äôre buying your first pair of AirPods or upgrading the trusty ‚Äòbuds you have used every day for years, Amazon‚Äôs twice-yearly Prime Day sales are a great time to look for a discount. Many Apple products are rarely on sale, and when they do go on sale they‚Äôre barely at a discount at all. AirPods are an exception: As long as they‚Äôre not a just-released model, they‚Äôre almost always available at a discount from the official retail price. And when big sales events come around, like Prime Day or Black Friday, you can often save 25 percent or more. Amazon is one of the best places to look for AirPods deals, and we are already seeing some excellent discounts during the Prime Day event which runs from October 8 to midnight on October 9. We‚Äôll keep this article updated throughout Prime Day so you can quickly find the best deal. The AirPods picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We‚Äôve reviewed everything we recommend and we won‚Äôt tell you to buy something that‚Äôs not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we‚Äôve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we‚Äôve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction‚Äîand save you big bucks.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

We all wanted his attention and approval, and that drove us to do better work ‚Äî even those of us who never worked at Apple. Nobody replaced him in this role. Nobody can. But as an outsider who had no personal relationship with him to mourn, it has been most depressing to consider how much of his work the world missed out on. He wasn‚Äôt taken from us after a long, complete life ‚Äî¬†he was taken in his prime. He had so much more to offer the world.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2021/09/13/future-of-the-app-store",
    "description": "After the dust settles from the developer class-action settlement, the South Korean law, the JFTC announcement, and the Apple v. Epic decision, I think the most likely long-term outcome isn‚Äôt very different from the status quo ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a good thing. Allowing external purchases Here‚Äôs what I think we‚Äôll end up with: Apple will still require apps to use their IAP system for any qualifying purchases that occur in the apps themselves. All app types will be allowed to link out to a browser for other purchase methods. Most apps will be required to also offer IAP side-by-side with any external methods.1 Only ‚ÄúReader apps‚Äù will be exempt from this requirement.2 Apple will have many rules regarding the display, descriptions, and behavior of external purchases, many of which will be unpublished and ever-changing. App Review will be extremely harsh, inconsistent, capricious, petty, and punitive with their enforcement.3 Apple won‚Äôt require price-matching between IAP and external purchases. These few but important corrections reduce Apple‚Äôs worst behavior and should relieve most regulatory pressure. The result won‚Äôt look much different than the status quo: Most big media apps (qualifying as ‚Äúreader‚Äù apps) won‚Äôt offer IAP, but will finally be allowed to link to their websites from their apps and offer purchases there. Many games will offer both IAP and external purchases, with the external choice offering a discount, bonus gems, extra loot boxes, or other manipulative tricks to optimize the profitability of casino games for children (commissions from which have been the largest portion of Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúservices revenue‚Äù to date). Most importantly, many products, services, and business models will become possible that previously weren‚Äôt, leading to more apps, more competition, and more money going to more places. External purchase methods will evolve to be almost as convenient as IAP (especially if Apple Pay is permitted in this context), and payment processors will reduce the burden of manual credit-card entry with shared credentials available across multiple apps. The payment-fraud doomsday scenarios argued by Apple and many fans mostly won‚Äôt happen, in part because App Review will prevent most obvious cases, but also because parents don‚Äôt typically offer their credit cards to untrustworthy children; and for buyers of all ages, most credit cards themselves provide stronger fraud prevention and easier recourse from unwanted charges than the App Store ever has. No side-loading I don‚Äôt expect side-loading or alternative app stores to become possible, and I‚Äôm relieved, because that is not a future I want for iOS. When evaluating such ideas, I merely ask myself: ‚ÄúWhat would Facebook do?‚Äù Facebook owns four of the top ten apps in the world. If side-loading became possible, Facebook could remove Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger from Apple‚Äôs App Store, requiring customers to install these extremely popular apps directly from Facebook via side-loading. And everyone would. Most people use a Facebook-owned app not because it‚Äôs a good app, but because it‚Äôs a means to an important end in their life. Social pressure, family pressure, and network lock-in prevent most users from seeking meaningful alternatives. People would jump through a few hoops if they had to. Facebook would soon have apps that bypassed App Review installed on the majority of iPhones in the world. Technical limitations of the OS would prevent the most egregious abuses, but there‚Äôs a lot they could still do. We don‚Äôt need to do much imagining ‚Äî they already have attempted multiple hacks, workarounds, privacy invasions, and other unscrupulous and technically invasive behavior with their apps over time to surveil user behavior outside of their app and stay running longer in the background than users intend or expect. The OS could evolve over time to reduce some of these vulnerabilities, but technical measures alone cannot address all of them. Without the threat of App Review to keep them in check, Facebook‚Äôs apps would become even more monstrous than they already are. As a user and a fan of iOS, I don‚Äôt want any part of that. No alternative app stores Alternative app stores would be even worse. Rather than offering individual apps via side-loading, Facebook could offer just one: The Facebook App Store. Instagram, WhatsApp, the Facebook app, and Messenger could all be available exclusively there. The majority of iOS users in the world would soon install it, and Facebook would start using leverage in other areas ‚Äî apps‚Äô social accounts, stats packages, app-install ads, ad-attribution requirements ‚Äî to heavily incentivize (and likely strong-arm) a huge number of developers to offer their apps in the Facebook App Store, likely in addition to Apple‚Äôs. Maybe I‚Äôd be required to add the Facebook SDK to my app in order to be in their store, which they would then use to surveil my users. Maybe I‚Äôd need to buy app-install ads to show up in search there at all. Maybe I‚Äôd need to pay Facebook to ‚Äúpromote‚Äù each app update to reach more than a tiny percentage of my existing customers. And Facebook wouldn‚Äôt even be the only app store likely to become a large player on iOS. Amazon would almost certainly bring their garbage ‚ÄúAppstore‚Äù to iOS, but at least that one probably wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere. Maybe Google would bring the Play Store to iOS and offer a unified SDK to develop a single codebase for iOS and Android, effectively making every app feel like an Android app and further marginalizing native apps when they‚Äôre already hurting. Media conglomerates that own many big-name properties, like Disney, might each have their own app stores for their high-profile apps. Running your own store means you can promote all of your own apps as much as you want. What giant corporation would resist? Don‚Äôt forget games! Epic and Steam would come to iOS with their own game stores. Maybe Microsoft and Nintendo, too. Maybe you‚Äôd need to install seven different app stores on your iPhone just to get the apps and games you already use ‚Äî and all without App Review to keep them in check. Most developers would probably need to start submitting our apps to multiple app stores, each with its own rules, metadata, technical requirements, capabilities, approval delays, payment processing, stats, crash reports, ads, promotion methods, and user reviews. As a user, a multiple-app-store world sounds like an annoying mess; as a developer, it terrifies me. Apple‚Äôs App Store is the devil we know. The most viable alternatives that would crop up would be far worse. Course correction The way Apple runs its business isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs also not a democracy. I loved this part of Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers‚Äô decision in Apple v. Epic, as quoted by Ben Thompson‚Äôs excellent article that you should read: Apple has not offered any justification for the actions other than to argue entitlement. Where its actions harm competition and result in supracompetitive pricing and profits, Apple is wrong. I interpret ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù without a negative connotation here ‚Äî Apple is entitled to run their platform mostly as they wish, with governmental interference only warranted to fix market-scale issues that harm large segments of commerce or society. As a developer, I‚Äôd love to see more changes to Apple‚Äôs control over iOS. But it‚Äôs hard to make larger changes without potentially harming much of what makes iOS great for both users and developers. Judge Gonzalez Rogers got it right: we needed a minor course correction to address the most egregiously anticompetitive behavior, but most of the way Apple runs iOS is best left to Apple. If the South Korean law holds, IAP may not be required ‚Äî but only in South Korea. With this exception, I expect the rest of these rules to be enforced the same way globally.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Apple defines ‚Äúreader‚Äù apps as ‚Äú[allowing] a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video).‚Äù This includes many apps that Apple‚Äôs services compete with, such as Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle, that raise anticompetitive concerns among regulators and legislators when forced to give Apple 30%.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é App Review has higher-level queues for managerial review of controversial rules or edge cases, typically identifiable from the outside by an app stuck with ‚ÄúIn Review‚Äù status for days or weeks, and often ending in a phone call from ‚ÄúBill‚Äù. I‚Äôd expect any app offering external purchases to have a very high chance of being escalated to a slower, more pain-in-the-ass review process, possibly causing it not to be worthwhile for most small developers to deal with. I have no plans to add external purchases to Overcast for multiple reasons, including this ‚Äî but mostly because, for my purposes, I‚Äôm satisfied with Apple‚Äôs IAP system.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "description": "Apple‚Äôs leaders continue to deny developers of two obvious truths: That our apps provide substantial value to iOS beyond the purchase commissions collected by Apple. That any portion of our customers came to our apps from our own marketing or reputation, rather than the App Store. For Apple to continue to deny these is dishonest, factually wrong, and extremely insulting ‚Äî¬†not only to our efforts, but to the intelligence of all Apple developers and customers. This isn‚Äôt about the 30%, or the 15%, or the prohibition of other payment systems, or the rules against telling our customers about our websites, or Apple‚Äôs many other restrictions. (Not today, at least.) It‚Äôs about what Apple‚Äôs leadership thinks of us and our work. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* It isn‚Äôt the App Store‚Äôs responsibility to the rest of Apple to ‚Äúpay its way‚Äù by leveraging hefty fees on certain types of transactions. Modern society has come to rely so heavily on mobile apps that any phone manufacturer must ensure that such a healthy ecosystem exists as table stakes for anyone to buy their phones. Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today. If Apple wishes to continue advancing bizarre corporate-accounting arguments, the massive profits from the hardware business are what therefore truly ‚Äúpay the way‚Äù of the App Store, public APIs, developer tools, and other app-development resources, just as the hardware profits must fund the development of Apple‚Äôs own hardware, software, and services that make the iPhone appeal to customers. The forced App Store commissions, annual developer fees, and App Store Search Ads income are all just gravy. The ‚Äúway‚Äù is already paid by the hardware ‚Äî¬†but Apple uses their position of power to double-dip. And that‚Äôs just business. Apple‚Äôs a lot of things, and ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù isn‚Äôt one. But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple‚Äôs feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* Apple further extends the value argument, and defends their justification for forced commissions, by claiming responsibility for and ownership of the customer relationship between all iOS users and each app they choose to use. This argument only makes sense ‚Äî¬†and even then, only somewhat ‚Äî when apps are installed by a customer browsing the App Store, finding an app they hadn‚Äôt previously heard of, and choosing to install it based on App Store influence alone. But in the common case ‚Äî¬†and for most app installations, the much more common case ‚Äî¬†of searching for a specific app by name or following a link or ad based on its developer‚Äôs own marketing or reputation, Apple has served no meaningful role in the customer acquisition and ‚Äúdeserves‚Äù nothing more from the transaction than what a CDN and commodity credit-card processor would charge. The idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy. It isn‚Äôt the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS ‚Äî¬†it‚Äôs the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would‚Äôve. The App Store is merely one platform‚Äôs forced distribution gateway, ‚Äúfacilitating‚Äù the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* At WWDC next week, these same people are going to try to tell us a different story. They‚Äôre going to tell us how amazing we are, how important our work is, and how much they value us. And for thousands of Apple employees who‚Äôve made the great products and platforms that we love, including the hundreds of engineers presenting the sessions and working the labs, it‚Äôll be genuine and true. But the leaders have already shown us who they really are, what they really think of us, and how much they value our work. Please forgive some sloppiness in my metaphors or phrasing ‚Äî my writing skills are pretty rusty ‚Äî and I‚Äôll return the favor to anyone who responds.",

    "description": "A summary of today‚Äôs changes to 3.1.3 Other Purchase Methods: Your app must use Apple‚Äôs in-app-purchase (IAP) system for all purchases made in the app. Unless they‚Äôre purchases for goods or services that are consumed outside the app, in which case you are prohibited from using IAP. Unless those goods or services consumed outside the app are magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, in which case, you are required to use IAP. But if your app only ‚Äúreads‚Äù previously purchased magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video, and doesn‚Äôt mention the possibility of purchases anywhere in the app, you don‚Äôt need to use IAP. Unless you offer account creation, in which case, you are required to use IAP. Unless you only offer free account creation, in which case, you don‚Äôt need to use IAP. But if you offer paid upgrades from free accounts within the app, you are required to use IAP. Except for accounts that were created outside the app, which can offer paid account upgrades and don‚Äôt need to use IAP. If you‚Äôre selling ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù between people, you don‚Äôt need to use IAP. Unless those ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù include three or more people, or aren‚Äôt consumed live, in which case, you are required to use only IAP. If your purchase is for services, features, or game items, you are required to use only IAP. Unless you operate on multiple platforms, in which case, you can also offer purchasing outside the app. But you can‚Äôt tell anyone about it. Unless you get their contact info somewhere else, in which case, you can tell them about it, but not in the app. You are required to use IAP even if you sell your app or service directly to other people. Unless you only sell it to businesses or groups for their employees or students to use, in which case, you still must use IAP, but you can include your own payment method as well. Unless those groups are families, or unless those employees or students are somehow ‚Äúconsumers‚Äù, in which case, you must only use IAP. Do I have that right? *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* How about an alternative that‚Äôs clear, fair, reasonable, and consistently enforceable? Apps may offer other payment mechanisms in their app, as long as terms are clear and customers aren‚Äôt misled, and may or may not choose to implement in-app purchase based on its merits. In one stroke, antitrust and regulatory pressure disappear, developer relations are significantly repaired, and Apple can go back to spending its time, resources, PR, and political capital on making their products better and customers happier.",

    "title": "Introducing Voice Boost 2: Remaster your podcasts",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/31/voiceboost2",
    "description": "The latest update to Overcast includes a feature that I‚Äôm especially proud of that took over a year to build. Voice Boost 2 is an all-new audio engine that includes professional-grade, mastering-quality loudness normalization. When I first introduced Overcast in 2014, Voice Boost was one of its headlining features: Voice Boost is a combination of dynamic compression and equalization that can make many shows more listenable and normalize volume across all shows. This makes amateur-produced podcasts (including many of my favorites) more listenable in loud environments, like cars, where you‚Äôd otherwise need to crank the volume so loudly to hear the quiet parts that you‚Äôd blow your ears out when the loudest person spoke. Voice Boost 2 achieves the same goal as the original Voice Boost, but with dramatically more sophisticated methods, leading to more consistent results and much better sound quality. Goals When I wrote the original Voice Boost with only a rudimentary understanding of audio processing, it was a single configuration of Apple‚Äôs AudioUnits that applied a fixed set of parameters to all podcasts, regardless of their audio characteristics. It was an effective but blunt tool, relying on aggressive level compression and a strong EQ to make the compression less noticeable. Since then, I‚Äôve edited over 500 podcasts, learned a lot more about how to master them properly, and developed a much better understanding of audio signal processing. I set out to develop a better, smarter, and more refined Voice Boost that took advantage of everything I‚Äôd learned, with these audio goals: The effect should be much more subtle: mostly just consistent volume, plus slightly smoother tone. It should analyze the input audio and apply just enough processing to achieve a consistent volume level, modifying already-good audio as little as possible. It should sound good, and consistent, regardless of the volume dynamics of its input. Quality should be so good that I can even play high-quality music through it1 and not notice any artifacts. And these technical goals: Like Smart Speed and the original Voice Boost, it had to work as a streaming process, easily toggled on and off at will, without needing to scan the entire file first or look very far ahead. The code had to be pure C, with highly optimized and vectorized code, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a major power drain on older phones and could potentially run on much lower-power devices as well. I had to write every component from scratch, without using AudioUnits, because I wanted to understand and control everything, ensure the highest performance and sound quality, and avoid Apple‚Äôs platform-specific API limits.2 It had to be modular and easily customizable, like a channel strip in an audio editor, so I could adjust the processing during development and testing, offer user customization down the road, and use the same engine to build myself a modular podcast-preproduction tool to save time in my weekly workflow (which I‚Äôve been using for over a year).3 Live LUFS normalization Since Voice Boost is mostly about high-quality volume analysis and loudness normalization, I went straight to the top, implementing the ITU BS.1770‚Äì4 standard that gives us the LUFS measurement seen in high-end audio editors. Overcast now measures and adjusts podcast levels using this broadcast-standard perceptual loudness algorithm, at full quality, with no preprocessing. Voice Boost 2 normalizes all podcasts to ‚Äì14¬†LUFS ‚Äî a level I chose because it closely matches the volume of Siri and most iOS turn-by-turn navigation voices, so when you‚Äôre listening to a podcast while driving, navigation interruptions are less jarring. Most professionally produced podcasts are already mastered to similar volume levels, so Voice Boost 2 won‚Äôt overcompress them with aggressive processing ‚Äî it‚Äôll only apply as much correction as necessary to make them all the same volume. A brief tutorial on clipping and distortion This is about to get nerdier, but bear with me. (Yes, nerdier than ITU broadcast-loudness standards.) Given a loudness measurement for the incoming audio, quieter podcasts need to be amplified to reach the target. But perceived loudness isn‚Äôt the peak of the incoming audio stream ‚Äî it‚Äôs more of an average. Quiet-sounding audio can still have brief moments of loud peaks. When increasing the volume of digital audio, the biggest challenge is not ‚Äúclipping‚Äù during the peaks ‚Äî not having any part of the signal pass above the volume ceiling of 0 dB. (It‚Äôs a negative scale. This is also why the LUFS value above, which is closely related to the decibel scale used here, is negative.) Here‚Äôs the highest the signal should go, showing the individual audio samples (green dots) that can be processed by a podcast app before the DAC transforms them into audio (smooth green line): It‚Äôll sound right as long as the audio doesn‚Äôt cross above that top line (0 dB). Increase the volume even slightly too far, and some of the samples just slam into it and stay there, losing the tops of their smooth curves: And that sounds terrible. But I can‚Äôt just cap all the samples right below the limit and call it a day ‚Äî that‚Äôs called a brickwall limiter ‚Äî because then the shape of the audio line will actually represent different frequencies, telling the DAC to add noise that wasn‚Äôt really there. Here, the bottom of each image shows the frequency breakdown: The unclipped signal (left) shows only its original frequency of about 2100 Hz, but a basic brickwall limiter (right) results in the unwanted introduction of a bunch of extra frequencies. That‚Äôs distortion. (If this is interesting to you, learn more about audio sampling theory here.) Lookahead limiter Avoiding audible distortion requires a lookahead limiter, which looks‚Ä¶ ahead (üòé) at the audio coming down the pipeline, and smoothly ramps the volume amplification down as a loud peak is approaching, then back up again afterward, just enough to avoid clipping and audible distortion, but so quickly that you don‚Äôt notice.4 After Voice Boost 2‚Äôs complete 32-bit audio processing pipeline, the last stage is a lookahead limiter, configured such that it can‚Äôt clip, no matter what audio comes through. This gives vast flexibility in volume processing without sacrificing quality. Voice Boost 2 also incorporates a dynamics compressor, but over time, I‚Äôve kept reducing its strength as I‚Äôve found it less necessary. Proper LUFS processing with a great lookahead limiter provides excellent volume normalization with almost no compression needed afterward. True-peak detection There‚Äôs one more way to introduce clipping that needs to be guarded against. Digital audio is represented by samples that represent a point in time (green dots, again) on a sound wave (green line). But the sampled points don‚Äôt always land at the exact peaks of those waves: The most common way to measure the peak of a waveform is to find the greatest absolute sample value. By this method, the top waveform peaks here would measure about ‚Äì6 dB and ‚Äì1.5 dB, respectively. But the actual peak amplitudes of these waves is ‚Äì1 dB! A simple limiter could still output clipped audio because it‚Äôs not seeing the true peaks. Voice Boost 2‚Äôs limiter performs true-peak detection, rather than simply measuring sample peaks, to avoid this type of clipping and further reduce distortion. Mastering-quality processing for everyone Voice Boost 2 is a mastering-quality audio-processing pipeline that applies broadcast-standard loudness normalization, light compression and EQ, and a true-peak lookahead limiter to your podcasts, in real time, without sacrificing quality or battery life. And it runs at less than 1% CPU usage on an iPhone¬†SE.5 I intend to expose some of its customizability to customers in future updates, but I wanted to develop and ship the best default settings first to keep the app simple and usable to everyone. Now that it‚Äôs available to everyone, I may still subtly tweak the defaults in response to feedback. But as I‚Äôve refined the settings during the beta period to be more universal, less customization has been necessary.6 Having achieved its goals of being more consistent and less aggressive, Voice Boost 2 is intentionally transparent. It‚Äôs not promoted more in the app or even labeled ‚ÄúVoice Boost 2‚Äù. It‚Äôs still Voice Boost ‚Äî just better now. If I did my job well, you‚Äôll hardly notice it at all. You‚Äôll have no idea that your podcasts are being remastered in your pocket. But I‚Äôll know. And the handful of you who really care will know. And that‚Äôs enough for me. Voice Boost 2 is in today‚Äôs update (2020.1), along with these new features: AirPlay 2: Overcast can now play to HomePods and other AirPlay 2 devices much more responsively, with full-blown Smart Speed and Voice Boost, on iOS 13.1 and above.7 Skip intros/outros: There‚Äôs a new per-podcast setting to skip a given number of seconds from the start and/or end of its episodes. Clip-sharing from private feeds. In retrospect, this restriction was unnecessary, so I lifted it. Restored iOS 12 compatibility. Going 13-only so soon was a mistake. Hear why on Under The Radar 181 and 183. As usual, all of this is free for everyone in Overcast. Those awesome Trey Anastasio acoustic shows are pretty quiet.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Apple doesn‚Äôt make all of their audio APIs available on all platforms: some are Mac-only and never came to iOS, and watchOS has an even smaller subset than iOS. The more I can accomplish in my own code, the less I depend on Apple‚Äôs choices for which APIs they make available to developers.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é It‚Äôs just a command-line tool for now. You don‚Äôt want it. (But if you do‚Ä¶ someday, maybe.)¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é This all happens in milliseconds.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é At 1X, with Smart Speed enabled. Smart Speed was actually entirely rewritten as part of Voice Boost 2, but it‚Äôs less interesting. It performs the same job as before, but much more efficiently, and taking advantage of the measured loudness when Voice Boost is also enabled.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é For instance, I also built a de-esser into Voice Boost 2, but it slowly became unnecessary as I improved the other processing, so it‚Äôs not currently enabled.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Smart Speed is a big deal here, I think ‚Äî I‚Äôm not aware of any other podcast apps with silence-skipping over AirPlay 2. (Or LUFS normalization, or true-peak lookahead limiters.)¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux",
    "description": "In light of today‚Äôs rumor that a Pro Mode may be coming that seems to offer benefits in the opposite direction,1 I wanted to re-make the case for a Low Power Mode on macOS ‚Äî and explain why now is the time. Modern hardware constantly pushes thermal and power limits, trying to strike a balance that minimizes noise and heat while maximizing performance and battery life. Software also plays a role, trying to keep everything background-updated, content-indexed, and photo-analyzed so it‚Äôs ready for us when we want it, but not so aggressively that we notice any cost to performance or battery life. Apple‚Äôs customers don‚Äôt usually have control over these balances, and they‚Äôre usually fixed at design time with little opportunity to adapt to changing circumstances or customer priorities. The sole exception, Low Power Mode on iOS, seems to be a huge hit: by offering a single toggle that chooses a different balance, people are able to greatly extend their battery life when they know they‚Äôll need it.2 Mac laptops need Low Power Mode, too. I believe so strongly in its potential because I‚Äôve been using it on my laptops (in a way) for years, and it‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôve been disabling Intel Turbo Boost on my laptops with Turbo Boost Switcher Pro most of the time since 2015. In 2018, I first argued for Low Power Mode on macOS with a list of possible tweaks, concluding that disabling Turbo Boost was still the best bang-for-the-buck tweak to improve battery life without a noticeable performance cost in most tasks.3 Recently, as Intel has crammed more cores and higher clocks into smaller form factors and pushed thermal limits to new extremes, the gains have become even more significant. Here‚Äôs some thermal testing from my 8-core 16-inch MacBook Pro: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 16-inch MacBook Pro (Late 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core i9) ¬† Power Temp. Geekbench¬†5 single/multi xcodebuild Normal 82W 90¬∞C 1260/7386 39 sec. No Turbo 31W‚àí62% 65¬∞C 669/5206‚àí46/29% 62 sec.+59% With Turbo Boost disabled, peak CPU power consumption drops by 62%, with a correspondingly huge reduction in temperature. This has two massive benefits: The fans never audibly spin up. When Turbo Boost is enabled, the fans annoyingly spin up every time the system is under a heavy sustained load. Disable it, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to get them to be audible. It runs significantly cooler. Turbo Boost lets laptops get too hot to comfortably hold in your lap, and so much heat radiates out that it can make hands sweaty. Disable it, and the laptop only gets moderately warm, not hot, and hands stay comfortably dry. I haven‚Äôt done formal battery testing on the 16-inch, since it‚Äôs so difficult and time-consuming to do in a controlled way that‚Äôs actually useful to people, but anecdotally, I‚Äôm seeing similar battery gains by disabling Turbo Boost that I‚Äôve seen with previous laptops: significantly longer battery life that I‚Äôd estimate to be between 30‚Äì50%. This comes at a cost to performance, but: It‚Äôs not noticeable on most workloads. Parallel workloads are affected far less than single-threaded tasks, and most modern heavy workloads are parallelized. This is an 8-core laptop that‚Äôs competitive with my iMac Pro! It‚Äôs much faster than most people need (myself included) most of the time, so I can spare some performance to get other benefits. A fast laptop isn‚Äôt very useful if your hands are too sweaty to type, the battery dies in the middle of a flight, or the loud fans ruin your audio recording. When I really want to maximize performance, Turbo Boost Switcher Pro lets me quickly toggle it in the menu bar, so switching between modes is easy. The vast majority of the time I‚Äôm using it, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a much better laptop with Turbo Boost disabled. It‚Äôs still fast enough to do everything I need (including significant development with Xcode), while remaining silent and cool, with incredible battery life. But soon, I bet I won‚Äôt be able to do this anymore. Turbo Boost Switcher Pro relies on a kernel extension that‚Äôs grandfathered into Apple‚Äôs latest security requirements, but it can never be updated ‚Äî and when macOS Catalina loads it for the first time, it warns that it‚Äôll be ‚Äúincompatible with a future version of macOS.‚Äù I suspect that this is the last year I‚Äôll get to run the latest OS and be able to turn off Turbo Boost at will, making all of my future laptop usage significantly worse. Please, Apple, make this feature official: give us a Low Power Mode for macOS that disables Turbo Boost to keep our laptops cool, quiet, and long-lasting at times when those are more important to us than speed. My guess is that ‚ÄúPro Mode‚Äù doesn‚Äôt raise the peak performance, but instead raises the fan speeds to allow longer sustained operation at high Turbo Boost speeds.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Low Power Mode has been so successful on iOS that Apple also thought it worthwhile to add a Low Data Mode to iOS 13, offering similar control over data usage. (Mac owners can get similar functionality with the excellent TripMode.)¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é As I wrote back then, disabling discrete GPUs and Photos analysis are other obvious contributors to a good Mac Low Power Mode.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/11/13/mbp16",
    "description": "After my first day with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, I‚Äôm very optimistic about it. üéß¬†¬†Hear more on today‚Äôs Accidental Tech Podcast! Two years ago, I wrote a wishlist to fix the MacBook Pro, and the 16-inch doesn‚Äôt actually deliver most of it. But time and technological progress are slowly getting Apple off the hook: The ports are unchanged. We‚Äôll still need dongles. But USB-C is gradually becoming more common, and dongles are slowly ‚Äî very slowly ‚Äî getting less shitty. The Touch Bar isn‚Äôt optional. But a new hardware Esc key removes one of its biggest drawbacks, and accidental input should be reduced by the increased spacing between the Touch Bar and the top row of keys. The power brick still lacks its previous conveniences. There‚Äôs still no cable management, safety breakaway, or charging LED. But third parties are slowly filling some of these gaps. The headphone jack is still on the right (wrong) side, despite most single-sided headphone cables entering the left earcup. But the need for wired headphones is decreasing over time. Addressing those would be nice, but as I wrote then, they paled in comparison to one huge issue: the butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro must return to scissor keyswitches. If Apple only changes one thing about the next MacBook Pro, it should be this. It‚Äôs far more important than anything else on this list. [‚Ä¶] The Magic Keyboard‚Äôs scissor switches feel similar, but with a bit more travel, and all of the reliability and resilience of previous keyboard generations. [‚Ä¶] The Magic Keyboard only needs one change to be perfect for the MacBook Pro: returning to the ‚Äúinverted-T‚Äù arrow-key arrangement by making the left- and right-arrow keys half-height again. This arrangement is much more natural and less error-prone because we can align our fingers by feeling the ‚ÄúT‚Äù shape, a crucial affordance for such frequently used keys that are so far from the home row. That‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôve done, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. The new 16-inch MacBook Pro is a great computer in most other ways, but so were the MacBook Pros from the last few years. They were fast, powerful, capable workstations‚Ä¶ but the butterfly keyboard took away from it all. Not anymore. I‚Äôm on cloud nine. Look at this glorious keyboard! An Esc key! Inverted-T arrow keys! A millimeter of key travel! Enough spacing between the keys for our fingers to accurately orient themselves! And keystrokes will probably work, 100% of the time, for years! Five years ago, nobody would‚Äôve considered any of these noteworthy, and readers would‚Äôve suspected you weren‚Äôt of sound mind if you included them in a review. Five years ago, laptop keyboards were fine. Everyone was pretty much satisfied with the ones they had, they worked, and we never had to talk or think about them. Today, finally, we begin heading back to that world. The butterfly keyboard was an anomaly ‚Äî it was a huge departure from everything else we‚Äôd ever used, mostly not in good ways. The new keyboard is very similar to the recent desktop Magic Keyboard, and I expect it to have a wide appeal, just as the Magic Keyboard does. It has slightly less travel and spacing, but the overall feeling is very similar ‚Äî and it‚Äôs nothing at all like the butterfly keyboard. I absolutely love it ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs the most amazing keyboard in the world, but because it‚Äôs completely forgettable in the best possible way. It just feels normal again. There‚Äôs a lot more to love about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The screen and battery are bigger, but the size and weight barely increased. It‚Äôs almost as fast as my iMac Pro, and the new thermals can sustain higher performance. The speakers and microphone got huge, unexpected improvements. And I didn‚Äôt get everything I wanted. But many of my wishlist items fall outside of what Apple is likely to ever do, and all of them are much less important than making the computer‚Äôs primary input device functional, acceptable, and reliable. Now we have the luxury of being able to complain about less-urgent wishes. The biggest change is that I finally don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs constantly fighting me. Its design doesn‚Äôt feel spiteful. It‚Äôs a computer that doesn‚Äôt seem to hate being a computer. I‚Äôm not afraid to use it in the world, and I‚Äôm not avoiding using it because it‚Äôs unpleasant. The butterfly keyboard was the opposite, it never got better, I never got used to it, and good riddance to it. Following in the footsteps of the fantastic iMac Pro, updated Mac Mini, and upcoming Mac Pro, the release of the 16-inch MacBook Pro ends a painful chapter of neglect and hubristic design of the Mac. Apple has finally turned the ship around. We haven‚Äôt had long enough to fully test it yet. There may be flaws or shortcomings discovered over time ‚Äî there usually are (and always have been). But frankly, it could catch fire twice a week and it would still be my favorite laptop Apple has made since 2015. Fortunately, upon initial usage, nothing bad really jumps out. The new MacBook Pro has no massive asterisks or qualifications. It‚Äôs a great computer, period, and it feels so good to be able to say that again. For the first time in years, without any major exceptions, we can see that Apple loves computers as much as we do. üéß¬†¬†Much more detail and discussion in the podcast!",

    "description": "Today‚Äôs Overcast update (2019.6) brings some great new features. But first, I need to set low expectations for iOS 13, watchOS 6, and macOS Catalina updates this fall. Halfway through the summer, I‚Äôve made much less progress than expected, having been overwhelmed by the required OS changes, my own technical and design debts, and unusually rough betas. Rather than shipping a big iOS update, a standalone Watch app, and a Mac app on day one, these will probably come incrementally over the next year. Fortunately, I haven‚Äôt stopped improving the app in the meantime. Per-podcast customization, longer clips You can now set download-vs.-stream and auto-delete behavior per podcast, one of the most frequently requested features over the last few years. (Sorry it took so long ‚Äî it required a lot of server-side work for uninteresting reasons.) I‚Äôve also raised the clip-sharing length limit to 90 seconds. When I debuted this feature, I had to guess how it would be used and received, and 60 seconds seemed like a good limit. In practice, that‚Äôs sometimes a bit too short to capture a complete thought. 90 seconds should be better ‚Äî most clips won‚Äôt need to be that long, but it‚Äôll be nice to have the headroom when you need it. ‚ÄúSuggestions for You‚Äù replacing Twitter Overcast has had a Twitter-powered social-recommendations feature since version 1.0 in 2014, which made sense at the time: I didn‚Äôt have any popularity data to generate recommendations from, and social networks were nicer places to be than they are today. But after five years, only 10% of active users have connected a Twitter account in Overcast, and only 0.2% of new podcast subscriptions have actually been added via Twitter recommendations. Not only was the feature not providing much value to the 10% of people who enabled it, but the other 90% of Overcast‚Äôs customers haven‚Äôt been getting personalized recommendations at all. In the meantime, I‚Äôve accumulated five years of popularity data, so I tried writing my own recommendation engine. It worked ‚Äî and it‚Äôs better. Overcast now offers its own data-driven recommendation engine, and I‚Äôve removed Twitter integration entirely. Podcasts in the new ‚ÄúSuggestions for You‚Äù section of the Add Podcast screen are based on the shows you subscribe to, and what else their subscribers subscribe to, which gives much better recommendations without involving any social networks. Most importantly, it works for all of Overcast‚Äôs customers. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Give it a try.",

    "description": "Something big changed at Apple around the beginning of 2017. They had encountered significant turbulence in the product line over the preceding years, especially Macs. It was a rough time to be a pro Mac user. The ‚Äútrash can‚Äù 2013 Mac Pro addressed only a fraction of the needs solved by the previous ‚Äúcheese grater‚Äù towers, aged quickly without critical upgrade paths, and suffered from high GPU-failure rates from its cooling solution ‚Äî¬†all because its design prioritized size and appearance over performance and versatility in the one Mac model that should never make that tradeoff. Over the next few years, it became clear that the Mac Pro was an embarrassing, outdated flop that Apple seemed to have little intention of ever updating, leaving its customers feeling unheard and abandoned. I think Apple learned a small lesson from it, but they learned a much bigger one a few years later. The current MacBook Pro generation launched in late 2016, and I think Apple was truly caught completely by surprise when the new Touch Bar, sparse USB-C-only port offerings, high prices, and highly polarizing butterfly keyboard were met with harsh criticism, mixed reviews, and high failure rates. This one really hurt: while the Mac Pro is a niche machine for the highest-end and most-specialized needs, the popular MacBook Pro is the lifeblood of the Mac. By the end of 2016, in addition to the generally buggy, neglected state macOS seemed to be perpetually stuck in, Apple had replaced its entire ‚Äúpro‚Äù Mac lineup with controversial, limiting products that seemed optimized to flex Apple‚Äôs industrial-design muscles rather than actually addressing their customers‚Äô needs. The only company that can make computers for our OS seemed incapable of making good computers anymore. Each update threatened to remove or break things we needed or loved. Their newest designs felt punitive, rather than feeling like a celebration of computing. Then, in April 2017, out of nowhere, Apple held a Mac Pro roundtable discussion with the press to announce that they were in the early stages of completely redesigning the Mac Pro.1 The follow-up briefing a year later promised that the new Mac Pro would be released in 2019, and publicized the existence of a ‚ÄúPro Workflow Team‚Äù of real pro users working inside Apple to inform the direction of their pro hardware and software. It sounded like they‚Äôd gone from not listening to their customers at all to an institutionalized process of listening. And the newly designed Macs released since then have been great.2 The late-2017 iMac Pro, which I‚Äôm using to write this, is the best Mac I‚Äôve ever owned by far. It‚Äôs versatile, incredibly powerful, beautiful, and silent. It‚Äôs so good that I‚Äôll probably never really need a Mac Pro again,3 and if this was the only new ‚ÄúMac Pro‚Äù, I‚Äôd be mostly fine with that. The late-2018 Mac Mini replaced a pitiful, punitive, neglected relic with a practical, powerful mini-Mac-Pro. Apple could‚Äôve let it die, or replaced it with a tiny, no-port marvel of uselessness, but instead, they made a computer so good that I started and ended a YouTube mini-career just to review it. And the 2019 Mac Pro, finally unveiled last week, looks to be absolutely killer ‚Äî it‚Äôs the first true successor to the tower Mac Pro, which saw its last real update almost a decade ago in 2010.4 It‚Äôs big, bulky, ludicrously fast, and almost obscenely upgradeable ‚Äî¬†exactly what a Mac Pro needs to be, and far better than any of us expected. The new Mac Pro is, truly, a celebration of computing. Even more importantly than any hardware releases, macOS itself has also seen massive engineering effort recently. For the first time in a decade, the Mac was a major focus of WWDC, with great new APIs poised to usher in a huge wave of fresh software. To be fair, this story hasn‚Äôt ended yet. The Mac Pro isn‚Äôt actually out yet (and will be very expensive), they still need to resolve the problematic MacBook Pro with its next generation (rumors are promising), and the lack of standalone Apple displays under six thousand dollars really hurts the Mac Pro story.5 But I‚Äôm optimistic for the first time in years. It‚Äôs hard to tell when Apple is listening. They speak concisely, infrequently, and only when they‚Äôre ready, saying absolutely nothing in the meantime, even when we‚Äôre all screaming about a product line as if it‚Äôs on fire. They make great progress, but often with courageous losses that never get reversed, so an extended silence because we‚Äôre stuck with a change forever is indistinguishable from an extended silence because the fix isn‚Äôt ready yet. But there has clearly been a major shift in direction for the better since early 2017, and they couldn‚Äôt be more clear now: Apple is listening again, they‚Äôve still got it, and the Mac is back. Based on what we‚Äôve learned since, they had likely started the project a very short time before holding the roundtable.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é I‚Äôm excluding the 2018 MacBook Air because it feels like a stopgap that wasn‚Äôt originally planned to exist ‚Äî¬†the no-Touch-Bar 13‚Äù MacBook ‚ÄúEscape‚Äù seemed intended to replace it ‚Äî that was rushed into the 2016-era generation mid-cycle, rather than being the first of a new design. Even so, with the large exception of the butterfly keyboard, it‚Äôs quite good.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean I won‚Äôt buy one.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é The 2010/‚Äú2012‚Äù Mac Pro was so good, and so upgradeable, that it‚Äôs still in surprisingly widespread use today for needs that weren‚Äôt possible or compelling on the ‚Äútrashcan‚Äù successor.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é And the MacBook Pro. A very common setup for developers ‚Äî¬†Apple‚Äôs largest identified segment of pro users ‚Äî is a 15‚Äù MacBook Pro connected to an external monitor, for which a good solution no longer exists. Developers would be much better served by a $1,500-ish standalone version of the iMac‚Äôs 5K display than a $6,000 XDR reference monitor for professional video colorists.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "description": "Sharing podcasts has never been easy, but I‚Äôve always tried to lead the way with Overcast, with publicly shareable episode links and optional recommendations from your Twitter friends since version 1.0 in 2014. Podcast sharing has been limited to audio and links, but today‚Äôs social networks are more reliant on images and video, especially Instagram. Podcasts need video clips to be shared more easily today. I‚Äôve seen some video clips from tools specific to certain podcast networks or hosts, but they were never available to everyone, or for every show. So people mostly just haven‚Äôt shared podcast clips, understandably, because it has been too hard. Not anymore. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚Ü©Ô∏è This remark on Unco by Stephen Hackett inspired me to finally solve this problem in a way that worked easily, for all podcasts, for both podcasters and listeners to use. With today‚Äôs 2019.4 update1, you can now share audio or video clips, up to a minute each, from any public podcast. Simply tap the share button in the upper-right corner. You can generate an audio clip, or portrait, landscape, or square video, using your current Overcast theme setting. In order to help spread podcasts further, I didn‚Äôt want to be heavy-handed in the Overcast branding ‚Äî not everyone wants to advertise for one specific podcast app when promoting their shows. So the ‚ÄúShared with Overcast‚Äù badge is optional, and if you‚Äôd like, you can also add an Apple Podcasts badge. Finally, I wanted to extend the same app-agnosticism to Overcast‚Äôs share links. While this design still needs a lot of modernization, I‚Äôve done a small refresh: Now, for non-logged-in visitors, Overcast‚Äôs public sharing pages display badges for other podcast apps and the RSS feed for any podcast listed in Apple Podcasts. It‚Äôs important for me to promote other apps like this, and to make it easy even for other people‚Äôs customers to benefit from Overcast‚Äôs sharing features, because there are much bigger threats than letting other open-ecosystem podcast apps get a few more users. For podcasting to remain open and free, we must not leave major shortcomings for proprietary, locked-down services to exploit.2 Conversely, the more we strengthen the open podcast ecosystem with content, functionality, and ease of use, the larger the barrier becomes that any walled garden must overcome to be compelling. One of the most common shortcomings we hear is that podcasts are hard to share. Hopefully, Overcast‚Äôs new clip-sharing feature changes that, and other apps build similar features soon. So go get Overcast and start sharing your favorite moments. It‚Äôll help me, of course, but more importantly, it‚Äôll help your favorite shows gain listeners, and it‚Äôll strengthen the amazing, open, standards-based world of podcasting. Like Slopes and Castro, I‚Äôve changed to a date-based version-numbering scheme ‚Äî 2019.4 is the fourth update released in 2019, the next version will be 2019.5, and so on ‚Äî partly because version numbers don‚Äôt really matter anymore, but mostly because I no longer wanted to delay completed features until a major-version change or worry that I didn‚Äôt do enough to justify a certain number.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é YouTube was able to dominate video because it made everything easy in a medium that (at the time) was very hard to do elsewhere. If a proprietary service takes a very hard aspect of podcasting and makes it very easy, it may rapidly rise to prominence. Other major shortcomings I‚Äôm concerned about: the difficulty of getting sponsorships for small shows (‚ÄúAdSense for podcasts‚Äù), and the complexity of creation and publishing (‚ÄúTumblr for podcasts‚Äù). This is probably why Spotify bought Anchor.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2019/01/28/overcast-instant-search",
    "description": "‚ñ∂Ô∏è The first thing someone does in a podcast app is add some podcasts, and most active Overcast users add at least two new podcasts each month. Over 80% of podcasts are added to Overcast by searching, with the vast majority as searches for a specific podcast by name (rather than searching for generic keywords, such as ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù). Good search is a critical, differentiating feature of any podcast app. I‚Äôm not satisfied if the podcast you‚Äôre looking for is somewhere in the middle of a long list ‚Äî I want it to be the first one, displayed quickly, after typing the fewest characters possible. I‚Äôve been building toward this by analyzing years of popularity statistics and anonymous search data. Instant Search is the next step in Overcast‚Äôs search evolution. It combines a small local cache with a highly optimized search service to give the most relevant results immediately as you type, even after only a single letter.1 It‚Äôs a dramatic, delightful improvement to a critical, frequently used feature. This was a lot of fun to build, and I‚Äôm proud of it. See for yourself! Overcast is free on the App Store. If Instant Search isn‚Äôt instant right after you update, the cache hasn‚Äôt fully downloaded yet. It‚Äôs downloaded weekly, only on Wi-Fi, and is less than 5 MB.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

Until last week, I thought it would be the last Mac Mini that Apple ever made. And when rumors started swirling about an imminent Mac Mini update, I assumed the worst: if it came at all, it would be a tiny box with a slow, ultra-low-power processor and almost zero ports, optimizing for small size instead of versatility. I don‚Äôt think this was an unreasonable fear after the 2014 Mac Mini update, which made many key aspects much worse without making anything much better. It seemed clear then, and for the following four years that it went without an update, that Apple held the Mac Mini and its customers in very low regard. Not anymore. The 2018 Mac Mini is real, and it‚Äôs spectacular. It makes almost nothing worse and almost everything better, finally bringing the Mac Mini into the modern age. Ports! Glorious ports! Number one ‚Äî and this is a big one these days, especially for this product ‚Äî is that it‚Äôs not any less useful or versatile than the outgoing Mac Mini, including the generous assortment of ports. If the previous one served a role for you, the new one can probably do it just as well, and probably better and faster, with minimal donglage.2 It‚Äôs the same size as the old one, which is the right tradeoff. I know zero Mac Mini owners who really need it to get smaller, and many who don‚Äôt want it to get fewer ports or worse performance. The point of the Mac Mini is to be as versatile as possible, addressing lots of diverse and edge-case needs that the other Macs can‚Äôt with their vastly different form factors and more opinionated designs. The Mac Mini needs to be a utility product, not a design statement. (Although, even as someone tired of space-gray everything, I have to admit that the Mini looks fantastic in its new color.) The base price has increased to $800, and that‚Äôs not great. It‚Äôs partly justifiable because it‚Äôs much higher-end than before ‚Äî the processors are much better, the architecture is higher-end and includes big advances like the T2, and all-SSD is standard ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still an expensive product in absolute terms. Apple lent me a high-end configuration for review ‚Äî 6-core i7, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD ‚Äî which would cost $2499 (much of which is the SSD). This would‚Äôve sounded crazy to spend on a Mac Mini a few years ago, but when it‚Äôs specced up like this, it‚Äôs targeting a much higher-end market than the previous model could. Compared to similarly specced iMacs and MacBook Pros, the pricing is generally reasonable. And this can truly be a pro desktop, with just one exception. Benchmarks The big story to me is how incredibly fast this thing is. Granted, I‚Äôm testing the fastest CPU offered, but damn. Geekbench results are very strong. The i7 Mac Mini scored better on single-core performance than every other Mac today (!) at 5912, and its multi-core score of nearly 24,740 beats every Mac to date except the iMac Pro and the old 12-core 2013 Mac Pro. ‚ÄúPerformance-competitive with pro Macs‚Äù was not high on my prediction list for a Mac Mini update, but here we are. As the rate of CPU advancement has slowed dramatically over the last few years, Apple has found other ways to improve performance. The T2 is great for lots of security reasons ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt buy a new Mac these days without it ‚Äî but what you‚Äôre seeing here is its strength as a ridiculously fast SSD controller. This Mac Mini builds my app, Overcast, much faster than my maxed-out 13-inch MacBook Pro, and about as quickly as my 10-core iMac Pro! Obviously, to achieve this result with only 6 cores, it‚Äôs not maxing out the CPU 100% of the time ‚Äî it hits it in bursts while juggling a lot between the SSD and memory ‚Äî but the result is that it‚Äôs incredibly fast as a development machine. The Blackmagick Disk Speed Test shows that the raw SSD performance is effectively identical to the other T2 Macs shipped to date, and a huge improvement over the four-year-old Mac Mini. A lot of people use Mac Minis as media or Plex servers, so I ran an H.265 transcoding test with ffmpeg. This maxes out all CPU cores, so the results predictably scale with the core count: the 6-core Mac Mini was much faster than the 4-core MacBook Pro, but the 10-core iMac Pro beat them both. But if an app supports the T2‚Äôs hardware HEVC encoder,3 it can go much faster. And since every T2 so far performs identically, all T2 machines ‚Äî from the 2018 MacBook Air to the iMac Pro ‚Äî encode HEVC this way at the same speed, and all in complete silence because they‚Äôre barely touching the CPU. I wasn‚Äôt able to notice any quality differences between the videos encoded with x265 and the T2‚Äôs hardware acceleration. The only spec that lets it down is the Intel GPU. It‚Äôs fast enough for common tasks, but if your workload benefits from a strong GPU, you‚Äôre better off going for an iMac or a 15-inch MacBook Pro, or considering an eGPU setup. Many Mac lines rely on Intel‚Äôs integrated GPUs to fit their physical and thermal needs, and Intel has been incredibly inconsistent over the last few years in delivering updated CPU-GPU combinations that would be suitable for many Macs. We often blame Intel‚Äôs CPU roadmap (or Apple‚Äôs seeming indifference) for the lack of updates to certain Mac lines, but Intel‚Äôs GPU offerings are often the bigger issue. This is Intel‚Äôs fault, but it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs problem ‚Äî¬†and Apple passes that problem right along to its customers. But that‚Äôs it ‚Äî aside from price, that‚Äôs the only downside. The GPU sucks. Everything else is awesome. If you don‚Äôt need a strong GPU ‚Äî¬†and honestly, most Mac Mini use-cases don‚Äôt ‚Äî this is a solid pick for a general-purpose Mac, even at the base-level configuration. Spec it up, and it‚Äôs more like a mini-Mac Pro. A few assorted notes, with apologies for stealing Gruber‚Äôs format: It‚Äôs silent at idle. The i7‚Äôs fan noise does become clearly audible when it‚Äôs under heavy load: it‚Äôs in the ballpark of a modern MacBook Pro, but quieter. Interestingly, I disabled Turbo Boost to simulate the base i3 model‚Äôs thermals, and couldn‚Äôt get the fan to spin up audibly, no matter what I did. Those who prioritize silence under heavy loads should probably stick with the i3. This is the first non-iMac desktop Mac that lets you plug in a 5K display, at full quality, without dual cables or other unreliable hacks. We finally have 5K Retina Mac options beyond the iMac! Unfortunately, we still don‚Äôt have any great standalone 5K displays. (The LG UltraFine isn‚Äôt.) You can upgrade the RAM again! I never would‚Äôve guessed this was coming, and I believe it‚Äôs the first time in a long time that an Apple product‚Äôs direct successor became more upgradeable and serviceable. I still recommend getting it with the right amount of RAM from Apple if possible, since third-party RAM has historically been a mess of unreliability and finger-pointing, but if you need that, it‚Äôs back. (The security screws inside ‚Äî TR6? ‚Äî still need some iFixit tools to get past.) I Can‚Äôt Believe The Mac Mini Is This Awesome, I Can‚Äôt Even Say ‚ÄúAgain‚Äù Because It Never Was A new Mac Mini could‚Äôve been so much worse. At many times in its past, it has seemed unloved, neglected, and downright punitive ‚Äî a similar pattern to Apple‚Äôs other headless desktop, the Mac Pro. It seemed for a while that Apple lacked any interest in making Macs anymore, especially desktops. Last year, with the introduction of the absolutely stellar iMac Pro, Apple showed us a glimpse of a potential new direction. It was downright perfect ‚Äî a love letter to the Mac and its pro desktop users, and a clear turnaround in the way the company views the Mac for the better. We didn‚Äôt know until now whether the iMac Pro‚Äôs greatness was a fluke. But now we have another data point: the last two desktops out of Apple have been incredible. After this, I have faith that they‚Äôre going to do the new Mac Pro justice when it finally ships next year. The new Mac Mini is a great update, out of nowhere, to a product we thought would never be updated again. Of course, with Apple‚Äôs track record on the Mac Mini, it may never be updated after this. This is either the first in a series of regular updates with which Apple proves that they care about the Mac Mini again, or it‚Äôs the last Mac Mini that will ever exist and we‚Äôll all be hoarding them in a few years. We can‚Äôt know yet. But today, this is a great update, a wonderful all-arounder for lots of potential needs, and just a fantastic little computer. I do this via iSCSI, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. It breaks and requires a new $200+ iSCSI initiator with almost every macOS update ‚Äî which is why my Mac Mini still runs Sierra. In the near future, I‚Äôll just directly attach some giant external hard drives to the Mac Mini and stop using the NAS.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Unless you used optical audio, audio input, or the SD-card reader. (Shit, I use optical in and out.)¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é ffmpeg can do it by specifying -c:v hevc_videotoolbox instead of -c:v x265. I also needed -vtag hvc1 for the output MP4s with either codec to be playable on macOS. Compressor uses the T2‚Äôs HEVC acceleration when encoding 8-bit HEVC, but not 10-bit.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

If that took you a bit longer than usual to tell the time on the Apple Watch‚Äôs new default Infograph face, you‚Äôre not alone: John Gruber finds it ‚Äúfar too busy‚Äù Jason Snell finds it ‚Äúpretty and packed with features‚Äù, but misses hour numerals Zac Hall removes almost everything to improve legibility David Smith wrote his own complications (!) to improve contrast I‚Äôve configured mine acceptably, but Utility is still far more legible for telling the time at a quick glance: Infograph, Utility Infograph suffers from two major issues: The center complications reduce the contrast between the dial and hands, often making the hands hard to locate. This is avoidable with customization, although the defaults should be much more conservative. It takes too much cognitive effort (and therefore time) to distinguish the current hour. This is simply a flawed design. It‚Äôs faster and easier to read analog time with the 1‚Äì12 numerals displayed on a watch, but many people prefer the cleaner look of a watch that uses lines, dots, or other shapes as hour markers instead. (Watch people call these ‚Äúindices‚Äù.) And it‚Äôs absolutely possible to design a highly legible dial with hour indices in many different styles. Here are some classics and modern takes:1 Across a wide variety of brands, styles, and price points, a few key design principles are clear: The hour markers for 12 (and often 3/6/9) are more prominent. The hour indices are much larger than the minute markings. The hour hands nearly touch the hour indices. These all improve legibility by making it as fast and easy as possible to know which hour is being indicated (and minimize the chance of an off-by-one error), first by orienting your eyes to the current rotation with the 12 marker, then by minimizing the distance between the hour hand and the indices it‚Äôs between. Apple Watch‚Äôs analog faces all fail to achieve these principles:2 Color, Simple, Explorer Color, Simple, and Explorer have easily distinguished hour markers, but Explorer‚Äôs are a bit too far from its hour hand. None of them have distinguished 12 markers to aid in orientation. While Explorer omits minute markings altogether, Simple bafflingly uses 30-second markings in place of its minute track, making time-telling even harder. I‚Äôve never seen another watch with sub-minute markings identical to its minute markings. Activity Analog, Utility, and Infograph without most complications Activity Analog‚Äôs hour markers are faint and far from its hour hand, and the central activity rings quickly eliminate the hands‚Äô contrast against the dial as they progress. Utility (when configured without numbers) improves legibility slightly with its bold hour indices, but they‚Äôre still too small and too far from its hour hand, and there‚Äôs no differentiation for the 12 index. Infograph is similar, but even worse: its hour indices are more faint, it uses 30-second markings instead of minute markings, and its default Calendar display wipes out the top three indices. (At least you can tell which way is up.) Even with almost no complications, the basic essence of the Infograph dial has poor time legibility. When it‚Äôs being used as Apple seems to intend, time-telling at a glance is so difficult that many people have actually suggested setting the digital time as the center complication, at which point the hands are just a nuisance and we should stop pretending it‚Äôs an analog face. It‚Äôs great for Apple to offer a wide variety of Apple Watch faces, but most of them are short-lived novelties at best. We‚Äôre three years and four generations into the Apple Watch, and almost every Watch owner I know still uses the same handful of ‚Äúgood‚Äù faces. If you want digital time with a good deal of complications, Modular is your only good choice (or Infograph Modular on the Series 4).3 If you want analog time with numerals, Utility is the only good option. If you want indices instead of numerals ‚Äî probably the most popular analog watch style in the world ‚Äî I don‚Äôt think there is a good option. By now, we‚Äôve seen Apple‚Äôs design range that they‚Äôre willing to ship as Watch faces, and while it seems broad at first glance, it‚Äôs actually pretty narrow. And we‚Äôre restricted to the handful of good watch faces that Apple makes, because other developers aren‚Äôt allowed to make custom Watch faces. The Apple Watch is an amazing feat of technology. It‚Äôs a computer. It can display anything. With no mechanical or physical limitations to hold us back, any watch-face design from anyone could plausibly be built, enabling a range of creativity, style, and usefulness that no single company could ever design on its own. But they won‚Äôt let us. In a time when personal expression and innovation in watch fashion should be booming, they‚Äôre instead being eroded, as everyone in the room is increasingly wearing the same watch with the same two faces. Open this door, Apple. You can even see which model the Apple Watch‚Äôs hand shape comes from, which is not a coincidence.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é For Apple Watch faces offering multiple hour/minute styles, I selected the best one that didn‚Äôt have hour numerals, and most complications were disabled.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é Special shout-out to my favorite digital face, Solar.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

Busy day. It all started with the watchOS volume widget. You see, Overcast‚Äôs previous Apple Watch app really sucked. I did my best with the capabilities of watchOS 1‚Äì4, but I couldn‚Äôt give people what they really wanted: Standalone podcast playback on the Apple Watch without an iPhone. I briefly offered it through some bad hacks, but had to remove it. Volume control on the Watch, which is increasingly important with the popularity of AirPods. That‚Äôs why I nearly jumped for joy during the watchOS 5 announcement in June, when Apple unveiled most of my list of watchOS changes needed to make good podcast apps. After a very busy summer, standalone Apple Watch playback is back in Overcast, and it‚Äôs actually good this time! It‚Äôs not perfect: No cellular. Apple hasn‚Äôt released a good way to do cellular audio streaming in watchOS, and the bad ways wouldn‚Äôt be very useful. Sending podcasts to the Watch is slow. Overcast shrinks them to reduce the transfer time, but when (and how quickly) podcasts transfer is tightly controlled by watchOS to preserve battery life. Transfers still sometimes wait forever or silently fail. Programmers like me can‚Äôt accept that something is just slow, so I‚Äôve decided to make transfer speed irrelevant. Nobody cares how slowly podcasts transfer if it happens while they‚Äôre asleep! Auto-Sync to Watch automatically tries to send your most recent podcasts to your Apple Watch whenever it gets a chance.1 You can still send episodes manually from the queue button on an episode (‚â°+), but in my testing, I never needed to. Just pick up your Watch and go, and it‚Äôll already have plenty of podcasts for your outing, all without having to manually sync anything or wait for slow transfers. The Overcast 5.0.1 update, due out in a few days, makes Watch transfers even more reliable. (Sorry. Found a better way after 5.0 was approved.) And Watch-crown volume control! Finally, the best way to use Overcast from your Apple Watch isn‚Äôt to delete it, letting the Now Playing app show up instead. That‚Äôs where the other half of my summer workload began. The watchOS volume widget offers minimal customization: just the color of the circle. I couldn‚Äôt make the line width a little narrower to match the rest of Overcast‚Äôs thin-line aesthetic. But that iOS 7-era thin-line aesthetic looked dated, and I‚Äôd wanted a design refresh for a while. I decided to start modernizing the app‚Äôs design, screen by screen. I couldn‚Äôt do it all in one summer, so I started with the screen that needed the most help: Now Playing. The previous Now Playing screen in Overcast 4. The biggest problem of the previous design was the center artwork area, a scrollable set of ‚Äúpages‚Äù that had speed and effects controls offscreen to the left, and the episode notes offscreen to the right. Nobody ever found them. I‚Äôve been getting emails almost every day from people asking where the speed controls were because they set them once and couldn‚Äôt find them again, or saying how they‚Äôd really like my app more if it offered speed controls. The only indication in the interface was three ‚Äúpage dots‚Äù below the scrollable area, but that wasn‚Äôt enough. The new design maintains the same scrollable pages, but now as obvious, tactile cards. In my testing, everyone figured these out immediately. Put differently, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre navigating this through a phone-shaped window in the middle: This design is not only more discoverable, but it allows me to fit more controls on screen, and in more reachable areas. Unlike the previous design, I can also fit the same controls on all devices, from the iPhone SE to the iPad Pro. Designing a good Now Playing screen for a music or podcast app that‚Äôs nice, clean, and highly discoverable is incredibly difficult. I think I‚Äôve finally found a good balance. I‚Äôve given chapters (when present) their own card with durations and inline progress bars. I‚Äôve also finally revamped the sleep timer to ditch the ugly alert sheet, give it a proper UI for fast input, and show the remaining time in more useful ways: There are lots of other improvements throughout the app as well. Some of the highlights: Search your podcasts and current episodes from the main screen, or go into a podcast‚Äôs screen to search its entire archive. Refreshed the podcast screen a little. (More to come.) Siri Shortcuts support, of course. Plus smaller fixes and improvements: CarPlay performance is much better, especially for people with large collections. Podcasts now display their estimated release frequency (daily, weekly, etc.) if it can be inferred. Tap-to-load on images now loads all images from the same domain at once. Tons of bug fixes and performance improvements. Overcast 5 requires iOS 12 and watchOS 5, and as always, it‚Äôs free. Update your devices, then go get Overcast! Up to 20 episodes are auto-synced today. This number will change as I refine the balance of resource usage. Auto-Sync to Watch is on by default and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode",
    "description": "Laptop battery life is decreasingly relevant to me as more airplanes offer power outlets. But sometimes you lose that lottery, as I did on my latest 8-hour daytime flight. Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúUp to 10 hours‚Äù claim doesn‚Äôt apply to my work,1 which is usually a mix of Xcode, web browsing, and social time-wasting, so I knew I‚Äôd have to seriously conserve power. Sometimes, you just need Low Power Mode: the switch added to iOS a few years ago to conserve battery life when you need it, at the expense of full performance and background tasks. There‚Äôs no such feature on Mac laptops, but there should be. It could: Disable the discrete GPU on 15-inch models unless required for hardware reasons2 Pause Photos syncing and analysis Pause Spotlight indexing Reduce the frequency of Time Machine backups Don‚Äôt download or install software updates Don‚Äôt download new content in iTunes Auto-dim the screen after a shorter time Let third-party apps detect Low Power Mode and reduce their background operations to only essential work And the big one: Reduce the processor‚Äôs maximum wattage or disable Turbo Boost Back in 2015, I experimented with disabling Turbo Boost and discovered that it reduced performance by about a third, but also boosted battery life by almost as much. Since then, I‚Äôve been running Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to automatically disable Turbo Boost when I‚Äôm running on battery power, and it has been wonderful: I made it through that 8-hour flight only because Turbo Boost was off. Over the last few days, I‚Äôve run battery tests on my 2018 13-inch MacBook Pro with the (awesome) 2.7 GHz i7 and my 2015 2.2 GHz 15-inch3 to see how far I could push the battery life using Volta, which can disable Turbo Boost and/or set wattage limits on the CPU. My test was based on the ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù script from last time, but using xcodebuild every few minutes with Overcast‚Äôs current codebase (which is larger and includes some Swift). Improvements are in green and performance reductions are in red: \u003c!-- .turboboosttable { margin: 2em auto; border-collapse: collapse; } .turboboosttable th, .turboboosttable td { text-align: center; border: 1px solid #f4f4f4; padding: 0.5em; } .turboboosttable th { width: 15%; } .turboboosttable th.lcol { text-align: right; } .turboboosttable th.notbold { font-weight: normal; } .turboboosttable th { background-color: #f4f4f4; } .turboboosttable .lightslash { opacity: 0.33; } .turboboosttable td.noturbo { background-color: #f8f8f8; } .turboboosttable .perfminus { color: #a00; } .turboboosttable .perfplus { color: #0a0; } --\u003e 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro (2.2 GHz quad-core i7) ¬† Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:36 3963/13864 43.9s No Turbo 5:06+42% 2796/9917‚àí29/28% 63.4s+44% 13-inch 2018 MacBook Pro (2.7 GHz quad-core i7) ¬† Battery life Geekbench single/multi xcodebuild Normal 3:09 5412/18983 34.3s 28W 3:28+10% 5401/16326‚àí0/14% 37.4s+9% 18W 4:05+29% 5248/14133‚àí3/26% 43.5s+27% 12W 4:44+50% 4818/11835‚àí11/38% 48.2s+41% No Turbo 5:05+61% 3624/13324‚àí33/30% 48.9s+43% 6W 6:24+103% 4065/7596‚àí25/60% 76.1s+121% It‚Äôs impressive how much faster this new 13-inch model is than the best laptop ever made due to significant CPU and SSD improvements. Dropping the wattage to 6W, the thermal limit of the fanless 12-inch MacBook, interestingly (but not surprisingly) makes it perform effectively identically to the best 12-inch MacBook in Geekbench. This is an extreme option, but one I‚Äôd occasionally take if offered. It roughly doubles compilation times, but also doubles the battery life. This ratio holds for most other configurations: the gain in battery life is about as large as the loss in heavy-workload performance. That‚Äôs a trade-off I‚Äôd gladly make when I need to maximize runtime. The best bang-for-the-buck option is still to just disable Turbo Boost. Single-threaded performance hurts more than with wattage-limiting, but it‚Äôs able to maintain better multi-threaded performance and more consistent thermals, and gets a larger battery gain relative to its performance loss. And Volta, which offers both wattage limits and Turbo disabling, requires disabling System Integrity Protection to install an unsigned kernel extension, which I really don‚Äôt recommend. Turbo Boost Switcher, which doesn‚Äôt offer wattage control, works with SIP using a signed extension and its Pro version has more convenient features for automatic toggling. For now, I‚Äôm going to continue to happily run Turbo Boost Switcher Pro to selectively give myself better battery life, and I recommend it for anyone else with the same need. But what I ultimately want is for a true Low Power Mode built into macOS that could provide this sort of CPU throttling and software changes, which would ultimately achieve even greater gains. Whose work does get 10 hours out of a MacBook Pro? None of the use-cases on the marketing page ‚Äî Photography, Coding, Video Editing, 3D Graphics, and Gaming ‚Äî are likely to achieve even half of that in practice.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é I‚Äôve heard that 15-inch models are wired such that the discrete GPU is required when external displays are connected. Otherwise, whether it‚Äôs used or not is a software decision, and gfxCardStatus can override it in certain conditions.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é It‚Äôs not brand new, so it‚Äôs not a perfect comparison, but the battery only had 90 cycles before this test.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "Overcast 4.2: The privacy update",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2018/04/27/overcast42",
    "description": "Overcast 4.2 is out now. It enhances privacy in two major areas: Anonymous sync by default Overcast has offered anonymous sync accounts since 2014. They‚Äôre fully functional, but they lack email addresses or passwords, so they can‚Äôt log into the website. A login token is stored in iCloud so the account can be accessed after a restore or upgrade, or from other devices you own. Previously, the login screen pushed email logins. But with four years of perspective, feedback, and usage data, I now think that‚Äôs the wrong move. Only a single-digit percentage of customers use the website, and the iCloud token-sync method solves cross-device logins for almost everyone. Your personal data isn‚Äôt my business ‚Äî it‚Äôs a liability. I want as little as possible. I don‚Äôt even log IP addresses anymore. If I don‚Äôt need your email address, I really don‚Äôt want it. 68% of Overcast accounts have email addresses today. To reduce that as much as possible, I‚Äôve made major changes to account handling: The previous login screen (left) and the new one. In Overcast 4.2, the login screen now prominently encourages anonymous accounts by default. If you already have an account in iCloud, it‚Äôll pop up a dialog box over this screen asking if you want to use it. And the first time you launch 4.2, people with email-based accounts will be encouraged to migrate them to anonymous accounts: The migration prompt that shows on the first run. Finally, you can now change your account between email-based and anonymous whenever you want. Blocking ad-tracking images In most podcast apps, podcasts are downloaded automatically in the background. The only data sent to a podcast‚Äôs publisher about you or your behavior is your IP address and the app‚Äôs name. The IP address lets them derive your approximate region, but not much else. They don‚Äôt know exactly who you are, whether you listened, when you listened, how far you listened, or whether you skipped certain parts. Some large podcast producers are trying very hard to change that. I‚Äôm not. Big data ruined the web, and I‚Äôm not going to help bring it to podcasts. Publishers already get enough from Apple to inform ad rates and make content decisions ‚Äî they don‚Äôt need more data from my customers. Podcasting has thrived, grown, and made tons of money for tons of people under the current model for over a decade. We already have all the data we need. One of the ways publishers try to get around the limitations of the current model is by embedding remote images or invisible ‚Äútracking pixels‚Äù in each episode‚Äôs HTML show notes. When displayed in most apps, the images are automatically loaded from an analytics server, which can then record and track more information about you. In Overcast 4.2, much like Mail (and for the same reason), remote images don‚Äôt load by default. A tappable placeholder shows you where each image will load from, and you can decide whether to load it or not. I believe I‚Äôve done this in the most secure way possible ‚Äî I‚Äôm actually displaying the show notes using a strict Content Security Policy ‚Äî and I would love to hear from anyone who finds a way to inject auto-loading remote images or execute arbitrary JavaScript in show notes. Bug fixes Overcast 4.2 also includes a bunch of minor fixes, and two big ones: Fixed the major slowdowns and high battery usage that resulted from extremely large podcast artwork. Password-protected episodes are now supported on password-protected feeds. Get it now in the App Store!",

    "description": "Overcast 4.1 is now in the App Store with some small but nice new features. Smart Resume is actually two features: It jumps back by up to a few seconds after having been paused to help remind you of the conversation. It slightly adjusts resumes and seeks to fall in the silences between spoken words when reasonably possible. Both are subtle but noticeable benefits (my favorite kind), especially when you‚Äôre being interrupted a lot, such as while following turn-by-turn navigation directions. Smart Resume is on by default, and can be turned off in Nitpicky Details. Delete episodes 24 hours after completion: Before, episodes could either be auto-deleted immediately upon completion, or not at all. There‚Äôs now a third option, auto-deleting 24 hours after completion, which will soon be the default for new accounts. The 24-hour threshold is only enforced after a successful sync, so it won‚Äôt auto-delete anything in the middle of an extended offline period, such as a long flight. Auto-deletion, either immediate or after 24 hours, also no longer applies to Premium subscribers‚Äô Uploads. Password-protected podcasts: Some private podcast feeds, including many paid and members-only podcasts, require a username and password via HTTP Basic Auth. You can now add these in the Add URL screen. Password-protected podcasts, and other private feeds such as Patreon bonus feeds and anything using the tag, do not show up in search or recommendations. Noteworthy bug fixes: Resuming playback after quitting in the background, especially on very long podcasts and/or when using AirPods, no longer occasionally results in glitchy noises and incorrect durations. Playback under certain conditions no longer stalls, requiring pausing and playing again. Downloads now fail less often. Playback controls no longer disappear occasionally. Smart Speed total savings now appear at the bottom of the Settings screen for locales that use commas as their decimal separator.1 Extremely large playlists now only show the most/least-recent 500 episodes to improve app performance for users with very high subscription counts. There‚Äôs also one removal: rotation support on iPhone. (The iPad app still rotates.) iPhone rotation has always been disabled by default, and had been buried in Nitpicky Details for a long time, so very few people have ever used it. Meanwhile, it has become increasingly difficult to support and maintain, especially with the modern complexities of rotation and the dramatically increased workload of supporting the iPhone X in landscape. iPhone rotation has simply proven far too costly to maintain for its extremely low usage, and it had to go to free up more of my time for more highly demanded features. I apologize to the few people who did use it, and I hope this isn‚Äôt too disruptive for you. The rest is all good news. Go get Overcast now! In the next update, I‚Äôll be addressing the biggest design failure of Overcast 4: the non-discoverability of the Effects and Notes pages in the Now Playing screen. Expect the return of an ancient user-interface tool known as ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù. This was Overcast‚Äôs oldest known bug, which had been there since 1.0: some users, mostly in central Europe, wouldn‚Äôt see Smart Speed totals. It turned out to be one of the most interesting and obscure bugs I‚Äôve seen. The total-time-saved value is stored on-device as it accumulates, then gets sent to the server to be combined with any listening you do on other devices. The overall total is read back from the server, and the local total is reset, on each sync. I was using an NSNumberFormatter to read the total value from Overcast‚Äôs server as a double. My server always sends values with U.S.-style number formatting, using a period as the decimal separator (e.g. ‚Äú1234.5‚Äù). But by default, NSNumberFormatter uses the device‚Äôs locale, so in countries that use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g. ‚Äú1234,5‚Äù), it was interpreting the server‚Äôs numbers with periods as invalid and returning zero. So the Settings screen thought they hadn‚Äôt saved any time, and hid the time-saved label. Fortunately, it was an easy fix: setting that NSNumberFormatter locale to en_US to match what the server was sending. And since the accumulated local totals were still being sent and added properly, the correct historical data is there ‚Äî it just wasn‚Äôt being displayed correctly.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
