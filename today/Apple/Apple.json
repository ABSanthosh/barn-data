    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld During last week‚Äôs four-day ‚ÄúPrime Day‚Äù event, we saw AirPods 4 on sale for the lowest price ever. As expected, those prices went back up when the event ended‚Äìbut they just dropped again, matching those steep Prime Day discounts. You can get the AirPods 4 without active noise cancelling for only $89, a 30 percent discount off its $129 MSRP and the lowest price we‚Äôve seen. We think the AirPods 4 with ANC for only $119 is an even better buy, though. That‚Äôs 33 percent off, and again, the lowest price we‚Äôve ever seen for these. The AirPods 4 with ANC earned our Editor‚Äôs Choice rating with a¬†4.5-star score when we reviewed them. We loved everything about them, chiefly the superb audio quality and excellent noise canceling without silicone tips. In our testing, the AirPods 4‚Äôs noise cancellation also delivered great clarity and volume when talking, while the Conversation Awareness feature works great to automatically lower the volume of what you‚Äôre listening to when someone strikes up a conversation. If you want to step up to Apple‚Äôs premium earbuds, AirPods Pro 2 are $169 now (32 percent off). It‚Äôs not the stellar price of $150 we saw during Prime Day, but it‚Äôs a good sale price we only see a few times a year. Apple AirPods 4 (with ANC) Read our review Price When Reviewed: $179 with Active Noice Cancelation Best Prices Today: $119.99 at Amazon | $119.99 at Walmart | $149.99 at Target",

    "description": "Macworld Apple is all in on its new Liquid Glass user interface that it introduced at WWDC last June. So much so that the company may be expanding the Liquid Glass concept beyond its software and into its hardware. According to leaker Setsuna Digital on a Weibo post, Apple may be releasing the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro in a color option that has ties to the Liquid Glass UI design of iOS 26. Setsuna Digital identifies the color as white, but it will show different effects based on the light hitting it. Setsuna Digital/Weibo Setsuna Digital has not seen the Liquid Glass iPhone and has only heard about it. Setsuna Digital made some correct reports about Apple products prior to official release, such as a report on the Titanium Milanese Loop watchband for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and the iPhone 14‚Äôs Yellow color option. Macworld on Wednesday reported on the iPhone 17 colors and noted that White will be an option and that it will be the same as the iPhone 16 Pro. Maijin Bu reported on Thursday about the iPhone 17 Pro colors with a lineup that closely matched Macworld‚Äôs, with one exception. While Macworld‚Äôs report included a Steel Gray option, Bu‚Äôs report only included four colors: orange, white, black, and dark blue. When asked about the gray color on X, he replied, ‚ÄúThe answer may be more complex than expected.‚Äù The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be revealed by Apple at a yet-to-be-announced event in September. Besides the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models, Apple is expected to introduced a new iPhone 17 Air model.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber‚Äôs The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [‚Ä¶] Phil‚Äôs appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers ‚Äî remember, developer relations is all under Phil ‚Äî might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn‚Äôt have (they‚Äôre pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple‚Äôs enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt help but suspect that it won‚Äôt come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We‚Äôll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it‚Äôs easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that‚Äôs either not the case, or it doesn‚Äôt stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I‚Äôm not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple‚Äôs leaders are doing that, too.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
