    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Macworld The gift-giving season may be over but that doesn’t mean we’re not still looking for deals. And we have three today that are perfect for those gift cards you got, with some of the best prices we’ve ever seen. First up is the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple’s latest smartwatch with a slew of excellent health features and sensors to get your new year off on the right foot. It has a bigger display than the Series 9, a thinner design, and faster charging, as well as incredible health and life-saving features, including an ECG sensor, all-day heart-rate monitoring, a-fib warnings, sleep tracking, and fall and crash detection. And today Amazon has the Apple Watch on sale for just $329, a savings of $70 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. Next, there’s the 10th-gen iPad. While it hasn’t been updated since 2022, this iPad still represents the best value in Apple’s lineup by far, with a screen as large as the $599 iPad Air. You’ll also get a 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage, a USB-C charging port, and a modern design with bold colors. It’s a great bargain at its $349 MSRP but Amazon’s price of $279 is a downright steal. Finally, there’s the humble AirTag, which has one job—to keep track of your non-Apple gear and help you find it when lost. It uses Apple’s robust Find My network to pinpoint lost items and alerts you when you’ve left something behind so you won’t get too far away. Amazon is selling a four-pack today for $73, good for $26 off, not quite an all-time low but just a few dollars away from the best price we’ve ever seen.",

    "description": "Macworld When Apple launched the iPhone 16 in September, it continued to sell the 14, 15, and SE 3 models at lower prices. As usual, this gave customers on more limited budgets the flexibility to pick between five main iterations (counting the Plus variants) with three different sizes and a mixed assortment of technical specifications. However, while none of these iPhones are bad phones, it couldn’t be a worse possible time to get one of them—even as a gift. And, if you got one, you may want to take it back before the holiday return window closes. Because the iPhone SE 4 will be better than all of them. Nothing special The iPhone SE line has long been in need of an update due to its outdated design. While higher-end iPhones have long moved on and adopted more modern appearances, the SE continues to persist in a bygone era. That’s about to change in a few months.  Credible leaks have long indicated that the iPhone SE 4, which is due to arrive this spring, will finally retire the classic chassis in favor of a modern look that adopts something similar to the iPhone 14. So, in just a few months, we could be bidding the prehistoric 4.7-inch LCD with thick bezels and a physical Home button farewell—once and for all. The front side would instead adopt an edge-to-edge, 6.1-inch OLED panel with a notch. This would finally provide iPhone SE users with an immersive screen featuring a higher pixel resolution, true black levels, and sleeker bezels. It could also offer a 48MO rear camera and a TrueDepth front camera with Face ID—all lightyears better than the current SE you just got. Plus it’s still got a Lightning port, as does the iPhone 14. So, waiting for an iPhone SE 4 would spare you from carrying around a dedicated Lightning cable—assuming your other gadgets charge via USB-C. The iPhone SE and iPhone 14 still have Lightning ports, which means you have to carry an additional cable.Foundry Searching for Apple Intelligence From afar, the iPhone 14 and 15 may look more advanced than even the upcoming SE 4. After all, they pack dual rear camera systems, and the 2023 models boast the futuristic Dynamic Island. Meanwhile, 2025’s budget release will likely miss out on both features. Despite that, a closer look at the budget phone’s rumored internals suggests it’ll outperform the aforementioned iPhones. However, the iPhone SE 4 will likely pack either the iPhone 16’s base A18 chipset or the iPhone 17 Pro, featuring 6 CPU cores, 5 GPU cores, 16 Neural Engine cores, and 8GB of RAM. This would enable it to run some of the demanding mobile games that exclusively run on newer devices. Beyond its snappier Safari, the iPhone SE 4 will most probably receive software updates for a longer period than the 14 and 15 models. More importantly, though, it would unlock the extensive Apple Intelligence suite that isn’t available on the iPhone 14 or 15. Apple Intelligence is going to be a centerpiece of the Apple ecosystem for years to come, so you’re going to want a phone that supports it.  Apple Intelligence might not be important now, but it will be at the forefront of Apple’s ecosystem for years to come.Foundry Flagship quality at a discount The iPhone SE 4 won’t have every feature you’re getting with your iPhone 15 or even the 14. The most prominent absentee will potentially be the ultra-wide rear lens available on the iPhone 14, 14 Plus, 15, and 15 Plus. The iPhone SE 4 could similarly be limited to a single 6.1-inch option, while the flagships from 2022 and 2023 offer larger 6.7-inch Plus editions. Otherwise, the final notable omission would be the Dynamic Island cutout available on the iPhone 15. Despite these drawbacks, the iPhone SE 4 will still be a better budget pick. Sure, the Dynamic Island is nice to have, but you’ll still be able to access Live Activities via the Notification Center and Lock Screen. And, even though the camera and size limitations may irritate certain customers, the iPhone SE 4 will be leaps ahead of its predecessor. Face ID is coming at least the iPhone SE, making it more secure and convenient.Foundry Switching from a 4.7-inch, thick-bezel LCD to a 6.1-inch, edge-to-edge OLED will substantially upgrade the iPhone SE 4’s video-watching and app-scrolling experience. Comparably, upgrading the ancient rear camera from 12MP to 48MP will unlock crisper shots and 2x zoom that don’t completely wreck the outputted photos’ resolution.  The iPhone SE 4 will be the first iPhone to offer both a design that fits our modern times and a flagship processor that supports all of the relevant iOS features. And, for the first time, iPhone users will get to experience Apple Intelligence—likely for less than $500. It’s even possible Apple will discontinue the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus altogether since paying $100 more for a similar iPhone that lacks Apple Intelligence and USB-C isn’t the best deal. The iPhone SE 4 is shaping up to be a real threat to midrange Android phones and Apple’s current lineup. Based on the leaks, Apple appears to have addressed all the current SE’s flaws and built a phone that’s perfect for any user on a budget. So if you just got one of Apple’s cheaper phones, go box it up and return it, because something better is coming soon.",
