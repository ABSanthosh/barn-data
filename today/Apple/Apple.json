    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple’s M3 MacBook Air finally got settled into the Mac lineup, but Apple is already looking ahead with the M4 MacBook Air. Reports on the future laptop are starting to appear, though it’s not expected to ship until next year. We’ll see more rumors between now and the M4 MacBook Air release. This article will keep track of what’s being reported, as well as offer a perspective based on Apple’s current lineup. Update 10/23/24: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reports that an M4 MacBook Air may be released in 2025. M4 MacBook Air: Release date In an April 2024 report, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that the Mac’s version of the M4 chip will be introduced in the MacBook Pro and iMacs later this year, with an M4 MacBook Air release likely coming in spring 2025, which would be about a year after the M3 MacBook Air was released. Gurman states that “the company’s plans could change,” leaving some wiggle room for the release date. Gurman doesn’t clarify if a change in plans would mean an earlier or later release.  In June, Gurman reported that the Mac released schedule had not changed. The M4 MacBook Air is not expected until the spring of 2025. In August, Gurman reiterated that the M4 MacBook Air will not be available until 2025. In October, Gurman reported that Apple is getting ready to start production on the M4 MacBook Air, with a possibility of a release between January and March of 2025. M4 MacBook Air: Processor Apple surprised us with the release of the M4 chip in the iPad Pro in early May, barely six months after the M3 debuted in the MacBook Pro. These are the specs for the chip as announced: Models with 256GB or 512GB of storage 9-core CPU (3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores) 10-core GPU Hardware-accelerated ray tracing 16-core Neural Engine 120GB/s memory bandwidth 8GB RAM Models with 1TB or 2TB storage 10-core CPU (4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores) 10-core GPU Hardware-accelerated ray tracing 16-core Neural Engine 120GB/s memory bandwidth 16GB RAM Compared to the 8-core M3, the M4 has two extra efficiency cores and higher memory bandwidth (120 GB/s vs 100GB/s). Apple will likely use the same design for the Mac, making the M4 the first non-Pro or Max chip that has Before the M4 arrived in the iPad, Gurman reported that the chip would focus on AI enhancements. Apple talked briefly during its Let Loose event about the improved Neural Engine and its ability to deliver over 38 trillion operations per second but didn’t get into much detail about real-world use. We’ll likely hear lots more about AI during the WWDC keynote and then again at the iPhone 16 launch when the A18 chip is unveiled. M4 MacBook Air: Design and specs The M4 upgrade would be the fourth generation of the M-series chip in the MacBook Air, but it’s not the fourth time around for the current Air design. Apple shipped the M1 MacBook Air in 2020 with an older design that was used with Intel chips and the current design wasn’t introduced until the M2 chip upgrade in July 2022. Apple isn’t expected to change it at all for the M4. Apple made a slight change to the Air’s design with the M3 update in March 2024, but only for one specific color. The Midnight version now has an anodization seal to help cut down on fingerprints–it’s a similar process introduced with the Space Black MacBook Pro. Apple is not expected to offer the process for the Silver, Space Gray, and Starlight colors.  Mark Gurman reported in April that Apple may increase the upper memory limit of its high-end desktop Macs, which use higher-end M-series chips. If the M4 has enhanced AI capabilities, it could require more memory regardless of whether it’s a base M4 or something higher. But to maintain costs as well as to persuade customers to consider investing in a higher-level device, Apple could decide that the base M4 won’t get more memory.  Another feature that could get an upgrade is battery life. If the MacBook M4 follows the iPad Pro’s chip design, it could be more engery-friendly with two extra efficiency cores. That could mean more battery life. The Midnight MacBook Air now has an anodization seal to cut down on fingerprints.Macwelt Everything else about the MacBook Air will likely stay the same with an M4 upgrade. The display, size, weight, camera, mics, speakers, ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are expected to remain unchanged. M4 MacBook Pro: Price Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M3 MacBook Air for reference. 13-inch MacBook Air $1,099/£1,099: M3 with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 256GB SSD $1,299/£1,299: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $1,499/£1,499: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 16GB unified memory; 512GB SSD 15-inch MacBook Pro $1,299/£1,299: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 256GB SSD $1,499/£1,499: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 512GB SSD $1,699/£1,699: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 16GB unified memory; 512GB SSD Reports for the M4 MacBook Air prices have yet to be made. Apple will likely offer similar configurations and we don’t expect prices to change much.",

    "description": "Macworld We expect the M4 MacBook Pro, M4 Mac mini, and M4 iMac announcements next week to be the last major product released for 2024. But it appears that Apple is going to start 2025 in a big way. According to a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is gearing up to start production of the M4 MacBook Air for a release in “early 2025.” How early? Gurman states that Apple has a December software update planned (likely macOS 15.2), and then after that, Apple will release the M4 MacBook Air between January and March of next year. The new MacBook Air will simply be a chip update from the M3 to the M4 for both the 13- and 15-inch models, which Gurman said have the codenames J713 and J715. The M4 MacBook Air release will come about a year after the M3 MacBook was released in March of this year. Gurman also reports that the new Mac Studio once had a similar schedule as the M4 MacBook Air, but Apple has decided to push it back to a March or June release. The current Mac Studio, released in June 2023, features an M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip. It is presumed that Apple will outfit the new Mac Studio with M4 Max and M4 Ultra chips since the company is phasing out the M3 series. The rescheduling will mean the Mac Studio will go two years between updates. Gurman reports that an M4 Mac Pro is still in the works but offered no updates on its release schedule. Gurman had previously reported that the M4 Mac Pro could be available in late 2025 or at WWDC in June at the earliest. But the first half of 2025 isn’t just for the Mac. Gurman reports that for the “spring product release cycle,” Apple plans to release “a revamped iPhone SE, fresh iPad Air models and upgraded iPad keyboards” as well as the 11th-generation iPad. As heavily rumored, the iPhone SE will represent a complete redesign for the budget phone, with an iPhone 14-style design, Apple Intelligence support, and the first Apple-design modem. The 11th-gen iPad and iPad Air updates will likely be smaller spec bumps.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",
