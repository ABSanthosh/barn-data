    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Macworld Apple has announced the dates of this year’s WWDC get-together. As expected, the event will run from June 9-13, 2025. As in prior years, this year’s WWDC will be a hybrid event. The entire five-day program will be available online, but there will also be an in-person gathering at Apple Park on June 9. Attendees will watch the keynote, take part in activities, and get a chance to speak one-on-one with Apple experts. “We’re excited to mark another incredible year of WWDC with our global developer community,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “We can’t wait to share the latest tools and technologies that will empower developers and help them continue to innovate.” WWDC, or the Worldwide Developers Conference, is the second-biggest event in Apple’s calendar after the iPhone launch in the fall. Each summer the company uses WWDC to inform app developers about new features coming to each of its software platforms. However, the event attracts a large audience of other parties interested in software changes that will affect their Apple devices. WWDC lasts for five days, offering a range of workshops and networking events to help developers in their work and careers. But the keynote presentation on the first day is what gets all the publicity. At the WWDC 2025 keynote, we will definitely hear about iOS 19 and iPadOS 19, macOS 16, and watchOS 12, as well as tvOS 19, visionOS 3, and AirPods and HomePod software. You can expect Apple Intelligence to dominate the agenda. The first betas of the new software will launch straight after the keynote so developers can start getting to grips with the changes. By the time the updates launch to the public in the fall, active apps should (in theory) have had time to adapt and work correctly with the new operating systems. Following the event online will be free. Those who would like to apply to join the event in person can find details on Apple’s WWDC webpage.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2647460/products-apple-never-released-airpower-car-magic-charger-paladin-siri.html",
    "description": "Macworld The iPhones and Macs we use today aren’t mere smartphones and desktop computers—they’re the fruit of decades’ worth of research and testing behind the scenes at Apple HQ. Like most corporations in this field, Apple spends large sums of money trialing all sorts of wild and innovative prototypes. Naturally, many of these experiments never make it to the consumer market and instead act as lessons or even foundations for future devices. While there are numerous unreleased products concealed in Apple’s secret basement, here are six notable products Apple developed that never saw the light of day—and one that might top the list soon. 1. Apple Car The most recent instance of a product that failed to get out the door is Apple’s self-driving car project. For many years, the company was rumored to be working on a self-driving vehicle dubbed Project Titan that integrates seamlessly with its ecosystem. The electric automobile could’ve potentially featured a CarPlay-like dashboard interface and relied on advanced sensors utilizing the power of four M2 Ultra chipsets to detect surrounding objects. Apple reportedly poured more than a billion dollars into researching it over the span of a decade, and thousands of employees were involved in its development. A year ago, Apple reportedly killed the car project and decided to reallocate its resources to develop artificial intelligence technology. Given the intense competition in AI right now—and presumably due to the challenging, complex nature of releasing an autonomous vehicle that matches Apple’s high standards—pivoting away from a car makes more sense for the company. Additionally, Apple never referenced the car publicly or made any relevant promises it couldn’t keep. As a result, the firm didn’t face any significant user backlash for discontinuing it. 2. AirPower While most unreleased Apple products were never officially unveiled to the public, Apple’s Airpower charging mat was one instance where a promised device was teased during a keynote only to be axed before its launch. First previewed during the iPhone launch event in 2017, AirPower was supposed to act as a multipurpose wireless charging mat capable of charging an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods case simultaneously. This futuristic vision, however, was riddled with technological obstacles that made executing it unfeasible. AirPower was hailed as the next big thing in charging but Apple quietly killed it before it hit shelves.Apple For starters, Apple had to internally distribute coils all over the mat, as Qi wireless charging requires precise coil alignment to work. This would’ve allowed users to place their iPhones anywhere on AirPower rather than positioning them in a very specific spot. Another hurdle was the Apple Watch’s proprietary wireless charging standard, which, for reasons unknown, is incompatible with Qi. Consequently, the company had to stack two layers of charging tech in a thin mat—reportedly causing unmanageable overheating issues. While Apple officially declared it won’t release the AirPower in 2019, its vision lived on. In 2020, the company launched the foldable MagSafe Duo Charger, bundling a MagSafe pad and an Apple Watch charging puck. However, that was discontinued in 2023 due to its high price, dubious hinge, and lack of support for fast Apple Watch charging and the larger iPhone 15 Pro Max. 3. Magic Charger Another official charging accessory that never saw the light of day is the Magic Charger. Unlike AirPower, Apple never unveiled this gadget publicly, but a collector who came across a prototype shed light on the accessory in 2022. The Magic Charger basically integrated a flexible MagSafe pad into a metallic stand. Like the MagSafe Duo Charger, users would’ve been able to attach an iPhone to a flat surface or stand it vertically by folding it. It’s unclear why Apple never released the accessory, especially given its practicality and the lack of major engineering obstacles. It would’ve complemented the StandBy feature introduced with iOS 17.  Apple’s Magic Charger is the portable MagSage stand we always wanted.@TheBlueMister 4. Paladin Way back in 1995, Apple was reportedly working on an all-in-one device for small businesses. The Paladin was designed to function as a computer, fax machine, scanner, and phone. The device would’ve let business owners do all of their productivity tasks with a single device. The Paladin could have done for offices what the iMac did for boxy PCs.Jim Abeles/Flickr Apple Paladin reportedly ran software dubbed Complete Office, letting users switch between its various modes with the click of a button. This would cause the interface to change depending on whether the fax or computing functions were in use. While Paladin had a basic monochrome LCD, it reportedly supported external, full-color displays through a dedicated port. It would have been revolutionary back in the 90s but alas it never saw the light of day. 5. PowerBook G5 During the early 2000s, Apple was heavily rumored to be working on a PowerBook G5 laptop to succeed the popular G4 model. That never came to fruition, though. Instead, Apple released its first MacBook Pro in 2006 with Intel Core 2 Duo processors, marking a shift in its laptop branding and design. Two years later, the iconic MacBook Air followed, offering users balanced power in a competitively sleek and timeless design. The PowerBook G5 was the rumored successor to the PowerBook G4 (left) but Apple released the MacBook Pro instead.Foundry 6. iPod phone Before releasing the original iPhone, Apple seemingly explored an iPod phone. Building on the success of its portable music player, the company is rumored to have considered adding a cellular modem to the iPod design. However, the Click Wheel input made dialing phone numbers unintuitive, and as a result, it never made it out of the R\u0026D stage. Interestingly, during the unveiling of the first-generation iPhone, Steve Jobs humorously previewed a mockup of a click-wheel-equipped phone, portraying its ridiculousness and impracticality—with a wink to the rumors that were circulating at the time. The iPod phone make an appearance in the keynote to announce the original iPhone.Apple Will Siri 2.0 join the list? Of all the items on this list, only one, the AirPower charging mat, was actually announced. Apple doesn’t typically unveil new products until they’re ready to ship, a policy that gives Apple the time and space it needs to perfect them while also maintaining its credibility and users’ trust. During last year’s WWDC, Apple promised that iOS 18 would bring a massive Siri update, giving it awareness of on-screen content, work within third-party apps, and fetch personal data from various parts of the system—such as emails and messages. There was even an ad campaign, but earlier this month, Apple delayed the upgraded Siri until “the coming year,” suggesting it might not arrive until iOS 19 in 2026.  It gets worse: A recent report even suggested the new Siri is so far behind, that Apple might have to rebuild the project from scratch. Given the sensitivity of user data and how unpredictable AI can be, Apple is evidently struggling to build an assistant that can reliably and securely perform the promised tasks. If Siri 2.0 is back to square one, what guarantees that things will be any different a year from now? The delays are bad enough, but failing to deliver Siri 2.0 will be a much bigger hit on Apple’s reputation than AirPower, especially when considering Google’s and other rivals’ advances in AI. Siri is already lagging behind its peers, and a failure to deliver on its promises for a smarter and more aware assistant could be Apple’s biggest failure ever.",
