    "description": "One of the stylish visual changes to the iPhone on iOS 26 is a new layout for the lock screen when music is playing. Artwork can now be animated and shown full-screen on the iPhone display, with playback controls resting on a platter of a liquid glass. You can try this out right now with Apple Music.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Appleâ€™s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruberâ€™s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [â€¦] Philâ€™s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers â€” remember, developer relations is all under Phil â€” might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldnâ€™t have (theyâ€™re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Appleâ€™s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *Â Â Â Â Â *Â Â Â Â Â * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community â€” and I canâ€™t help but suspect that it wonâ€™t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. Weâ€™ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, itâ€™s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope thatâ€™s either not the case, or it doesnâ€™t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC Iâ€™m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, Iâ€™ve decided that itâ€™s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Appleâ€™s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, Iâ€™m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade â€” and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! Whatâ€™s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on todayâ€™s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. Whatâ€™s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. Itâ€™s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. Iâ€™m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and Iâ€™ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. Whatâ€™s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On todayâ€™s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, Iâ€™ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who donâ€™t automatically download every episode. Whatâ€™s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcastâ€™s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. Thatâ€™s why there havenâ€™t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasnâ€™t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. Iâ€™ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. Iâ€™m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Hereâ€™s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.Â â†©ï¸Ž",
