    "description": "Macworld Let’s say your best buddy–we’ll call him Pietro–uses an Android phone. To each his own, you say. The problem is, Pietro, who doesn’t own a TV and watches shows on his phone (like I said, to each his own) doesn’t subscribe to Apple TV+ because there’s no Android app for that. This means when you excitedly call Pietro after watching the latest episode of Severance that dropped on Friday, you can’t talk about it. Instead, you have to ask him how’s he doing, how the kids are, what he had for dinner, whatever. Ho hum. But today is your (or Pietro’s) lucky day. Apple has released the Apple TV app on Android and it’s now available on the Google Play store. It provides access to all Apple TV+ content, as well as MLS Season Pass. A subscription is required for Apple TV+, which costs $9.99/£9.99 per month; MLS Season Pass is an additional subscription fee, but does not require an Apple TV+ subscription (learn more about MLS Season Pass). Apple TV+ also offers TV shows and movies available to rent or buy but The Verge reports that you cannot access the store from within the Android app. Users on Reddit say that previously purchased shows can’t be accessed, either. The Verge also points out that the Apple TV app for Android is optimized for foldable phones, which Pietro loves to brag about (“Crease? That’s not a crease,” he likes to say). Google’s Dan Seifert posted that the app also has a themeable app icon, picture-in-picture support, as well as offline downloads. So your Android-using buddy really has no excuse for missing out on one of the best shows of the year and a bunch of other great Apple TV+ content. Unless the lack of casting support in the app is a dealbreaker. Then you’re just going to have to go back to chatting about the weather. thrilled to see Apple TV land on Android devices today!it's an excellent Android citizen too:themeable app icon: ✅PIP support: ✅offline downloads: ✅foldable posture support: ✅https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv— dan seifert (@dcseifert.bsky.social) 2025-02-12T21:40:07.642227Z",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s newest iPad mini version is the perfect companion with an 8.3-inch screen and support for Apple Intelligence, and it’s even better when it’s on sale. Especially when it’s at all-time low—Amazon is selling the A17 Pro iPad Mini for $399, a savings of $100 off its MSRP and matching the best price we’ve ever seen. When we reviewed the new iPad mini, we gave it a four-star rating, loving the new fast CPU and graphics, as well as the fact that it supports Apple Intelligence. “The iPad mini is still a great tablet, perhaps the best at its size and better than larger, non-Apple tablets,” we concluded. It’s not a huge upgrade from the prior generation other than Apple Intelligence, but if you have an older model or are looking for something smaller, it’s a fantastic option. The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina Display looks as gorgeous as we’ve become accustomed to from Apple. The colors are vibrant and bright, the details are sharp, and it’s perfect for reading, streaming content, and playing games. This model also now comes with a baseline storage of 128GB, which means you actually get to install a bunch of apps without worrying about space all the time. The A17 Pro iPad Mini A17 Pro works with either the Apple Pencil Pro (on sale for $99) and the USB-C Apple Pencil, so if you have an older model you’ll need to upgrade. Since we’ve never seen the A17 Pro iPad Mini for less, it’s a great time to splurge and get yourself a great versatile tablet. Buy now at Amazon",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
