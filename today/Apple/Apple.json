These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2787618/ipados-17-7-8-update-now-available-for-older-ipads.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple on Monday released iPadOS 17.7.8, an update for older iPads that cannot run iPadOS 18. The 17.7.8 update is for the first-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro, the second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the sixth-generation iPad. The update addresses an issue where iPads running iPadOS 17.7.7 did not allow users to log into an app. The release note states that the update includes “important security fixes,” but Apple’s security releases document states that iPadOS 17.7.8 has no published CVE entries–in other words, the update doesn’t address anything recorded in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. To install the update, open the Settings app and go to Software Update. You will need an internet connection, and the iPad will need to restart. The current version of iPadOS is 18.5, which was released last week. However, Apple does release updates to older operating systems, such as iPadOS 17, when functionality is impaired, serious bugs have been addressed, or vital security patches are available.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2787510/apple-plans-to-offer-ai-alternatives-as-it-works-to-overhaul-siri.html",
    "description": "Macworld Mark Gurman and Dave Bennett have an interesting feature at Bloomberg about Apple’s AI struggles. It is primarily a summary of the last several months’ reporting on how Apple fell behind in AI, why it failed to deliver on its iOS 18 promises, and how it’s shaking up the organization to get back on track. But there are a few new or updated bits of information in there, even for those who have been paying attention to this drama. The report paints the picture of a company that is dramatically overhauling Siri, which will take time. In the meantime, the company plans to offer users a variety of options in AI tools. We previously reported, Apple is working on a huge Siri overhaul. The current version of Siri is a “hybrid” model of sorts, with different models to handle simple iPhone commands and more sophisticated AI queries. Apple now has AI-centered offices in Zurich that are working on a new “all LLM” (large language model) version of Siri that will handle everything with one sophisticated engine. This Siri is said to be conversational and much better at understanding information and taking actions. The company has in the past been reluctant to even pursue Siri as an alternative to today’s chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini, but that thinking has changed and it is racing ahead. Work appears to be going well, with Gurman and Bennett reporting that, “the chatbot the company has been testing internally has made significant strides over the past six months, to the point that some executives see it as on par with recent versions of ChatGPT.” It’s still a long way from release, however. It won’t be ready to show off at WWDC next month, and won’t be a part of iOS 19. In fact, the report says, Siri is going to take a back seat at WWDC, in favor of other AI enhancements like battery management and a health coach. That will be disappointing for Apple fans who have taken to making Siri failures a meme, and are at least looking for Apple to patch up the current version into something less embarrassing. While we wait for “LLM Siri,” Apple plans to offer alternatives. In most of the world, requests that Siri can’t handle can be sent to ChatGPT for an answer, and it is used in the Visual Intelligence feature as well. Bloomberg once again states that Apple will add Google’s Gemini as an option in addition to ChatGPT in iOS 19, and what’s more, the company is in “early talks” with Perplexity to add it as another ChatGPT alternative for Siri, and as a search provider in Safari. Apple seems to know how bad Siri’s reputation has gotten, at least. According to the report, the company is going to work to separate Siri from the overall Apple Intelligence brand in its marketing, because the Siri brand isn’t helping. Apple will also close the gap between when it announces new features and when they are available, to avoid the embarrassing slip-up of this past year, where it promised Siri features last June that still haven’t materialized. Apple will kick off WWDC with a keynote on June 9 to showcase the Apple Intelligence features coming in the next year.",
