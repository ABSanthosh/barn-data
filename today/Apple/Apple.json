    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2693167/phone-17-upgrade-air-pro-camera-design-ram-battery.html",
    "description": "Macworld With every iPhone launch, people are excited until they start to voice their frustration over Apple’s incremental hardware changes. The rage is typically justified. Over the past several years, Apple has given us largely tweaked iterations of the same device. Nevertheless, these small improvements do add up to meaningful year-over-year upgrades, but it’s been a while since Apple has truly blown us away This year’s iPhone 17 lineup could follow the same pattern. We’re not expecting groundbreaking additions such as a foldable display or a portless design, but rumors hint at a slew of welcome changes across the line. Regardless of the model you’re using right now, here are 10 main reasons you will want to buy an iPhone 17 this fall. 1. All-new Air variant Perhaps the most noticeable introduction will be the iPhone 17 Air. Apple is reportedly working on an ultra-thin phone that sacrifices some high-end specs in favor of sleeker aesthetics. With a rumored thinness of around 5.5mm, the Air model will easily dethrone the 6.9mm iPhone 6 as Apple’s thinnest smartphone ever. While it will likely sport a single camera like the iPhone 16e, the 17 Air edition is expected to still bring several high-end features, including support for MagSafe accessories, the Dynamic Island, the Camera Control button, and possibly even an always-on display. It’s the closest thing to a new design we’ve gotten in years, and the iPhone 17 Air will appeal to customers looking for something different. 2. Sharper selfie camera If you don’t really care about the Air edition, there are still plenty of other upgrades planned for the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. For starters, all four models are expected to feature a 24MP TrueDepth camera system, a notable jump from the 12MP lens available on the last several generations. This upgrade will dramatically improve the quality of your selfies and possibly enable 2X zoom while maintaining image sharpness. The iPhone 17 Pro could get a major camera upgrade.Foundry 3. Main camera upgrades The newest iPhones always have better cameras, and the iPhone 17 will be no exception. Most notably, the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max could finally adopt a 48MP telephoto lens, making faraway shots even sharper and enabling even better digital zoom. Additionally, the ultrawide lens could gain a variable aperture, letting you decide how much light passes through. This would elevate mobile photography by giving users more control over the depth of field. However, it’s possible that this feature gets pushed to the iPhone 18 in 2026. Beyond that, the highest-end models could gain 8K video shooting capabilities for the first time, luring content creators who’d rather not carry a dedicated camera around. 4. Reimagined camera bump iPhone camera upgrades are usually limited to spec bumps, but this year’s models are also expected to adopt a fresh exterior design. For starters, the all-new iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a new look with a horizontal bar to house its single wide lens, differentiating it from the entry-level 16e. Similarly, Apple may stretch the iPhone 17 Pro models’ camera bump across the back as well, departing from the classic square design. The back of the iPhone has generally looked the same ever since the iPhone 11, so an overhauled look will set the upcoming Pro iPhones apart from their predecessors. The entire iPhone lineup could have new camera designs.Foundry 5. Aluminum frame revival For nearly a decade, Apple has distinguished its flagship iPhones by offering distinct metallic chassis. The strategy was kickstarted by the iPhone X, offering a stainless steel frame as the iPhone 8 stuck to aluminum. Lower-end iPhones continued to feature the same aluminum frame, while Pro models eventually switched to titanium. Later this year, Apple could switch things up by using aluminum bodies across the entire iPhone 17 line. This shift could make the Pro models lighter, as titanium is significantly denser. Apart from that, the company could mix aluminum with the back glass to increase its durability. 6. In-house wireless chips With the iPhone 16e, Apple introduced its first 5G chip, delivering comparable performance using less energy. The first-party modem could make its way to the iPhone 17 Air later this year, which would improve its energy efficiency. Similarly, all iPhone 17 models could pack an Apple-made Wi-Fi chipset, potentially increasing their battery life. Apple might switch to new wireless chips that are more efficient.Foundry 7. RAM boost With the launch of the iPhone 16, Apple boosted the standard models to 8GB of RAM to support on-device Apple Intelligence features, matching the 8GB in the Pro models. To set its high-end phones apart, Apple is rumored to equip the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max with 12GB of RAM—a 50 percent increase over the current specs. Beyond more powerful AI tools, the upgrade could make apps snappier and practically eliminate lag across the system. 8. Improved thermal management After the iPhone 15 Pro’s overheating issues, the iPhone 16 Pro adopted an enhanced thermal management system. To help maintain the phone’s neutral temperature, the iPhone 17 Pro models could go one step further with a vapor chamber cooling technology. A special liquid would dissipate in a vacuum space when subjected to heat, which then distributes it across a wider area, keeping things cool in the most stressful conditions. 9. Longer battery life The homegrown Wi-Fi chip and vapor chamber cooling may not be the only factors improving battery life. The iPhone 17 Pro models could have a thicker design for the first time in years, presumably to accommodate larger batteries. Consequently, iPhone 17 Pro users could be able to go through a full day of heavy use without having to worry about charging. The non-Pro iPhone 17 models might get ProMotion displays for the first time.Foundry 10. Superior displays Lastly, all iPhone 17 models could adopt the ProMotion technology, finally unlocking 120Hz variable refresh rates for all users. Currently exclusive to Pro models since 2021, the addition would let iPhone 17 and 17 Air users finally enjoy smoother scrolling and transitions throughout iOS. Furthermore, the four displays could feature a more scratch-resistant coating to better withstand sharp objects. There have also been mixed rumors about a smaller Dynamic Island on the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but it’s unclear if it’ll actually materialize. There’s still room for innovation Smartphones have undoubtedly matured, and annual refreshes have arguably become redundant. Despite that, every once in a while, Apple manages to squeeze in enough hardware boosts in a single launch, enticing users to upgrade. What’s especially exciting about this year’s rumored iPhone line is how there are remarkable changes impacting each of the four variants—not just the highest-end ones. While the vanilla iPhone 17 may be the least interesting, there’s a lot to look forward to in the Air, Pro, and Pro Max models.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
