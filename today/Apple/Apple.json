    "description": "Macworld Deciding which iPhone to buy has always been tricky and no doubt you have many questions. Which screen size is best for you, and how much storage do you need? Should you save money by selecting an older model, or should you splash out on the latest iPhone? Which iPhone is the best compromise between specs and value for money? In this article, we talk you through each of the phones currently available from Apple, to help you decide which is best for you. We discuss iPhone prices, specs and features, paying particular attention to the cameras, screens and durability, and how the design of each handset differs, so you should leave feeling much more confident about which iPhone you should get. For more help with your choice see our full reviews of the latest iPhones (linked below) and our Best iPhone comparison chart where we compare all the new iPhone with the ones still on sale. Best iPhone 2025 The best iPhone isn’t necessarily the best iPhone for you due to its high price tag. Luckily there is a perfect iPhone for everyone, with each model offering the perfect compromise of features to price. Here is a quick-at-a-glance comparison of all the iPhones Apple currently sells, from the ultimate iPhone to the cheapest iPhone you can buy right now. 1. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max – The ultimate iPhone Price When Reviewed: $1,199 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $1199 View Deal $1199.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB – White Titanium – Unlocked $985 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB – Desert Titanium – Unlocked $1091 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB – Natural Titanium – Unlocked $1091 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro Max 256GB – Black Titanium – Unlocked $1091.99 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket Just as the iPhone 16 Plus is simply a larger version of the iPhone 16, so too is the iPhone 16 Pro Max just a larger iPhone 16 Pro. In past years, the Pro Max version would have some distinguishing feature (like better telephoto camera) but that isn’t the case this year. The iPhone 16 Pro Max does get a big boost in battery life from its larger battery, and an even bigger screen than the previous generation, up from 6.7-inches to 6.9-inches.

Apple iPhone 16 Pro – The iPhone for photography fans Price When Reviewed: $999 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $999 View Deal Apple $999 View Deal $999.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 Pro 128GB – Black Titanium – Unlocked $819.99 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro 128GB – Natural Titanium – Unlocked $853 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro 128GB – Desert Titanium – Unlocked $853 View Deal iPhone 16 Pro 128GB – White Titanium – Unlocked $864.99 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket The Pro version of the iPhone 16 comes in a titanium shell (like it’s predecessor) and offers slightly better performance and battery life than the standard iPhone 16. The photo and video capabilities are where the Pro models stand out. They include a 5x telephoto camera, a sharper 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and support for high-end formats like ProRAW, HLG video, and video recording at up to 4K and 120fps. And yes, it includes the new Camera Control button. Read our full Apple iPhone 16 Pro review 3. Apple iPhone 16 Plus – Big screen, better battery Price When Reviewed: $899 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $929 View Deal $929.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Black – Unlocked $721 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Pink – Unlocked $740 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Ultramarine – Unlocked $745.87 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Teal – Unlocked $749 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – White – Unlocked $777 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket View more prices A larger version of the iPhone 16, with the same specs and features, outside of the obviously larger display. The only place the iPhone 16 Plus differs in performance from the iPhone 16 is in its significantly longer battery life. After all, if the phone is bigger, it can fit a larger battery inside.

Apple iPhone 16 – The iPhone for everyone Price When Reviewed: 128GB $799, 256GB $899, 512GB $1,099 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $829 View Deal $829.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 128GB – Ultramarine – Unlocked $702 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – Teal – Unlocked $702 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – Pink – Unlocked $702 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – Black – Unlocked $719.99 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – White – Unlocked $724 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket View more prices The iPhone 16 is similar to the iPhone 15, but the A18 processor supports Apple Intelligence, while the iPhone 15 doesn’t. It also delivers much longer battery life than the iPhone 15, and includes a new Camera Control button to make it faster and easier to launch your favorite photo app and take pictures. To find out how the iPhone 16 compares to other iPhones in the line up read: iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 15 vs iPhone 16. Read our full Apple iPhone 16 review 5. Apple iPhone 16e – The cheapest iPhone Price When Reviewed: From $599 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $599 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The iPhone 16e arrived in February 2025 and pushed the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 out of the line up. The iPhone 16e brings the Apple Intelligence AI-powered features at a slightly more budget friendly price. Unlike the iPhone 14, the 16e has only one camera on the rear, but its a lot better than the single camera on the iPhone SE was. It also offers better battery life than the iPhone 16. You may want to read our comparisons of the iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e vs the iPhone 15 to see if it’s worth saving money or spending more. We also discuss whether to upgrade from iPhone 14 to the iPhone 16e. Read our full Apple iPhone 16e review 6. Apple iPhone 15 Plus – The cheapest large iPhone Price When Reviewed: $799 (was $899) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $829 View Deal $829.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Introduced in 2023, this iPhone is identical to the iPhone 15 except for one big difference: it’s bigger. If you prefer a larger iPhone, but don’t want to spend a lot of money, this is the iPhone for you. Like the iPhone 15, this phone doesn’t support Apple Intelligence. If you need a big phone you are probably better off with the iPhone 16 Plus. Read our full Apple iPhone 15 Plus review 7. Apple iPhone 15 – Too much of a compromise Price When Reviewed: From $699 (Was $799) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $729 View Deal $729.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The standard iPhone 15 model, introduced in 2023, offered some great new features in comparison to 2022’s iPhone 14, including the Dynamic Island. The iPhone 15 camera was significantly better than the iPhone 14 camera at 48MP and with Smart HDR 5. You also get USB-C instead of Lightning. But, now that the iPhone 16e has taken the place of the iPhone 14 in the line up the question is what the iPhone 15 offers that the iPhone 16e doesn’t. Should you pay $100 more for the iPhone 15 and get the two rear cameras, or save $100 and get a more advanced chip capable of supporting Apple Intelligence. We anticipate that over the next few years you might end up regretting it if you don’t jump on the AI bandwagon now. How much do iPhones cost? Each year when Apple introduces a new set of iPhones it reduces the price of the older models it continues to sell. Below you will find pricing for U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia (scroll across to see pricing in your region). In the U.S., prices are subsidised by which ever carrier you sign up with and you pay more for an unlocked iPhone. In the U.K. and other countries an iPhone can be bought from Apple off contract and unlocked, so you can use it with an existing contract or switch networks to get a better deal.

All the iPhones as of spring 2025.Foundry One easy way to distinguish the iPhone 16 line up from the previous generation is the Camera Control button on the side of the iPhone. The Camera Control button is a physical button that can be used to open the camera app, take photos and control things like the zoom. The iPhone 16e, which joined the line up in February 2025, doesn’t feature the Camera Control button and nor do the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus. There’s a second button on the side of the iPhone 16 line up (which also features on the iPhone 16e). The Action Button (which was previously only found on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max) is a customisable button that can perform certain actions, such as turning on the flashlight or silent mode. The Action Button is above the volume controls in the same position as the mute button on older iPhones. From the front the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are visually similar to the iPhone 16, but turn them over and the camera lenses are positioned differently (diagonally on the 15, and in parallel on the 16). The 16e only has a single camera lens on the back. From the front the iPhone 16e is the only iPhone to feature a notch, all the other current iPhones have the Dynamic Island, a little pill-shaped cutout for the front camera and sensors. Apple and app developers use the Dynamic Island to display all sorts of live information. The iPhone 16e is the lightest iPhone on sale currently and is fractionally shorter than the iPhones 15 and 16. In fact, the screen size is slightly larger on the iPhone 15 and 16. The iPhone 16e has the least inspiring color palette on offer with only black or white to choose from. No Ultramarine or Teal options here, those are reserved for the ‘fun’ iPhone 16, while the iPhone 16 Pro gets more business like metallic finishes. Here’s how the dimensions and colors compare: iPhoneDimensionsWeightColorsiPhone 16 Pro Max6.42 inches (163 mm) x 3.06 inches (77.6 mm) x 0.32 inch (8.25 mm)7.99 ounces (227 grams)Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White Titanium, Black TitaniumiPhone 16 Pro5.89 inches (149.6 mm) x 2.81 inches (71.5 mm) x 0.32 inches (8.25 mm)7.03 ounces (199 grams)Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White Titanium, Black TitaniumiPhone 16 Plus6.33 inches (160.9 mm) x 3.06 inches (77.8 mm) x 0.31 inch (7.80 mm)7.03 ounces (199 grams)Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, BlackiPhone 165.81 inches (147.6 mm) x 2.82 inches (71.6 mm) x 0.31 inch (7.80 mm)6.00 ounces (170 grams)Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, BlackiPhone 15 Plus6.33 inches (160.9 mm) x 3.06 inches (77.8 mm) x 0.31 inch (7.80 mm)7.09 ounces (201 grams)Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, BlackiPhone 155.81 inches (147.6mm) x 2.82 inches (71.6 mm) x 0.31 inches (7.80 mm)6.02 ounces (171 grams)Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, BlackiPhone 16e5.78 inches (146.7 mm) x 2.82 inches (71.5 mm) x 0.31 inch (7.80 mm)5.88 ounces (167 grams)Black, WhiteHow Apple’s iPhone lineup compares, mid 2025. Software: Which iPhones get Apple Intelligence Apple Intelligence, the a suite of AI features that include writing tools, image generation, image recognition, “Genmoji” emoji generation, and new capabilities for Siri is only available on the iPhones that have a 16 in their name. That’s the iPhone 16e, 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus miss out (even though the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max were Apple Intelligence ready). While there is nothing drastically important that you might miss out on if you don’t have Apple Intelligence right now, it’s likely that in time not having Apple Intelligence will be more of a hinderance than it is currently. For example, there are some really impressive AI features coming in iOS 19 that we anticipate will make the Apple Intelligence capable phones even more attractive, so if you don’t want to be suffering from FOMO then get on the AI bandwagon now with an Apple Intelligence-capable phone. Find out about what Apple Intelligence is by reading our guide: Apple Intelligence FAQ, what it is, what it does. Screen: How are the iPhone displays different? The Pro and Pro Max iPhones have the best screens available on an iPhone. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max offer ProMotion, which allows for an adaptive refresh rate. The refresh rate goes as high as 120Hz for really smooth scrolling and as low as 1Hz. ProMotion has been a staple of the “Pro” iPhones for years, but new to all the 2024 iPhone 16 models is the ability for the screen to get very very dim (down to 1 nit) while still remaining usable. It’s great for dark rooms. (The iPhone 16e has a less bright screen and lacks this dimming feature.) Thanks to the Always-On screen on the iPhone 16 Pro models you will always be able to see elements such as the time and date, notifications and Lock Screen widgets without waking the iPhone. The screen dims to minimize onscreen power usage to preserve battery life and it will turn off should you place it face down or walk away while wearing an Apple Watch. Like ProMotion, always-on displays are a feature of Pro iPhones. Both the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus also offer a few more pixels than their predecessors, matching the pixels of the Pro and Pro Max handsets this time round. The screen size may be the most important factor in your decision. If you prefer a larger screen, you’ll want the “Plus” or “Pro Max” version. The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a screen size of 6.9 inches diagonally, up from 6.7 inches in prior years and with the other Plus-size iPhones. It’s a small difference, but one you can notice. The iPhone 16 Pro is larger than the iPhone 16, too: 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches. As we mentioned above, the iPhone 16e is fractionally shorter than the iPhones 15 and 16. While Apple the iPhone 16e, 16 and 15 as having a 6.1-inch display, actually the screen on the iPhone 16 and 15 is 6.12-inches, while the 16e screen is 6.06-inches. This allows for a few more pixels than the iPhone 16e: 2,556-by-1,179-pixel vs 2532-by-1170-pixel resolution at 460 ppi. Camera: How do the iPhone cameras compare? Jason Snell / Foundry For many it’s the capabilities of the cameras that sell the iPhones, so it’s no wonder that every year Apple improves the camera on its iPhones, sometimes improving the tech, sometimes the software. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus still feature a dual-camera array with wide and ultra-wide lenses, while only the Pro and Pro Max offer the additional 5x telephoto lens. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have a 48 megapixel Ultra Wide camera, while the 15 and 15 Plus have a 12 megapixel Ultra Wide. However, the 16 and 16 Plus can now shoot macro photos, a feature that used to be reserved for the Pro models. There are also new video recording features for the pro models, including ProRes video recording up to 4K at 120 fps, LOG video recording and Academy Color Encoding. The iPhone 16e features a single-lens camera system, omitting certain advanced features found in higher-end models. However, it still delivers notable improvements over previous budget iPhones, with camera capabilities that are suitable for everyday photography needs Also read: Which iPhone has the best camera? iPhoneCamerasVideoPhoto \u0026 video featuresiPhone 16 Pro and Pro MaxThree rear cameras: 48MP Main (ƒ/1.78 aperture), 48MP Ultra Wide (ƒ/2.2 aperture) and 12MP Telephoto (ƒ/2.8 aperture), second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, 5x, 1x, 2x, 0.5x optical zoom, Adaptive True Tone flashFront camera: TrueDepth front camera, 12 MP (ƒ/1.9 aperture)Video: ProRes video recording up to 4K at up to 120 fps (with external recording), 4K video recording at up to 120 fps, 1080p HD video recording at up to 120 fps, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 4K at 120 fps, Sensor-shift optical image stabilization for video, Spatial video up to 1080p at 30 fpsLOG video recording, Academy Color Encoding System, Photonic Engine, Night mode portraits, Night mode, new Photographic Styles, Macro photos, ProRaw, Smart HDR 5Cinematic mode, Macro video recording, Action Mode, Audio zoom, wind noise reductioniPhone 16 and 16 PlusTwo rear cameras: 48MP Main (ƒ/1.6 aperture), 12MP Ultra Wide (ƒ/2.2 aperture), sensor-shift optical image stabilization, 2x, 1x, 0.5x zoom, True Tone flashFront camera: TrueDepth front camera, 12MP (ƒ/1.9 aperture)Video: 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, 1080p HD video recording at 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 4K at 60 fps, Sensor-shift optical image stabilization for video, Spatial video up to 1080p at 30 fpsPhotonic Engine, Action Mode, Night mode, new Photographic Styles, Smart HDR 5Cinematic mode, Audio zoom, wind noise reductioniPhone 15 and 15 PlusTwo rear cameras: 48MP Main (ƒ/1.6 aperture), 12MP Ultra Wide (ƒ/2.4 aperture), sensor-shift optical image stabilization, 2x, 1x and 0.5x optical zoom, True Tone flashFront camera: TrueDepth front camera, 12MP (ƒ/1.9 aperture)Video: 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, 1080p HD video recording at 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision up to 4K at 60 fps, Sensor-shift optical image stabilization for videoPhotonic Engine, Action Mode, Night mode, Photographic Styles, Smart HDR 5Cinematic mode, Audio zoomiPhone 16eOne rear cameras: 48MP Main (ƒ/1.6 aperture), optical image stabilization, 1x, 2x, zoom, True Tone flashFront camera: TrueDepth front camera, 12MP (ƒ/1.9 aperture)Video: 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, 1080p HD video recording at 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, optical image stabilization for videoPhotonic Engine, Night mode, Photographic Styles, Smart HDR 5, wind noise reductionThe camera features of the spring 2025 iPhone lineup. Safety features: Emergency protection Apple introduced some safety features with the iPhone 14 series in 2022 and these are available on all the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models. These features include a Crash Detection feature and Satellite Connectivity for emergency phone calls. Crash detection uses the gyroscope and accelerometer in the iPhones to recognize if the vehicle you are in has crashed. If the iPhone thinks you’ve been involved in a crash, it will call emergency services and notify your preferred contacts (unless you tell it not to). All phones offer the ability to send an Emergency SOS, but since the iPhone iPhones have been able to do so via satellite, which would be useful if you were in an area with no signal. You just need to be able to establish a clear view of the sky, and be in a country that supports the feature (many do now). Thanks to the feature your iPhone can alert the emergency services to your location in an emergency, the iPhone will also contact your emergency contact. Durability: Which iPhone is the toughest? Another factor in the choice of which iPhone to choose is how durable the model is. How likely are you to damage the iPhone? All iPhones on sale right now offer a Ceramic Shield front, which should mean that the glass on the front is less likely to smash if you drop it. Only the Pro and Pro Max are constructed from titanium (previous generations were stainless steel), which is more durable than aluminum, which all other iPhones are encased in. All iPhones have a glass back (which is necessary for MagSafe wireless charging). This does mean that if you drop your iPhone with no case on then you are pretty much guaranteed to break the glass on the back. So be sure to pop your new iPhone in a case. For our recommendations see our round-up of the Best iPhone 16 cases. The other way people damage their iPhones is by dropping them in water. All current iPhones are rated as water resistant to a depth of 6 meters for up to 30 minutes (IP68). We still wouldn’t recommend getting your iPhone wet though because Apple will know if it’s gotten wet and it could void your warranty should anything go wrong. Which iPhone would be worse off if you dropped it? Apple Specs: Storage and processor options The A18 in the iPhone 16, 16 Plus and iPhone 16e is considerably faster than the A16 found in the iPhone 15, especially when it comes to graphics or AI tasks. There is one fewer GPU core in the iPhone 16e (4-core GPU, compared to 5-core GPU in the 16 and 16 Plus). The A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max is distinguished primarily by an extra GPU core (6-core GPU), though it also has super video hardware to support the Pro video features. As mentioned above the A18 is able to support Apple Intelligence. The A16 in the iPhone 15 cannot. Each iPhone is available in between three and four capacity options. It’s important to consider how much you need before buying because iPhones don’t have a microSD card slot that will allow you to add additional storage at a later date. For the typical iPhone user, 128GB is probably sufficient. One reason you may not need more storage is if you choose to sync your data to the cloud. If you pay a monthly fee for iCloud storage all your data will be available on any of your devices, and crucially your photos will be stored in the cloud rather than on your device, freeing up many gigabytes of space. iCloud starts at $0.99/£0.99 for 50GB. See How much does iCloud cost for more information, including Australian and Canadian prices. Before you decide how much storage you need have a look at your current phone’s usage (go to Settings \u003e General \u003e iPhone Storage) and think about how much space you really need.

In our testing, the difference in battery life was even more pronounced than Apple’s spec sheets indicate—we saw battery life improvements of around 20 percent for the regular models and 30 percent for the Pro models. As for how you charge the iPhone, fast charging requires a 20W adapter or higher that plugs into either the USB-C on 2023 iPhones, or the Lightning port on older iPhones. All but the iPhone SE 3 can also be charged wirelessly via MagSafe. The iPhone 16 models support faster MagSafe charging when used with a 30W power adapter. Apple’s official battery life and charging times can be seen in the table above. In our testing, the iPhone 16 line offered a big boost in battery life over prior models, too. Apple claims the iPhone 16e has even better battery life than the iPhone 16. However, in our tests the 16e managed 13 hours and 38 minutes, which is lower than any other 16-series iPhone. We compare battery life, capacity, mah and watt hours for every iPhone separately. Which iPhone should I buy? The best iPhone you can buy right now is the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max, depending on whether you want a larger display or not. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are probably a better value, though. They support Apple Intelligence and have the Camera Control button and have fantastic battery life and performance, so all you’re really giving up is the 5x telephoto camera (you still get a 2x optical crop-zoom mode) and some high-end video features. You could save money and opt instead for an iPhone 15, which might appeal if you are upgrading from a particularly old iPhone, but we think a much better option is the iPhone 16e, which will be future-proofed for upcoming Apple Intelligence features. Unless you really want the additional ultra-wide camera, which is missing from this phone. Once you have chosen your new iPhone be sure to read our iPhone setup guide. Buying an iPhone on contract The two most common ways to buy an iPhone are SIM-free from Apple itself or a third-party reseller (which is where the pricing information throughout this information fits in, because you’ll be paying upfront for the phone, you will own it, and you will then need to pay for a SIM-only contract for minutes, texts and data), or buying an iPhone on contract. A contract usually starts with an upfront payment that will vary depending on the iPhone model you go for and also how much you’ll be paying each month. That upfront payment is followed by monthly payments, normally for a total of 24 months, after which you own the phone (in most cases). Those monthly payments also cover data, minutes and texts. The following networks are worth checking for their contract offers: AT\u0026T Sprint T-Mobile Verizon Optimum Mobile Boost Infinite U.K. readers can find iPhone contracts from the following networks: O2 EE Vodafone Three Tesco Mobile Sky Mobile Virgin Mobile And from the following third-party resellers: Carphone Warehouse Mobiles.co.uk E2save Mobile Phones Direct Using the iPhone Upgrade Program Apple offers a scheme called the iPhone Upgrade Program, which works with your carrier and starts at $39.50/£42.95 per month. You can then upgrade to the new iPhone each time one is announced, staying on the same or a very similar plan. You should be cautious about the value this offers, but in some circumstances, it may be the right approach for you. The scheme works slightly differently in the U.K., where this is for a SIM-free iPhone. You will also need to get a SIM-only contract for your data, minutes and texts. You do get AppleCare+ included in the Upgrade Program, though, which is a two-year insurance for your iPhone that will cover you for two incidents of accidental damage. You’ll still have to pay an excess fee should you need to use it, but it’ll be much cheaper than having to cough up the full price of a repair. Buying a second-hand and refurbished iPhone You’ll have noticed that buying an iPhone doesn’t come cheap. However, if you’re strapped for cash you don’t have to dismiss the idea of buying an iPhone completely. You may be able to get a good deal on one of the older handsets if someone is looking to sell their current handset. Here are or recommendations of the best place to buy a used iPhone. Not sold on iPhone after all? By now we hope we’ve helped you to find the perfect iPhone for you. Of course, there are alternatives outside Apple’s ecosystem. Our sister site Tech Advisor can help you find the best phone if you’re considering switching to Android (or maybe just want to laugh at the competition).",

    "description": "Macworld There are three types of storage you can use with your Mac. External storage devices like SSDs and hard drives can plug into your Mac and be used to back up your data or to extend your storage. There are also those little USB memory sticks you can use to store or transfer files, these days they can hold up to 2TB of files in your pocket. These days cloud storage is another popular solution, as it offers a simple way to access your data from anywhere, collaborate with teams of people, and it extends the amount of storage available on your Mac. With the advent of home working meaning fewer people are confined to the office, lots are turning to cloud storage for collaboration, but there are downsides to this, not least the fact that typical cloud storage solutions are not really suitable for backing up (iCloud doesn’t work with Time Machine for example). There are various cloud backup services that we look at here: Best Cloud backup for Mac. The third kind of storage is a NAS (network-attached storage). A NAS drive is a good solution if you are looking for a shared storage solution for a team of people in an office, when you want to share data and projects between multiple workstations, or if you are looking for a way to keep your Mac backed up without needing to leave it plugged into a drive. Using a NAS to store your files means you aren’t reliant on a good internet connection, you don’t need to upload your data to an external service, and you don’t (generally) have to pay a monthly subscription.  So, in this article, we round up the best NAS drives for a Mac owner. If you’d like more advice about what to look for in a good NAS drive, such as the amount of storage you’ll need and the features to look for, jump down to our buying advice. Best NAS and PCS drives for Mac Western Digital My Cloud Home – Best overall Pros Good Mac support Online backup sync Cons No simple drag-and-drop Price When Reviewed: $149.99 (2TB), $169.99 (4TB), $249.99 (8TB) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Western Digital $149.99 View Deal $279.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket You’re spoilt for choice when it comes to Western Digital’s My Cloud range, with several models available for home users and small businesses, as well as a number of Expert and Pro models for larger organizations. The My Cloud Home is a little more expensive than other models in the My Cloud range, but is fast and provides additional features such as support for the Plex Media Server software (although that’s probably not a must-have for Mac users). It comes with a range of storage allocations; 8TB should be more than enough for most homes, as well as small offices and self-employed users. The slimline white-and-silver unit is neatly designed and only measures 2in wide, so it’ll sit easily on your desk or on a shelf close to your router without taking up too much space. There’s also a larger dual-drive model, called the My Cloud Home Duo, which houses two matching drives and offers considerably more storage. That provides RAID 1 mirroring for extra data protection, but if you want more sophisticated RAID features, as well as the ability to install and remove drives yourself, you’ll need to step up to the My Cloud Expert or My Cloud Pro models. Western Digital always does a good job with Mac support, and the My Cloud Home is no exception, with apps that handle a range of tasks quickly and easily. The iOS app can perform automatic backups of your photos and videos, while the Mac app lets you use Time Machine for your backups (and there are Mac and Windows versions of the apps available too). There are some nice touches too, such as the ability to right-click a folder on your Mac and automatically sync the contents of that folder on to the My Cloud Home. That will be handy for people who want an extra backup of their current work files or projects in addition to the basic Time Machine backup. You can also right-click any file that is stored on the My Cloud Home and send a download link in order to quickly share that file with friends or colleagues. And, if you also use an online backup service, such as Dropbox, then you can sync the contents of your Dropbox account on to the My Cloud Home too. You can even back up photos and albums from Facebook on to the drive for safekeeping if you want to. There are a couple of rough edges. You can’t simply double-click the drive’s icon on the Mac desktop in order to open the drive and then drag-and-drop to copy folders or files on to the drive. For some reason you have to open the app’s pulldown menu and view the contents of the drive through the app instead. You can’t create individual user accounts on the Mac either, so you’re forced to use the app on an iPhone or iPad if you want to invite someone else to create their own personal folders on the My Cloud Home drive. Most Mac users will have an iPhone or iPad, of course, but we’d like to see the Mac app updated to allow you full freedom to control the My Cloud Home with your Mac as well. Synology DiskStation DS925+ – Versatile and expandable Pros Compact NAS drive with lots of storage Good performance Expandable Cons Hard drives cost extra Poorly designed apps Price When Reviewed: $640 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $543.95 View Deal $639.99 View Deal $639.99 View Deal Synology $640 View Deal $655.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Synology’s DiskStation DS925+, offers expandable storage with future-proofing capabilities.The DS925+ resembles its predecessor, the DS923+, with a black design and four drive bays for hard drives or SSDs. Two M.2 slots on the base allow for SSD modules for a high-speed cache. The DS925+ features a quad-core AMD Ryzen V1500B processor running at 2.2GHz, two 2.5Gb Ethernet ports for a high-speed network connection, and a maximum write speed of up to 565MB/s and read speed of 522MB/s. These speeds depend on network configuration and drive type. Like many Synology NAS drives, the DS925+ is sold ‘unpopulated’, an empty chassis without drives. The unpopulated drive costs $640/£575, requiring additional hard drives or SSDs. You must select 2.5-inch SSD or 3.5-inch hard drives approved by Synology. These can be bought from Synology or online dealers.  The DS925+ has four bays that can hold up to 20TB of hard drives, providing a maximum of 80TB of storage (with RAID options supported). An expansion module called the DX525 can be connected to further upgrade storage. It costs $449/£467 and adds five drive bays, giving a maximum of 180TB of storage. USB-A (3.2) ports on the front and back panels allow connecting external drives. Synology’s hardware design is efficient, but the software is confusing for new users. The box includes a QR code that leads to lengthy, complicated Help files on Synology’s website, which could easily confuse first-time NAS users. The DS Finder app, available for iOS and Android, can detect the DS925+ when connected to the office network. However, it only suggests using a web browser to download and install DiskStation Manager (DSM) software, which doesn’t work either. It then prompts users to download a separate desktop app called Synology Assistant, which initially fails but provides tips for adjusting encryption settings.  After installing DSM, users can switch back to the DS Finder app on their iPad to complete the setup process. The app also includes a QuickConnect option for remote access, allowing users to access files as a ‘private cloud’ when away from the office. Unfortunately, the DS Finder app requires additional apps for file management, photos, and other features. Synology should improve its documentation and simplify its app selection to make it more user-friendly for small businesses and home workers without IT support. The compact DS925+ is suitable for small businesses or offices, with expansion options for future storage. However, its software is unorganised, so it’s best suited for experienced networkers setting up a NAS drive.particularly deadly.

Ports include 10Gbe ethernet, three 10Gbps USB ports (two Type-A, one Type-C), and an HDMI port for diagnostics rather than direct video output. It’s 7-inch tall, by 2.25-inch wide, and 5.5-inch. It’s not particularly hefty, weighing only 1 pound, 10 ounces with eight SSDs installed. The eight included heat sinks add another 5 ounces if you need them (that depends on how much traffic the fan-cooled box is subjected to). It opens via a single thumb screw and rests on rubber feet. It is stable despite its vertical orientation, but you might want to lay it on its side. Of course, SSDs aren’t as delicate as hard drives that normally inhabit NAS boxes, so a tumble likely wouldn’t be catastrophic. NAS/server features include security, file sharing, media streaming, BitTorrent downloads, video surveillance, Docker and VM hosting. These all require installing applications from TerraMaster. There are numerous backup solutions available, and the File Manager lets you add remote folders from Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and Amazon S3/S3-compatibles. The operating system, TOS 6.0, isn’t quite as refined as those offered by QNAP and Synology. I couldn’t run file manager or anything else while installing an app, for example. Also, the program didn’t register a deleted storage pool, an added online destination, or a new volume immediately. I had to reboot each time to get changes to register. Despite this, I found TOS 6 attractive, decently intuitive, easy to use, and stable. But it could use some fine-tuning (and multi-tasking), even if none of the issues are particularly deadly. Read our full Terramaster F8 SSD Plus NVMe 10Gbe NAS review Synology Beestation – Good for beginners Pros Apps provide useful features Cons Apps are tricky to use Price When Reviewed: $219 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $204.5 View Deal $219.99 View Deal Synology $219.99 View Deal $225.98 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The widespread use of cloud storage services such as iCloud and Google Drive means that NAS drives aren’t as popular as they used to be, and Synology is one of the few companies still making NAS drives that cater to the SOHO market (small office/home office) with its DiskStation range. Synology is expanding its product range with the introduction of the BeeStation. The BeeStation looks like a fairly conventional desktop hard drive, and it provides 4TB of storage so you’ve got plenty of room for your work or personal files. Like most NAS drives it uses an Ethernet port to connect to your home or office network, but once you’ve connected it to your Wi-Fi router, you can simply scan a QR code with your iPhone or iPad to connect to the drive remotely and set it up using a web browser (although you’ll need to provide an email address to set up your Synology account first). You are then prompted to download two mobile apps called BeePhotos and BeeFiles, which, as the names suggest, allow you to back-up photos and other files onto the BeeStation. Once the drive is set up, you can log in via a web browser on your Mac, and then download the BeeStation desktop app for Macs (running macOS 12 or later) and Windows PCs. These apps provide plenty of useful features, including the ability to automatically upload photos and videos from your mobile devices onto the BeeStation. You can share files with friends, family or colleagues, and sync specific folders on your Mac with the BeeStation. However, these apps can be a bit tricky to use – they tend to throw a lot of settings and information onto the screen, and the Help files on Synology’s website use a lot of techno-jargon that might be confusing for less experienced users. Mac users, for instance, will find that instructions for using the BeeStation with Time Machine are hidden within a rather convoluted Help file about ‘local access’ settings. So it may take a little work to get the BeeStation properly set up, but its ability to provide both online storage for mobile devices and a NAS drive for your home or office network makes it a very versatile back-up device for home and small business users. Western Digital My Cloud EX2 Ultra – The quick and easy option Pros Straightforward and easy to use Can be used as a RAID Cons Software has reduced compatibility Price When Reviewed: From $150.99 (unpopulated) to $1,299.99 (28TB) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Western Digital $150.99 View Deal Check Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Western Digital’s My Cloud Home drive provides a quick and easy option for home users who aren’t familiar with NAS drives and networking technology. In fact, the company doesn’t even call it a ‘NAS drive’, opting for the more user-friendly ‘personal cloud’ label instead. (If you feel a bit more comfortable with jargon such as NAS and RAID, you might want to step up to WD’s ‘expert’ range with the My Cloud EX2 Ultra instead.) The EX2 Ultra is a no-compromises NAS drive with additional features and customisation options, while remaining affordable enough for home users or self-employed people, such as photographers or designers, who need a really reliable backup drive for important work files. It’s a ‘two-bay’ drive that holds two separate hard drives, and allows you to remove the top panel so you can remove the drives for repairs or adding more storage in the future. You can buy the EX2 Ultra with a pair of drives pre-installed, with a wide range of prices depending on the storage you select. WD includes its high-performance Red Drives and 1GB of memory to help the EX2 Ultra multi-task when different people are using the drive on the network at the same time. There’s a Gigabit Ethernet port for connecting to your network, and the EX2 Ultra also has two USB ports that allow you to connect an external USB drive for additional storage. Alternatively, you have the option of buying the EX2 Ultra ‘unpopulated’ – with no drives at all – and then providing your own drives to suit your particular needs. This is the best option if you think you might want to add extra storage in the future, and installation is really easy: the top panel simply pops open at the press of a button to reveal the internal drive bays. Using two separate hard drives also means the EX2 Ultra can work as a ‘RAID’ drive, with either RAID 0 – which improves performance by splitting files across both drives (called ‘striping’) – or RAID 1 ‘mirroring’, which makes separate copies of your files on each drive for extra reliability. If you want even more safeguards for your important files, there’s also an option to back up data from the EX2 Ultra on to an external hard drive connected to one of its USB ports. Despite all these extra features, setting up the EX2 Ultra is still very straightforward, as the drive supports Time Machine for automatically backing up files from your Mac. There’s also a My Cloud app for iOS/iPadOS and Android that allows you to back up and share files using non-Apple devices as well. The app provides remote access to the drive over the internet, and there’s a web browser interface also available for Macs and PCs, which allows more advanced users to configure RAID settings and features such as the FTP server – and even to use it as an ‘iTunes Server’ for streaming music across your network. It’s worth checking out the changes made by the My Cloud OS 5 software update, however; this adds several new features, but reduces compatibility with some web services. Buffalo LinkStation 220D – Versatile \u0026 affordable Pros Versatile and affordable Cons Unreliable apps Price When Reviewed: From $119.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Buffalo Technology $119.99 View Deal Dell Home $264.99 View Deal $387.49 View Deal $439.99 View Deal $488.36 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Buffalo’s LinkStation 220D is a versatile and affordable NAS drive that’s suitable for both home and business users. But, as we’ve seen with Buffalo in the past, its products sometimes lack the straightforward ease of use that Mac and iOS users take for granted. The LinkStation 220D is a dual-bay NAS drive that houses two separate hard drives. You can buy it ‘unpopulated’ – with no drives at all – and then provide the drives that you want to use for yourself. Alternatively, you can buy it with 2TB, 4TB or 8TB. There’s also a more expensive model called the 220DR that’s designed for use with Western Digital’s high-speed Red drives, but the standard 220D model that we review here should be perfectly adequate for most homes and small businesses. The dual-bay setup also means you can use the LinkStation as a RAID drive, supporting either RAID 0 for maximum performance, or RAID 1 for maximum data protection (storing separate copies of your data on both drives). Future upgrades are simple as well, as you can quickly remove the front panel of the LinkStation and pull out the drives by their handles, with no screws or tools required. There’s also a USB port on the back of the LinkStation that can be used to make additional backups to an external USB drive for extra safety. Getting started is quite straightforward, as the 4TB LinkStation that we tested automatically showed up on our office network once we connected it to our router with an Ethernet cable. That allowed us to simply drag-and-drop files onto the LinkStation for quick backups, but things get a bit more complicated when you start to move beyond the basics. The LinkStation does work with Time Machine so that you can back up your Macs over the network, but setting up Time Machine and a ‘shared folder’ for your backups proved rather complicated. Buffalo’s NAS Navigator app for Macs allows you to view the LinkStation on your network and displays basic information, such as its IP address. However, using any other features requires you to open up a web browser in order to view the LinkStation’s web interface. This does include a variety of useful features, including Time Machine support, remote ‘web access’ for when you’re away from home or the office, BitTorrent downloads, and the ability to use the LinkStation as an iTunes server for streaming your music across the network. But this browser interface is very complicated and won’t be easy for non-technical users to understand – and Buffalo’s 125-page jargon-heavy PDF manual doesn’t really make life any easier. And neither do Buffalo’s mobile apps. Buffalo provides two separate apps for iOS devices: Smartphone Navigator for basic setup, and WebAccess to provide access to your files via Wi-Fi when you’re out and about. These apps are getting on a bit, and some users have complained that they’re unreliable. In fact, the apps seemed to run on our office iPhone and iPad without any problems, but they’re still quite complicated and unhelpful for people who aren’t familiar with NAS drives and networking technology. So while the LinkStation is a good option for more experienced home or business users who already know a bit about NAS drives, it’s probably not the best option for first-time users who are still learning the ropes. Why you can trust Macworld The team at Macworld has tested a lot of storage over the past couple of decades. These are the drives we use and recommend. How we test NAS drives We run stringent tests on the NAS drives we review including benchmarking in order that we have a library of results we can compare. We also mirror real world use, transferring sets of tiles and folders, checking write and read speeds and testing how the drives perform in large file transfers. How to choose the best NAS drive Here are some essential features you should look out for when selecting a NAS drive for your Mac. Time Machine support One of the great unsung features of macOS is Time Machine, the software that sits inside your System Preferences panel and quietly performs an automatic backup of the entire contents of your Mac’s hard disk every hour, on the hour. If you accidentally delete a file you can go back and check out all the previous versions of that file that you backed up in the past. And if your Mac starts behaving oddly and you think you might have been infected by malware, you can just reboot your Mac and use Time Machine to restore the entire macOS to an earlier, untarnished state. But, of course, in order to use Time Machine you do need to have an external hard drive connected to your Mac that can store all your old backups. Hard drives are pretty cheap these days, but as we all start to own more and more desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices, it starts to become both expensive and rather impractical to buy a separate backup drive for every single device in our home or office. The answer to this problem is a NAS drive. Most NAS drives are ‘Mac-compatible’ – but not all of them are what we might call ‘Mac-friendly’. For instance, not all NAS drives will allow you to use Time Machine to make backups over the network, so support for Time Machine is a key feature that you should check on when thinking about buying a NAS drive for use with one or more Macs. User accounts and sharing Another important feature is the ability to create individual user accounts, so that each person in your home or office can have their own private area on the NAS drive for storing their personal files. And, at the same time, it’s also handy to create ‘shares’, which are like public folders that can be shared by everyone – perhaps for storing music or photos for the whole family. Most NAS drives will allow you to do this, but sometimes you need a bit of network know-how to figure out how each drive handles this process (and some drives, such as Apple’s now-discontinued Time Capsule, just ignore this side of things altogether and focus on the basic task of handling Time Machine backups). Mobile device support And, of course, you’ll also want to check that your new NAS drive provides an app for your iPhone or iPad. Most of us now tend to use iCloud for backing up photos, videos and other files from our mobile devices, but it can give you extra peace of mind to know that you’ve got a spare backup on your NAS drive in case anything goes wrong. A good NAS drive will also let you share your photos and videos with other people by streaming them to mobile devices over your network, or possibly even provide a remote access option that allows you to retrieve files over the internet when you’re away from home (a feature that manufacturers often refer to as a ‘personal cloud’). File streaming Many people also use their NAS drive as a kind of central media server for their home, perhaps streaming music and videos to a games console that is connected to their TV in the front room. Mac users should check to see if a NAS drive can stream files to an Apple TV, or act as an ‘iTunes server’, storing your iTunes/Music library on the NAS drive so that it can stream music to every Mac or iOS device on the network. How much storage do you need? That’s something you’ll need to decide for yourself, but it’s worth mentioning that some NAS drives are more flexible on this point than others. Some of the less expensive NAS drives are sold with a built-in hard drive – generally at least 2TB – but the hard drive is fixed and can’t be replaced once it’s full (although the NAS drive may have a USB port that lets you connect a conventional USB hard drive in order to add some extra storage). This is the simplest option, favored by most home users and small businesses, as it means you can just unpack the NAS drive and connect it to your router to get started. The unpopulated option However, many NAS drives are sold ‘unpopulated’ – without any internal hard drives already installed – and simply provide two or more empty drive bays into which you insert your own choice of hard drives. This option is more expensive, but it allows you to customise the NAS by buying your own hard in order to provide as much storage as you need. And, if you run out of storage space, you can just take out the old drives and insert new, larger drives in the future. This type of NAS drive generally also offers a number of ‘RAID’ options – this stands for “redundant array of independent disks” – which use multiple hard drives to provide additional performance and data protection.",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
