This is a continuation of a move starting in 2022 towards more user repairability of its products.Batteries, one of the most common replacement parts, sell for $99 for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, or $119 for the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max. Likewise, replacement camera assemblies cost $169 or $249, depending on the model. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "description": "Macworld Thanksgiving is a time to reflect upon the prior year, be thankful for what we have, gorge ourselves until we‚Äôre near bursting, and then settle into our favorite chairs and watch the first half of a TV show before the tryptophan kicks in. If you usually spend your post-meal time falling asleep to A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, you won‚Äôt find it on the usual broadcast or cable channels‚Äìit‚Äôs exclusively on Apple TV+. Before you wave that turkey drumstick in the air and curse the state of television and all the darn streaming services you need subscriptions for‚Äîyes, I‚Äôm talking about you, Uncle Fred‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need a subscription to Apple TV+ to watch A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. Apple is making the show available to anyone for a limited time. If you are an Apple TV+ subscriber, however, you can watch it anytime. How to watch¬†A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving¬†for free on Apple TV+ On November 23 and 24, anyone with an Apple ID can watch¬†A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. If you own an Apple device, you have one, but if not, Apple IDs are free and you don‚Äôt need a credit card to sign up. Once you have signed up, you can watch in several ways: Through the TV app on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. On smart TVs with the Apple TV app. On the web at¬†tv.apple.com. On an Apple TV device. As we noted when Apple did this same deal with It‚Äôs the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, Apple has all the classic Peanuts specials for the holiday season that used to air over broadcast TV. Apple TV+ also has¬†A Charlie Brown Christmas that will have its free airing on Dec. 14 and 15. Apple TV+ also has Happy New Year, Charlie Brown but it is not listed as free-to-view. A few years ago, Apple acquired the rights to the Peanuts cartoon series that stars Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Linus, Lucy, and other memorable characters. Since then, Apple has aired new Peanuts shows such as The Snoopy Show and Snoopy in Space, and new movies, including Peanuts in Space: Secrets of Apollo 10, Lucy‚Äôs School, and It‚Äôs the Small Things, Charlie Brown. The Apple TV+ subscription television streaming service is $9.99/¬£9.99 per month and can be renewed annually for $99/¬£99. Apple TV+ is also included in the Apple One subscription bundles, which include other Apple services, such as Apple Music, Apple News+, and iCloud storage. Apple One bundles are priced between $19.95/¬£19.95 and $37.95/¬£37.95 per month. For more information about Apple TV+, read our Apple TV+ FAQ.

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros 2 or 4 USB-C ports Built-in Find My locator Slim charger International Travel Set available Cons Our Verdict Twelve South PlugBug With Find Me is a great travel charger with a built-in locator to give you peace of mind that you should never lose your trusty charger again. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When ReviewedFrom $69.99 Best Prices Today: Twelve South PlugBug with Find My Retailer Price $69.99 View Deal $69.99 View Deal $69.99 View Deal $79.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket We have reviewed a lot of USB-C chargers, from tiny ones you could lose in a pocket to giant desktop chargers with enough ports for every device you own. While we‚Äôd never forget where the big desktop charger is situated, the smaller and more portable chargers have a frustrating habit of disappearing. ‚ÄúCan I borrow your charger for a minute?‚Äù is the plaintive plea that charger owners will hear now and again or far too frequently in a large office or family. However, that minute can stretch far enough to the point where when you next need to charge your phone or laptop you suddenly find it‚Äôs not where it should be. Short of taping an AirTag onto your charger you have little option but to go hunt the office or house power sockets for it. Or maybe you left it in a suitcase that has gone missing. Accessory maker Twelve South has a cunning product that could make that hunt all the easier. Its PlugBug With Find My charger has a locator built into it. The locator is hidden away in a back compartment, so looks better than a sleek charger with an AirTag strapped on. It works just like an AirTag, and you set it up the same way and check for it in the Find My app‚Äôs Items section. You can make it sound an alert and all the other features available to Find My app items. Like the AirTag it requires a replaceable battery‚Äîone is included‚Äîthat is easy to swap out when it runs out in a couple of years. More than a big AirTag The principal purpose of the PlugBug is as a USB-C wall charger, and it comes in two models. Twelve South The PlugBug 50 has two USB-C ports, each rated at 50W. Use both at the same time and one will charge at 30W and the other at 20W. 50W is powerful enough to charge a MacBook Air, though MacBook Pro owners would be better served with the PlugBug 120, which has four USB-C ports, each rated at 120W. Use all four at the same time and one will charge at 50W, two at 25W, and the fourth at 20W (or one 50W, two 20W, and one 25W depending on the device). If you have three devices, the‚Äôll charge at 65W/35W/20W, while two will split the charge between 70W and 30W. The charger detects dynamically delivers the right amount of fast charging power to each device being charged so you don‚Äôt have to worry about which port to connect each device to. Twelve South PlugBug with Find My Charger: Design The PlugBug With Find My is long but thin so is especially suitable in those hotel rooms with power sockets tucked into hard-to-reach places behind desks or nightstands. It features a fetching red section that makes it visually easy to spot, too‚Äîwhich could come in handy when you try to distinguish it in a busy caf√© or airport environment. While the PlugBug is a more than capable home charger, it is especially useful on your travels. The U.S. model has folding prongs for extra travel slimness. The PlugBug 50 measures 3.3 x 1.9 x 0.9 inches (8,3 x 4.9 x 2.2cm), and weighs 3.9oz (110g). The PlugBug 120 measures 4.1 x 2.4 x 1.2 inches (10.4 x 6 x 3.1cm), and weighs 8.8oz (250g). Twelve South The U.K. and E.U. versions ship with plug attachments for both regions. The U.S. model features just the foldable North American prongs. Apple sells an exclusive Twelve South PlugBug Travel Set, which includes interchangeable international adapters for U.S., U.K., E.U., AU, KR, and CN and a travel case, for both the 2-port and 4-port models ($79.95 and $129.95). PlugBug with Find My Charger: Price In the U.S. the PlugBug 50 costs $69.99 and the PlugBug 120 is priced at $119.99, direct from Twelve South or via Amazon. See also the value-for-money Travel Set sold exclusively through the Apple Store. In Canada the two models are priced C$99.99 and C$169.99. In the U.K. its ¬£69.99 and ¬£119.99. And in the E.U. it‚Äôs 79,99 and 139,99 Euros. For more USB-C charging options check out our recommendations for the best iPhone chargers and best MacBook chargers. Should you buy a PlugBug with Find My Charger? We thought we‚Äôd seen it all from the wide range of USB-C chargers but the powerful Twelve South PlugBug With Find Me is a great travel charger with a built-in locator to give you peace of mind that you should never lose your trusty charger again. It won‚Äôt stop you from forgetting it and leaving it at home only to slam into your thoughts as you reach the airport or hotel, but at least you‚Äôll know exactly where it is.",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
