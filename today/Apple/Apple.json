    "description": "Macworld Updated 06/12/25: A new report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg claims his sources (“people with knowledge of the matter”) say Apple is targeting the iOS 26.4 update to bring these Siri features to users. The x.4 updates are typically released in March. At WWDC last summer, Apple showed off some advanced Siri features as part of Apple Intelligence that were supposed to come in an update to iOS 18 this spring. Apple even ran TV ads promoting iPhone 16 that showcased those features. Then, this spring, Apple delayed the release of those features and said they would be delivered “in the coming year.” Now we have confirmation that this does not mean later in 2025. The new Siri features won’t be a part of iOS 26, or a 26.1 or 26.2 update. As a reminder, there are three major Siri features that were supposed to be here by now but missed the iOS 18 deadline: Screen awareness: Siri can read what’s on your screen and take proper contextual action. When looking at a screen with an address on it, asking Siri to “Add this to my contacts” will know what you’re talking about, for example. Personal context: Siri will use your mail, messages, web history, etc to build a contextual profile of you. (No data leaves your iPhone, it’s private.) So when you ask it for info, it can give you answers that are specific to you and your life. In-app actions: A massive expansion of “app intents” will let developers build apps so that Siri can perform actions within them. “Make this photo black and white and send it to my wife” should be able to perform the necessary actions in Photos and Messages without your intervention. Hundreds of App Intents would let Siri do all sorts of things within both Apple’s apps and third-party apps. In a WWDC interview with Mark Spoonauer from Tom’s Guide and Lance Ulanoff from Tech Radar, Apple’s software engineering head Craig Federighi and marketing chief Greg “Joz” Joswiak explained what happened and what we can expect. As Federighi explains it, those announced features were being built on the “V1” Siri architecture, and were working, but not well enough. And to meet the quality bar, those features need to be built upon the newer Siri “V2” architecture. Apple has these features and more working, in-house, using the new V2 architecture but will no announce a date for when we can expect them until it has reached the quality level it thinks its customers expect. When pressed by Spoonauer, who asked, “Instead of an actual release date, is it okay to say 2026, or is that too broad?” Joz answered, “Yeah, that’s what we said.” Federighi then went on to explain how the “V2” architecture being used in a homogeneous fashion across all of Siri gives Apple “much higher quality and much better capability.” Of course, 2026 is still half a year away, and we don’t know when in 2026 we can expect any of this stuff. Apple could release the big V2 Siri update as an update to the version 26 OSes in the spring, perhaps with iOS/macOS/iPadOS 26.4 or the like. But it could also come in iOS 27 in the fall of 2026, or even as an update to that. A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says Apple is currently targeting the iOS 26.4 update, around March, for these features. The timing could change. No matter how you look at it, if you want a new and improved Siri, you’re going to be waiting a while. And you probably shouldn’t expect Apple to announce a date or give a demo until it’s ready to launch.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple just unveiled watchOS 26, the latest version of its wrist-sized OS, and it’s bringing big changes this fall, including a new Workout Buddy and Liquid Glass design. You’ll need an Apple Watch Series 6 or later to install it, so if you have something older, today’s a great day to upgrade. Amazon is selling the 42mm Apple Watch Series 10 for $299, a savings of $100, matching the best price we’ve seen. The Series 10 is Apple’s latest watch, with a beautiful, thinner design, gorgeous edge-to-edge screen, and an array of health features and sensors, including ECG, temperature, and heart rate. It’s also. Got IP6X dust resistance and water resistance so good that you can even wear it when diving. And the battery life will get you through a complete day and a full night’s sleep with just a short charge before bed. In our 4.5-star review, we praised the performance and called it “the best smartwatch around.” And watchOS 26 will only make it better. So go grab one now before the price jumps back up.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
