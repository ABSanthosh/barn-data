    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2733800/iphone-features-not-using-namedrop-back-tap-flashlight-timer-measure-song-recognition.html",
    "description": "Macworld These days, iPhones can do a lot – and we mean a lot. From photography and video editing to gaming and artificial intelligence, it’s enough to make you forget they can also, you know, make phone calls and send text messages. With all these headline features, it’s not surprising that a bunch of clever capabilities slip through the cracks. Whether you’re an Apple veteran or an iOS newbie, we bet there are scores of interesting iPhone features that you never knew existed. Here, we’ve rounded up some of the best iPhone settings you’re probably not using. NameDrop: Easily share contacts NameDrop, which lets you touch two iPhones together to exchange contacts, is a great example of Apple’s seamless and intelligent integration between hardware and software, and it’s something that few other phone makers could pull off. Just bring the top ends of two iPhones running iOS 17 or later close to each other and hold them there until you see a bubble-like animation show on their displays. Once that happens, NameDrop will be shared between the two users like magic, and you can then choose the fields you want to share before exchanging your details or tap Receive Only to get their info without sending your own. And here’s a bonus: The feature also works when sending Apple Cash to another iPhone user. Back Tap: Add a button to the back of your iPhone Some iPhone features feel so natural that you wonder why you didn’t know about them before, and Back Tap certainly qualifies. With a quick double or triple tap on the back of your phone, you can open your camera app, turn on the flashlight, switch apps, and more. To get started, open the Settings app on your iPhone and head to Accessibility \u003e Touch \u003e Back Tap. Select either Double Tap or Triple Tap, then pick an option from the extensive list. You can run system functions, activate accessibility controls, and even launch a shortcut, which is a clever way to kickstart a powerful workflow with minimal effort. Foundry Visual Look Up: Use the camera to learn about nature How many times have you seen an animal or plant and found yourself scratching your head over what it was? With your iPhone, there’s no need to be left wondering what you saw – just use Visual Look Up. Simply snap a photo of the animal or plant in question, open the image in the Photos app, then swipe up. You’ll see an option to Look Up Plant or Look Up Animal, which will show likely matches and similar images. If you have an iPhone with Camera Control, you can use the visual intelligence feature to tap into Apple Intelligence or ChatGPT to get similar assistance. Tap and hold the Camera Control for a couple of seconds until a new camera window bursts onto your screen. Point your camera at the object in question, and an animal or plant name will appear at the top. (If it says “Maybe,” tap the name to see a few options of what it could be. If ChatGPT is more certain, it will show the name of what it thinks it is, and you can tap it to get some information.) Foundry Song Recognition: Identify music that you hear Shazam is a fantastic way to discover a new song or identify those earworm songs that you can’t quite remember the names of—but with your iPhone, you don’t need to open the Shazam app itself every time. You can put a handy Shazam button right into the Control Center for quick access instead. Open the Control Center by swiping down from your iPhone’s top-right corner. From here, tap the + in the top-left corner, tap Add a Control, type “recognize music” in the search bar, and then tap the result. The next time you hear a song you can’t identify, open the Control Center and tap the Shazam button, and it’ll identify the song within seconds. Foundry Timer Control: Start a countdown in no time There’s another handy hidden feature that can be found in the Control Center that lets you swiftly set up a timer without hunting for the Clock app. You probably know that you can jump to the Timer section in the Clock app by tapping the dedicated Control Center button, but you might not know there’s an even shorter shortcut. Tap and hold the Timer button in the Control Center, and a slider will appear on your screen. Move your finger up or down the slider to increase or decrease the duration in one-minute increments and tap Start to begin. Flashlight: Adjust the width of your beam Everyone knows that your iPhone can provide a helpful flashlight to guide you through the darkness. But did you know that you can adjust the width and distance of its beam in just a few taps? To do so, tap to turn on your phone’s flashlight (or ask Siri), and the icon will appear in the Dynamic Island. It’s not just a reminder that it’s on—tap it and you’ll be able to adjust the light beam by moving left (to make the beam narrower and more intense) or right (to make it wider and more diffuse). You can also move your finger up and down to increase or decrease the light’s strength as usual. Foundry Measure: Use the iPhone’s hidden virtual ruler Most of us don’t carry tape measures around with us, but there are times when we need one. Not to worry – your iPhone actually has a hidden Measure app that can help. To find it, tap the Search box on your iPhone’s Home screen and type “Measure” to find the Measure app. Open it, and it’ll activate the rear camera with two options: Measure and Level. To measure something, aim your phone at one edge of the object you want to measure, tap the plus (+) symbol, then move your camera to the other edge and tap the plus symbol again. The length of the object will appear on your screen. You can calculate multiple lengths by tapping + again after you’ve taken the first measurement. On iPhone 12 Pro or later with a Lidar sensor, you can move your phone near the subject and the line will transform into a ruler that displays incremental units of length. Pro phones can also gauge the height of a person who appears in the Measure app’s viewfinder. Foundry Widgets: Get quick info on the Lock screen Widgets aren’t just for the Home screen—you can add a few to your Lock screen as well to view data at a glance. To add widgets to your Lock Screen, tap and hold the screen until the Customize button appears. Tap it, then tap Lock Screen. Underneath the time, you’ll see an empty rectangle with a box labeled Add Widgets underneath it. Just tap any widgets from the list and they’ll be added to this box.  Foundry App Tracking: Stop apps from following your activity When you open an app for the first time, you might see a pop-up window asking if you want to let the app track you across other apps and websites. If you find yourself getting tired of repeatedly tapping “Ask App Not to Track,” there’s a simple fix that will reject tracking attempts once and for all. Open the Settings app and navigate to Privacy \u0026 Security \u003e Tracking, then disable the toggle next to Allow Apps to Request to Track. When you do this, you won’t get any more prompts about being tracked—disabling this toggle tells iOS to automatically reject all app tracking attempts on your behalf, so you can protect your privacy without all the annoying pop-ups. Default apps: Open links in the apps you want For years, Apple devices have been heavily locked down, and that’s even extended to controlling your default apps for email, web browsing, and more. That’s no longer the case, though, so if you want to switch up your default apps, it’s now easier than ever. To start customizing your app choices, open the Settings app and go to Apps \u003e Default Apps. You’ll see several options, from email and messaging to web browsing and translation. Just tap one, then pick an app from the resulting list. Your options will be limited to apps installed on your iPhone, so make sure you’ve downloaded your apps of choice before getting started. Foundry Text replacement: Give your thumbs a break Tired of typing all the time? Use text replacement. This automatically fills out words and phrases when you enter a shortcut. For instance, you could create a text replacement shortcut that enters your email address whenever you type @@ or to automatically capitalize BBQ when you type bbq.. This feature can be enabled in Settings \u003e General \u003e Keyboard \u003e Text Replacement. There, tap + to add a new entry. The Shortcut box contains the condensed word or phrase you want to use, while the Phrase box is for the full version that will be inserted by your phone. Alternatively, if there’s a word or phrase that you don’t want to be corrected, create a new text replacement entry and type it into the same field, but keep the Shortcut box empty.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
