    "description": "Macworld When Tim Cook posted on Monday that “there’s something in the Air” this week, we expected a new iPad Air (which happened), maybe an 11th-gen iPad (which also happened), and a new MacBook Air (coming Wednesday). But surprisingly, we’re hearing that Apple is tossing in a one-more-thing-like announcement into the week in the form of a new Mac Studio. X/Mark Gurman According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to update the high-end desktop for the first time in nearly two years. But he also includes a headscratcher: it won’t include an M4 Ultra. Rather, Apple may introduce the M3 Ultra, which most people had thought was as good as dead. Apple has used M-series Max and Ultra chips in the Studio and Mac Pro but of the same chip generation. Gurman reports that Apple is going to use an M4 Max and an M3 Ultra, rather than M4 versions of both chips. It seems like an odd thing to do, as the M3 Ultra will be faster than an M4 Max, but the gains won’t be as dramatic as they should be. Why wouldn’t Apple just go with an M4 Ultra? Perhaps there are manufacturing issues. Or perhaps Apple wants to create a distinction between the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro, which is rumored to get the M4 Ultra. We should find out more tomorrow, but for now, you can read all about the rumors of the M4 Mac Studio and the M4 Ultra Mac Pro while we try to figure this one out.",

    "description": "Macworld The M2 Max and Ultra Mac Studio were released at more than a year ago at WWDC23, and the M4 era of Apple’s System on a Chip has already started. So it’s time to start looking forward to the next Mac Studio. But just how long will we have to wait for the new Mac Studio? We’ll keep track of what’s being said in this article.  Update March 4, 2025: A new Mac Studio could be released within the week. M4 Mac Studio: Release date We’ve had two generations of Mac Studio. The first gen (M1 Max and Ultra) was released in March of 2022. The second-gen (M2 Max and Ultra) was revealed at WWDC23 in June 2023. Apple will probably continue with a March or June timeframe for the next Mac Studio, with WWDC25 the likely venue. The next Max and Ultra Mac Studio could be released in 2025.Roman Loyola/IDG In April 2024, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said in the paid version of his Power On newsletter that the next Mac Studio could launch in the second half of 2024, which at the time pointed to a June 2024 release at WWDC. However, the promise of an imminent update didn’t last long. In May, Gurman reported that the Mac Studio was not on the schedule of Apple releases for 2024. He claimed it won’t appear until mid-2025. Gurman reiterated this in June 2024 when he reported that the Mac released schedule had not changed and the M4 Mac Studio is not expected until the second half of 2025. Gurman repeated this claim that the new Mac Studio will ship in 2025 again in August 2024. In October, Gurman reported that the new Mac Studio had originally had a similar release schedule as the M4 MacBook Air, with a release planned between January and March of 2025. But Apple has decided to push the Mac Studio back to a release between March and June. On March 4, 2025, Gurman posted that a new Mac Studio is “imminent.” X/Mark Gurman M4 Mac Studio: Price No reports on the price for the next-gen Mac Studio have been made. Here are the standard configuration prices of the current M2 Mac Studio lineup, for reference. $1,999/£2,099: M2 Max with a 12-core CPU, 30-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, 32GB unified memory, 512GB SSD $3,999/ £4,199: M2 Ultra with a 24-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 64GB unified memory, 1TB SSD The price is unlikely to change in the U.S., but we anticipate that the new Mac Studio will be less than it is currently in the U.K. The original Mac Studio was £1,999 in the U.K. when it launched, Apple then pushed up the price to £2,099 with the arrival of the M2-powered model. Since then fluctuations in economies around the world likely mean that the U.K. price will return to £1,999, as this is how Apple has aligned other prices. M4 Mac Studio: Design The Mac mini had a redesign when Apple introduced the M4 and M4 Pro versions, but no reports about design changes to the Mac Studio have been made. The current design works well so Apple likely won’t change it. The only possible exception is a new space black color option to match the MacBook Pro. M4 Mac Studio: Specs and features The main (and likely only) change that will happen with the upcoming Mac Studio is with its SoC. The Mac Studio should continue to have the Max and Ultra versions of its M-series chips, so the new chips we will see are likely to be the M4 Max and M4 Ultra. We already know what to expect from the M4 Max as it has launched in the MacBook Pro. The ports on the Mac Studio will likely remain unchanged.Roman Loyola/IDG Apple’s Ultra chips are likely to combine two M4 Max chips to offer double the CPU and GPU cores. The M4 chip is already very impressive, in fact, in our Geekbench tests the M4 Max beat the M2 Ultra. Read: How Apple’s M4 chips dispelled all my fears about buying a new Mac. When the M4 Ultra launches you can expect something exceedingly fast and powerful. Apple could have even more up its sleeves. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has stated that Apple is working on AI-enhanced M4 chips that could find their way into the Mac Studio in 2025. On March 4, 2025, Gurman posted that the new Mac Studio could use an M4 Max and an M3 Ultra, not an M4 Ultra. It seems like an odd thing to do, though the M3 Ultra will be faster than an M4 Max, but the difference will be smaller than if it were an M4 Ultra. Why wouldn’t Apple just go with an M4 Ultra? Perhaps there are manufacturing issues. Or perhaps Apple wants to create separation between the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro, which is rumored to have the M4 Ultra. Read all about the rumors of the M4 Mac Studio and the M4 Ultra Mac Pro. Another major upgrade to expect is Thunderbolt 5 implementation, an upgrade from Thunderbolt 4 in the current Mac Studio. With the M4 Pro/Max MacBook Pro, Apple implemented Thunderbolt 5, so it will happen with the new Mac Studio. Learn more about Thunderbolt 5. The other features of the Mac Studio should remain the same. That means no changes to the ports, connectivity, speaker, SSD sizes, or display support.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",
