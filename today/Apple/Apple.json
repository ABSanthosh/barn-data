    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "title": "Best iPhone for seniors",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/334307/the-best-iphone-for-seniors.html",
    "description": "Macworld The old trope that old people are hopelessly illiterate when it comes to technology is somewhat unwarranted. The home computer revolution is decades old at this point, and smartphones have been around for over 16 years. Seniors may not operate their smartphones as adroitly as their grandkids, but they aren’t just sitting around pining for the days of rotary dial phones. Seniors need iPhones, too, but they may have unique needs. They’re often on fixed incomes and may have difficulty reading small text, suffer from arthritis, or have other accessibility needs. The best iPhone for seniors is one that won’t cost an arm and a leg and will continue to be updated for at least a few years. Beyond that, we’re going to make two recommendations: a small iPhone for seniors who find large phones difficult to carry and manipulate, and a large iPhone for those who need larger text and images. Right now buying an iPhone for an older person is a little less simple than usual. We previously recommended the iPhone SE because it has a Home button, which simplifies the iPhone interface for the less tech-minded and is cheaper. However, Apple discontinued the iPhone SE in February 2025 and no longer offers iPhones with Touch ID and a Home button. If that’s what you want, check third-party retailers and see if they have any in stock. Also note that Apple Intelligence features are only supported by Apple’s newest phones, the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max, and 16e. Apple sells the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus for $699 and $799, respectively, but they don’t support Apple Intelligence, so if you want those features, you need to get an iPhone 16. 1. Apple iPhone 16: Best for seniors Pros Excellent battery life Great processing and graphics performance Camera Control is a boon for users who frequently shoot photos Cons No always-on display May not be small enough for those who prefer small phones Price When Reviewed: $799 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $829 View Deal $829.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 128GB – Black – Unlocked – eSIM $717 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – Ultramarine – Unlocked – eSIM $749 View Deal iPhone 16 128GB – Pink – Unlocked – eSIM $750 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket $829 at Apple$829.99 at Best Buy We recommend the iPhone 16 as the top choice here primarily because it represents the best value for money right now. At $799/£799., it offers a dual camera system with a Camera Control button. It can also shoot 4K video at 60 fps. The iPhone 16 also offers Emergency SOS via satellite, Crash Detection, Roadside Assistance via satellite, and Messages via satellite. That A18 processor is more than fast enough for email, checking social media apps, taking pictures, making FaceTime calls, and everything else a senior wants an iPhone for. And it’ll still get several years of iOS software updates. Face ID might take a little getting used to if the user is used to Touch ID and the Home button, but could prove to be an easier way to secure an iPhone for those with arthritis. Read our full Apple iPhone 16 review 2. Apple iPhone 16e: New $599 option Pros Small size Support for Apple Intelligence Long battery life Cons No MagSafe support Old set of Photographic Styles Price When Reviewed: From $599 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $599 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $599 at Apple The iPhone 16e is Apple’s newest affordable option that replaces both the iPhone 14 and iPhone SE. Starting at $599/£599, you get an iPhone with the same A18 processor but with fewer GPU cores (4 vs 5). It has a single 48MP camera, but as we’ve seen on other iPhones it’s quite good with features like Deep Fusion for better low-light photography. Apple calls it a “2-in-1” camera since its high-resolution photos allow it to zoom at 2X without any noticeable degradation. Apple no longer offers a Home button and Touch ID. The iPhone 16e uses Face ID, and you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to get to the Home screen. Some seniors will find Touch ID easier to deal with than Face ID (especially if their previous smartphone was an older iPhone). The iPhone 16e is not as small as the iPhone SE it replaced, but it is among Apple’s smallest phones in the current lineup. Despite its size, battery life is rated by Apple to last 26 hours, which is the longest ever for a 6.1-inch iPhone. The iPhone 16e supports 5G and comes in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB capacities. If you decide on the 128GB model, you can opt for an iCloud subscription plan if you find yourself needing additional storage. We’ll update this with our full review but if you can’t wait, the iPhone 16e should be a solid option for users looking to spend a little less. Learn more about the iPhone 16e. 3. Apple iPhone 16 Plus: Big-screen iPhone Pros Large 6.7-inch screen Lightest large-screened iPhone Cons Bulky and heavier than smaller iPhones Price When Reviewed: $899 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $924.97 View Deal $929 View Deal $929.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – White – Unlocked – eSIM $799 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Black – Unlocked – eSIM $840.43 View Deal iPhone 16 Plus 128GB – Teal – Unlocked – eSIM $888 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket $924.97 at Amazon$929 at Apple$929.99 at Best Buy The large display of one of the Plus-sized iPhones will be much easier for old eyes to see clearly. Excluding the iPhone 16 Pro Max, there are two choices with a 6.7-inch screen here: the iPhone 16 Plus, and iPhone 15 Plus. Again, you can save $100/£100 by buying the iPhone 15 Plus (at $799/£799) instead of the newer iPhone 16 Plus (at $899/£899). This time we recommend spending the extra money if there is a budget available because the iPhone 16 generation is a leap ahead of the iPhone 15 in terms of processor and camera. Another reason to choose the iPhone 16 Plus: it supports Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 15 Plus does not. The Apple Intelligence features may not appeal to you now, but they turn out to be useful in the future. If you want Apple Intelligence and a larger iPhone then the best option is the iPhone 16 Plus.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2605277/ios-18-4-beta-begins-with-huge-apple-intelligence-expansion-but-no-new-siri.html",
    "description": "Macworld iOS 18.4 is destined to be a big release. The headline feature of iOS 18 is Apple Intelligence, and the various AI features have been rolling out piece by piece. After getting no major new AI features in iOS 18.3, Apple is bringing Apple Intelligence to many more countries in iOS 18.4 as well as a new device—Vision Pro. However, the anticipated Siri update has to wait. There are several big Siri updates coming, including personal context, app intents, and screen reading, but they’re missing from the first iOS 18.4 beta. Instead, Apple says Apple Intelligence “will receive additional features in the coming months, including expanded capabilities for Siri.” That likely means the whole update has been pushed to iOS 18.5. The iOS 18.4 beta began on February 21 and we expect the final release in early April. What’s new in iOS 18.4 We’ll update this section with the features and changes found in the latest iOS 18.4 beta, as they are found. Apple Intelligence languages: Including Simplified Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish—along with localized English for Singapore and India. Apple Intelligence regions: With iOS 18.4, iPhone and iPad users in the EU will gain access to Apple Intelligence features for the first time. Prioritize Notifications: Apple Intelligence will attempt to show notifications that may be important in a separate section on the lock screen. Go to Settings \u003e Notifications \u003e Prioritize Notifications to enable. Food in News+: A new section in Apple News+ for curated recipes, restaurant reviews, and curated stories about food and dining. Ambient Music: You can add four different ambient music categories to Control Center: Sleep, Chill, Productivity, and Wellbeing. Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro: Apple is bringing Apple Intelligence to the Vision Pro for English-speaking users in the U.S. with the visionOS 2.4 update. Apple Vision Pro app: iOS 18.4 brings a new iPhone app that offers users a new way to download Vision Pro apps and games from the App Store on your iPhone, as well as browse Apple TV content and access your library of spatial photos and videos. It only shows up if you have a Vision Pro associated with the same Apple ID. Mail categories in iPadOS: With the iPadOS 18.4 release, the iPad version of the Mail app finally gets the categories that have been on the iPhone since iOS 18.2. Default translation app: In the Default Apps section of Settings, there is now an option to set a default translation app. iOS 18.4: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 18.4, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. iOS 18.4: How to install the public beta If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.4, you can sign up for the public beta test, which should arrive in late February. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now: Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 18 superguide.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
