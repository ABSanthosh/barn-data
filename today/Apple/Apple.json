That's the deadline for both parties to file arguments about the case, and the courts will then decide if a longer stay is in order during appeal.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2797073/will-apple-announce-any-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2025.html",
    "description": "Macworld Every year, as Apple’s WWDC approaches, speculation about what new products may arrive alongside all the big software announcements. While sources claim that Apple has been working on a new interface for iOS, macOS, and other operating systems, we haven’t heard much about new hardware coming at WWDC. There are rumors about products in the works—most notably new Macs and the “HomePad” smart home hub—but the reality is, if you’re expecting to see new hardware at WWDC 2025, you’re likely to be disappointed. WWDC is a software event Historically, WWDC is an event focused almost entirely on software. After all, it’s a conference for developers. Every year, Apple not only reveals its plans for the future of its operating systems at the event, but also gives developers early access to new APIs and frameworks. This enables them to start optimizing their apps for the new platforms months ahead of public releases. While there have been occasional hardware announcements, such as the original HomePod, the transition to Apple silicon in 2020, and the first look at the Apple Vision Pro in 2023, those moments were tightly linked to developer needs. This year, rumors suggest that Apple has been working on new hardware products that could be a good fit for WWDC, but it doesn’t look like they’ll be ready in time for this year’s event. Here’s why. HomePad: Delayed In an effort to take HomeKit to the next level, Apple has been working on a smart home hub with a built-in screen for several years. The idea is to let users easily control their HomeKit accessories, such as lamps, heaters, and robot vacuum cleaners, even when their phone isn’t around. While the actual name of the device is unclear, reports claim it will combine aspects of the HomePod and iPad in a single product focused on the smart home, so it’s been dubbed HomePad. Apple is reportedly making a new smart home hub that combines an iPad with a HomePod, but it’s likely not shipping for a while.Foundry Along with the smart home capabilities, HomePad will reportedly also function as an Apple TV-like entertainment device so users can stream video and music, or make FaceTime calls from its built-in camera. Essentially, it will be a home companion device that is either mounted to a wall or sits in a dock. While the HomePad was once expected to launch in the spring, recent reports claim the project is delayed, possibly until 2026. The main reason is due to a deep integration with Apple Intelligence and the new Siri experience, which have been beset with issues. It’s possible that Apple gives a sneak peek of HomePad at WWDC, as it did with HomePod and Vision Pro, but most reports say Apple is focused on fixing Siri first. M5 Macs and iPads: Not yet WWDC has been a hot spot for new Macs in recent years, with Apple Silicon, the redesigned M2 MacBook Air, and the M2 Ultra chip all making their debuts at WWDC. As such, there has been speculation about whether Apple will announce any new Mac hardware at WWDC. With the exception of the Mac Pro, which hasn’t seen any updates since 2022, Apple has already completed the transition of the entire Mac lineup to the M4 chip, introduced last year with the iPad Pro. In theory, this could mean that Apple will move onto the next generation of chips at WWDC, but don’t count on it. Apple typically unveils the first new Macs with the next generation of chips in the fall, around October and November. And according to multiple sources in the industry, this will be the case once again this year. A new iPad Pro with the M5 chip and M5 MacBook Pro are said to be on track for the second half of 2025. It’s possible that Apple unveils a new high-end chip for the aging Mac Pro, but most reports claim that Apple will keep the current model around until the M5 Ultra arrives. Could the M5 debut at WWDC? It’s not likely.Foundry iPhone 17: Coming in September Although in the past Apple has introduced new iPhone models at WWDC, it’s been more than a decade since an iPhone model debuted at the event. Besides, the iPhone 16e only just arrived in March, and the iPhone 17 lineup will arrive in September. One of the main reasons is that the new iPhone always ships with the new version of iOS announced at WWDC, so Apple needs time to test and refine the new software before launching the new phone. So if you’re planning to buy an iPhone 17, you’ll have to wait until September at least. Apple Vision Pro 2: Maybe next year The first Apple Vision Pro is decidedly a developer device. It was announced at WWDC 2023 but didn’t ship until 2024, mainly so developers had time to build new apps for the headset. And with a $3,499 price tag, it’s still basically a developer kit.  The current Vision Pro is powered by the M2 chip, which some consumers may consider outdated for a product that costs $3,500. Although Apple is rumored to be working on an updated Vision Pro with an M5 chip inside, this model is unlikely to arrive before next year. According to a report from The Information, Apple has reportedly set aside the Vision Pro 2 project to work on a more affordable version of its mixed reality headset, but that model isn’t expected to ship for a while either. So while we’ll get a look at the new visionOS software, the same hardware is likely sticking around for at least another year. WWDC will likely be very software-centric this year.Foundry What to expect instead at WWDC 2025? Once again, this WWDC will be all about software and services, so expect major updates across all Apple platforms. From iOS 19 to macOS 16 (or possibly iOS 26 and macOS 26), Apple’s operating systems will be updated with a new, more modern interface. Sources believe that the new design language will be similar to what Apple introduced with visionOS, which has more depth and shadows rather than a completely flat interface. Apple is also rumored to be working on new features to make iPadOS more similar to macOS, as well as further improving Apple Intelligence and the Siri experience. So there will be plenty to get excited about at WWDC 2025, but it almost certainly won’t involve any new devices. WWDC 2025 kicks off on June 9 with an opening keynote.

    "description": "Macworld A new report shows Android phones outfitted with Qualcomm cellular modems outperforming the iPhone 16e with its own Apple C1 modem. Unfortunately, the limited nature of the tests, combined with the fact that it was commissioned by Qualcomm, means we can’t learn much from it. The tests were performed by Cellular Insights, and you can read the summary here or the full report here. The general summary of the results is that the Android devices had download speeds around 35 percent faster than the iPhone 16e, and upload speeds between 81 percent and 91 percent faster. That the report was paid for by Qualcomm, of course, makes it suspect, but there are other limitations worth noting. First, the report doesn’t let us know which Android phones were tested. It says one is “a 2025 flagship device powered by Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System priced at $799” and the other is “a 2024 flagship device powered by Snapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF System priced at $619.” That narrows it down somewhat, but it’s odd that the iPhone 16e is named (the only device with an Apple C1 modem after all) and the Android devices are kept somewhat secret. Second, the testing all took place in only three locations in a single small geographical area—the Astoria neighborhood in Queens, New York City. Even our own testing, which we noted was quite limited, managed to test five locations around the greater Sacramento area. Finally, the study exclusively used T-Mobile’s commercial SA 5G network. As with our own testing, which took place only on the Verizon network, looking at a single carrier (especially only in one neighborhood) captures only a very limited experience. A more extensive set of tests comes from Ookla, whose report back in March used data from many users across the country testing with its popular Speedtest app. That report captured the experience on all three major carriers, and interestingly, the gap between the iPhone 16 (using a Qualcomm modem) and the iPhone 16e (with the Apple C1) was widest on, you guessed it, T-Mobile’s network. So this test looks slightly suspect. Not only is it paid for by Qualcomm, but it pits the $599 iPhone 16e against unnamed Android phones, in just three locations of a single neighborhood, on the carrier in which Qualcomm’s modems just happen to outperform Apple’s by the widest margin. And it only tests upload and download speeds, not other aspects such as stability when moving within and between cell areas, latency, or power utilization. None of this means the report is false, but it gives the appearance of cherry-picking tests to get the results you want. Ultimately, there’s nothing of note here. The C1 modem was never meant to outperform Qualcomm’s best modems, only to provide a comparable experience to mid-tier products with good stability and lower power utilization. Apple’s future modems (C2 and C3, presumably) are expected to increase performance with each generation, ultimately with the aim of beating Qualcomm’s best offerings in 2026 or 2027.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
