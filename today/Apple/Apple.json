    "description": "The British Broadcasting Corporation has complained to a UK antitrust authority that Apple and Google's news services, such as Apple News, diminish its branding by downplaying where it gets its new stories.Apple has now disabled news summaries after damaging inaccuracies were reported.The new accusations come in the midst of an ongoing investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over the two tech giants' dominance in web browser engines and smartphone operating systems. The new complaint from the BBC suggests that aggregate news services minimize credit for the providers of the news those programs feature.Because the BBC gets its budget from a unique \"licence fee\" model, it depends on worldwide brand recognition and respect for its efforts to justify its funding. Its income derives in large part from a fee paid by everyone in the UK who has a TV or radio. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2658685/forget-ios-18-4-your-older-iphones-and-macs-need-an-update-this-weekend-too.html",
    "description": "Macworld If you have a new iPhone or Mac, there are plenty of reasons to go update to iOS 18.4 or macOS 15.4, but users of older devices might not be so quick to hit the download button. But these updates are especially important—Apple has patched a pair of vulnerabilities originally fixed in iOS 18.3.1 and 18.3.2 and five dozen fixes for newer phones and Macs. In iOS 16.7.11 (compatible with iPhones 6-13) and iOS 15.8.4 (compatible with iPhones 8-14), Apple issued a pair of security updates to fix zero-days previously exploited in the wild. Apple previously addressed the flaws in iOS 18.3.1 (Accessibility) and 18.3.2 (WebKit) for newer iPhones, but they remained exploitable in older phones until this week. Apple also patched an actively exploited CoreMedia flaw in older iPads and Macs that was first fixed in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. Apple says the vulnerabilities were used in “extremely sophisticated” attacks, meaning hackers targeted high-level individuals in government or business. However, as long as the flaw remains open on your devices, there is still a risk that it could be exploited with lower-level malware, so we recommend updating as soon as possible. See our tests of the best Mac antivirus programs for more security options. Apple also issued a few dozen security fixes for newer iPhones and Macs with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4, as well as updates to iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Vision Pro so no matter what Apple device you own, go update this weekend before it’s too late.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac.html",
    "description": "Macworld USB-C is the latest standard of USB that allows data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, can fast-charge devices, and conveniently fits in a port either way up—which means that you can wave bye-bye to the age-old USB guessing game of “Which way does it go in?”. While some of the newer hubs reviewed here do boast 10Gbps legacy USB-A ports, USB-A is mostly seen in devices at 5Gbps, offers slower charging speeds, and is annoyingly fussy at which way up it is when you try to connect it to a port. USB-C is no one-trick pony, either—handling data transfer, video output and power input.  You’ll find faster variants of USB-C (called Thunderbolt 3, 4 or 5) on the MacBook Pro (post-2016 models), MacBook Air (post-2018), the iMac (after 2017) and Mac mini (2018 and later). Thunderbolt Macs can connect to USB-C hubs and docks, but will lose some of their extra bandwidth—Thunderbolt 3and 4’s 40Gbps significantly outpaces USB-C’s 5-10Gbps. USB4, like Thunderbolt, boasts 40Gbps bandwidth, although note that there is also a 20Gbps version to look out for. Thunderbolt 5 has a theoretical maxmimum of a =n amazing 120Gbps, although 80Gbps is the more likely data-transfer option. From an Apple user perspective, Thunderbolt 3 and 4 are very similar. Both have 40Gbps bandwidth but TB4 has a few extra benefits; find out more in our Thunderbolt 4 vs Thunderbolt 3 comparison. Thunderbolt 5 is similar but much faster if your devices can keep up with it. If you need super-fast data transfer, read our roundup of the best Thunderbolt 4 hubs. We have included a couple in this roundup as they increasingly offer better value as prices come down. Few people have a full range of USB-C or Thunderbolt gear, so you’ll likely need a USB-C hub to add different ports—such as old-school USB-A—to your Mac. In general, an “adapter” works with a single port (such as USB-A or Ethernet) while a “hub” gives you multiple ports. If you require even more, then look for a “dock” or “docking station”. If you’re after a full desktop setup for your MacBook, look out for our recommendations for the best USB-C and Thunderbolt docking stations for MacBooks. Here we have tested and reviewed the premium USB-C hubs and adapters. There are many much cheaper versions out there, but we recommend these for quality and robustness. Which extra ports do you need Many MacBook users connect their laptop to one or more external displays for greater screen space. You can connect to monitors via a USB-C (via adapters to non-USB-C monitors) or better a dedicated video port, such as HDMI or DisplayPort. Check the hub specs to see which displays they support: some are limited to HD displays, others support 4K (also known as UHD) displays. The refresh rate is also important. 4K at 30Hz is fine for most productivity and browsing tasks, but watching video or playing games demands higher refresh rates of at least 60Hz. You may need some old non-reversible USB-A ports, and most adapters and hubs have at least one for your non-USB-C memory sticks and drives. Look for at least USB 3.0, which has a speedy bandwidth of 5Gbps compared to the lamentably sluggish USB 2.0’s 480Mbps. To fast-charge an iPhone, you need a minimum of 18W and it has to be USB-C, so look for extra USB-C slots with charging power, which are more capable than USB-A. Other ports to look for in a hub include Ethernet for faster wired Internet access (without the flakiness of Wi-Fi). You can choose from standard Gigabit Ethernet (1000Mbps) or 2.5Gb and even 5Gb Ethernet (2500Mbps), although the faster Ethernet requires the whole network to support that speed. An SD or microSD card reader is perfect for adding inexpensive portable storage to your system. Card readers come at different speeds: UHS-I at 104MBps, and UHS-II at 312MBps; although some are slower at 60MBps. Look for hubs that offer passthrough charging, so you can charge your laptop even though you are using up one of the laptop’s USB-C ports for the hub itself. Most don’t ship with a charger, so you’ll need to add your own, and remember that it needs to be a 100W charger to give 85W and above charging if offered by the hub. Lower wattage chargers are fine but will limit the hub’s charging potential. Couple your hub with one of the best Mac USB-C chargers. Check the Power Delivery (PD) charging power each hub or adapter offers connected laptops or iPads. 12in MacBook and MacBook Air charge at 30W; the 13in and 14in MacBook Pro at 67W, the 15in MacBook Pro at 87W; and the 16in MacBook Pro at 96W. You can certainly use a charger at lower power, but remember that it will power up slower than when using a higher-wattage charger, and if too low your laptop might run out of juice altogether when maxed out on power-hungry apps and devices. You can also buy USB-C adapters for the many older display standards out there, such as VGA and DVI. We’ve picked the best for you below. Many hubs and docks aren’t compatible with Apple’s SuperDrive CD/DVD drive. We’ve found only one USB-C dock that is compatible with the SuperDrive, the Caldigit USB-C Pro Dock. Plugable 9-in-1 USB-C Hub Multiport Adapter – Best overall USB-C hub Pros 9 ports inc Ethernet, 60Hz 4K display via HDMI 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A 125W PD Price When Reviewed: $49.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $49.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $49.95 at Amazon 9 Ports: 2x USB-C, 3x USB-A, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, SD Card Reader, MicroSD Card Reader, 125W laptop charging This 9-in-1 hub is bristling with top-end ports and with an unrivalled 125W to laptop passthrough power is a great match for larger laptops. A seven-inch cable connects the hub to your MacBook at 10Gbps and a possible 125W passthrough charging when the hub is connected to a USB-C charger—the highest passthrough charging we’ve seen in a USB-C hub. Total power output from the hub to laptop and devices is 140W. There’s one dedicated 10Gbps USB-C data port, HDMI 2.0 port with 4K 60Hz support, and both SD and MicroSD card readers at fast UHS-II media-transfer speeds. If you need to attach legacy devices there are two USB-A ports, also at 10Gbps. One of these can drive 7.5W of power to the connected device. There’s also a much slower 480Mbps USB 2.0 port that good for a memory stick or mouse/keyboard. With its extra USB-A port and faster SD card readers, the 9-in-1 Plugable USB-C Hub beats our long-time USB-C hub champ, the Anker 555 8-in-1 USB-C Hub, reviewed below. If you prefer DisplayPort to HDMI the Anker 565 should be considered even with its slower card readers. Anker 555 8-in-1 USB-C Hub – Great value USB-C hub Pros 8 ports inc Ethernet, 60Hz 4K display via HDMI 10Gbps USB-C and USB-A 85W PD Cons Can get warm during use UHS-I SD reader Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $49.99 View Deal Anker $49.99 View Deal $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $49.99 at Amazon$49.99 at Anker$49.99 at Walmart 8 Ports: 2x USB-C, 2x USB-A, HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet, SD Card Reader, MicroSD Card Reader, 85W laptop charging The Anker 555 USB-C 8-in-1 Hub is compact and powerful, offering greater specs than some of the other leading options on this list. It’s one of two similar USB-C hubs from the company, and we start with the best-value option. The 555 offers two USB-C ports—one that supports 85W USB-C Power Delivery, while another supports data transfers up to 10Gbps. You also get speedy 10Gbps transfer rates through two additional USB-A ports, where many rivals max out at 5Gbps.  The Anker 555 is special as it offers an HDMI port that supports 4K 60Hz resolutions, where most are limited to 4K 30Hz. For 4K 60Hz resolution, your device must support DP 1.4. This includes MacBook Air (from 2020), MacBook Pro 15in (from 2018), MacBook Pro 16in (from 2019) and iPad Pro (from 2018). Also included are SD and MicroSD card reader slots. These are rated at UHS-I (104MBps) so not the fastest. If you transfer a lot of data via SD cards, look for a hub with faster UHS-II (312MBps). The Gigabit Ethernet port is great for those times when Wi-Fi just won’t do. It’s also incredibly light at just under 4.5oz (130g) and compact so you can take it anywhere. At $49.99 / £79.99 it’s hard to deny this hub’s value for money. In our experience, it does get warm with use but Anker says this is normal. Anker The higher-end $65.99 / £89.99 Anker 565 USB-C Hub, shown above, offers eleven ports instead of the 555’s mere eight, and is equally lightweight at 4.8oz (136g). The extra ports are one USB-A and an audio jack, which isn’t a remarkable boost—but it does include a top-end DisplayPort 1.4 video connection in case HDMI is not for you. If the inclusion of a native DisplayPort is important to you, then the 565 is a better solution (read our full Anker 565 11-in-1 USB-C Hub review) than maybe even the Plugable 9-in-1 reviewed above.

The Ugreen USB-C 4-port hub is a slim and inexpensive adapter that allows you to add four full-size USB 3.0 ports that can handle data transfer at up to 5Gbps. It has recently been upgraded to feature a further USB-C port that can supply a 10W charge for connected devices, but not the host computer. While all four ports can be used simultaneously, a maximum of two hard drives can be connected at one time. It looks the part with most modern MacBooks, and is an easy way to connect memory sticks, a printer or other older devices that don’t come with USB-C.

The Satechi Pro Hub Max, available in either Silver or Space Gray, features USB4 ports that are both compatible with Thunderbolt and can reach the same 40Gbps maximum throughput. Connecting directly to two of the MacBook’s Thunderbolt ports, it boasts a bunch of ports that should be enough for most of us. The hub receives 40Gbps from each of the Thunderbolt ports on the Mac (so a total of 80Gbps). 40Gbps is used for the USB4 pass-through port, while the second Thunderbolt port distributes 40Gbps of bandwidth to the rest of the ports on the hub. The USB4 port supports up to 96W charging—easily fine for a 14-inch MacBook Pro and punchy enough to keep a 16-inch Pro going and charged pretty quickly. This same USB4 port can be used to connect to an external display—up to 6K at 60Hz display output, transferring data at 40Gbps. It should allow video output and passthrough charging simultaneously. In a test connection from a MacBook to an LG 4K UltraFine Display, the MacBook was able to output video to the monitor, while the monitor was able to provide power to the MacBook, all through the single connection. Owners of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and M2 Air can charge via the MagSafe connector at the same time as using the Pro Hub. The HDMI 2.0 port can also be used to connect a 4K 60Hz display, so you can achieve a dual 4K monitor setup on any Pro or Max M1 or M2 MacBook. Plain M1/M2 MacBook Airs are limited to just one external display. Also onboard are a 5Gbps USB-A port and a 5Gbps USB-C port—although neither can charge connected devices. There are both SD and MicroSD card readers (UHS-I), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and 3.5mm combo audio jack port. In the same family, Satechi also offers the Pro Hub Mini (the same as the Max but without the HDMI port) and the Pro Hub Slim (which swaps the Ethernet port for an extra USB-A port, and boasts 10GBps USB-A and USB-C ports compared to the Mac and Mini’s 5Gbps). If you don’t need wired Internet access, the Pro Hub Slim edges out the Pro Hub Max. If you don’t need more than one external screen or you want to save the USB4 for passthrough charging only, consider the Pro Hub Mini or the Plugable 5-in-1 USB-C Hub reviewed below.. Note that all three requires a MacBook with two adjacent Thunderbolt ports on one side.

A smart cutout keeps access to those MacBooks’ MagSafe charger port. The inclusion of the 40Gbps USB-C port is useful as the hub uses the two Thunderbolt or USB4 ports in its flush side connection to the MacBook. But, in return, it gives you two 5Gbps USB-A ports (4.5W charging) and Gigabit Ethernet. The audio jack port is also covered but replicated on the hub. The 40Gbps USB-C port can be used to connect a display up to 6K at 60Hz, or offer passthrough charging at up to 100W—15W for phones and other devices. Its closest rival is the Satechi Pro Hub Mini (reviewed above), which features an extra USB-C port (5Gbps) but is more expensive, so this hub wins our budget 40Gbps hub award.

It’s lightweight and much more compact than most USB-C docks. It features a full array of 8 ports, including: USB-C 3.1 for 85W Power Delivery (PD) charging of the laptop; an HDMI port (4K at 30Hz) for attaching to an external display; two 5Gbps USB-A 3.0 ports and another USB-A port with 7.5W for faster charging; Gigabit Ethernet for wired Internet; and SD and Micro SD card readers. It is showing its age a bit with its focus on USB-A rather than spare USB-C ports. The only USB-C port on offer is for passthrough charging of your laptop. It comes with a 1m USB-C cable to connect with your laptop, plus a detachable travel cable that hides inside the dock when not in use. While not Thunderbolt 3 or 4 it is compatible with Thunderbolt MacBooks–its data transfer is just limited to 5Gbps rather than TB’s 40Gbps. It’s pricier than most of the hubs reviewed here, but it’s got everything you need except a spare USB-C port, and we like it a lot. It feels more robust than some of the cheaper hubs, yet weighs just 150g. It’s available in either Black or White.

It’s primarily designed for the iPad Pro but will also work with a MacBook. While it lacks its bigger sibling’s Ethernet port and SD/microSD card readers, it still packs a HDMI Port (4K at 30Hz), USB A-port, USB-C Port for passthrough 85W PD charging, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. The StayGo’s singular USB-A port features BC 1.2 for up to 7.5W fast charging, but is USB 2.0 so limited to 480MBps data transfer compared to the StayGo’s three 5Gbps USB-A ports. It can connect directly to a tablet USB-C port, and also ships with a 0.5 meter USB-C cable if you want to use it with a MacBook. And if your iPad is in a protective case, the cable will mean the hub can still connect to the tablet. Available in Black only.

If you no longer have need for old-time USB-A by buying this hub you won’t be wasting money on a port you don’t require. If you have USB-A peripherals, such as an older memory stick, then you should look for a hub with a Type-A USB port. Three of the USB-C ports offer fast 10Gbps data transfer, and one at 5Gbps. A fifth USB-C port is for attaching a power source, most likely a USB-C wall charger. If the charger is rated at 100W, all that power can be distributed via the hub, including up to 85W PD to the host laptop or tablet. However, aside from the pass-through PD port, none of the USB ports can output power to connected devices. The EZQuest USB-C Slim Gen 2 Hub Adapter 6-in-1, reviewed here lower down, has four 10Gbps USB-C ports, each with 7.5W device charging, plus two more for 4K/60Hz monitor support and 80W passthrough charging, but it lacks the Ethernet and card reader. It’s not just the USB ports that are fast—the Ethernet port can reach 2.5Gb, compared to most hubs’ 1Gb Ethernet, if your network supports such speeds; of course, it is backwards compatible with GigabIt Ethernet networks. And the SD card reader is also top-notch at 312MBps, compared to some that are UHS-I at 104MBps. Despite the 8K in its name, the HDMI 2.1 port can support only as high a resolution as an external 4K display at 60Hz refresh rate, as well as display options of 2K/144Hz and 1080p/240Hz. Apple display limitations mean that its potential 8K/30Hz display support is limited to Windows machines. It’s at the high end for price but you get high-end, premium and future-proof ports for your money. It is available in Apple MacBook-matching Space Gray, Silver, and Midnight colors.

Four of these are rated at 10Gbps for data transfer, which is about as fast as you can get before you have to switch up to 40Gbps Thunderbolt. Another can link up to an external display up to 4K in resolution and at a gamer-friendly 60Hz refresh rate. You can either connect direct to a USB-C monitor, or use a USB-C to either DisplayPort or HDMI adapter. The sixth USB-C port can handle 100W of PD 3.0 power input, 80W of which is reserved for the MacBook if it needs that much. Each of the 10Gbps ports can deliver 7.5W, up to a maximum 15W across all four at the same time. U.K. buyers can buy direct from EZQuest, but have to swallow a $25 shipping fee.

There are five USB-A ports, all rated at a speedy 10Gbps. One offers 12W of device-charging power. One of the two 10Gbps USB-C ports can also charge connected devices at 12W. The other USB ports each offer a small charge of 4.5W. Even 12W is not powerful enough to fast charge an iPhone but it’s enough to keep most connected devices powered up.

It doesn’t have its own power supply but offers passthrough PD charging at a more than healthy 100W. That’s a great set of ports, but that’s not it’s biggest plus for users of Apple’s plain M1/M2/M3-based MacBooks. The standard M1 and M2 chips (that is non-Pro/Max) in Apple’s MacBooks are powerful but have a major limitation: unlike Intel-based Macs, they don’t support more than one external display. The plain M3 MacBooks can connect two displays but only if the MacBook’s lid remains closed. The smarter M4 and M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro and Max chips do support multiple displays. If that is a problem for you there is a hardware solution in the Hyperdrive Dual 4K HDMI 10-in-1 USB-C Hub, which lets non-Pro/Max Macs connect two external displays. There is some light software installation involved for M1/M2/M3 users, and you need to allow InstantView access to your Privacy settings in System Preferences. There are alternative solutions for adding two or more monitors to an M1, M2, M3 MacBook. One HDMI port allows for 4K at 60Hz, and the other 4K at 30Hz.

This six-port hub from Satechi boasts a 2.5Gbps (2.5GbE) Ethernet port—2.5x faster than regular Gigabit Ethernet. 2.5GbE development is becoming more commonplace now that WiFi 6 enables wireless connection to over 1GbE LAN, and you can find 2.5G ports on some WiFi 6 routers. Current CAT5e Ethernet cables are compatible so there’s no need for rewiring. Aside from this super-fast Ethernet this hub boasts 4K at 60Hz HDMI, 10Gbps USB-A and two 10Gbps USB-C ports (one with 100W passthrough charging) and a combo 3.5mm audio jack. Note that neither USB-C port supports video transfer so it’s a one-display hub. This hub also stands apart from standard USB-C ports by being USB4, which means you get to play with your Mac’s full 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 bandwidth. If all you need is the 2.5Gbps (2.5GbE) Ethernet port, look at Satechi’s more affordable USB-C 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, which boasts a strong braided cable.

It wasn’t so much that we needed adapters, but more to do with the price Apple was charging for its simple USB-C hubs and adapters. Take, for example Apple’s USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter, which cost a lot for just an HDMI port, one USB-A port and a passthrough-power USB-C port. Plugable has a much cheaper alternative, at about a third of the price. And it looks pretty identical. Aside from the price, the one drawback is that the HDMI connection can connect a 4K external display at 30Hz rather than the full 60Hz, which may put off gamers. But otherwise, this is a great alternative at a fraction of the price, and can charge at 60W.

The Mac Mini and Mac Studio, you’d think, have an army of ports in comparison to Apple’s laptops. Apple’s latest M4 Mac mini does at least add a couple of USB-C ports and an audio jack at the front—sadly lacking for its earlier M1 and M2 Mac mini models, see below—but it doesn’t have any legacy USB-A ports or card readers. The Satechi Stand \u0026 Hub for the M4 Mac mini adds three USB-A ports—two at 10Gbps and one at 480Mbps—at the front, plus an SD card reader. Inside the Hub is an enclosure that enables you to add an NVMe SSD—so adding more hidden storage at prices much cheaper than offered by Apple at purchase. It fits neatly under the mini and, in our tests, didn’t suffer the same Wi-Fi problems as its M1/M2 sibling, although it has three fewer ports.

That sounds like a lot, but Apple accessory specialist Satechi believes the Mini needs maxing. Satechi’s Type-C Aluminum Stand \u0026 Hub for Mac Mini expands these capabilities with seven ports: including a USB-C data port, three USB-A ports, micro/SD card readers, and another 3.5mm headphone jack port. (Note that you can’t charge devices connected to the USB ports, as they are there for syncing and data transfer only.) The crucial point is that these points are front-facing, and not tucked around the back with the unwieldy and unsightly power supply. It also lifts the Mini off the desk, and its built-in air vents help regulate temperature and encourage airflow. There is a superior model, the Satechi Stand \u0026 Hub For Mac Mini / Studio With NVMe SSD Enclosure, which includes an integrated slot where you can insert an SSD card to add affordable fast storage, accessible when connected to your Mac mini or Mac Studio. Read our Satechi Stand \u0026 Hub With SSD Enclosure review. Both of the Satechi M1/M2 Mac mini Stand Hubs, however, can have a negative impact on the mini’s Wi-Fi signal strength, so it’s recommended to use the wired Ethernet option instead. In spring 2025 Satechi will start selling a version of the hub for the smaller 2024 Mac Mini M4, with up to 4TB NVMe storage and 10Gbps USB-C. Apple has added USB-C ports to the front of its new Mac mini but Satechi’s hub will add USB-A and a card reader. We will review the new Mac Mini M4 Stand \u0026 Hub with SSD Enclosure (pictured above) when it is released. HyperDrive 6-in-1 USB-C Hub for 24in iMac – Best hub for iMac Pros 6 ports USB-C (10Gbps) 2x USB-A (10Gbps, 7.5W) 4K 60Hz display via HDMI Color matches your iMac Cons UHS-I card reader 24in iMac only Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $79.99 View Deal Hyper $79.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $79.99 at Amazon$79.99 at Hyper 6 Ports: 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A, 1x HDMI, SD Card Reader, MicroSD Card Reader You might not think a desktop Mac needs a hub, but the 24in iMac is quite lacking, having either just two Thunderbolt ports on the entry-level model or two Thunderbolt and two USB-C at the top-end. These ports are also all hidden away at the back, which can mean snaking cables all over your desk. Five of the ports on this hub that clamps to the underside of the iMac are front-facing ports for easy access to memory cards, USB storage, or storage cards. There are two USB-C ports and one USB-A port (all rated at a speedy 10GBps). The USB-A port can charge a phone at 7.5W. The UHS-I (104MBps) SD and microSD card readers aren’t the fastest but should suffice. Such memory cards are an affordable way of adding portable storage, and will also delight camera users. At the rear of the hub is an HDMI port that can support an external 4K display at 60Hz. Hyper also sells a 5-in-1 iMac USB Hub with two USB-C (5Gbps) and three USB-A (5Gbps and one that charges at 7.5W). Quite brilliantly, the hubs can color-match with your 24in iMac, with 7 iMac color faceplates included.

It brings four USB ports within easy arm’s reach, so you don’t need to fiddle around at the back of the computer. It lacks the HyperDrive’s HDMI port but gains an extra USB-A port, although at a slow 480Mbps and with little charging power.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
