For even more deals, Club MacStories+ and Premier members should visit our Black Friday Discord channel, where members are sharing the deals they find throughout the week, too. Apple and Beats Hardware Apple AirPods Pro 2 (32% off) This isn’t quite the best deal I’ve seen on AirPods Pro 2, but it’s close. With Apple’s new hearing protection and assistance features, the AirPods Pro 2 are more capable than ever, so it’s a good time to refresh an aging pair or pick up your first. Apple AirTag Four-Pack (26%) I have AirTags on my luggage, on my backpack, and in my glasses cases. Amazon’s Black Friday deal is one of the lowest prices for a four-pack that I’ve seen. Apple Watch Series 10 (18% off) It’s wild to me that the Apple Watch Series 10 is already 18% off on Amazon, which is the best deal available since the wearable’s launch according to CamelCamelCamel. I’m sticking with my OG Apple Watch Ultra, but the Series 10 is tempting at this price. Beats Solo 4 (50% off) Beats is going all out for Black Friday with 50% off the Solo 4 headphones in various color. I haven’t used either model myself, but Devon recently reviewed the Beats Solo 4 in the Club MacStories Monthly Log. I’m a fan of the Beats Fit Pro, which I’ve been using for about a year whenever I run outdoors; unfortunately, the Fit Pro model isn’t on sale this week. Everything Else Logitech POP Mouse (50% off) I’m a fan of the Logitech POP mouse. It’s not a device I use every day, but it’s small and lightweight, making it great to take on the go or use for tasks like setting up apps on my Legion Go Windows handheld console. PlayStation 5 Digital Edition (Slim) (17% off) Given the size of my original PS5, the slim edition is tempting, especially since this is the cheapest it’s ever been on Amazon, but I think I’ll resist. Still, if you’re in the market for a new console, this is a terrific deal. Sony PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller (28% off) Sony’s DualSense controller is one of my all-time favorite controllers, and right now, you can get it in a variety of colors for 28% off, which makes now an excellent time to pick up a spare controller for your PS5 or a second controller to play games on an iPad or Apple TV. Anker MagGo Power Bank for Apple Watch (31% off) When the Belkin BoostCharge Pro battery with a built-in Apple Watch charger was recalled, I went on the hunt for a replacement and ended up getting this similar battery pack from Anker. It supports fast Apple Watch charging and features a 10,000 mAh capacity, a display to show charging details, and a built-in USB-C cable that delivers up to 30W. Anker MagGo Power Bank (33% off) Anker’s MagGo Power Bank supports Qi2 15W charging and has a kickstand, a tiny display with charging details, and a single USB-C port. Anker Power Bank Power Station 60,000 mAh Portable Outdoor Generator (36% off) This big Anker battery came up on the most recent episode of MacStories Unwind. “Portable at home” is a concept we’ve talked about a lot on Unwind and NPC: Next Portable Console. This isn’t the kind of battery you’d carry in a backpack, but it does provide a lot of power for times when you don’t have an electrical outlet nearby. With its built-in light, it’s also a good option for camping trips. UGREEN Nexode Pro 100W USB-C Charger (20% off) UGREEN’s entire Nexode line of GaN chargers is good, but I like this 100W model best because it strikes a nice balance between compact size and power. It can deliver up to 100W of power to a single USB-C port, or you can split the output among its three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A). Aqara Smart Lock U100 (43% off) Although I haven’t tried it myself, I wanted to mention the Aqara Smart Lock U100, because there are so few Home Key-compatible locks on the market, and this is such a good deal. I’m not fully sold on the style of this lock, but it’s better than most I’ve seen. Kindle Paperwhite (19% off) The latest model of the Kindle Paperwhite is on sale for 19% off, which is a great deal for a device that has only been available for a matter of weeks. I haven’t tried the new Paperwhite, but I’ve been a fan of the last couple of models, and by all accounts, the latest iteration is quite good too. Elgato Stream Deck+ (16% off) The Elgato Stream Deck+ came up on AppStories this week, where I interviewed Brendon Bigley about his app and podcasting setups. Brendon’s using the Stream Deck+ along with Elgato’s XLR Dock, so he has physical dials to control his podcasting mic. Meross Smart Garage Door Opener Remote (20% off) I think it’s time I finally pull the trigger on the Meross Smart Garage Door Opener Remote. I’m one of the many people frustrated by the Chamberlain MyQ app, which doesn’t integrate with HomeKit, and with this deal, I think I’ll add this device to my holiday tech project list. That’s it for Black Friday deals for now. We’ll have details on a big indie app sale later this week, and you can find even more deals being shared in the Club MacStories Discord community, so keep an eye on MacStories this week.
