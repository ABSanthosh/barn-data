The \"Apple Crayon Pro\" accurately imitates the wrapper of genuine crayons, and it even features a colored tip to match. If it wasn't for the word \"Crayon\" on the side, you might almost think it's an actual Crayola product. ColorWare's \"Apple Crayon Pro\" even mimics the wrappers of real-world crayons.The Apple Pencil Pro, and by extension ColorWare's \"Apple Crayon Pro,\" is compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 models of the iPad Air, as well as the iPad mini 7, which features Apple's A17 Pro chip. The playful and creative design comes at a cost, though, as ColorWare's custom Apple Pencil Pro will set you back $215. Compared to the standard Apple Pencil Pro, which is available only in white for $129, the \"Apple Crayon Pro\" costs an additional $86. The \"Apple Crayon Pro\" is available in seven different colors, including mint.The product comes with a one-year warranty from ColorWare and is available in a matte finish. The unique design of the \"Apple Crayon Pro\" lets you stand out and make a statement. It might also take you back in time, so to speak, much like ColorWare's custom iPhone 7 that echoed legacy Macintosh computers. While the $86 premium may be too much for some, others will undoubtedly find the custom \"Apple Pencil Pro\" fun and quirky enough to buy. Using a custom Apple Crayon Pro with the built-in Freeform app on iPad is sure to make you feel like a kid again.",
