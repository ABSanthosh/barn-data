Whether you watch the video version of the show or not, we kicked off a playlist of bonus content this week with two videos. The first is an unboxing and closer look at the Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition. I’ve had the Switch Lite for a little over a week and love it. We also published a short video follow-up to one of the news stories we covered on the most recent episode of NPC. It turns out that the mysterious Nintendo device that appeared in the FCC’s records wasn’t quite what we thought it might be, and Brendon got photos from the Nintendo Store in New York, which Brendon also wrote about on Wavelengths. YouTube’s playlist feature is also a great way to put together themed sets of past episodes of shows like AppStories, which has over 400 episodes. We’re working on more of these, but this week, we added a playlist of all 43 interview episodes we’ve done so far, as well as a collection of our classic Pick 2 episodes where Federico and I spotlight recent apps we’ve been trying.
