  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Sofa is an easy-to-use app that helps keep you organized when you don’t have something to do. Everyone has some level of downtime, but often don’t plan things out. Social media doomscrolling is often an option, but Sofa helps you plan out other leisure activities. In its new update, it also added a built-in podcast player. Top features Sofa lets you organize apps, books, audiobooks, movies, TV shows, podcasts, music albums, video games, and more. It’s a one stop shop. The app has a very large catalog, so when you search for something – more than likely it knows what it is. Once you search it, you can either add it to “the pile”, which is a general place for anything you’d like to go through – or add it to a tailored list that you curate. You can add your own custom categories for things beyond what I named prior. If you want an articles list, for example, you can choose to make one. There’s also a logbook, allowing you to keep track of every game, podcast, or show you’ve explored thus far. It serves as a great activity tracker. And, as mentioned earlier, the new Sofa 4.2 update now has a podcast player, so you don’t even need to exit the app if you’re a huge podcast enjoyer. The podcast player has show notes, and also supports CarPlay. Download Sofa Sofa is available for free on the App Store with all of the features mentioned above. It’ll require an iPhone or iPad running iOS 17.6 or later, a Mac running macOS 14.6 Sonoma or later, or an Apple Vision Pro running visionOS 2.4 or later. For even more features, you can check out Super Sofa. It’s their premium offering, which adds features like smart lists, deeper customization, enhanced podcast controls, pinned lists, sticky notes, and more. It’s available for $3.99/month or $29.99/year. Smart lists are automatically populating lists based on filter criteria you can set up while creating a list. Sofa is plenty capable even if you never subscribe. It offers unlimited groups/lists, the ability to add virtually anything to the app, iCloud syncing, custom categories, and the brand-new podcast player – even on the free tier.
