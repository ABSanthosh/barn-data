  "text": "While Apple may have just released the final versions of MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4 to the general public, they’re already back on the beta train. This time around we’ve got the first beta versions of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5. It’s not clear what the focus of these new beta versions will be, and no major new features are expected, or at least included in the initial betas. Presumably the focus will be on the typical bug fixes and security enhancements, perhaps with some further refinements to Apple Intelligence features. Beta testers can also find new beta versions of watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, if they’re testing for those devices as well. If you install the beta onto your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, you’ll have to restart your device to finish installation. Betas are intended for advanced users and developers and are not intended for casual users due to the buggy nature of beta system software. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.5 Beta 1 Any enrolled iPhone or iPad can get the latest beta through: Opening the “Settings” app Going to “General”, and then going to “Software Update” Choosing to install iOS 18.5 beta 1 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 1 If the Mac is enrolled in the betas you can get the latest version by: From the  Apple menu, go to “System Settings” and then go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to “Update Now” for MacOS Sequoia 15.5 beta 1 When will iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 be released as final? While there’s no known public timeline for the release of the next versions of stable operating systems for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Apple usually goes through several beta builds before issuing a final version. Given that Apple just released MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4 as final, and that this is the version beta versions of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5, one might reasonably expect the final releases to be out sometime at the end of April or in May.",
