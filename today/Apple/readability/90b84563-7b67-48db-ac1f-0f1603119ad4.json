  "text": "News Shoppers bought heaps of iPhone Pro models in 2024. Photo: Apple If you paid $900 for your iPhone, then you paid less than the global average, according to a new analysts’ report. That’s because the average selling price for iOS devices grew 25% over the last four years, even as the number of handsets Apple sold also increased. There’s been a trend for several years of greater demand for Apple’s more expensive iPhone Pro models, and that’s driving up ASP. iPhone ASP goes up, up and away Each generation of iOS devices starts with a base version, and there are also additional variations for more features… and higher prices. Data shows that plenty of people opt for the more expensive options. We know that because the average selling price for an iPhone in 2024 was well above the cost of the base model, according to analysts at Counterpoint Research. Although iPhone had a slightly weak Q4, “the brand’s revenue was not hurt much and ASP continued to grow, which surpassed the $900 mark — a new record,” Research Director Jeff Fieldhack said on Monday. The global total hit $903. There’s been a sizable jump over the past few years, considering iPhone ASP in 2020 was $724. Do not think that shoppers are buying fewer, more expensive iOS devices. Market analysis firm IDC reports that Apple sold 206 million iPhones in 2020 and 232 million in 2024 — more than any other handset maker. Also, don’t think all the growth is coming in the U.S. and Europe. “Apple continues to expand its footprint in emerging markets where the growing middle-class is driving demand,” noted Counterpoint’s analysts. “Latin America was the fastest growing region for Apple with iPhone shipments increasing 44% YoY driven by local availability of the latest series and price discounts on legacy models.” iPhone Pro for the win In explaining the iPhone ASP increase, Counterpoint’s Fieldhack said, “The contribution of the Pro series within Apple’s portfolio continues to rise.” No rival can come close to matching buyer demand for premium iOS models. Although Samsung offers the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at a startlingly high $1,900, the company’s global average selling price for all its models is just $299. And it’s the only one of Apple’s significant competitors with an ASP over $250. This means these companies primarily sell cheap handsets, not high-end ones. The result is that Apple brought in 46% of the world’s smartphone revenue in 2024, according to Counterpoint. Its closest rival was Samsung, who accounted for a mere 15%. Despite these results, the situation could change somewhat throughout 2025. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reported in January that the iPhone 16 outsold the iPhone 16 Pro during the last quarter of 2024.",
