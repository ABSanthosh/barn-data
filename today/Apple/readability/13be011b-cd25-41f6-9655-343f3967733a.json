  "text": "Developers relying on Rosetta 2 to keep their legacy code running should begin preparing now, as macOS 27 will be the last to provide full support for the translation technology. When Apple revealed Apple Silicon in 2020, it shared that the transition would be slow to ensure users and software weren't lost along the way. With the announcement of macOS Tahoe during WWDC 2025, Apple has revealed that not only Intel Macs, but Rosetta 2 are on the chopping block. According to a portion of the Platforms State of the Union, developers have until macOS 28 to get their apps running natively on Apple Silicon. They also shared that macOS 26 is the last Mac operating system that will support Intel-based Macs. When it arrives, macOS 28 will still run Rosetta 2, but scaled back significantly to support only legacy apps like old games that won't be updated again. The full Rosetta 2 translation layer will still work in macOS 26 and macOS 27, in the meantime. Intel owners should consider upgrading to a more modern Mac to continue receiving full operating system updates. Apple will likely continue to support macOS 26 with security patches for some years, but the feature updates won't arrive on Intel machines anymore. Those already using Apple Silicon should ensure they are running native apps. If you have an app that's still Intel-based, either find a new app or start writing to the developer to urge a transition to a native app. There's plenty of time, so no need to panic at this point. In all likelihood, macOS 28 won't be announced until WWDC 2027.",
