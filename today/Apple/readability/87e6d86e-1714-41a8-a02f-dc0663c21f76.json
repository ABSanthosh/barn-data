  "text": "According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is preparing a ‘major shake-up’ for the 20th anniversary of the iPhone next year. One of the changes includes introducing a foldable iPhone for the first time, but the company is reportedly planning a ‘bold new Pro model.’ This device, if things stick to plan, would finally achieve what Jony Ive initially visioned for the iPhone. He had long championed for an iPhone that would “appear like a single sheet of glass,” according to reports. This concept became very clear with the iPhone X. While Apple in more recent years has only made thicker and less sleek iPhones, it seems they’re now headed in the direction of what Jony Ive would’ve wanted. This shift starts with the launch of the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air model later this year, and will continue to play out next year in the 20th anniversary pro iPhone. From the Power On newsletter: But the company is preparing a major shake-up for the iPhone’s 20-year anniversary, including a foldable version and a bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass. An iPhone with more glass probably sounds like more of a durability and repairability headache to most people, but it sounds completely in line with what Apple would do. It also makes complete sense to implement this sort of shake up for the 20th anniversary. In the past, Gurman has reported that the iPhone 17 Air was just the first step towards all iPhones eventually becoming ultra-thin. I could see Apple implementing both an ultra-thin and more glassy design for iPhone 19 Pro. This would satisfy the vision of making an iPhone that appears like a single sheet of glass. Unfortunately, Gurman doesn’t provide any key design details other than the fact that it’ll use more glass. You’ll have to leave the rest to your imagination.
