If not, your Wi-Fi router could be to blame. Ensure you’re not lacking in that department by securing a deep discount on a HomeKit-compatible Linksys Velop mesh Wi-Fi setup. Originally $299, you can get a two-pack of refurbished Linksys Velop tri-band Wi-Fi 5 routers for only $49.99. Score a pair of these Intelligent Mesh routers for less, and you should notice an immediate improvement in your in-home Wi-Fi performance. Enjoy ultra-fast performance with the Linksys Velop mesh Wi-Fi system Featuring Linksys’ Intelligent Mesh technology and a range that extends up to 6,000 square feet, Velop is designed to offer a speedy path to the internet in any type and size of home. These tri-band mesh routers are Wi-Fi 5, which isn’t the latest version of the wireless standard. However, the tri-band AC2200 (867 + 867 + 400Mbps) Wi-Fi delivers plenty of throughput for most needs. And if you’re already running a Linksys Velop network, they make an easy and affordable way to expand your Wi-Fi’s reach even further and more reliably. The Linksys Velop Whole Home system utilizes MU-MIMO technology, which can simultaneously deliver high-speed Wi-Fi to various devices. The system can easily handle multiple computers, gaming consoles and smart home devices. The routers have even been tested in 25 real-world tests in the Linksys Life Lab to ensure they withstand the internet needs of any household, office or organization. Easy upgrade for HomeKit-compatible Wi-Fi Compatible with Apple’s HomeKit as well as Amazon’s Alexa, these routers provide simple management options. Users can take inventory of which devices require the most bandwidth, and then prioritize them on the Wi-Fi network. And since this is a two-pack, you can use them both to make sure Wi-Fi gets to every corner of your house. Alternatively, you could keep one at home for you and your family, and another for the office or as a gift for someone in need. Save on a pair of dual-band Linksys Velop mesh Wi-Fi routers While these dual-band Wi-Fi routers are preloved, they boast a Grade “A” refurbished rating. That means they will arrive in near-mint condition, with few to zero exterior blemishes. Since they’re used, you can get a like-new product at a more affordable price. Enjoy big savings on two Linksys Velop dual-band Wi-Fi routers, now just $49.99. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
