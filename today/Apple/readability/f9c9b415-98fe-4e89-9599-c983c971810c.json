  "text": "Apple on Monday released visionOS 2.4, and it’s the first update to enable Apple Intelligence features in Apple Vision Pro. However, even though the update was released on the same day as iOS 18.4 – which expands AI capabilities to more languages – Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro is only available in English. Apple Intelligence for Vision Pro is limited to US English In a note on Apple’s website, the company notes that the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro is only available in US English. This means that Vision Pro users must set both the system language and Siri to US English before enabling AI features. When Apple Intelligence arrived on iOS, it was also limited to US English. With iOS 18.2, Apple has expanded its AI tools to more variations of English. Now with iOS 18.4, Apple Intelligence is also available in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese, and Spanish. The Apple Intelligence features in Vision Pro are pretty much the same as those already available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes Writing Tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and text summarization. Apple hasn’t made any specific AI features for Vision Pro, and it doesn’t have Visual Intelligence like the iPhone. Since Vision Pro is only available in a few countries around the world, it’s understandable that Apple hasn’t rushed to add support for more languages just yet. In addition to Apple Intelligence, visionOS 2.4 adds a new Spatial Gallery app with photos, videos and spatial panoramas curated by Apple. The update also makes it easier to share a Vision Pro with a guest. You can install visionOS 2.4 by going to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update. It’s worth noting that Apple Vision Pro is currently available in Australia, Canada, China mainland, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, the UAE, the UK, and the US.
