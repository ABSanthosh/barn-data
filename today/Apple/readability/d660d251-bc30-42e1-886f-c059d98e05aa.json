  "description": "Macworld Apple’s Studio Display is more than a gorgeous 5K monitor—it’s also loaded with high-end features you won’t find on any other display, including spatial audio speakers, a FaceTime camera with Center Stage, and three built-in USB-C ports. All that comes at a high price, of course, but today it’s cheaper than it’s ever been: Amazon is selling the 27-inch Apple Studio Display for $1,294 for Prime Day, a savings of $305 and the best price we’ve ever seen. The Studio Display is a fantastic monitor with a 5K Retina display and up to 600 nits of brightness, True Tone, and a P3 wide color gamut. Under the hood, you’ll find a built-in 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage support for keeping you well-framed during calls, as well as a six-speaker sound system with spatial audio support and three USB-C ports with 96W of power delivery, enough to fast-charge a MacBook. In our 4-star review, we liked the Studio Display as “an affordable alternative to the Pro Display XDR,” but didn’t love its high price. This deal fixes that and at this price, it gets our full recommendation—especially if you want to pair it with a 512GB Mac mini, on sale for $690 ($109 off), or a new discounted MacBook. So go grab one before the price shoots back up. Get the Studio Display for more than $300 offView Deal",
