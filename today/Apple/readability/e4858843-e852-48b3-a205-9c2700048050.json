As I said when I recently reviewed the Epomaker Split65, I'm a sucker for a keyboard. But when you try a lot of keyboards, it's easy to find them all merging into one mechanical mass. Even so, the Magcore 87 is a first for me — something that happens all too rarely these days. In a world of mechanical keyboards, Epomaker chose to go with inductive switches this time around. That didn't mean an awful lot to me at first, but after a few weeks with the Magcore 87, I think I'm sold. It does help that the black and purple stealth look hits the spot, too. But the unusual switches and cool aesthetics don't tell the whole story here. The Magcore 87 has more to offer, and it should — because it costs a whopping $200. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard review: What's in the boxLet's kick things off with the basics, because the first thing any keyboard needs is to be unboxed. Unsheathing the Magcore 87 reveals the keyboard, a USB-C cable, a manual, and a keycap puller. You also get three inductive switches included, too, should you need them. Epomaker is probably concerned people might break them when they switch keycaps. Since this keyboard is wired-only, there is no 2.4GHz dongle included, which feels strange. In a world of wireless keyboards, I like that the Magcore 87 feels distinctly retro here. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard review: Design and specsThe first thing I noticed about the Magcore 87 was its size and heft. It's a big keyboard, and at around 2kg (around 4.4 pounds), you don't want to drop it on your toe. The second thing I noticed was the cool keycaps, with some made from a purple translucent, almost transparent, plastic. It's a vibe and adds to the Transformers Decepticon look. Epomaker Magcore 87 review: The clear caps look gorgeous lit upFeaturing a TKL (Tenkeyless) design, the Magcore 87 has plenty of keys for you to tap away on, including a full array of arrows. Considering the keyboard's gaming credentials, everything is present and correct. Keycap fans will note the double-shot PBT plastic construction here. Each key sports south-facing RGB lights. That brings us neatly onto those inductive switches, one of the more notable technical features here. In this case, they're Kaih Box inductive switches. So, what do you get by going inductive? In theory, they offer a smoother operation with improved stability and durability compared to traditional mechanical options. For gamers, one advantage over standard mechanical switches is customization. Keys can be adjusted to require less force to register a press, for example. Handy for when the action gets frantic. Each switch has a total travel of around 3.5mm, and they're hot-swappable if you'd prefer something else. Just remember that your new switches must be inductive, not mechanical. You'll find nothing more than a single USB-C port around the back of the Magcore 87. The lack of wireless connectivity means there is no battery, so no need for a power switch. Other specs that are worth calling out include an 8,000Hz polling rate and a 0.125ms latency when typing. N-key rollover support means you shouldn't see any ghosting, too. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard review: CustomizationLike most modern keyboards, the Epomaker Magcore 87 supports customization. You can use the Epomaker app or, if you prefer, the VIA web-based option — I used the latter, because there is no Mac version of the Epomaker app. As mentioned earlier, there are a few ways that the Magcore 87 can be customized. The most functional is the option to adjust trigger travel for gaming. Another feature aimed at gamers is RGB lighting, although I admit it just looks cool even if the last game you played was Frogger back in the 1980s. In reality, there are more options than you're likely to ever need — I chose one and never changed it again. But you do you. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard review: In useI've been using the Epomaker Magcore 87 with my MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, connected to the Anker Prime Thunderbolt 5 dock. Epomaker Magcore 87 review: The RGB lightning is among the bestIn use, I enjoyed typing on the Magcore 87, and the Kaih switches can be credited for that. I could type as quickly as usual without adding any extra mistakes to the mix. In terms of sound, I found the Magcore 87 to have a muted thunk rather than the mechanical click I'm used to. That's those switches again, and I confess I do like it — so do my family, who have to listen to me type, too. Unfortunately, like the other Epomaker keyboards I've tested, the Magcore 87 supports the Mac but doesn't come with Mac-specific keycaps. You'll need to just get used to having a Win key and try not to look at it, unfortunately. It isn't the biggest thing, but it's an irritation that shouldn't happen. Especially when you remember that this keyboard costs almost $200. As someone who has used smaller keyboards for the most part in recent years, I must admit I do like the larger TKL size. It's not a full-size keyboard by any stretch, but having more space around the arrow keys is a bigger deal than I expected it to be. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard review: An expensive keyboard with fancy switchesAs is probably obvious, I type a lot of words each and every day. I do that five, often six days a week, so my keyboards are used plenty. I also test a lot of keyboards. Some of those keyboards are better than others, and some are unboxed, tapped, and never used again. Epomaker Magcore 87 review: A single USB-C port is the only connection optionThe Epomaker Magcore 87 definitely doesn't fall into that latter category, and it's a keyboard I'd happily type on full time. Whether or not to pay $200 for it iss a complicated question, because the Magcore 87 does things and has features that a lot of people don't need. It's built with gamers in mind, with advanced key customization aimed squarely at those people. But while I won't be adjusting the actuation of my keys any time soon, I can still appreciate a good, solidly built keyboard. There is no doubt that the Magcore 87 very much falls into that category. If you are a gamer, and you do want to use these kinds of features, you'll love the Magcore 87. For you, that $200 price point is probably well worth it, too. Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard: ProsA quality, heavy construction Plenty of RGB customization options Inductive switches are more stable than mechanical Nice typing experience with Kaih Box switches Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard: ConsAt $200, it's an expensive keyboard No Mac-specific keycaps No wireless connectivity Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard: Rating 3.5 out of 5 Where to buy the Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboardYou can preorder the Epomaker Magcore 87 keyboard for $199.99 directly from Epomaker's website.",
