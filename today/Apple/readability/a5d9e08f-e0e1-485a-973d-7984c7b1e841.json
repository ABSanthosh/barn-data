  "text": "Today we announced changes to our technology coverage at the Journal.The Journal has a rich tradition of groundbreaking coverage of the biggest technology companies. The time has come for us to put in place a structure that fully acknowledges tech’s all-encompassing role in the economy and our lives. To that end, tech coverage will be part of a wider Technology \u0026 Media group, based in New York. I’m happy to announce that Sarah Krouse will run that group as Tech \u0026 Media editor. Sarah will be returning to New York from a successful run in Los Angeles as  LA bureau chief. She’ll manage the tech-focused reporters and editors in San Francisco and New York, the New York-based media team and the Los Angeles-based entertainment team.We are advertising for a deputy Technology bureau chief based in New York and for a second deputy Technology bureau chief based in San Francisco.We’re also creating a new Tech \u0026 Media enterprise team, reporting to Sarah, and we’re creating two new jobs on this team based in San Francisco. In the coming weeks, we’ll be reconfiguring beats on the tech team to give more of them a wide ambit. Fewer will focus narrowly on individual companies. We are also advertising for  a new tech-focused job on Heard in New York.These changes do mean that some reporters and editors in San Francisco and New York will be leaving us. I want to thank them for their contributions to the Journal. I want to especially thank Jason Dean, who is departing, for his long and distinguished service.",
