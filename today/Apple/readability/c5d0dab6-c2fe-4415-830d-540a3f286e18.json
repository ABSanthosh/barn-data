Photo: Cult of Mac Deals The remarkably tiny Charge Fob keychain power bank can charge your iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously. It’s one of the smallest portable chargers we’ve seen, and it’s perfect for those “oh crap” moments when one of your Apple devices runs out of juice unexpectedly. Measuring just under 4 inches long and 2 inches wide, you can slip this little guy in your pocket, purse or travel bag and have some extra iPhone or Apple Watch juice to get through the day. Plus, at just $19.99, this gadget is an absolute steal (regularly $59.95). Charge Fob: A keychain power bank you can count on (and forget about) We’ve all done it: Packed a chunky portable charger for a trip, then left it in the hotel room because it felt like carrying a brick. This tiny keychain power bank fixes that. It’s compact enough to stash on your keyring, and it doesn’t require any cords. You likely won’t even remember it’s there … until your Apple Watch or iPhone flashes the low-battery warning. Compatible with all Apple Watch series This mini keychain charger and power bank charges iPhone and Apple Watch.Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Apple Watch users know the struggle: The smartwatch always dies when you’re halfway through closing your rings or you’re actually depending on it for notifications. The keychain charger‘s built-in magnetic charging pad locks your Apple Watch into place and powers it up, without needing the original puck or charging brick. Built for the iPhone 15 and newer For iPhone users, this compact charger comes with a retractable USB-C plug. (Sorry, Lightning users.) That means you don’t need a cable to top up the 2,000mAh keychain power bank or to juice up your iPhone. In either case, it’s simply plug and go. The only real downside to this method compared to wireless charging is that you’ll have the charger sticking out of your iPhone’s charging port. Still, you’re only paying $19.99, so the savings are worth the fuss. Save on a Charge Fob keychain power bank No cords. No setup. Just a clean, modern power boost that works when you need it. Whether you’re commuting, traveling or just trying to make it through your 3 p.m. slump, this little keychain power bank delivers a shot of juice when you need it most. And that’s exactly why we’re loving it. Order the Charge Fob keychain power bank for just $19.99 (regularly $59.95). Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
