  "text": "Ever since Apple announced its deal to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, there have been hints that the company wanted to make deals with other AI providers, too. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has added fuel to the rumors with testimony given today in the remedy phase of the search antitrust case brought against it by the U.S. Department of Justice. In response to questions by a DOJ prosecutor, Pichai testified that he hoped Google Gemini would be added to iPhones this year. According to a Bloomberg story co-authored by Mark Gurman, Davey Alba, and Leah Nylen: Pichai said he held a series of conversations with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook across 2024 and he hopes to have a deal done by the middle of this year. This news isn’t surprising, but it is welcome. Despite Google’s early stumbles with Bard, its successor, Gemini, has improved by leaps and bounds in recent months and has the advantage of being integrated with many of Google’s other products that have a huge user base. What will be interesting to see is whether Gemini is integrated as an alternative fallback for Siri requests or whether Apple and Google ink a broader deal that integrates Gemini into other aspects of iOS.",
