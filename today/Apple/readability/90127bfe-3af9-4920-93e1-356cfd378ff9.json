  "text": "Since launch, Gemini on iOS has been part of the Google (Search) app. That’s about to change with at least one iPhone user today spotting a standalone “Google Gemini” app on the App Store that also lets you access Gemini Live.  With this standalone app, you get a Gemini icon on your homescreen: “Unlock the power of Google AI on your iPhone.” Since launch, you’ve had to open the Google app and switch over to the “Gemini” tab at the top. Alternatively, the Google app’s homescreen widget was updated in September with customizable shortcuts that let you directly access Gemini with one tap.  The listing for “Google Gemini” shows the ability to access Gemini Live. This is not yet available in the Google app, with one user that downloaded the app showing the voice experience in action. Gemini is taking advantage of a Live Activity to let it be active while you continue using your phone. Credit: u/lostshenanigans So far, there’s only one report of this app being downloadable for a user in the Philippines. The App Store listing does not load in the US (“This app is currently not available in your country or region”), with Google presumably testing in a few countries before the wider launch.  In terms of functionality, Gemini on iPhone via the Google app today is on par with gemini.google.com. However, Google has not updated the UI to match the Android experience. Hopefully, this standalone app will allow Google to deliver faster updates. As a reminder, Google Assistant is its own app on the Apple platform.
