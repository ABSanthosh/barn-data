  "text": "Mozilla has announced that it will shut down Pocket, its popular read-it-later app, on July 8, 2025. This means that unless the Digg acquisition offer turns into something, its users will have until then to find an alternative read-it-later app. If that’s you, here are five potential replacements, although I know none of them will ever be able to fill that Pocket-shaped hole in your heart. 1. Instapaper Instapaper has been around almost as long as Pocket, with its roots dating back to 2008. Originally developed by Marco Arment, it changed hands a few times before becoming independently operated again under Instant Paper, Inc. The app offers a clean, distraction-free interface with support for offline reading, text highlighting, and adjustable text settings. As a soon-to-be former Pocket user, you might like the app’s speed-reading mode, note-taking tools, and seamless syncing across devices. Availability: iOS, iPadOS, Android, web, Kindle.Price: Free tier available. Premium plan for $5.99/month or $59.99/year. 2. Raindrop.io Founded in 2013, Raindrop.io began as a modern bookmarking tool and has steadily evolved into a robust cross-platform content manager. It’s especially popular among power users who want to go a bit beyond what plain read-it-later apps purport to offer. Raindrop.io supports not just articles but also images, videos, and PDFs. It supports collaboration and public page creation and offers a browser web clipper. It can also bidirectionally integrate and sync bookmarks from RSS, Alfred, Dropbox, Evernote, and more. Availability: iOS, iPadOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, web.Price: Free tier available. Premium plan for $3/month or $28/year. 3. Readwise Reader Reader is a recent addition from the team behind Readwise, a service built to help users resurface and retain highlights from books, articles, and notes. Unlike most read-it-later apps, Reader is designed for longer reads and overall knowledge management. It imports highlights from Pocket, Instapaper, Kindle, and also handles PDFs, RSS feeds, newsletters, and even YouTube transcripts. Notes and highlights sync back to Readwise, which makes it a great fit for researchers or anyone who wants to remember what they read. Availability: iOS, iPadOS, macOS (via web app), Android, web.Price: Included with Readwise subscription. $12.99/month or $119.88/year after free trial. 4. Matter Matter was launched in 2021 and set out to become a premium reading destination by unifying newsletters, articles, and other long-form content in one app. It’s visually refined and built with mobile-first readers in mind. Matter supports text highlighting, audio narration of saved content, and integrations with tools like Notion and Readwise. It also lets you follow individual writers, turning your inbox into a curated reading feed. Pocket users who relied on newsletter subscriptions will find Matter especially appealing. Availability: iOS, iPadOS, webPrice: Free tier available. Premium plan for $14.99/month or $77.99/year 5. GoodLinks GoodLinks is a privacy-first read-it-later app made exclusively for Apple platforms. Built by indie developer Ngoc Luu, it aims to provide a “clean reading experience”, removing clutter from pages and focusing on the content. The app also really focuses on privacy, as it doesn’t sync to third-party services or analyze your reading habits. Everything stays local, or in your iCloud. You can tag articles, read offline, and use shortcuts on iOS and macOS. Availability: iOS, iPadOS, macOSPrice: One-time purchase of $9.99, with IAP for tipping and an “Annual Feature Upgrade”. In the end, there is no perfect read-it-later app. Pocket wasn’t perfect, just as Instapaper isn’t. The work is finding the app that better aligns with your internal wiring (and hoping it doesn’t go away). If you have other tips, apps, or platforms that might be good Pocket replacements, let’s hear them in the comments.
