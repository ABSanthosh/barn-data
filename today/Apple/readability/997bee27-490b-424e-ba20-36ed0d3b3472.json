  "description": "Macworld If you’re already thinking about all the outdoor activities you’re going to do this summer, you’re going to need an Apple Watch to keep track of it all. And today’s a great time to buy one: Amazon is selling the Apple Watch Series 10 at its very best price of $299, a hefty $100 discount, and the best price we’ve ever seen. The Apple Watch Series 10 is a gorgeous smartwatch that looks as good on a night out as it does with workout gear. Not only do we love how it looks, but when we reviewed it, we gave it a 4.5-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, praising its easy-to-read display and faster charging. The device is crack-resistant and has an IP6X dust resistance and will even survive dives of up to 50 meters, so it’ll be ready no matter what you do this summer. And the 18 hours of battery life is enough to get through it all and a quick charge before bed will let you track sleep all night too. Speaking of sleep tracking, the Apple Watch Series 10 comes with a truckload of features and sensors to track your fitness activity, run ECGs, and keep an eye on your heart rate and rhythm. The smartwatch comes with Fall Detection, knows if you’ve been in a car crash, and if you get into trouble, the emergency SOS feature lets you quickly call for help. So stop dreaming about summer and get yourself the Apple Watch Series 10 for $299 while this deal is still hot. It's time to save 25% on the Apple Watch Series 10Buy now at Amazon",
