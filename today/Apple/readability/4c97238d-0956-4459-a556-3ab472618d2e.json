  "text": "Applite is a powerful free and open source MacOS application for streamlining the installation, updating, and management of third party apps using the Homebrew cask feature, without ever having to use the Terminal. Presented in an easy to use simple graphical interface, Applite is sort of like a third-party App Store that makes using Homebrew casks easy even for the non-technical user. You’ll still need to have Homebrew installed on the Mac in order to use Applite, but you won’t need to use the command line to install or manage any application through Applite. Grab Applite free from the developer hereApplite GitHub page) Once Applite is installed on the Mac (it will offer to install Homebrew for you if you don’t have that installed already), you can then browse through the available apps and install or update any of them with a single click. This can make setting up a new Mac super easy and quite fast, since you won’t have to hunt around the web for dozens of different apps to install, many of the necessities and essentials for common workflows are accessible right away in Applite. Need to quickly install Chrome, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, The Unarchiver, Slack, and a clipboard manager as fast as possible? Applite can do that for you. You’ll find apps categorized into browsers, communication, productivity, office tools, menu bar, utilities, create tools, media, developer tools, IDE’s, terminals, virtualization, gaming, VPN, and password manager, as well as sections for installing updates, managing installed apps (and therefore uninstalling them too), and managing Homebrew itself. Applite is basically a simple and easy to use GUI front-end to Homebrew’s cask feature, which allows you to install GUI apps from the command line. Applite is not intending to be a GUI front-end to the Homebrew command line tool, so if you were expecting that or hoping for that, this isn’t the solution for you. But, if you use Homebrew anyway, and you enjoy the cask feature, or if you’d just like an easy way to install and manage many common Mac applications that are available outside of the Mac App Store, check out Applite, it’s free, easy to use, quite powerful, and a valuable tool for your MacOS workflow.",
