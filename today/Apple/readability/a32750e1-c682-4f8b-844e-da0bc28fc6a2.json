  "text": "The popular Blackmagic Camera app has just received a huge update with multiple new features for iOS users. The new version brings support for the iPhone 16’s Camera Control, as well as more bitrate options and many other improvements. Read on as we detail everything that’s new in Blackmagic Camera. What’s new with Blackmagic Camera 2.1 for iPhone Following the release of Blackmagic Camera 2.0 in August with native support for iPad, the app has just been updated to version 2.1. One of the most notable changes in today’s update is Camera Control support for iPhone 16 models. Users can control zoom, exposure, focus, ISO, and more just by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. In addition, it’s now possible to open the app from Control Center, Lock Screen, or using Camera Control. Blackmagic Camera 2.1 also introduces support for DockKit-compatible iPhone accessories, such as the Insta360 Flow Pro gimbal. Another welcome change is the addition of a higher bitrate option for recording videos using the H.264 and H.265 codecs. This means that users can benefit from higher bitrates and even Log recordings without having to rely on the ProRes codec, which results in larger files. Here’s the full list of changes coming with the update: Support for launching and recording using the Camera Control on iPhone 16. Ability to control zoom, exposure bias, focus, ISO and other settings using Camera Control on iPhone 16. Ability to launch the app from Control Center, the Lock Screen, or the Camera Control button. Support for logging in to Blackmagic Cloud organization accounts. Display time-lapse frequency and duration timecode on the overlay during recording. Off-speed recording now includes audio. Improved overlays to indicate when off-speed mode is active. Option to limit HDMI monitoring to HD resolution. HDMI monitoring preview now remains active on all pages. Bit rate options when recording to H.264 and H.265 codecs. Support for DockKit compatible iPhone accessories. Improved timecode accuracy for Tentacle sync devices. Improved performance for recording high speed ProRes 4K clips on iPhone 16 Pro models. Improved remote monitoring performance when recording with proxies. Switching to front facing camera when recording now captures with the correct orientation. General performance and stability improvements. Try it now For those unfamiliar, the app is developed by the same company behind the popular video editing software DaVinci Resolve. Blackmagic Camera is available for free on the App Store. It requires an iPhone XR or later running iOS 17 or later. Keep in mind that some features (such as the Log color profile) are only available for specific iPhone models due to hardware limitations. Of course, since the app was developed by Blackmagic, it integrates seamlessly with DaVinci Resolve and Blackmagic Cloud, so you can sync your videos directly with these apps.
