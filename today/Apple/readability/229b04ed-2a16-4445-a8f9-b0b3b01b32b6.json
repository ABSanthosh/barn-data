  "text": "Over four years after Epic broke App Store rules and sparked a billion-dollar battle, \"Fortnite\" is finally back on iPhone and iPad. For those who have missed playing Fortnite on iPhone and iPad, today's your lucky day: it's back on the App Store. After successfully passing its review in early May, the game has been cleared by Apple and made available to players once more. It's been four years since Fortnite was last available on iOS. In the summer of 2020, Epic willingly violated Apple's App Store rules by allowing players the option to purchase Fortnite's in-game currency directly from Epic. The move was done to avoid the 30% fee Apple charged on in-app purchases. Of course, it was also a publicity stunt. This violation not only resulted in the game's removal from the App Store, it kicked off a lengthy legal battle between the two tech giants. The lawsuit concluded with Epic being found guilty of violations, but it was also determined that Apple's anti-steering provisions in the App Store were not entirely legal. Epic may have claimed a moral victory, but it's still unclear who actually won. What is clear is that the fight emptied more than $1 billion from Epic's coffers. Buying V-Bucks in \"Fortnite\"After installing the game and signing in, you're greeted with the main Fortnite page to join a game. Going to the V-Bucks menu shows a few simple choices you'd expect from a game with its own currency, like bonus coins for spending more. Epic isn't pushy about its external linkIt isn't until you choose an amount and tap purchase that you're faced with a decision. Both buttons for the Epic Games external link and the in-app purchase are identical in size. There are no warnings about Epic owing Apple money or charging more for in-app purchase. It seems the only incentive offered is a bonus 20% in Epic Rewards by choosing the external link. Get Fortnite as a free download from the App Store.",
