  "description": "Macworld macOS 15, best known as macOS Sequoia, is named after the California National Park and, more specifically, the world’s largest trees. Among the new features that arrived on Macs with Sequoia in September 2024 were iPhone mirroring, which puts your iPhone screen on your Mac’s display and lets you interact with it via your mouse and keyboard, a new Video conferencing presenter preview, and a new Password app to manage passwords. Subsequent updates have brought Apple Intelligence, which is Apple’s name for its AI features. macOS Sequoia has been available for compatible Macs since September 2024, but further updates to Sequoia have arrived almost monthly since. The latest major update is macOS 15.5, which arrived on Monday, May 12. A beta for macOS Sequoia 15.6 was released on June 16. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about macOS 15 Sequoia, including how to download it. We also link to various tutorials about how to use the new features. Some features will only work on Macs with an M-series chip, including several Apple Intelligence features that will offer help with writing, creating images, editing photos, and more. If you want to know what the new features are, whether you will be able to enjoy all of them, and if your Mac is even compatible with Sequoia, read on. We are also tracking any problems, the latest updates, and what’s coming in the next update. You can also find information below about Apple’s beta testing program. In this article, we also discuss what’s new in the developer and public beta as Apple continues work on the development of the Sequoia operating system, although soon Apple’s beta testers will begin work on the next version of macOS, we have details of the upcoming macOS 26 in a separate article. Update July 21: macOS Sequoia 15.6 release candidate is now available. macOS Sequoia: Latest version macOS 15.5: May 12, 2025 On May 12, Apple released macOS Sequoia 15.5. It includes an update to Screen Time, where a notification appears when a passcode is used on a child’s device. The update also include bug fixes and security patches. On April 16, Apple released macOS Sequoia 15.4.1. This update contained security patches. Apple released macOS 15.4 on March 31, 2025.

Apple released the macOS 15.3.1 update on February 10. The update does not include any detailed release notes and the Apple security release webpage states that “this update has no published CVE entries,” which means that it does not address any security issues filed with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. However, the update’s description states that it “provides important security fixes and is recommended for all users.” iOS 18.3.1 was issued on the same day and addressed an “extremely sophisticated” security flaw relating to “A physical attack [that] may disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device”, according to Apple. Apple revealed that this attack may have been used against targeted individuals. On January 27, Apple released macOS 15.3. It offers Gemoji support, updates to the Calculator and Image Playground apps, and tweaks to the Notification summaries. It also includes bus fixes and security patches. This update also enables Apple Intelligence by default. Apple released macOS 15.2 on December 11. It has a slew of Apple Intelligence updates including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration, advanced Writing Tools, and more. Additionally, there are a few tweaks and bug fixes, and various performance improvements and security updates. Version 15.2 also brought Apple Intelligence features to the U.K. and some other locations, although those features still aren’t available in the E.U. The update also included a fix for a System Integrity Protection vulnerability. macOS 15.1.1 arrived in early December as an ’emergency update’ necessary to patch flaws in JavaScript and WebKit that Apple says “may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” There is no release for Macs running macOS Sonoma 14.7.1 or Ventura 13.7.1, yet, but that update is likely to come soon. macOS 15.1 arrived on October 28. This major update brings the first raft of Apple Intelligence features to Macs with the M-series chip. Initially Apple Intelligence features were only available in the U.S. but they arrived in some other locations with macOS 15.2. macOS 15.0.1 was released on October 3, 2024. It did not contain new features, but it did include two important bug fixes. One bug fix corrected the error that led Messages to quit when replying to a message that shared an Apple Watch face. The other fix was for compatibility with third-party security software. When was macOS Sequoia released? Monday, September 16, 2024 Apple released macOS Sequoia to the public earlier than usual, alongside iOS 18 on Monday, September 16. iOS 18, watchOS and iPadOS 18 were released at the same time.

What was new in macOS Sequoia 15.5? Release date: May 12, 2025 Sequoia 15.5 was a minor update with some bug fixes but few significant updates, perhaps a sign that Apple is slowing development of Sequoia now it is moving on to a new version of macOS.

Apple Intelligence still isn’t available in the E.U. due to regulatory problems. What was new in macOS Sequoia 15.1 Screenshot Foundry macOS Sequoia 15.1 includes a number of new AI features that work on M-series Macs, although only to those in U.S., or with their system set to U.S. Outside the U.S. it was necessary to wait for Sequoia 15.2 for Apple Intelligence features to arrive (and even then only in certain locations). Writing Tools – offering spelling and grammar support and helping you edit or summarize text. These features can be used around the operating system. Siri – new design and Type To Siri. (Type to Siri isn’t a new feature, but Apple’s making it more obvious for those of us who hate talking to Siri). Siri will be better at maintaining context while you ask related questions.

Read more here: Hold off on updating to macOS Sequoia if you’re using cybersecurity tools. CrowdStrike referenced “changes in the network stack” in an alert sent to its customers and has held off on support for the new OS. ESET indicated that there is a problem is with ESET Cyber Security version 6, an older version that “will be End of Life soon.” Firefox apparently had firewall-related issues with Sequoia. Messages could quit if a message including an Apple Watch face was replied to (fixed in macOS 15.0.1) Compatibility with third-party security software was addressed in macOS 15.0.

Read: How to downgrade macOS Sequoia to Sonoma macOS Sequoia Beta: Latest developer and public betas Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July 2024 and will continue into 2025 as Apple adds more new features to macOS Sequoia. If you want to install the beta on your Mac, check out our guide to how to install the Mac beta. Sequoia beta 15.2.Foundry If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny. Anyone can sign up for the Public Beta, which should be more stable than the developer beta, but it may still be unstable. By nature, beta software is not as stable as the final version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed. Once registered, when you go to System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately, including details of how to get a free developer account. If you want to install the beta, follow our macOS beta installation guide. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove macOS beta. The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases macOS Sequoia to the general public as Apple develops new features unavailable at launch. Read How to join Apple’s beta program for more advice. macOS Sequoia compatibility: Which Macs can run macOS 15? Screenshot Foundry The following Macs get support for macOS 15. iMac from 2019 and later Mac Pro from 2019 and later iMac Pro from 2017 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from 2020 and later Mac mini from 2018 and later MacBook Pro from 2018 and later There are two 13-inch MacBook Air models from 2018 and 2019 running Sonoma that won’t be able to install Sequoia. So if your MacBook Air was purchased before 2020 you are out of luck. The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it would continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but the last generation of Intel Macs remains on the macOS 15 compatibility list with a few Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia. However, only Macs with an M1, M2, or M3-series chip will support the new AI features referred to as “Apple Intelligence.” That includes the following: iMac from 2021 and later Mac Pro from 2023 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from late 2020 and later Mac mini from late 2020 and later MacBook Pro from late 2020 and later If your Mac can’t be updated to Sequoia that doesn’t mean you are completely abandoned by Apple. Apple will provide security updates for some Macs that don’t run macOS 15. Generally, Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: How long does Apple support Macs? On average, Macs get 6.6 years of macOS updates. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our macOS compatibility list. macOS Sequoia: Should I install Sequoia? As long as your Mac can run it, we recommend updating to Sequoia. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough. We address how macOS Sequoia compares to Sonoma? in a separate article. We also run through 6 reasons why you need to upgrade to macOS Sequoia. However, it’s wise to wait a week or so for the inevitable issues with the early release to be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets out into the wide Mac world. It’s also wise to wait because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. Refer to the problems and bugs section above to see if any of the identified issues might affect you. macOS Sequoia: How to install Installing macOS Sequoia is a breeze. Open System Settings and go to General \u003e Software Update; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our macOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. However, if you do encounter problems the following may be useful: How to install macOS Sequoia on your Mac How to get your Mac ready for macOS Sequoia How to fix macOS installation problems macOS Sequoia: All the features in macOS Sequoia Many new features arrived in macOS 14 Sonoma in 2023 including changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI-related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, some AI improvements are coming alongside iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. iPhone mirroring iPhone mirroring is a new development of Continuity. Continuity is a feature that has existed on Macs for a number of years that means you can use your Mac together with other devices in a seamless way, making cut and paste, screen sharing and mouse and keyboard sharing possible across devices. With the new ability to mirror an iPhone on a Mac’s display, it will be possible for a Mac to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. This way a user will be able to control their iPhone from their Mac, using the keyboard and mouse to interact. Drag and drop between the Mac and iPhone will also be possible. Users can also mirror the iPhone in a window on the Mac. It will also be possible to launch their iPhone apps via their Mac. Any audio from the iPhone will play through the Mac’s speakers. During any manipulation of the iPhone via the Mac, the iPhone will remain locked so nobody can see what is being done. It will also be possible to use the phone normally while it is connected to the Mac. Users will also be able to receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. These can be interacted with even when the iPhone isn’t nearby. Click on a notification and be taken into the app on your iPhone via the Mac’s display. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia Apple Window Tiling macOS Sequoia will bring a new, neater, way to arrange windows. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen it will show a place on the desktop that you can slot that window into. This will make it easy to quickly arrange tiles side-by-side so that more apps are in view. There will be new keyboard and menu shortcuts to help users organize tiles even faster. Read: Why you don’t want to ditch your tiling window manager just yet and How to stop macOS Sequoia from resizing windows to fill your screen for when you get frustrated because macOS keeps changing the window size and you don’t know why! Apple Video conferencing A new presenter preview will show users what they’re about to share before they share it. This feature will work with Zoom and other apps, as well as FaceTime. It will also be possible to apply built-in backgrounds with color gradients and wallpapers. Users will also be able to upload their photos. These Background replacements can be applied in various video calling apps, even mid-call. Apple Safari 18 Safari 18 will include several new features including a new Highlights feature which will help users discover information. The Reader feature is also getting a redesign to minimize distractions when you are reading an article. Joining the more streamlined version of the article that can already be accessed, users will see a summary and a table of contents for longer articles. If there is a video on the page it will be placed front and center and the user will have access to playback controls and picture-in-picture playback will also be possible. Other rumored features included a “Web Eraser,” and a new page controls menu. An update in 2025 is also said to be bringing an AI enhancement to Visual Lookup not just in Safari, but throughout the OS, although we are awaiting confirmation. Read: How to use Distraction Control to remove ads and This new Safari feature lets you snap away annoying ads. Apple New Passwords app Apple is bringing the iCloud Keychain into the 21st century. Apple says the new Passwords app will make it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. It will seamlessly syncs between both Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app. Apple Calculator It had been rumored that Apple is working on a new Calculator app. It may be redesigned to resemble the iOS version, with new features including a history tape, revamped conversions, and a resizable window. Apple did reveal that it will be possible to see previous calculations with a history feature. Calendar and Reminders The Calendar app will allow users to manage Reminders. Users will be able to view events and tasks from Reminders in the Calendar. An updated Month View will also be available and both apps will see UI changes. Other new features iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Installing apps – Apple is removing the double free space requirement to download and install an app. Read: macOS Sequoia makes it easier to install large apps. Security \u0026 Privacy – The beta indicates that macOS Sequoia will require regular permission checks when using certain apps. Gaming improvements In 2023 Apple introduced the Game Porting Toolkit to help developers bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever. Now Game Porting Toolkit 2 adds the most-requested capabilities from game developers. In addition, improvements to Game Mode on the Mac will unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup. Apple proudly shared details of several gaming titles that will be coming to the Mac, including: Assassin’s Creed Shadows Control Ultimate Edition Frostpunk 2 Palworld RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard RESIDENT EVIL 2 RoboCop: Rogue City Sniper Elite 4, Ubisoft Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown World of Warcraft: The War Within (coming later this year). Wuthering Waves Apple noted that they are “leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup” and that they are “taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.” Personalized Spatial Audio will result in significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Apple Intelligence features Several reports over the past few months have indicated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Those reports weren’t wrong. Apple’s new personal intelligence system is coming to Mac, iPhone, and iPad with macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by Macs with an M-series chip though, so Intel Macs will not offer these new features. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it Writing Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing-focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Apple Images New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground, users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. Next version of macOS Since Apple stopped using the names of jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several other place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia. But it’s anyone guess which Californian location macOS 16 will be named after. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to macOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS: macOS 15 Sequoia: September 16, 2024 macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023 macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022 macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021 macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020 macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019 macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018",

Image Wand – uses Apple’s image generation tools to create an image and add as context to a note. ChatGPT integration – use ChatGPT with Siri. Mail – AI-powered auto-categories to help manage your Inbox. macOS Sequoia 15.2 brought Apple Intelligence features to the U.K., Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. Apple Intelligence still isn’t available in the E.U. due to regulatory problems. What was new in macOS Sequoia 15.1 Screenshot Foundry macOS Sequoia 15.1 includes a number of new AI features that work on M-series Macs, although only to those in U.S., or with their system set to U.S. Outside the U.S. it was necessary to wait for Sequoia 15.2 for Apple Intelligence features to arrive (and even then only in certain locations). Writing Tools – offering spelling and grammar support and helping you edit or summarize text. These features can be used around the operating system. Siri – new design and Type To Siri. (Type to Siri isn’t a new feature, but Apple’s making it more obvious for those of us who hate talking to Siri). Siri will be better at maintaining context while you ask related questions. Reduce Interruptions – a new AI Focus Mode that will filter out unimportant notifications. Smart Reply – you’ll be able to use these in Messages and Mail. Photos – Memory Movie will create slideshows based on a text description. You can also use a Clean Up tool to remove unwanted elements of a photo. Improvements to photo search. Summaries – Safari will be able to summarize articles. iPhone Mirroring – Drag files from iPhone to Mac and back.

Read more here: Hold off on updating to macOS Sequoia if you’re using cybersecurity tools. CrowdStrike referenced “changes in the network stack” in an alert sent to its customers and has held off on support for the new OS. ESET indicated that there is a problem is with ESET Cyber Security version 6, an older version that “will be End of Life soon.” Firefox apparently had firewall-related issues with Sequoia. Messages could quit if a message including an Apple Watch face was replied to (fixed in macOS 15.0.1) Compatibility with third-party security software was addressed in macOS 15.0. Resizing windows is a new feature in macOS Sequoia but it can get a little annoying. Read: How to stop macOS Sequoia from resizing windows to fill your screen. Having problems with Sequoia? Read: How to downgrade macOS Sequoia to Sonoma macOS Sequoia Beta: Latest developer and public betas Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July 2024 and will continue into 2025 as Apple adds more new features to macOS Sequoia. If you want to install the beta on your Mac, check out our guide to how to install the Mac beta. Sequoia beta 15.2.Foundry If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. Since June 2023 Apple has opened the beta to all registered developers–so now everyone can get the earliest possible access to the macOS beta without paying a penny. Anyone can sign up for the Public Beta, which should be more stable than the developer beta, but it may still be unstable. By nature, beta software is not as stable as the final version–features may be implemented and then withdrawn, or they may not work properly, UI can change, and third-party app compatibility isn’t guaranteed. Once registered, when you go to System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running. For example, if you want to install the developer beta select macOS 15 Public Beta, alternatively, if it’s the public beta you want, select macOS 15 Public Beta. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately, including details of how to get a free developer account. If you want to install the beta, follow our macOS beta installation guide. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove macOS beta. The beta testing will continue even after Apple releases macOS Sequoia to the general public as Apple develops new features unavailable at launch. Read How to join Apple’s beta program for more advice. macOS Sequoia compatibility: Which Macs can run macOS 15? Screenshot Foundry The following Macs get support for macOS 15. iMac from 2019 and later Mac Pro from 2019 and later iMac Pro from 2017 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from 2020 and later Mac mini from 2018 and later MacBook Pro from 2018 and later There are two 13-inch MacBook Air models from 2018 and 2019 running Sonoma that won’t be able to install Sequoia. So if your MacBook Air was purchased before 2020 you are out of luck. The compatibility list is becoming a pressing concern for users of Intel Macs. After Apple introduced its M-series Macs, the company said it would continue to support Intel Macs for several years, but it did not offer specifics. The clock is ticking on Intel Macs, but the last generation of Intel Macs remains on the macOS 15 compatibility list with a few Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia. However, only Macs with an M1, M2, or M3-series chip will support the new AI features referred to as “Apple Intelligence.” That includes the following: iMac from 2021 and later Mac Pro from 2023 Mac Studio from 2022 and later MacBook Air from late 2020 and later Mac mini from late 2020 and later MacBook Pro from late 2020 and later If your Mac can’t be updated to Sequoia that doesn’t mean you are completely abandoned by Apple. Apple will provide security updates for some Macs that don’t run macOS 15. Generally, Apple provides software updates for the past two versions of macOS. See: How long does Apple support Macs? On average, Macs get 6.6 years of macOS updates. To find out which version of macOS and older Mac can run take a look at our macOS compatibility list. macOS Sequoia: Should I install Sequoia? As long as your Mac can run it, we recommend updating to Sequoia. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough. We address how macOS Sequoia compares to Sonoma? in a separate article. We also run through 6 reasons why you need to upgrade to macOS Sequoia. However, it’s wise to wait a week or so for the inevitable issues with the early release to be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets out into the wide Mac world. It’s also wise to wait because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. Refer to the problems and bugs section above to see if any of the identified issues might affect you. macOS Sequoia: How to install Installing macOS Sequoia is a breeze. Open System Settings and go to General \u003e Software Update; macOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our macOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. However, if you do encounter problems the following may be useful: How to install macOS Sequoia on your Mac How to get your Mac ready for macOS Sequoia How to fix macOS installation problems macOS Sequoia: All the features in macOS Sequoia Many new features arrived in macOS 14 Sonoma in 2023 including changes to Widgets, a new Game Mode, the ability to easily turn web pages into web apps, and fun additions to video conferencing apps. Rumors suggested that there wouldn’t be many new features in macOS 15, with AI-related improvements in iOS 18 taking most of the development focus. However, some AI improvements are coming alongside iPhone mirroring on your Mac display, a new Presenter Preview for video conferencing apps, and Game Porting Toolkit 2 for porting games between Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Apple has announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. Not all the new features will be available at launch though. Some new features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. iPhone mirroring iPhone mirroring is a new development of Continuity. Continuity is a feature that has existed on Macs for a number of years that means you can use your Mac together with other devices in a seamless way, making cut and paste, screen sharing and mouse and keyboard sharing possible across devices. With the new ability to mirror an iPhone on a Mac’s display, it will be possible for a Mac to connect to an iPhone and display the iPhone screen on the Mac’s display. This way a user will be able to control their iPhone from their Mac, using the keyboard and mouse to interact. Drag and drop between the Mac and iPhone will also be possible. Users can also mirror the iPhone in a window on the Mac. It will also be possible to launch their iPhone apps via their Mac. Any audio from the iPhone will play through the Mac’s speakers. During any manipulation of the iPhone via the Mac, the iPhone will remain locked so nobody can see what is being done. It will also be possible to use the phone normally while it is connected to the Mac. Users will also be able to receive iPhone notifications on a Mac. They will appear alongside Mac notifications. These can be interacted with even when the iPhone isn’t nearby. Click on a notification and be taken into the app on your iPhone via the Mac’s display. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia Apple Window Tiling macOS Sequoia will bring a new, neater, way to arrange windows. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen it will show a place on the desktop that you can slot that window into. This will make it easy to quickly arrange tiles side-by-side so that more apps are in view. There will be new keyboard and menu shortcuts to help users organize tiles even faster. Read: Why you don’t want to ditch your tiling window manager just yet and How to stop macOS Sequoia from resizing windows to fill your screen for when you get frustrated because macOS keeps changing the window size and you don’t know why! Apple Video conferencing A new presenter preview will show users what they’re about to share before they share it. This feature will work with Zoom and other apps, as well as FaceTime. It will also be possible to apply built-in backgrounds with color gradients and wallpapers. Users will also be able to upload their photos. These Background replacements can be applied in various video calling apps, even mid-call. Apple Safari 18 Safari 18 will include several new features including a new Highlights feature which will help users discover information. The Reader feature is also getting a redesign to minimize distractions when you are reading an article. Joining the more streamlined version of the article that can already be accessed, users will see a summary and a table of contents for longer articles. If there is a video on the page it will be placed front and center and the user will have access to playback controls and picture-in-picture playback will also be possible. Other rumored features included a “Web Eraser,” and a new page controls menu. An update in 2025 is also said to be bringing an AI enhancement to Visual Lookup not just in Safari, but throughout the OS, although we are awaiting confirmation. Read: How to use Distraction Control to remove ads and This new Safari feature lets you snap away annoying ads. Apple New Passwords app Apple is bringing the iCloud Keychain into the 21st century. Apple says the new Passwords app will make it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. It will seamlessly syncs between both Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app. Apple Calculator It had been rumored that Apple is working on a new Calculator app. It may be redesigned to resemble the iOS version, with new features including a history tape, revamped conversions, and a resizable window. Apple did reveal that it will be possible to see previous calculations with a history feature. Calendar and Reminders The Calendar app will allow users to manage Reminders. Users will be able to view events and tasks from Reminders in the Calendar. An updated Month View will also be available and both apps will see UI changes. Other new features iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Installing apps – Apple is removing the double free space requirement to download and install an app. Read: macOS Sequoia makes it easier to install large apps. Security \u0026 Privacy – The beta indicates that macOS Sequoia will require regular permission checks when using certain apps. Gaming improvements In 2023 Apple introduced the Game Porting Toolkit to help developers bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever. Now Game Porting Toolkit 2 adds the most-requested capabilities from game developers. In addition, improvements to Game Mode on the Mac will unlock smoother frame rates, and advanced power management features boost performance across the Mac lineup. Apple proudly shared details of several gaming titles that will be coming to the Mac, including: Assassin’s Creed Shadows Control Ultimate Edition Frostpunk 2 Palworld RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard RESIDENT EVIL 2 RoboCop: Rogue City Sniper Elite 4, Ubisoft Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown World of Warcraft: The War Within (coming later this year). Wuthering Waves Apple noted that they are “leveraging powerful software technologies like MetalFX Upscaling to accelerate performance and deliver high-quality visuals across the Mac lineup” and that they are “taking advantage of the latest M3 family of chips to deliver breathtaking visuals with ray tracing.” Personalized Spatial Audio will result in significantly reduced audio latency with AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Apple Intelligence features Several reports over the past few months have indicated that Apple is doing a lot of work towards AI, and that generative AI (using AI to create content) will have a big role in macOS. Those reports weren’t wrong. Apple’s new personal intelligence system is coming to Mac, iPhone, and iPad with macOS Sequoia, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by Macs with an M-series chip though, so Intel Macs will not offer these new features. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it Writing Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing-focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Apple Images New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground, users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is integrated into Siri. Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. Next version of macOS Since Apple stopped using the names of jungle cats with macOS 10.9 Mavericks, it’s used California places to identify its annual OS updates. The last several years have been Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina. Apple has trademarked several other place names, including Condor, Mammoth, Redwood, and Sequoia. But it’s anyone guess which Californian location macOS 16 will be named after. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to macOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. In the recent past, the release has come several weeks after the new version of iOS ships. Here are the release dates for the previous five versions of macOS: macOS 15 Sequoia: September 16, 2024 macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023 macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022 macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021 macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020 macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019 macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018",
