This year, the company picked a collection of apps and games from 17 developers across 12 categories, including new categories for the Vision Pro App and Game of the Year. Apple CEO Tim Cook had this to say about this year’s winning developers: We are thrilled to honor this impressive group of developers who are harnessing the power of Apple devices and technology to deliver experiences that enrich the lives of users and have a profound impact on their communities. The remarkable achievements of this year’s winners demonstrate the incredible ingenuity that can be unlocked through apps. This year’s App Store Award winners are: Apps iPhone App of the Year: Kino, from Lux Optics, Inc.  iPad App of the Year: Moises, from Moises Systems, Inc.  Mac App of the Year: Adobe Lightroom, from Adobe, Inc.  Apple Vision Pro App of the Year: What If…? An Immersive Story, from Disney Apple Watch App of the Year: Lumy, from Raja V. Apple TV App of the Year: F1 TV, from Formula One Digital Media Limited Games iPhone Game of the Year: AFK Journey, from Farlight Games iPad Game of the Year: Squad Busters, from Supercell Mac Game of the Year: Thank Goodness You’re Here!, from Panic, Inc.  Apple Vision Pro Game of the Year: THRASHER: Arcade Odyssey, from Puddle, LLC Apple Arcade Game of the Year: Balatro+, from Playstack Ltd. Apple also honored the following Cultural Impact winners: Oko from AYES BV EF Hello from Signum International AG DailyArt from Zuzanna Stanska NYT Games from The New York Times Company The Wreck from The Pixel Hunt Do You Really Want to Know 2 from Gamtropy Co., Ltd. I had a chance to meet with the developers of three winning apps: Thrasher, Oko, and Moises. I wasn’t familiar with any of these apps before my meetings, but every one of them struck a chord with me, and I can see why Apple included them in their awards. Thrasher takes advantage of the Vision Pro’s many sensors to create a uniquely immersive visual and musical experience. Oko uses the iPhone’s cameras to help low-vision and blind users navigate busy cities safely and independently. Moises leverages AI to break down music in a way that helps musicians practice and improve their skills. They’re all very different apps, but each pushes Apple’s devices in its own way to elevate their users’ daily lives whether it’s improving their skills, helping them through their daily lives, or entertaining them during a moment of downtime. Congratulations to all of this year’s App Store Award winners. It’s always great to see developers’ hard work and contributions to Apple’s platforms recognized.
