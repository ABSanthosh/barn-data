  "text": "If you’re heading out to watch fireworks this July 4th, you might want to capture the moments with some great photos or videos of fireworks. With just a few simple tips, you’ll be snapping great fireworks photos and smooth videos with just your trusty iPhone. Turn Off Flash The camera flash may help fill in peoples features in the foreground, but for taking pics of fireworks the flash will do nothing good. Simply tap on the flash icon when shooting photos to disable this feature while you’re watching a firework show and snapping photos. Consider Live Photos Live Photos capture little videos around a photo, making them animated. This can be fun for fireworks because you can change the Live Photo effect to Loop, Bounce, or Long Exposure, depending on which looks best for any given photo taken on your iPhone. Keep the iPhone Steady Since fireworks are typically happening in low light situations at dusk or nighttime, the iPhone camera shutterspeed is slower. Basically this means that small movements can cause blurring of photos, so whenever possible keep your iPhone as steady as you can. Rest it on a stable surface, use a tripod, tuck your arms in close to your body, or even brace yourself against something solid. A steady iPhone will result in better photos. Try Slow-mo \u0026 Time-lapse for Video Shooting fireworks in slow-mo video mode offers a great way to capture some really nice intricacies of fireworks and explosions, while time-lapse video mode can be a fun way to capture an entire firework show. – Whatever you do to celebrate the 4th of July, keep these iPhone tips in mind, and you’ll be sure to capture some wonderful moments of your firework experience. Happy 4th! Credit: Above image of fireworks and an iPhone is based upon a modified version of this picture from Unsplash, which makes for a great wallpaper too if you’d like something festive.",
