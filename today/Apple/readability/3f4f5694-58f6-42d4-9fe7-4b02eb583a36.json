  "text": "Apple has enthralled the world with some pretty significant visual overhauls to the iPhone and iPad system software, featuring the all new Liquid Glass appearance style. With a new look, plus many new features, it’s no wonder that so many Apple users are curious about downloading iOS 26 beta and installing it right away. And yes, technically speaking, anyone can install the iOS 26 beta, all you need is your Apple ID registered with the free Apple Developer program. But just because it’s possible to download and install iOS 26 beta right now, that doesn’t mean you should. Why you should not install iOS 26 beta right now The initial beta versions of iOS 26 are called Developer Beta’s for a reason; they’re intended for developers. That means these early beta builds are extra buggy and intended for advanced users and developers to test their software, apps, websites, and other tech, with the latest versions of system software. The first beta builds of system software are notoriously buggy, and can have some pretty significant issues that average users would find unacceptable on their regular use iPhone or iPad. This includes everything from frequent system crashes, app crashes, app incompatibilities, device overheating, sluggish performance, reduced performance, incomplete or unrefined interface changes and tweaks, and perhaps worst of all, theoretical data loss. If you’re casual but curious, wait for iOS 26 public beta If you’re a curious user, maybe even somewhat advanced and generally comfortable with beta system software and its quirks, the move is still to wait. Specifically, wait for the iOS 26 public beta, which is coming in July. Public beta system software is further along in the beta cycle from early release developer beta system software, and therefore will be more stable, less buggy, and overall less problematic. Have a little patience, while the new iOS 26 release looks exciting, waiting just a few more weeks to run the public beta, will result in a better experience. Need stability and reliability on your iPhone or iPad? Wait until iOS 26 final in the fall If you’re like most people, and you need your iPhone or iPad to be consistently stable, reliable, and things work as intended, you should avoid running beta system software entirely. Instead, wait for iOS 26 final in the fall, which is likely to debut in September or October, assuming Apple follows their historical release cycle. No way, I’m throwing caution to the wind and installing iOS 26 beta right now! Bugs and all! If you’re committed to installing the iOS 26 beta right now, you need to expect a buggy and less stable experience on your iPhone or iPad. More importantly, you need to completley backup your iPhone or iPad to your computer with Finder or iTunes/Windows, along with backing it up to iCloud. Backups preserve your data, but also, local backups allow you to downgrade from the iOS 26 beta back to stable iOS 18 releases. Ideally, if you’re beta testing system software, especially early versions like these iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 releases are, you’ll install them onto secondary devices that are not your primary hardware. To beta, or not to beta, that is the question Whether or not you heed our advice to not install early beta system software, is entirely up to you. We wouldn’t recommend installing beta system software for the vast majority of iPhone and iPad users, but the appeal of running shiny new system software like iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, complete with new features and with new shiny icons and transparent interface elements with the Liquid Glass style, are obviously appealing. At the very least, backup your iPhone or iPad, and know what you’re getting into.",
