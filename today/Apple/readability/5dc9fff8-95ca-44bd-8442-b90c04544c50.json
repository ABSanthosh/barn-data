Starting next month, iOS 18 will introduce Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant while protecting users’ privacy and security.1 More Customization Than Ever In iOS 18, users can customize their Home Screen in exciting new ways by placing app icons and widgets to frame the wallpaper or create the ideal layout on each page. Users can also choose how the app icons and widgets are presented — light, dark, or with a colored tint — or make app icons appear larger for a new streamlined look. Control Center is redesigned to be even more flexible. Powerful groups of controls — including favorites, media playback, Home controls and connectivity, and the new controls gallery featuring options from third-party apps — can be organized so that they’re always just a swipe away. Users can also access their favorite controls from the Action button, and for the first time, users can change the controls on the Lock Screen or remove them entirely. The customizable Home Screen of iOS 18 is shown on iPhone 16 Pro. The Control Center of iOS 18 is shown on iPhone 16 Pro. The Home Screen can be customized by arranging apps and widgets in any open space, and users can choose between a light, dark, or tinted look to create the experience that is perfect for them. Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, and the new controls gallery displays the full set of available controls, including new options from third-party apps. The Biggest Photos Redesign The biggest-ever update to Photos makes it easier to find and relive special moments. The beautiful, simplified layout puts the library into a unified yet familiar view. New collections like Recent Days, People \u0026 Pets, and Trips automatically keep the library organized with on-device intelligence, so users can spend less time searching and more time enjoying their memories. Users can personalize their experience with a customizable layout that reflects what is most important to them and pin favorite collections to keep them easily accessible. Collections give users a way to browse by themes, like recent days or trips, without having to organize content into albums. Powerful Ways to Stay Connected in Messages and Phone Messages offers major updates to the ways users express themselves and stay connected. Formatting options like bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough let users better convey tone; all-new text effects bring words, phrases, and sentences to life; emoji and sticker Tapbacks give users endless ways to react in a conversation; and users can compose an iMessage to send later. For times when cellular and Wi-Fi connections aren’t available, Messages via satellite connects users to a satellite in space right from the Messages app to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS.2 When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.3 The Phone app helps users stay organized with the ability to record and transcribe live calls, making it easier to recall important details later.4 Call participants are notified before a recording begins, and transcripts are conveniently saved to the Notes app, allowing users to quickly search and review what was discussed. On iPhone 16 Pro, a group thread in Messages shows new options for Tapbacks in iOS 18. The updated RCS functionality in Messages is shown on iPhone 16 Pro. Tapbacks are redesigned and expanded to include any emoji or sticker. The Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS. Intelligent Categorization in Mail Available later this year, categorization in Mail organizes messages to help users stay on top of their inbox. The Primary category lets users focus on the messages that matter most or contain time-sensitive information. Transactions, Updates, and Promotions are grouped by sender in a new digest view that pulls together all relevant emails from a business, allowing users to quickly scan for what’s important in the moment.

Mail introduces new ways to manage an inbox with categorization that includes Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. A new digest view pulls together relevant emails from a business to help users access what’s important in the moment. Distraction-Free Browsing with Safari Safari is the world’s fastest browser, and with iOS 18, it offers even more capabilities for browsing the web.5 Highlights intelligently surface key information — like a location’s address, a summary, or more information about a movie, TV show, or song — after a webpage is loaded. The redesigned Reader brings more ways to enjoy articles with a streamlined view, a summary, and a table of contents for longer articles. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing, such as sign-in banners or content overlays within a website. The redesigned Reader in Safari of iOS 18 is shown on iPhone 16 Pro. Highlights in Safari are shown on iPhone 16 Pro. Reader in Safari has been redesigned to help users enjoy articles by including a summary and a table of contents. In Safari, a new Highlights feature surfaces key information from webpages users visit, reducing distractions. The Brand-New Passwords App Passwords is a new app built on the foundation of Keychain that makes it even easier for users to access their passwords and see all their credentials — like passwords, passcodes, and verification codes — all in one place. Passwords is backed by incredibly secure end-to-end encryption; seamlessly syncs across devices; and alerts users when a password could be easily guessed, has been used multiple times, or has appeared in a known data leak. Privacy Features Designed to Empower Users iOS 18 gives users tools to manage who can see their apps, how their contacts are shared, and how their iPhone connects to accessories. Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app, and for additional privacy, they can also hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system. In addition, iOS 18 lets users share only specific contacts with an app, and developers can offer users a more seamless and private experience when connecting third-party accessories with iPhone. The First Set of Apple Intelligence Features Available Next Month Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available next month, delivering experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them. With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. In addition, natural language can be used to search for specific photos, and search in videos gets more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips. The new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject. And in the Notes and Phone apps, users can record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points. In Mail, a user selects copy to run through the Apple Intelligence-powered Rewrite tool. In Mail, the user’s writing has been reworked to include a more professional tone using the Apple Intelligence-powered Rewrite tool. Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.

Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience. It has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPhone. Users can type to Siri at any time on iPhone, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. In addition, with Siri’s extensive product knowledge, it can now answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple devices. Siri has a new design that includes an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. With many Apple Intelligence models running entirely on device, as well as the introduction of Private Cloud Compute — which extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence — Apple Intelligence represents an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence. Additional Features In Apple Maps, users can browse thousands of hikes across U.S. national parks and easily create their own custom walking routes, which they can access offline. Users can also save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and locations to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about each spot. Game Mode enhances the gaming experience with more consistent frame rates, especially during long play sessions, and makes AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories even more responsive. Users get new ways to pay with Apple Pay online and in apps on iPhone and iPad. Starting today, eligible U.S. users will be able to redeem rewards with Discover credit cards,6 as well as apply for loans directly through Affirm, and eligible U.K. users will be able to access installments with Monzo Flex right at checkout when they use Apple Pay.7 With Tap to Cash, users can send and receive Apple Cash by simply holding their iPhone near another iPhone or Apple Watch.8 And with the new ticket experience in Apple Wallet, fans can access even more information about their events, such as venue maps, local weather forecasts, recommended Apple Music playlists, and much more.9 In the Notes app, math formulas and equations entered while typing are solved instantly. New collapsible sections and highlighting make it easier to emphasize what’s important. Calendar becomes even more helpful by showing both events and tasks from Reminders. Users can create, edit, and complete reminders right from Calendar, and the updated month view provides an overview of events and tasks at a glance. In Journal, an all-new insights view helps users keep track of their journaling goals, the ability to search and sort entries makes it easy to enjoy past memories, and a Journal widget lets users quickly start an entry from the Home Screen or Lock Screen. Time spent journaling can be saved as mindful minutes in the Health app, and users can log their state of mind right in Journal. The Home app introduces guest access, providing users with easy ways to grant guests control of locks, garage doors, and security systems; set schedules for when guests can access the home; and more. With convenient updates to the Energy category, the Home app also makes it easier for eligible users to access, understand, and make more informed decisions about their home electricity use. Emergency SOS Live Video allows users to share context through streaming video and recorded media. In the middle of an emergency call, participating emergency dispatchers can send a request for a user to share live video or media from the user’s camera roll over a secure connection, making it easier and faster to get help. Updates coming to AirPods will transform the way users take calls, respond to Siri, and immerse themselves in their favorite games with AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2. Voice Isolation helps the caller’s voice be heard in loud or windy environments, while Siri Interactions allow users to nod or shake their head to respond to Siri announcements. AirPods updates also provide the best wireless audio latency Apple has ever delivered for mobile gaming, and add Personalized Spatial Audio for all AirPods models for even more immersive gameplay. Later this fall, AirPods Pro 2 add a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Based on results from an intuitive, clinically validated Hearing Test users can take from the comfort of their own home using AirPods Pro 2 and a compatible iPhone or iPad, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a personalized hearing aid set to meet the specific needs of the user, making access to hearing assistance easier than ever at an approachable price point.10 In the Health app, Medical ID has been redesigned to make it even easier for first responders to find the most important information in an emergency. The Health app helps users better understand their data during pregnancy by making adjustments and recommendations to reflect changes in their physical and mental health. The Fitness app on iPhone now offers users the ability to customize the Summary tab, and Apple Fitness+ has been redesigned with personalized workout and meditation recommendations in For You, more powerful search, and enhanced awards for extra motivation. New accessibility features include Eye Tracking, a built-in option for navigating iPhone with just eyes; Music Haptics, a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts that enable users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; and Vehicle Motion Cues, which helps reduce motion sickness for passengers using iPhone in a moving vehicle. Accessibility features are now available for CarPlay, including Voice Control, Sound Recognition, Color Filters, and Bold Text.

Users can also access their favorite controls from the Action button, and for the first time, users can change the controls on the Lock Screen or remove them entirely.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"customization-ios-18\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-29555648b3c82da836391a67a4bd2fc7\" href=\"#gallery-29555648b3c82da836391a67a4bd2fc7\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-29555648b3c82da836391a67a4bd2fc7\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe customizable Home Screen of iOS 18 is shown on iPhone 16 Pro.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-388e48872d74b049a5cba16763c7bb27\" href=\"#gallery-388e48872d74b049a5cba16763c7bb27\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-388e48872d74b049a5cba16763c7bb27\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Control Center of iOS 18 is shown on iPhone 16 Pro.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-29555648b3c82da836391a67a4bd2fc7\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-29555648b3c82da836391a67a4bd2fc7\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:home-screen\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eThe Home Screen can be customized by arranging apps and widgets in any open space, and users can choose between a light, dark, or tinted look to create the experience that is perfect for them.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2024/09/ios-18-is-available-today-making-iphone-more-personal-and-capable-than-ever/article/Apple-iOS-18-Home-Screen-widgets-customize.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -

Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app, and for additional privacy, they can also hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system. In addition, iOS 18 lets users share only specific contacts with an app, and developers can offer users a more seamless and private experience when connecting third-party accessories with iPhone.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe First Set of Apple Intelligence Features Available Next Month\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eApple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security.

In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. In addition, natural language can be used to search for specific photos, and search in videos gets more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips. The new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject. And in the Notes and Phone apps, users can record, transcribe, and summarize audio.
