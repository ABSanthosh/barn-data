On episode 573, ‘Five Legs and Way Too Many Fingers,’ we covered a bunch of topics including: the Apple Watch faces we use and why; our feelings about Apple marketing its new iPhones by highlighting Apple Intelligence features that won’t be available for months; where we get iPhone wallpapers and how we use them; and the iPhone’s Action Button. Thanks to Mikah and Dan for having me on, which was also a chance to chat with Lex for the first time, which I enjoyed too.",
