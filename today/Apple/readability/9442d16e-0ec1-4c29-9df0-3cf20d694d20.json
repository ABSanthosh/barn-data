  "text": "Apple Watch Ultra, outside of a very nice new titanium black, hasn’t been meaningfully upgraded since 2023. But later this year that’s going to change when the Apple Watch Ultra 3 arrives. Here are three new features coming to the next-generation Apple Watch Ultra 3. High blood pressure detection New health features are one thing you can consistently expect from Apple Watch upgrades. According to Mark Gurman, this year Apple is planning to introduce high blood pressure detection: The blood-pressure feature…is designed to work in a similar way to Apple’s sleep apnea detector. It won’t give users specific readings — such as diastolic or systolic levels — but it will inform them that they may be in a state of hypertension. Gurman notes that this project has been years in the making, but it finally seems ready to launch this year. Satellite messaging sans iPhone Apple Watch Ultra has always been geared toward adventurers and explorers, despite the product gaining plenty of fans with more casual needs. With the Ultra 3, Apple will add a new capability designed especially for those who enjoy going off the grid. Messaging over satellite is coming to the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Here’s Gurman again: The technology will let smartwatch users send off-the-grid text messages via Globalstar Inc.’s fleet of satellites when they don’t have a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. iPhone users have had this technology for a few years, and it got even better with a critical iOS 18 update. The Apple Watch, however, has never gotten its own satellite connectivity. With the new Ultra 3 it will be easier than ever for users to leave their iPhone behind to truly embrace the outdoors. 5G cellular for the first time This third upgrade also focuses on connectivity. Whereas previous Apple Watch Ultra models have been limited to 4G LTE connectivity, Apple plans to bring 5G to the Ultra 3 this year. This upgrade will reportedly take the form of 5G Redcap, a less power-hungry version of 5G. Redcap can’t hit the same max speeds as your iPhone’s 5G, but it will ensure your Watch doesn’t take a big battery hit either. Apple Watch Ultra 3 features: wrap-up The new Apple Watch Ultra 3 isn’t expected to arrive until the fall, so there’s still plenty of time for additional feature leaks to happen. Perhaps we’ll get even better battery performance this time around, for example. For now at least, it sounds like Apple is doubling down on the Ultra 3 as the ultimate Watch for adventurers. What new features do you want to see in the Apple Watch Ultra 3? Let us know in the comments.
