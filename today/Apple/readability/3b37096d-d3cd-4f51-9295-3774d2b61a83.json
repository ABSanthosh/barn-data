  "text": "Fortnite, the wildly popular online action game, is back on the App Store for iPhone and iPad users to download and play. The app has returned after Apple removed the popular game roughly five years ago while Apple and Epic engaged in an expensive drawn out legal squabble, which ultimately ended up disappointing and irritating consumers, gamers, kids, and parents who spent a lot of money with in-app purchases, more than anything else. If you have any interest in the legal aspects of the Epic v Apple case (I don’t!) you can bore yourself to sleep on Wikipedia, but if you, your family, or your kids are just interested in playing the popular game, you can download it again right now from the App Store. For the unfamiliar, Fortnite is an incredibly popular online game that blends competitive action, shooting, building, and general mayhem in a large interactive environment. Up to 100 players engage in battle royale while they wander around a map that is ever-changing and full of silliness and entertainment, complete with fun cartoony graphics and a unique social component. It’s not unusual to have Fornite players jump on a game with a friend, or even group of their friends, and hang out in a digital space while they play the games, and it’s particularly popular with kids and parents for a reason. Get Fortnite from the App Store here (free to download and play) Fortnite is currently available for iPhone and iPad only, but there used to be a Mac application for the game as well, though it remains to be seen if Mac users will get to enjoy the game again on their computers. If you have a gaming console or controller nearby, don’t forget to connect your Xbox One controller to iPhone or iPad so that you can use it to control Fortnite, as external controllers work really well with the game and typically improve players performance. Fortnite is free to download and free to play, but it’s not a small download, so have at least 20GB of storage available on your iPhone or iPad (infamously it took up over 100Gb on the Mac!). It plays impressively well with a great frame rate and good graphics on the latest model iPhone and iPad devices, so as long as your device is reasonably new you should be able to enjoy the game with you, your children, your friends, your coworkers, or complete strangers. And since any free app or service is worth wondering how they monetize, in the case of Fortnite, you can purchase optional customizations within the game itself, including custom player skins (which happens to be the only way you can consistently choose your gender in the game, if you care to do so). Anyway, while Fortnite is just back again for iPhone and iPad users, and hopefully coming soon to the Mac, it has stayed available for other platforms the entire time, including Windows, Android, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and Playstation, so if you’re interested in gaming with your alternate platform friends, you can do that too. Enjoy and have some fun!",
