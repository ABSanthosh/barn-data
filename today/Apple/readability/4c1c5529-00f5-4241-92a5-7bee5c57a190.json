Here's how they fare compared against Apple's identically-priced AirPods Pro 2. The Beats Powerbeats Pro have always had a place as one of the premium earphone options on Apple's roster. However, as time pressed onward, other earphones in the Apple and Beats ranges started to overtake it with features. In Feburary 2025, Beats finally made some big changes to the Powerbeats Pro. The second-gen model offers a thinner appearance, while still catering towards the fitness crowd. The changes weren't just cosmetic, as Beats also brought Active Noise Cancellation to the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, a much-needed premium audio feature. Furthermore, Beats also added a very unique feature in personal audio: heart rate tracking. This is something that Apple has been rumored to be working on, but has actually become a reality via Beats. With the additional premium changes, the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 are now the high-end option in the Beats roster. They also directly compete against Apple's own AirPods Pro 2, with the two models priced identically at $249. This is the specification breakdown between Beats' newest offering and Apple's top of the personal audio pile.

The AirPods Pro weigh 0.19 ounces apiece, with a height of 1.22 inches, a width of 0.86 inches, and a depth of 0.94 inches. The shape of the design includes a descending stalk that dips down outside the ear, which is used for control and for optimal microphone placement for picking up the user's voice. A selection of four silicone tips are used, both to secure the AirPods Pro 2 in place in the ear canal and to create an acoustic seal. The Powerbeats Pro 2 are considerably bigger at 1.8 inches by 1.6 inches by 0.9 inches. They're also much heavier than the AirPods Pro 2 at 0.30 ounces each. However, a lot of this is mitigated by the design choice to use earhooks. Since the Powerbeats Pro 2 are intended for use in workouts and athletic situations, the earhook is used to keep the earbuds on your ear, regardless of how anchored the silicone tip is in the ear canal. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: Earhooks make the Powerbeats Pro 2 much bigger in size. This does mean that users of the Beats earbuds can use a smaller size from the selection of five for a more comfortable fit instead of going for absolute security. You do still need that acoustic seal, but you don't necessarily need to wedge the earbuds tightly into the ear canal. The new models may be big, but they're not as large as the original version. This generation has an earhook that's over 50% smaller than the first-gen model, and there's also a weight loss of about 20% too. While you have to touch, tap, and hold the stem of AirPods Pro to make adjustments, Beats goes for a more physical approach. Each earbud has a multifunction button at the Beats logo, as well as a physical rocker switch, used for volume control. This is probably a better option for people working out, since you'd most likely want the quick tactile confirmation that you're turning the volume up and down from a physical switch when in the heat of an activity. Swiping a stalk doesn't really have the same immediateness. Then there's color to consider. As usual, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 are available only in the traditional white, while Beats has four options: Jet Black, Quick Sand, Hyper Purple, and Electric Orange. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - FeaturesThe Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2 both use the H2 chip for onboard processing. That means there's an awful lot of similarities when it comes to actual features. For a start, both have Active Noise Cancellation, which is a new feature to the Powerbeats Pro. Since there's ANC, there's also Transparency, allowing users to hear the outside world, which is handy for the occasional run. Then there's Adaptive EQ, which tunes the audio to the shape of your ear using the built-in microphones. Both options can improve the sound quality when ANC is disabled. Both also have Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking, which is a neat feature for listening to music or watching movies. Lossless audio is also present here too. Then there's the Apple ecosystem integrations, which are pretty much similar across the board. One-touch pairing with Apple devices, automatic switching between devices, and audio sharing are available in both pairs of earbuds. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: Both can quickly be paired to an iPhoneHands-free Siri is also naturally available, as is Find My support, but there is a difference here. The Find My of the AirPods Pro relies on the U1 chip in the case, which means you can track down the case itself using a relatively new iPhone. There is Find My with the AirPods, but it's a more basic offering, though you can make the earbuds make individual noises for the left and right earbud. Beats does benefit from being a bit more Android-aware, as Beats does offer an app to handle many settings on that platform, while AirPods Pro handle more like typical Bluetooth earphones. That means the Beats has things like one-touch pairing over on Android, as well as Locate My Beats, listening mode switching, and also over-the-air updates, via the app. Audio quality is high across the board, with the AirPods Pro using a custom-built drive and amplifier for minimal distortion across a variety of volume levels. Meanwhile Beats uses a custom-developed dual-layer transducer along with a high-output amplifier and a new acoustically-transparent mesh that also holds back liquids and debris. When it comes to capturing audio, both sets of earphones have three per earbud, totaling six apiece. The AirPods Pro have dual beamforming microphones, as well as an inward-facing microphone to power the ANC functionality. The Powerbeats Pro have a dedicated voice microphone as well as feed-forward and feedback mics for ANC features. Both also rely on voice algorithms to improve your audio. However, if you use a newer iPhone, this audio processing can be offloaded to the smartphone instead. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - HealthBoth the AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2 have health features, but in very different areas. The AirPods Pro 2 offer a scientifically validatedHearing Test, which works with your iPhone to check for hearing loss. It also provides immediate results, which are available in the Health app. The test can even prompt you to set up the Hearing Aid function, a clinical-grade feature that can amplify specific frequencies for the user. While Beats doesn't offer this, the Powerbeats Pro 2 does go down the health route in a more literal way. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: The sensors for heart rate monitoring. Built into each Powerbeats Pro 2 earbud is a heart rate monitor, using the same light-based system as the Apple Watch, but in your ear. Shining over 100 times per second, the two earbuds can determine the user's heart rate, which can be shared with the iPhone. However, unlike the Apple Watch, which provides all-day heart rate monitoring, the Powerbeats Pro 2 does so when you're doing a workout. As soon as you start a workout in some supported iOS apps, the heart rate feature will kick in. This can be very useful in situations where you may not want an Apple Watch, but still want to keep track of your heart rate. For example, sports or activities that require you to keep your wrist free of hardware, such as weight lifting. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - Charging and CasesThe cases used by each piece of kit are quite different, in part due to the vast difference in earbud design. The MagSafe Charging Case of the AirPods Pro 2 measures 1.78 inches by 2.39 inches by 0.85 inches. Meanwhile the Beats case is considerably chunkier at 3 inches by 2.6 inches by 1.3 inches. While larger, it's still a third smaller than the previous generation. As well as bigger, the Beats case is also heavier at 2.43 ounces versus 1.79 ounces for the AirPods case. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: Beats uses a much larger case, but it also has more battery capacity. Both cases offer USB-C charging as well as wireless charging support, though the AirPods Pro case also supports MagSafe. As for battery life, the AirPods Pro 2 can last for up to six hours of listening from a single charge. It's a maximum of 20 hours including the case with ANC enable, 30 hours with ANC off. The Powerbeats Pro can last for up to 8 hours with ANC enabled from a single charge, or 10 hours with ANC off. With the charging case included, it's 36 hours with ANC in total, 45 hours with ANC off. Fast charging is available across both models, with a five minute charge resulting in an hour and a half of playback time. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - Similar, but very differentIgnoring the health-related features for the moment, the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2 offer very similar capabilities as premium earphones. The use of the H2 chip grants the Powerbeats Pro 2 the premium functionality it has missed out on for years, making it a viable high-end option once again. Obviously not everyone will want to use such large earbuds with earhooks when there's the smaller, sleeker AirPods Pro 2. The much smaller case of the AirPods Pro 2 also helps things from a portability perspective. But that size difference affords Beats the chance to outlast AirPods in usage time. Both on earbud battery life and in total with the cases. However, you also have to consider the heart rate monitoring features of the Powerbeats Pro 2. It's not all-day, but since it activates during workouts, that's the time when it actually matters. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: Beats has thoroughly modernized its Powerbeats ProIt's possible that Apple is using the Powerbeats Pro 2 as a test case, a precursor before introducing the same sort of tech in the AirPods line down the road. It's a compelling prospect, but for the moment, it makes the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 stand out in a very crowded field. If you're OK with earhooks and the large size, or you're a particularly sporty person who wants music as you work out, the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 is a very compelling offering as it is, even if you ignore the heart rate monitoring features. The AirPods Pro 2 will still be the main choice for many consumers. But now there's a very viable Beats option, and it's one that goes the extra mile. Where to buy Powerbeat Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2Powerbeats Pro retail for $249.99 and can be ordered at B\u0026H Photo and Amazon. AirPods Pro 2, meanwhile, are aggressively discounted at press time, with Amazon delivering the lowest price.

As usual, Apple\u0026#39;s AirPods Pro 2 are available only in the traditional white, while Beats has four options: Jet Black, Quick Sand, Hyper Purple, and Electric Orange. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-airpods-pro-2--features\" id=\"beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-airpods-pro-2--features\"\u003eBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - Features\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2 both use the H2 chip for onboard processing. That means there\u0026#39;s an awful lot of similarities when it comes to actual features. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a start, both have Active Noise Cancellation, which is a new feature to the Powerbeats Pro. Since there\u0026#39;s ANC, there\u0026#39;s also Transparency, allowing users to hear the outside world, which is handy for the occasional run. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026#39;s Adaptive EQ, which tunes the audio to the shape of your ear using the built-in microphones. Both options can improve the sound quality when ANC is disabled. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth also have Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking, which is a neat feature for listening to music or watching movies. Lossless audio is also present here too. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026#39;s the Apple ecosystem integrations, which are pretty much similar across the board. One-touch pairing with Apple devices, automatic switching between devices, and audio sharing are available in both pairs of earbuds. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/62604-129866-beatspowerbeatspro2-3-xl.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/62604-129866-beatspowerbeatspro2-3-xl.jpg\" alt=\"A smartphone displaying Powerbeats Pro connection notification next to an open lavender case containing purple wireless earbuds on a grid-patterned surface.\" height=\"738\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003eBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2: Both can quickly be paired to an iPhone\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHands-free \u003ca href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/siri\" title=\"Siri\" data-kpt=\"1\"\u003eSiri\u003c/a\u003e is also naturally available, as is \u003ca href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/find-my\" title=\"Find My\" data-kpt=\"1\"\u003eFind My\u003c/a\u003e support, but there is a difference here. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Find My of the AirPods Pro relies on the U1 chip in the case, which means you can track down the case itself using a relatively new \u003ca href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone\" title=\"iPhone\" data-kpt=\"1\"\u003eiPhone\u003c/a\u003e.

Meanwhile Beats uses a custom-developed dual-layer transducer along with a high-output amplifier and a new acoustically-transparent mesh that also holds back liquids and debris. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to capturing audio, both sets of earphones have three per earbud, totaling six apiece. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe AirPods Pro have dual beamforming microphones, as well as an inward-facing microphone to power the ANC functionality. The Powerbeats Pro have a dedicated voice microphone as well as feed-forward and feedback mics for ANC features. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth also rely on voice algorithms to improve your audio. However, if you use a newer iPhone, this audio processing can be offloaded to the smartphone instead. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-airpods-pro-2--health\" id=\"beats-powerbeats-pro-2-vs-airpods-pro-2--health\"\u003eBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 vs AirPods Pro 2 - Health\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth the AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2 have health features, but in very different areas. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe AirPods Pro 2 offer a scientifically validated\u003ca href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/10/24/airpods-pro-2-receive-support-for-hearing-health-features-with-new-firmware-update\"\u003eHearing Test\u003c/a\u003e, which works with your iPhone to check for hearing loss.

As soon as you start a workout in some supported \u003ca href=\"https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios\" title=\"iOS\" data-kpt=\"1\"\u003eiOS\u003c/a\u003e apps, the heart rate feature will kick in. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can be very useful in situations where you may not want an Apple Watch, but still want to keep track of your heart rate.
