  "text": "AMBER alerts are well intentioned and aim to help locate missing children, but can also be incredibly disruptive and jarring, thus many iPhone and Apple Watch users might want to disable AMBER alerts on their devices. By turning off AMBER alerts, you will avoid the sudden screeching loud alarm sound that is disruptive to whatever you’re doing, whether you’re sleeping, in a meeting, a library, at a performance, or whatever else you’re doing that you might not want to be startled by a screamingly loud alarm sound coming from the government directly to your iPhone or Apple Watch. One of the most annoying things about AMBER alerts is that they’re not always location precise, sometimes they’re off by hundreds or even thousands of miles (for example, I’ve received an AMBER alert for California while in Seattle… not that useful!). They can also be glaringly loud even if the iPhone or Apple Watch is in silent mode or muted, and so when you combine these factors, many users might want to disable these features. If you want to have a much less intrusive experience on your iPhone and Apple Watch, you might decide you wish to opt out of AMBER alerts and disable the intrusive alarm on your devices. How to Turn Off Amber Alerts on Apple Watch \u0026 iPhone Turning off this feature for both devices is really easy: Open the “Settings” app on iPhone Go to “Notificaitons” Scroll all the way to the bottom and find the Government Alerts section, and toggle the switch for AMBER Alerts to the OFF position This settings change on iPhone will disable AMBER alerts for both Apple Watch and iPhone. You do not need to make any separate changes on Apple Watch specifically, the setting adjustment on iPhone will carry over to Apple Watch. Of course you can always turn this back on again if you feel like it, by simply reversing the settings toggle you just made. The AMBER alerts feature has been around for quite a while, and though it obviously has utility, it’s also a fairly terrifying alarm sound that is startling and disruptive, leading many people to long wonder how to disable it on their personal devices. And now you know, it’s quite easy to make the adjustment on your iPhone and Apple Watch.",
