  "text": "Apple could introduce a redesigned Mac mini with M4 The iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini are all expected to receive the M4 chip later this month in the form of an online-focused event. While Apple recently announced the seventh-generation iPad mini through a simple press release, new Mac computers will reportedly be revealed via an online event later in October. In a social media post on Threads, Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says that the inventory of Mac and Mac-related products in Apple Stores is currently \"very low.\" This includes iMacs, MacBook Pros, Mac mini units, the Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad. According to the post, the iMac and MacBook Pro are expected to receive the Apple M4 chip, currently only found in the iPad Pro. The Mac Mini, meanwhile, is set to receive a \"full-scale overhaul,\" which aligns with previous rumors saying that the device would come in a smaller form factor and that it would feature a different selection of ports. \"I've seen no evidence to suggest Apple will hold a full-scale, iPhone-like event at its headquarters with press,\" Gurman said. \"Instead, I'd anticipate the announcement to be online-focused with press hands-on opportunities, not too dissimilar from Scary Fast last year.\" This would align with Apple's previous events, such as the online iPad event in May of 2024, where redesigned iPad Pro and iPad Air models were introduced. This event, much like the Scary Fast event from October 2023, had no in-person component and was streamed online through Apple's website. Select members of the press got hands-on opportunities in London and New York. Gurman has previously said that he expects new Mac computers with an M4 chip to launch on November 1, 2024, following the rumored October event.",
