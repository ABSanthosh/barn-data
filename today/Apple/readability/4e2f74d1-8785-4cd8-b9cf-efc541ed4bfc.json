  "text": "Following the release of iOS 18.4 last week, Apple has now stopped signing the iOS 18.3.2 firmware. This means that iPhone and iPad users can no longer downgrade to this version of the operating system after updating their device to a newer version. Apple blocks downgrade from iOS 18.4 to iOS 18.3.2 iOS 18.4 was released on March 31 and it’s a major update, as it enables Apple Intelligence support in more languages. The update also comes with new emoji, Priority Notifications, and Visual Intelligence for the iPhone 15 Pro models. What’s more, the iOS 18.4 update brings multiple security patches. For instance, iOS 18.4 fixes exploits that could let apps access sensitive user data. As for iOS 18.3.2, the update was released on March 11 with another important security patch. According to Apple, the iOS 18.3.2 update resolves an exploit in WebKit that allowed malicious web content to break the sandbox. It’s important to keep your device’s software up to date to protect yourself against hackers and other attacks. That’s why Apple stops signing old versions of iOS. Of course, this ends up affecting users experiencing bugs with the latest version of iOS, since they can’t go back to the previous version. Right now, the only possible downgrade is from iOS 18.5 beta to iOS 18.4. If you have a compatible iPhone or iPad, make sure you update iOS by going to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update.
