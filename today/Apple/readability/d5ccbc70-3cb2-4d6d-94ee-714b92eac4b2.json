Over the past several weeks, we've seen plenty of iPhone 17 dummy units, and they all suggest that Apple's 2025 iPhone range will be noticeably different from the current iPhone 16. The iPhone 17 Pro is expected to feature a new rear \"camera bar\" design. An all-new ultra-thin model, known as the iPhone 17 Slim or iPhone 17 Air, is expected to get the same visual treatment. Videos of dummy units keep popping up, and while they all feature variations of the same design, sometimes they offer unique or interesting details about Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 line. On Tuesday, AppleTrack published a video that compares the rumored iPhone 17 designs to the iPhone 16 range, and it gives a sense of how the new devices will feel in the hand. The long-rumored iPhone 17 Air, for instance, looks as though it will be noticeably thinner than the current iPhone 16 Pro. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro is 8.25mm thick, while the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air is rumored to have a thickness of 5.5mm or 5.6mm. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe video also showcases the port and speaker placement on the iPhone 17 Air. Interestingly, it appears as though the USB-C port of the ultra-thin iPhone won't be centered. Instead, it will be closer to the back of the phone. The iPhone 17 Air also has fewer speaker holes relative to the iPhone 16, meaning that Apple likely had to make some compromises with the design. As for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the dummies featured in the video look somewhat similar to the iPhone 16 Pro. Aside from the obvious rear \"camera bar,\" the mockups consist of a backplate and a midframe, much like the iPhone 16 Pro. This means that the dummies lack the rumored part-glass, part-metal unibody design, which would have reportedly allowed for reverse wireless charging on the iPhone 17 Pro. Though unlikely, there's always a chance these dummy units don't correspond to real-world prototypes of the iPhone 17 range. All of the dummies we've seen so far share the same design, though, as do most of the alleged leaked CAD files and 3D renders. Thus, the designs featured in Tuesday's video have earned the \"Possible\" rating.",
