  "text": "News Dystopian drama series \"Silo\" returned to Apple TV+ for its second season, and plenty of viewers tuned in. Photo: Apple TV+ Season 2 of the dystopian sci-fi mystery Silo premiered last week, and it jumped right back onto lists of the top 10 most popular streaming series maintained by two separate ratings companies. And Bad Sisters season 2 found its audience again as well. Silo is once again a towering hit for Apple TV+ Over the past five years, Apple TV+ built a reputation as a source for top-quality sci-fi. It’s the home of phenomenal successes like Severance, plus popular series like Dark Matter, Foundation and For All Mankind. Silo is one of its bigger hits. Silo is based on the bestselling books by Hugh Howey, and that name recognition gave the series a boost when it launched in 2023. And the audience stayed and grew as season one went along. Now viewers came back for season two, which premiered on November 15. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch releases a weekly list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Silo sits at No. 3 for the week of Nov. 11 to Nov. 17. And rival service Reelgood put the show at No. 5 on its equivalent list for Nov. 14 to Nov. 20. A pair of Apple TV+ series did well with audiences last week: Silo and Bad Sisters.Photo: JustWatch/Reelgood Estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Apple’s official description of the series says: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on Earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built, and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. The first two episodes of Silo season two can be enjoyed now, while the next is coming on Wednesday. Watch to catch up? Season one is ready to be binge-watched. Bad Sisters season 2 returns strong, too Silo isn’t the only hit series now on Apple TV+. The dark comedy Bad Sisters season two also premiered last week and jumped right onto a popularity chart. It sits at No. 9  on JustWatch’s list for last week. Apple TV+ says of season two: Two years after the “accidental death” of Grace’s abusive husband, the close-knit Garvey sisters may have moved on, but when past truths resurface, the ladies are thrust back into the spotlight, suspicions are at an all-time high, lies are told, secrets are revealed and the sisters are forced to work out who they can trust. The first three episodes of Bad Sisters season two can be enjoyed now, while the next is coming on Wednesday. To catch up on what Apple calls a “delicious blend of both dark comedy and thriller,” season one can be binge-watched now. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming Silo and Bad Sisters, plus many other series or films, comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes much more, of course. There’s a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
