  "description": "Macworld Everyone’s favorite non-denominational shopping holiday has arrived, again. A second Amazon Prime Day (technically called Prime Big Deals Days) runs from October 8 until midnight on Wednesday, October 9. Even with Black Friday just around the corner, we’re already seeing some excellent prices on Apple gear. The deals will be coming and going quickly, so be sure to bookmark this page so you can keep checking the latest prices. If you are hoping to find some Apple products on sale on Amazon this Prime Day then look no further. Here are the best deals on Apple products we’ve found so far on iPads, AirPods, Apple Watches, Macs, and everything else Apple sells, along with some tips for getting the best bargains: How to get Prime Day discounts Some of these discounts are available to everyone, but many items in the Amazon Prime Day Sale are only open to Prime members, so you’ll need to sign in with an active membership to purchase one of the deals. Prime memberships cost $139 / £95 / AUD$59 annually, or $14.99 / £8.99 / AUD$6.99 every month. New users can sign up for a 30-day free trial that can be canceled at any time during the trial window. You’ll also get free one or two-day delivery and access to Amazon Prime Video and all that content. The products picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. One tip: When you click on a good deal—even if it’s from a Macworld page—check that the product isn’t redirected to a refurbished model and that the current manufacturer’s price is listed, as that can make the price drop look a lot better than it is. And if a product here is listed as sold out on Amazon, we recommend checking back periodically as Amazon has been known to restock Prime Day deals throughout the sale. We’ve highlighted what we think are the best deals, but there are lots of deals below that might just be on the Apple product you want to buy, so go ahead because these will probably be the best prices (at least until Black Friday!) Prime Big Deals Days AirPods deals With Apple revamping the AirPods range in September 2024–with the introduction of the AirPods 4 and new colors and USB-C for the AirPods Max–we can expect to see some discounts on the older, now discontinued, models over Prime Day. To see if other resellers are offering better deals take a look at our Best AirPods deals roundup. U.S. AirPods Prime Day deals In the U.S. we are already seeing discounts on the new AirPods 4 at Amazon. There are also some price cuts on the older AirPods. AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case): $169 ($80 off, MSRP $249) PRIME BIG DEAL AirPods 4: $119 ($10 off, MSRP $129) AirPods (3rd gen, wired case): $130 ($39 off, MSRP was $169 DISCONTINUED) AirPods Max (USB-C): $499 ($50 off, MSRP $549) AirPods Max (Lightning): $395 ($154 off, MSRP was $549 DISCONTINUED) U.K. AirPods Prime Day deals While Amazon is yet to discount the new AirPods in the U.K. there are discounts on the older models that have been discontinued, as well as the AirPods Pro. We think that prices may drop even more before Prime Day 2 is over. We’re also tracking Beats deals, since Beats is a subsidiary of Apple. AirPods Pro (2nd generation) with MagSafe, USB-C:  £179 (£50 off, RRP £229) PRIME BIG DEAL AirPods (3rd generation) with Lightning Charging Case: £129 (£40 off, RRP was £169 DISCONTINUED) AirPods (3rd generation) with MagSafe Charging Case: £139 (£40 off, RRP was £179 DISCONTINUED) AirPods Max (2020, Lightning): £429 (£70 off, RRP was £499 DISCONTINUED) See: Best Amazon Prime Day AirPods deals. Foundry Foundry Foundry Prime Day iPhone deals If you’re in the U.S., Amazon is not the place to go to buy a new iPhone, however, in other countries, including the U.K., you will find the latest iPhones at Amazon at lower prices. The new iPhone 16 hasn’t been here long so don’t expect big discounts on those iPhones, but we may see cut-price iPhone 15 and older models – we recommend you keep an eye on this over the next few days as we expect prices to decrease further. Just check that Amazon displays the current Apple price for the older iPhones as Apple recently dropped the prices on these models. iPhone 15 (128GB): £681 (£18 off, RRP now £699 ) iPhone 15 Plus (128GB): £799 (RRP now £799) iPhone 15 Pro (128GB): £899 (£100 off; RRP was £999 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 15 Pro Max (256GB): £1,099 (£100 off; RRP was £1,199 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 14 Plus (128 GB): £599 (RRP now £699) iPhone 14 Pro (256GB): £999 (RRP was £1,209 DISCONTINUED) iPhone 13 (128GB): £499 (RRP was £599 DISCONTINUED) iPhone SE (2022): £379 (£50 off, RRP £429) For more deals see our Best Amazon Prime Day iPhone deals.
