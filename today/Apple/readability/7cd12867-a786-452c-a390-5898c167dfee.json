  "text": "OpenAI has acknowledged that its popular AI chatbot, ChatGPT, is currently experiencing an outage, making the platform inaccessible to users all over the world. This issue has also impacted the integration with Siri following the public release of iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. Users complain about ChatGPT down or not working as expected According to OpenAI, the company has identified the cause of the outage and is actively working on a fix. While they aim to restore ChatGPT’s functionality as soon as possible, no specific timeline for resolution has been provided. Many users are encountering random error messages when attempting to access the service. In some cases, users were even logged out of the app. The release of iOS 18.2 earlier today introduced new features for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, including enhanced integration with ChatGPT through Siri. This allows users to interact with OpenAI’s chatbot right from the Siri interface. However, due to the current outage, this feature is not working for some users who have updated to the latest software. Although OpenAI didn’t give any details about the outage, some speculate that today’s outage was caused by the huge influx of iOS users playing with the new ChatGPT integration. Notably, iOS users can interact with ChatGPT via Siri for free without needing an OpenAI account. Apple also lets users subscribe to ChatGPT Plus right from the Settings app on iOS so they can benefit from paid features. Is ChatGPT working for you? Let us know in the comments section below.
