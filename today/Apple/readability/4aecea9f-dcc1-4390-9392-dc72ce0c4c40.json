  "text": "Apple has released the fourth beta version of iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 for iPhone and iPad, respectively. The latest beta build is available to download and install as a software update for users who are actively enrolled in the Apple Developer beta testing program. Beta system software is generally only appropriate for advanced users to install onto secondary devices, but nonetheless it’s easy to install the iOS 26 beta right now or iPadOS 26 beta right now if you’re adventurous. The iOS 26 public beta testing program is set to begin in the near future, and it’s possible the iOS 26 dev beta 4 build will match the iOS 26 public beta 1 release build, though that remains to be seen. iOS 26 features a redesigned new interface appearance called Liquid Glass which is heavy on translucency and shininess, plus there are some new features like adding background wallpapers to Messages app, polls in Messages group chats, new features in Phone app, improvements to CarPlay, a new ringtone, new wallpaper, new Shortcuts capabilities, improvements to Apple Intelligence, and more. Meanwhile on the iPad side of things, iPadOS 26 introduces all the same iPhone iOS 26 features plus a new windowing and multitasking system, the inclusion of Preview app, and a variety of other little changes. Separately, macOS Tahoe 26 beta 4, watchOS 26 beta 4, tvOS 26 beta 4, and visionOS 26 beta 4, are also available for beta testing. How to Download \u0026 Install iOS 26 Beta 4 / iPadOS 26 Beta 4 Always backup iPhone/iPad to iCloud and to your computer before starting a system software update, but particularly with betas. A failure to backup could result in permanent data loss. Open the “Settings” app on the beta enrolled iPhone or iPad Go to “General” and then select “Software Update” Choose to “Download \u0026 Install” to begin the process of getting iOS 26 beta 4 / iPadOS 26 beta 4 update on your device The iPhone or iPad must reboot to finish installation of the 4th beta of iOS 26. Though betas are intended for advanced users, and the developer beta program is particularly aimed at advanced users who are testing apps, hardware, websites, and other on-device activity, that doesn’t mean that adventurous users can’t investigate the beta operating systems. If you’re curious and comfortable running beta system software, which is notoriously buggy and less stable than final builds, you can install iOS 26 beta onto iPhone or install iPadOS 26 beta on iPad, assuming either device is compatible with the iOS/iPadOS 26 requirements. Generally speaking this is this is not something you should do, except on a secondary device that is not mission critical. Some more casusal users will wait until the public beta to try out the beta operating system on their devices, though that has yet to be made available by Apple. Beta testers should also update their other devices while they’re at it, as the 4th beta of the entire OS 26 suite is available, including the latest macOS Tahoe beta, watchOS beta, tvOS beta, and visionOS beta. Apple has said the final version of iOS 26 for iPhone will be released in the fall, along with the final versions of iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.",
