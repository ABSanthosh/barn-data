  "text": "WhatsApp on Thursday announced another update coming for its users. Starting today, WhatsApp will provide multiple chat theme options for both iOS and Android users, so that they can make chats unique with “colorful chat bubbles and new wallpapers.” WhatsApp now has chat themes “You asked for it. Here it is! We’re introducing chat themes, so you can make your chats uniquely yours with colorful chat bubbles and new wallpapers,” the company says. Changing the WhatsApp wallpaper was already possible before the update, but now the customizations go even further with themes. For instance, users can change the colors of the chat bubbles with “plenty of options to choose from.” There are pre-set themes that change both backgrounds and bubbles, but you can change each one individually. When it comes to wallpapers, users can choose from 30 new wallpaper options or upload a new background from the photo library. You can apply the same theme to all WhatsApp chats or set a specific theme for each chat. It’s worth noting that WhatsApp themes are only visible to you, so others won’t see the theme you’ve chosen. Themes are available for both chats and channels. In order to change the WhatsApp theme, open the app and go to Settings \u003e Chats \u003e Default Chat Theme. WhatsApp says that the feature is now being rolled out to users and will be available globally to everyone over the coming weeks. WhatsApp is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you update to the latest version of the app to get access to the new features.
