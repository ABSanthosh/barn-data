Announced as “One more thing” at WWDC 2015, the service launched on June 30, 2015, months before iOS 9 and Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan landed later that fall. To celebrate the milestone, Apple is offering a “special version” of its annual Replay playlist. Similar to Spotify’s Wrapped campaign, Replay offers “a look back at the top songs, artists, albums that defined your year,” but Apple is taking a step further—actually 10 steps further. The new Replay All Time playlist will collect your most-listened-to songs over the past 10 years into a handy playlist accessible in the Apple Music app.  To find it, open the Apple Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and navigate to the Home tab. Apple is spotlighting the Replay All Time playlist in the top carousel, so you can just tap to listen and hit the plus symbol in the top right to add it to your Playlists folder. Apple also has a site devoted to its annual Apple Music Replay but it hasn’t been updated with the new 10-year stats. Just note, as this is a generated playlist, you won’t be able to add or remove songs. It’s unclear if Apple will continuously update the playlist with new songs and rankings as you listen or if it’s limited to the first 10 years. But if you’re feeling nostalgic, give it a listen.",
