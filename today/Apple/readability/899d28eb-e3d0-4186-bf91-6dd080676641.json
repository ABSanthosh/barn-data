For some people, it might be easier to just have a single goal, task, or reminder, and that is the focus or important thing to remember, without any other distractions. That’s where One Thing comes in, which is a free simple Mac app that allows you to place any text (and emoji) into the Mac menu bar, whether that’s a task, goal, reminder, affirmation, or even a short sweet note to a loved one on their Mac. There’s not a lot to One Thing for Mac, but as the developer describes its purpose, “Put your most important task or goal in the menu bar. Its presence there will help remind you without being annoying.” If that sounds good to you, then grab One Thing free from the Mac App Store, launch it, and away you go. Get One Thing free from the Mac App Store After you launch One Thing you can change the menu bar text at anytime by clicking the existing text, or the (1) icon that appears there. What you decide to put in your Mac menu bar is really up to you, but because the space is relatively cramped on some Macs (especially with the ugly and annoying notch which mars an otherwise beautiful MacBook lineup, sigh), you probably won’t want to be putting too many characters into the menu bar with One Thing. Keep it short and simple, like “Do Taxes”, or “Submit Resignation”, or “Take a Walk”, whatever you want to be top of your mind with a little encouragement, and perhaps spice it up by placing an Emoji in there too. Maybe you want a reminder to “Eat Lunch”: Or to “Drink Coffee” (since you’re half-asleep without it and somehow can’t remember coffee is the solution): Or maybe you want to declare your appreciation to OSXDaily.com for being so helpful: Perhaps you’re on a spouses or partners Mac and you want to put a cute little reminder on there for them (this might win you points, or skepticism, who knows, try it?) : Whatever you wish to put in the Mac menu bar, One Thing lets you do that. One Thing is easy, it’s free, it’s simple, what’s not to like? Try it out on your Mac, see if it’s for you. Thanks to LifeHacker for pointing out this fun little find.",
