  "text": "The first beta for iOS 18.4 adds support for controlling robot vacuums via Apple Home, with several high-profile models ready to support it. The official release of iOS 18.4 is currently expected to be in April, but testing on the first beta is underway by developers. AppleInsider was able to confirm that while initially not user-facing, the update does include the requisite version of Matter to support robotic vacuums. Robotic vacuums and mops will be available in Apple Home thanks to Matter, the up-and-coming smart home standard intending to unify the various ecosystems. Robotic vacuums were first added to Matter in version 1.2 during the fall of 2023, but was yet to be supported by Apple. At WWDC 2024, Apple promised vacuums were arriving in iOS 18 but were delayed until the \"end of 2024.\" The adoption was once again quietly pushed, moving it into 2025 and now seemingly, the iOS 18.4 update. Currently, the Switchbot S10 Robot Vacuum and Mop is the only one available that supports Matter and the Home app, with exceptions. If added via a Switchbot hub, it will show as an on/off switch in Apple Home, but if added directly from the bot, will show appropriately as a vacuum cleaner as of the first beta of iOS 18.4. Bluesky user James Prochnow noted in a post that he has tested the S10, and found that it is already supported on the iPhone's Home app. The unit is currently available for sale for $1,199. AppleInsider reviewed a smaller version of the vacuum, the K10, a year ago. At the time, Matter support was not yet implemented, but on/off support was added in April of 2024. A YouTube video demonstrating the Switchbot robot vacuum is currently available from Smart Home Centre. In addition to controlling the S10 via the Home app on an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, the Matter compatibility means it can also respond to voice commands. @andrewosu.bsky.social @hilli.tech just an FYI. Vacuum support is in iOS 18.4. (This is with SwitchBot)[image or embed]— james-prochnow.bsky.social (@james-prochnow.bsky.social) Feb 22, 2025 at 12:39 PMUsers can use their voice to tell the vacuum to start or stop cleaning, to return to its to its dock, or to enable or disable the mopping function, and to switch cleaning modes. The Switchbot S10 can also be controlled by voice through HomePods or the Apple TV, and users can add the S10 and supported future robot vacuums to HomeKit automations and scenes. Matter 1.4 brought further refinements to the robotic vacuum cleaner spec, such as the Service Area Cluster. As AppleInsider is aware, this will allow users to set rooms and zones with the manufacture app, and set those service areas via the Home app. Tentatively, it appears that Apple has included this update as well with the Home app. This could have been the cause of the delay on Apple's rollout for a more full-featured user experience. While Switchbot doesn't support Matter 1.4 in its implementation, Ecovacs and Roborock both have passed this certification on their models. It's likely Roborock, Ecovacs, and others will all release their Matter firmware updates once Apple releases the final version of iOS 18.4 this spring. The Matter robot vacuum support standard is also expected to be added to iPadOS 18.4, tvOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, and watchOS 11.4.",
