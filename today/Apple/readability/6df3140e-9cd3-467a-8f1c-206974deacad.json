  "description": "Macworld Would you rather have a purple iPhone 17 or a green one? According to prominent leaker Majin Bu, Apple is currently testing both colors for the base iPhone 17 (the Pro models get different colors). The leaker says Apple is unlikely to choose both colors for the iPhone 17, with the company reportedly “leaning toward purple being the likely choice for release.” The new color will presumably arrive alongside the more typical colors (usually white and/or black, some shades of blue and pink are common). This year’s model comes in five flavors: Black, White, Pink, Teal, and Ultramarine. Apple previously released the iPhone 14 Pro in Deep Purple and the iPhone 12 and 12 mini in purple midway through its first year. Along with the new color, major changes are expected to come to the iPhone 17 line this year, including upgraded cameras, a new design with a horizontal camera array stretching across the back of the phone, the A19 processor, a 120Hz display, and more. You can follow along with all the rumors and leaks about Apple’s upcoming iPhones in our iPhone 17 superguide. Apple is expected to uneil its new phones in September.",
