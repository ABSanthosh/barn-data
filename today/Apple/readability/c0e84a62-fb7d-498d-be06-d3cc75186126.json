  "description": "Macworld Apple has racked up more Emmy nominations than ever before. Apple’s press release states, “Apple TV+ today earned a record-breaking 81 Emmy Award nominations across 14 hit Apple Original titles,” but Apple counts its two nominated commercials, which nobody else does. Anywhere else you look, you’ll see 79 nominations. When Apple says “record-breaking” they must mean they broke their own record, which was the 72 nominations it received last year. It is by no means a record for a single network, as HBO Max has 142 this year and Netflix has 120. The second season of Severance earned a whopping 27 nominations, more than any program from any network this year. The standout hit–for Apple–is its comedy The Studio. It earned 23 Emmy nominations, tied with The White Lotus for third place overall and a record for any comedy in its first season. Other standout shows include Shrinking and Slow Horses (two of our favorite Apple TV+ shows), with seven and five nominations, respectively. Lots of nominations doesn’t mean lots of winners, though. We’ll find out which series won and for what at the Creative Arts ceremonies on September 6 and 7 and the Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony on September 14. If you want to know what to watch, we maintain a complete list of all the Apple TV+ shows and movies here. We also maintain a list of upcoming projects so you know what to look forward to. If you don’t have Apple TV+, we have to covered, with our article telling you how to get Apple TV+ for free or discounted.",
