  "description": "Macworld It’s been about 18 months since Apple Vision Pro arrived, and it hasn’t exactly set the world on fire. After the initial and very brief hype died down, Apple has struggled to generate much interest in the high-priced headset, and any presence of it has all but disappeared from Apple Stores. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, there’s a new model coming next year, but it doesn’t sound like it’s going to do much to boost sales. The report claims the refresh will bring small improvements, including “a faster processor and components that can better run artificial intelligence,” as well as “a new strap to make it easier to wear the headset for long periods of time.” Gurman says that means an upgrade from the M2 to the M4. However, the new model reportedly won’t be any lighter and will presumably cost the same $3,499. The new strap, which Gurman describes as “designed to reduce neck strain and head pain,” will help somewhat, but the headset already comes with both a standard strap and the Apple Vision Pro Dual Loop Band. However, users still complain of head and neck pain after extended use. The new model will help set the stage for a flurry of Vision products, including a cheaper headset, a tethered model for enterprise work, and AR glasses. Those projects aren’t expected to arrive until at least 2027.",
