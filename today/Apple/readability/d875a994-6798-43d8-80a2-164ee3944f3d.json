  "text": "Apple is going to be launching the M4 Mac lineup next week in a series of press releases, which Apple marketing exec Greg Joswiak refers to as an “exciting week of announcements.” These are some Apple products you probably won’t be able to buy from the Apple Store after that saga. M3 MacBook Pros Apple is expected to unveil new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. Other than the chip upgrades, the new MacBook Pro will be mostly the same – though the base model MacBook Pro will likely start with 16GB of RAM. There should also be an additional Thunderbolt port on the new base model M4 MacBook Pro, up from two ports to three. According to packaging leaks and a subsequent unboxing, the cheapest 14″ MacBook Pro with the base M4 chip will also be coming in Space Black for the first time. We’ll finally be saying goodbye to the M3 MacBook Pro and its Space Gray finish. M2 Mac mini This month, Apple will be unveiling the largest redesign to Mac mini in 14 years, with a much smaller design, ports on the front, and more. Apple last updated the Mac mini in January 2023, with M2 and M2 Pro chips. The last update brought the first Mac mini with a Pro chip, and we’re expecting M4 and M4 Pro chips with the Mac mini redesign in a few weeks, saying goodbye to the classic design. M3 iMac We’re also expecting a new refresh to the iMac this month, bumping up from the M3 chip to the M4 chip. It’ll also likely be a light refresh, although we’re likely to see the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad transition from Lightning to USB-C, bidding farewell to Apple’s proprietary connector that definitely stayed around for too long. If you were in the market for any of these products, it’s probably a good idea to hold out for the upcoming Apple Event.
