  "text": "It's been widely reported that Apple's Siri advancements promised for 2025 would arrive in April with iOS 18.4 but a new report casts some doubt on that timeline. Apple has yet to officially announce when the advancements were coming, beyond a 2025 timeframe. The features were announced at WWDC 2024 and were said to be coming to iOS 18. But, according to a new report by Bloomberg on Friday, Apple's work has hit some snags. Some features that were said to be planned for iOS 18.4 are said to have been pushed back to May, or even later. Reportedly, testing of the improvements internally aren't going well. The features may be technically included in iOS 18.5, but disabled until Apple throws the switch to turn them on at some point after release. That means features like Personal Context Understanding, In-App Actions, and Onscreen Awareness will wait to launch. After the improvements, Siri will gain the ability to better interpret commands, and take multiple steps. So after asking about a sports team, a user can just say \"when do they play next?\" and then have Siri add that event to their calendar. This aspect of the improvement round leans on app intents. This is the ability of developers to present users with specific features of their apps, to be used directly by Siri. More improvements for Siri and Apple Intelligence are expected to be announced for iOS 19 at WWDC 2025 in early June.",
