  "description": "Macworld If you want the best tablet you can possibly get, look no further than the M4 iPad Pro. And right now, it’s never been cheaper—with an all-time-low price cut of $200 off, you can get yourself your very own iPad Pro for as low as $1,099. The same discount applies to all other storage capacities as well. The 13-inch iPad Pro has all the features you could possibly want and then some. It’s super powerful thanks to the M4 chip and it comes with a gorgeous ultra-thin design built around a stunning OLED display. It’s the perfect tablet if you want to be able to use it for both work and fun, if you want to edit images, run project designs, create videos, and so on. When we reviewed this tablet, we gave it a 5-star rating, appreciating the super-thin design, the gorgeously bright display, and overall fantastic performance. Oh, and the battery life, because everyone wants a tablet they can use around the clock. And with iPadOS 26 coming in the fall, with Liquid Glass, Mac-like multitasking and windowing, and a supercharged Files app, it’s going to get even more powerful. This particular $1,099 configuration features 256GB of storage space, but if you want more of that, you can definitely get some. The 512GB iPad Pro M4 is down to $1,299, the 1TB model is $1,699, while the 2TB version is $2,099. Basically, there’s a $200 discount across all models. So, if you want the 13-inch iPad Pro M4, now’s a good time to get it. Get a 256GB iPad Pro M4 for $200 offBuy now at Amazon",
