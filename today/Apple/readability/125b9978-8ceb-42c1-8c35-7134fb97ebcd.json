  "description": "Macworld Apple on Monday announced a special deal for the Apple Music streaming service. New and eligible customers can get six months of Apple Music for $2.99/£2.99. That’s $8 off the regular price of $10.99 per month, which kicks in at the end of the six-month trial. To sign up for Apple Music, launch the Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and go to the Home section. This offer is available in the U.S., U.K., and Canada until February 27, 2025. Apple’s press release doesn’t explain what “eligible” means, however. The Apple Music deal is part of Apple’s promotion tied to Super Bowl LIX and its sponsorship of the halftime show starring Kendrick Lamar (who won multiple Grammy awards on Sunday night). The company offers several related promotions, including a section of Apple Music for “Kendrick Lamar’s Road to Halftime,” an interview on Thursday, February 6 at 10 a.m. Central with Lamar on Apple Music, Super bowl-related Apple Music Radio programming, and more. Apple Music subscriptions are also part of Apple One, a bundle of six iCloud services for one monthly price. Plans range from $19.95/£19.95 for an Individual plan to $37.95/£37.95 for a Premier plan.
