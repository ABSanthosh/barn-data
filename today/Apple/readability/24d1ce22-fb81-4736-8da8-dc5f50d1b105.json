At worst, they’re targeted attempts to scam you for money or collect data that can be used for fraudulent purposes. Why You’re Getting Spammed on iOS Your personal data is collected, traded and sold without your consent by companies like data brokers and people search sites. It’s eye-opening just how much information is collected with virtually no oversight: your name, email, home address, phone number, SSN, family status, and even credit score. If you’ve suddenly received an influx of spam, chances are that your phone number (and more sensitive information) has been leaked, sold and uploaded to these unscrupulous databases. Traditional number-blocking techniques on iOS aren’t enough to stop them. Incogni - Personal Data Removal Services Personal data removal services can silence the harassment and get your sensitive information off the internet. Incogni’s personal information removal service will search out the data brokers most likely to be dealing in your personal data. Then, it sends out wave after wave of takedown requests on your behalf. Incogni does it all for you, letting you keep an eye on removal progress through your dashboard and regular privacy reports. A great feature of Incogni is that it restarts removals every three months to ensure your personal info is kept out of circulation.
