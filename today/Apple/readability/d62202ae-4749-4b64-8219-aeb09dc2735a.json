  "text": "Just a few hours ago, I wrote about H-E-B finally caving to the pressure and rolling out Apple Pay to all of its locations. As it turns out, H-E-B isn’t alone in this change. According to multiple 9to5Mac readers and reports across social media, Home Depot has also recently started rolling out Apple Pay support. Update October 9, 2024: Home Depot spokesperson Beth Marlowe confirmed this news in a statement to 9to5Mac: “We have begun rolling out contactless as a payment option in our U.S. stores. We anticipate the rollout will be completed to most of our stores and registers later this year.” Home Depot has been a major Apple Pay holdout, resisting pressure from its customers to add support for Apple’s tap-to-pay platform. Notably, Lowe’s—Home Depot’s biggest competitor—began rolling out Apple Pay support last December. It certainly seems possible that this move by Lowe’s put pressure on Home Depot to change its strategy. Home Depot hasn’t commented on this change in policy, and the details of the rollout aren’t explicitly clear. It appears to be a very gradual rollout that started at a small number of locations over the summer and has recently picked up momentum. Your mileage may vary for the time being, though. According to at least one report, Home Depot is exclusively supporting Apple Pay at its self-checkout terminals, not its traditional checkout lanes. Of course, some Home Depot locations exclusively offer self checkout anyways. Walmart is still the biggest Apple Pay holdout by a wide margin, and the company has shown no signs of changing its tune. Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the United States, began supporting Apple Pay at all of its stores last year. Walmart has largely focused on its own Walmart Pay and Walmart+ platforms as opposed to contactless platforms like Apple Pay. The company attempted to justify its decision by making the bizarre claim that Walmart Pay is more popular than Apple Pay. A quick search on social media, however, shows that shoppers are increasingly fed up with Walmart’s lack of Apple Pay support. Have you been able to try Apple Pay at your local Home Depot yet? Are there any other places you shop at that don’t support Apple Pay? Let us know in the comments. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
