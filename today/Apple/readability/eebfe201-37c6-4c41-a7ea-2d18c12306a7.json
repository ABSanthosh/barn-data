Apple TV+ is packed with star-studded dramas and comedies, and it continues to roll out new projects at a regular pace. The latest dramedy will likely fit in well with fans of Bad Sisters. I'm Glad My Mom Died will star Jennifer Aniston, who is also the executive producer for the series via Echo Films. She's playing the titular mother that relishes her identity as \"a starlet's mother.\" The story is based on a memoir of the same name by Jennette McCurdy, known for her role in Nickelodeon show iCarly. It reached number 1 on the New York Times bestselling list and stayed on the list for over 80 weeks. McCurdy detailed her struggles as a former child actor that has to deal with her overbearing mother. The title says it all, as the story is described as both heartbreaking and hilarious. While Apple's description is lacking, the book itself doesn't hold back. It describes McCurdy's life as a child actress with an obsessive mother forcing her into diets, flaunting her stardom, and even showering her until she was 16 years old. Things don't turn around for McCurdy until her mother dies of cancer while she's reprising her role in Sam and Cat, an iCarly spinoff. She quits acting and finds her own life. McCurdy herself is also an executive producer and showrunner alongside Ari Katcher. Sharon Horgan and Stacy Greenberg, makers of \"Bad Sisters,\" are there via their studio Merman. LuckyChap, Jerrod Carmichael, and Erica Kay are also executive producers. Apple didn't share any details on when the series would debut. It will be a 10-episode season.",
