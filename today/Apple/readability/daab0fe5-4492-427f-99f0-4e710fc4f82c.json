Becoming a T-Mobile customer comes with a lot of benefits, but that deal has been sweetened with an incredible offer. New customers can join T-Mobile and port their old number to get a free iPhone 16 Pro. Grab the iPhone deal Apple's iPhone 16 Pro is a powerful upgrade for almost any user of a previous-generation model thanks to the improved cameras and Camera Control. It also has a long battery life at 27 hours of video playback. The A18 Pro processor is also essential for Apple Intelligence, which brings a lot of AI functionality to your iPhone. Edit text, generate emojis, and get summarized emails from your private on-device AI. If you're already paying off a smartphone, T-Mobile will pay it off up to $800 a line. However, this isn't a trade-in deal — you get to keep your old smartphone as well. The iPhone 16 Pro On Us with new line and port offer is eligible for any new or returning customer that activates a new voice line on an Experience Beyond or Experience More plan while porting an eligible number. If you'd prefer an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus, they are also eligible in the deal. Families can take advantage of the offer as well on up to four lines. That means four free iPhones valued at $1,000 each, plus $800 each for paying off existing devices. T-Mobile iPhone 16 Pro deal termsPick the device you'd like to purchase valued up to $1,000, pay the taxes plus a $10 connection charge, and set up the new voice line to get the offer. As a bonus, if you're currently paying off a device and owe less than $800, T-Mobile will pay that off too with a prepaid Mastercard. The iPhone 16 Pro is paid off using 24 payment credits distributed over two years. If the plan is canceled before the iPhone is paid off, the user is responsible for paying the remaining balance. Paying the iPhone off early also ends the monthly bill credit. T-Mobile deals don't stop with the iPhone 16 Pro promotion. You get additional perks through the included Magenta Status for all customers, like discounts and exclusive offers.",
