  "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a Bluetooth tracker that works seamlessly with your iPhone’s Find My network, but don’t want to splurge on an AirTag, then we found just the one for you. This tiny Ugreen FineTrack is only $10 now that it’s half off at Amazon, and a fraction of the cost of an AirTag. The Apple AirTags are some of our favorites because they’re sleek, tiny, and soooo precise. But at $29 each, with very rare discounts that bring the price lower than $23, we have to admit they’re rather pricey, especially since you also need extra accessories to attach them to a keychain. The Ugreen FineTrack is compact, has a built-in keychain hole. Even better, it integrates with the same Find My network, so you get global positioning, it pings off other Apple devices when out of range, and you can make it beep so you can find your keys faster. The replaceable CR2032 button battery will last you for about two years, which is pretty awesome too. At just $10, the Ugreen FineTrack is a fantastic alternative to AirTags, delivering all the essential features at a budget-friendly price.
