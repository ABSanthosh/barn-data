  "text": "Gentler Streak, the Apple Design Awards-winning fitness and wellness app, is getting another update – this time to make the app even easier and more intuitive to use. After adding new Home Screen widgets with health metrics, Gentler Streak is now introducing a new For You tab that combines the user’s Streak with health information from the wellness section. Gentler Streak’s main tab gets a new layout Back in 2023, Gentler Streak introduced a new Wellbeing section, which provided an easy-to-understand summary of the user’s health data. Now this section is being combined with the app’s For You page in the Streak tab. According to the developers, not everyone was finding the health metrics in Gentler Streak, so they reorganized the app layout to highlight such information. “We have reimagined how the app delivers the info that matters most to you. The result? A lighter, more intuitive experience that puts everything you need right at your fingertips.” Despite the change, nothing has been removed from the app. Instead, the For You section is now fully customizable, so you can choose the most relevant information to always be at the top. For example, the app will highlight your sleep recaps in the morning and workout recaps during the day. That’s not all. To celebrate Women’s History Month, everyone who starts cycle tracking on Gentler Streak until the end of the month will get access to this Premium feature for free forever. Gentler Streak helps users better understand their physical condition to know whether they can improve their workouts or whether they’re pushing too hard. The app received Apple’s App of the Year award for Apple Watch in 2022 and earned a spot as a finalist for the 2023 Apple Design Award. Last year, Gentler Streak won an Apple Design Award in the Best Social Impact category. You can download Gentler Streak for free on the App Store, but some advanced features require a subscription or a lifetime license. It’s worth noting that the app works best with an Apple Watch.
