  "text": "After a whirlwind tour of Europe and the UK, Apple CEO Tim Cook is said to be meeting with President Elect Donald Trump for dinner on Friday night. The conversation between Cook and Trump, expected to be on a Mar A Lago patio, is likely going to be an extension of a conversation that Trump said he previously had with Cook. While on the election trail, Trump said Cook complained to him about European Union actions, specifically the $15 billion that was put in escrow to deal with Ireland tax issues. It does not appear that Trump did anything about the fine during his time as president. The funds to pay the fine were put in escrow in 2018, and there is not a statement on record from him about it from that time. Also likely up for discussion is Trump's proposed tariffs on goods imported from China. Those tariffs are said to increase consumer goods prices notably, with standouts being notebooks and tablets priced at 46% higher than current levels. Game consoles could increase in price by 40%, while smartphones like the iPhone are expected to be 26% more expensive for the consumer. Apple hasn't confirmed the dinner, which was noted in a report on Friday evening. To date, Trump has not said anything about it on social media. The Mar A Lago visit may be winding down Cook's travels. While in the UK on Wednesday, Cook shared a video of King Charles III visiting Apple's Battersea Power Station office in London. The visit was in part to celebrate Apple's work with The King's Trust, an organization to help young people in the UK develop their skills for employment or to start a business. \"We were honoured to welcome His Majesty King Charles to Apple Battersea — our home in the U.K. — and we're proud to support The King's Trust in its vital work educating and empowering young people,\" said Cook. \"We look forward to our continued growth here, building on more than 40 years of history in the United Kingdom\" Other tech CEOs are expected to meet with Trump soon, or already have. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai have already met with the President Elect. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is expected to meet with Trump during the week of December 16. Tim Cook and Donald TrumpFollowing a public congratulations for winning a second term, the dinner is likely Cook's second effort to reinvigorate his working relationship with Trump. During the first Trump administration, Cook was known for being close to the President, to a far greater degree than other business leaders. During the term, Trump praised Cook for his communication skills, calling him a \"great executive\" due to repeatedly contacting Trump directly over important matters. While others used consultants, Trump was impressed by Cook's personal touch. The term's famous US-China trade war was potentially damaging to Apple, but Cook led efforts to try and convince Trump from applying tariffs against its products. His influence certainly helped delay the application of tariffs, and did so altogether for iPhone, iPad, and Mac products when Trump signed a limited trade deal. Outside of the trade war, Cook had visited the White House multiple times and discussed a wide range of topics with the world leader. Even a gaffe where Trump called him \"Tim Apple\" was taken in stride. Cook's dealings with he U.S. leadership continued beyond Trump. During the Joe Biden presidency, Cook, his executives, and lobbyists visited the White House at least 87 times as of March 2024, with Cook attending 11 times. As for the return of Trump, it seems that Cook may have started laying the ground work for the next four years earlier in 2024. It is believed Cook left WWDC early to meet with Trump alongside up to 80 other CEOs, in preparation for the implementation of potential business-related policies if he won.",
