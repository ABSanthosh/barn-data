Photo: Apple/Cult of Mac Apple intends to massively transform the user interfaces for the iPhone, Mac and iPad later this year, according to a reliable source who says iOS 19, macOS 16 and iPadOS 19 could bring the most significant changes in years. How will those changes affect the familiar look and feel of Apple’s devices? A software developer speculates that a pair of recently released Apple apps offer a sneak peek at the design overhaul reportedly coming in iOS 19 and macOS 16. iOS 19 and macOS 16 could usher in significant design changes The current iOS 18, macOS Sequoia 15 and iPadOS 18 all look similar, but not identical. A redesign in the coming months supposedly will make them appear much more alike. “The revamp — due later this year — will fundamentally change the look of the operating systems and make Apple’s various software platforms more consistent,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported Monday. “That includes updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons.” Anonymous sources inside Apple say the company is “working to simplify the way users navigate and control their devices,” with an updated design language loosely based on software that runs Apple’s Vision Pro headset. iPhone, iPad and Mac taking cues from visionOS? That operating system, known as visionOS, uses more-translucent design elements than Apple’s other operating systems do. visionOS also utilizes circular app icons, rather than the instantly recognizable rounded-square “squircles” in iOS, iPadOS and macOS. A previous rumor indicated Apple intends to bring the look of visionOS to other platforms, though earlier we thought this might apply only to the Camera app. The operating systems’ overhauls reportedly will be more than simply cosmetic. “The changes are coming as part of iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 — code-named ‘Luck’ — and macOS 16, which is dubbed ‘Cheer,'” Gurman wrote. “They go well beyond a new design language and aesthetic tweaks. The software will mark the most significant upgrade to the Mac since the Big Sur operating system in 2020. For the iPhone, it will be the biggest revamp since iOS 7 in 2013.” Profound changes coming So, Mark Gurman says iOS and macOS are getting a significant redesign so that all operating systems are more consistent. This is great, because there are a lot of inconsistencies across them and even within the individual OSes. Here’s what I personally think this will mean (this… pic.twitter.com/5BK0M2MbTA — Dylan (@DylanMcD8) March 10, 2025 Responding to Gurman’s report, Dylan McDonald, owner and CEO of Sun Apps, predicted in an X post that “Apple will expand the use of blurs, particularly progressive ones.” He added that the system navigation bars will likely “get a significant overhaul with more styles and options, and likely use progressive blur like it does on visionOS.” He also predicted deep changes for iOS. “Most macOS and visionOS elements have small outlines, highlights, and gradients that imply depth and shape,” McDonald wrote. “I’d love to see iOS get this and finally make significant progress on iOS 7’s over-correction of Skeumorphism. I imagine the style of depth on macOS will likely be updated as well to give it a fresh feeling and make it more consistent with iOS and visionOS.” Apple Invites and Apple Sports apps: Examples of the new look? The new Apple Invites app might offer a glimpse of things to come in iOS 19.Screenshots: Apple McDonald pointed to the recently released Apple Invites and Apple Sports apps as portents of the future. “Notice the color and depth in Sports and Invites,” he wrote. “So much color, blurs, and outlines. I’d love if Apple went back to some of their original iOS 7 ideas and used your wallpaper as a background for all apps!” Notice the color and depth in Sports and Invites. So much color, blurs, and outlines.

Months of beta testing will follow. Then, if Apple follows its usual pattern, the new operating system upgrades will reach all customers in the autumn.
