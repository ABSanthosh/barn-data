You can snag Apple's new Mac Studio at a significant discount without having to leave the comfort of your home, as Apple Premier Partner Expercom is issuing a 7% markdown on every model exclusively for AppleInsider readers. Save up to $967 The standard model is reduced to $1,859.07, a discount of $140 off retail, when you shop through this pricing link (look for the special AppleInsider price above the Add to Cart button). There's a lot to love about the standard configuration, which features Apple's M4 Max chip with a 14-core CPU and 32-core GPU. It also is equipped with 36GB of unified RAM and a 512GB SSD (you can increase space for files through the use of an external SSD if need be). In our 2025 Mac Studio review, the desktop received a commendable score of 4.5 stars out of five. Pair it with an external display, such as the Apple Studio Display that's on sale, and you have a robust setup that's capable of content creation, spreadsheet analysis, and more. As mentioned earlier, every model is marked down at Expercom through our special pricing links, so if you want the M3 Ultra chip or additional memory, it's worth checking out our 2025 Mac Studio Price Guide for a rundown of the offers. We also highlight the week's best Mac Studio deals in our dedicated roundup, as closeout offers on M2 models pop up from time to time.",
