  "description": "Macworld Wireless AirPods are fun and all, but they can be easy to lose if you’re not careful, and can run out of juice right in the middle of a run. These Apple EarPods, however, are affordable, always attached to your phone, and never run out of battery. You can get a pair for $16 right now, the cheapest they’ve ever been, an impressive 16 percent discount. These old-school earbuds come with a USB-C port so you can connect them to all the most recent iPhone models, as well as pretty much any other device with a USB-C port, including laptops, tablets, and even Android devices. The EarPods have a sleek design that’s in line with pretty much all other Apple devices and only come in white. They have a round cable, so you’re going to have to be careful about those dreadful tangles. The volume controls are built into the cable, so you can adjust the volume, control media playback, and even answer or end calls without pulling out your phone. There’s an integrated microphone that captures your voice and will even pick up your Siri summons when you need the smart assistant. So snap up a pair of EarPods for $16 (or more) while they’re still on sale. Ditch the AirPods and get some $16 EarPods insteadBuy now at Amazon",
