Popular StoriesiPhone 17 Pro Max Rumors Allegedly Refer to 'iPhone 17 Ultra' ModelFriday March 14, 2025 7:56 am PDT by Tim HardwickIf you've been following iPhone rumors over the last few years, you may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end \"Ultra\" model that would either replace its Pro Max device or sit above it in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing.
