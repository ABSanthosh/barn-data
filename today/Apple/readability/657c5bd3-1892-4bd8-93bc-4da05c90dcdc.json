  "text": "Apple Books 20204 Year in Review and collections If you're an Apple Books user, the 2024 Year in Review is now available, which aggregates all of your reading data into a fun slideshow akin to Spotify Wrapped. It's December, which means it's time for every app and service to take part in the social media hype of sharing year-in-reviews. Apple doesn't shy away from the trend, as it offers Apple Music Replay throughout the year and now the Apple Books review is available. It's quite simple to get your Apple Books Year in Review. Just open the app and tap the green icon that says \"Year in Review\" under the \"Top Picks\" category. The short slideshow will showcase the number of books and audiobooks you read throughout 2024. Highlights include the number of minutes spent in the Books app, the longest book read, most read genre, if a series was finished, most read author, and reading trends. Apple Books gamifies reading a bit with goals and minutes read. The reading goal is customizable, and if you meet that goal, it can create a streak. Since the Apple Books app is also a store, it features recommendations from the editors. Navigate to the Book Store tab for collections of books based on editors' choice, chart toppers, and more from across 2024.",
