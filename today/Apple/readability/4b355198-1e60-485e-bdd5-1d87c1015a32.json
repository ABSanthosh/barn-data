  "description": "Macworld It’s been nearly three weeks since Apple released iOS 18.3 and we still don’t have the much-anticipated iOS 18.4 beta, which has long been expected to include the first look at the new and improved Siri. Well, according to a new report, we’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see any Siri-related progress. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman dropped a bombshell on Friday: the Siri overhaul that Apple is working on has faced engineering problems and bugs, “threatening” Apple’s plans to issue a Siri overhaul this April with iOS 18.4. Hence, the new Siri may not arrive until May or later with the iOS 18.5 update. The major Siri overhaul involves a heavy dose of Apple Intelligence, which brings the ability to read what’s on your screen and plug into third-party apps. Apple is testing the new Siri internally and has found inconsistent performance and with the iOS 18.4 beta expected next week, Apple has to make decisions on its ability to deliver. Besides delaying Siri, another option, Gurman says, is to include the enhanced Siri in iOS 18.4 but have it turned off by default until 18.5. The Siri setback is a major one for Apple. The company is already paying catch-up with its AI implementation, and Siri will be at the core of the rumored smart home push, which will reportedly include a new iPad-like home hub, a new HomePod mini and Apple TV 4K, and other accessories. So a Siri delay could cause a domino effect that delays those products as well. From a user standpoint, however, we’ve already been waiting for years for Siri to improve and be useful. What’s a few more months of waiting so that Apple gets it right?",
