  "text": "Adobe this week announced a series of new features coming to Adobe Express, a platform aimed at mainstream users who need to create web pages and graphics. Among the new features, the platform now integrates better with Creative Cloud apps and provides new tools for text and shapes. What’s new for Adobe Express As detailed by Adobe, the new version of Adobe Express brings features that make the platform more useful not only for ordinary users, but also for companies. For instance, it’s now easier to work and share content seamlessly between Adobe Express, InDesign and Lightroom. Features powered by Firefly, Adobe’s generative AI, have also been improved. Adobe Express users can now add movement to an entire design with just one click. The tool instantly animates every component including text, images, and shapes. You can also rearrange assets, make hand drawings and create graphs and tables easily with the update. Thanks to Firefly, users can now rephrase or shorten text, or even translate text into 46 different languages – all contextually aware. Users can even use of custom models trained on branded assets to create campaigns that match a brand’s specific style or apply all brand elements and colors across multiple pages for one-click brand and visual consistency. “With Adobe Express, our design team has the creative space and time to work on bigger, more meaningful projects while still maintaining a top layer of quality control,” said Zubair Khatry, Creative Studio Lead at Virgin Australia. Adobe points out that Adobe Express is being used by many enterprise customers such as ABB, Ad Council, Aon, Dentsu, Havas, IBM, Red Hat, Owen Jones, Prudential, Tata Consultancy Services, Virgin Australia, and Workday. The new features will be rolled out to Adobe Express users starting October 14. The platform can be used online or via the iOS app. Read also New Adobe Express app with Firefly AI now available on the iOS App Store Adobe announces new AI features coming to Illustrator and Photoshop Adobe Lightroom gets ‘fast and easy’ AI editing on iPhone, iPad, and Mac Using Lightroom on Vision Pro is easy and intuitive, but requires a slower pace Adobe unveils Firefly AI for Vision Pro with limited-time free text to image creation Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
