Below, you’ll find a selection of top picks from the changes he’s made, but be sure to visit the Setups page to see everything he’s currently using. For those who have already spent time on the Setups page, welcome back. There’s a handy changelog at the top of the page just for you, with a list of everything added and removed, so you don’t have to go searching for each item. Also, because today and tomorrow are Amazon Big Deals Days, I’ve highlighted the items on Federico’s setup list that are currently available at steep discounts on Amazon. Changes to Federico Viticci’s Desk Setup Part of the story of Federico’s latest setup changes is that he’s re-added a few key components that were previously removed: The Apple Vision Pro; CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt dock; and Apple Thunderbolt 4 Pro cables But there are plenty of new items in Federico’s setup, too. The 11” M4 iPad Pro with a nano texture display and AirPods 4 are the two big Apple additions. For NPC: Next Portable Console, Federico got a white low-profile microphone arm, which looks great on the video version of the show and is currently 20% off. If you’ve listened to the latest episode of NPC, you know why he also added a Samsung 990 Pro SSD with a heat sink, which is currently 42% off on Amazon. That SSD was used to mod his Lenovo Legion Go (22% off on Amazon), for which he’s also added a Mechanism gaming pillow and universal grips. Other additions include: an ASUS ROG Rapture WiFi 6E Gaming Router, which is currently 25% off on Amazon a Belkin MagSafe car charger for Federico’s iPhone, which is currently 34% off on Amazon; a big 25,000 mAh power bank by UGREEN; and a FiiO M17 high-resolution music player That’s it for the time being for our setups. I’ll also be back soon with updates on what I’ve been using for work and play.",
