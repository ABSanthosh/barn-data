  "text": "iOS 18.1 beta 6, iPadOS 18.1 beta 6, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 6, are now available to download for those participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. These beta builds are assumed to be finalized by the end of the month, and will bring Apple Intelligence AI features to compatible devices. The initial Apple Intelligence features include capabilities like summarization, writing tools, smart replies, and some new Siri features, though other AI features that were announced as part of iOS 18 or macOS Sequoia are likely to arrive in a later OS update as they are not included in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or macOS Sequoia 15.1. Apple Intelligence has strict system requirements, requiring an M1 or better chip for Mac or iPad, and an iPhone 15 Pro or better for iPhone. Other hardware will be able to install the iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates, but simply won’t include the Apple Intelligence features. How to Install iOS 18.1 Beta 6 and/or iPadOS 18.1 Beta 6 Open “Settings” and then head on over to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.1 beta 6 / iPadOS 18.1 beta 6 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.1 Beta 6 From the  Apple menu, select “System Settings” Go to “General”, and then to “Software Update” Choose “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.1 beta 6 Apple Intelligence has a waitlist to join before you can access it, but typically approval is almost immediate, and then you’ll be able to use the Apple Intelligence features in the beta. You can find this within System Settings \u003e Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri in iOS/iPadOS 18.1 beta or Sequoia 15.1 beta. When will iOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1, with Apple Intelligence be released? It is expected that iOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1, and iPadOS 18.1, all with Apple Intelligence, will be released in the coming weeks by Apple. Apple usually goes through several versions of betas before issuing a final version to the general public. A recent newsletter from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg suggests that October 28 will be the release date. There are rumors that Apple will refresh the iPad lineup and Mac lineup in the near future, and it’s plausible that iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and MacOS Sequoia 15.1 will be released with those. Additional Apple Intelligence features are likely to debut in iOS 18.2, macOS Sequoia 15.2, and iPadOS 18.2, later in the year, or next year.",
