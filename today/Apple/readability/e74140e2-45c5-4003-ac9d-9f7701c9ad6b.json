  "text": "The beta testing release cycle continues, this time with iOS 18.3 beta 3, iPadOS 18.3 beta 3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 3, each being made available to users participating in the beta testing programs from Apple. No major new features are arriving in these beta versions, though macOS Sequoia 15.3 will bring Genmoji creation to the Mac, and iOS/IpadOS 18.3 both have some minor changes to Apple Intelligence Summaries after users complained about inaccurate summaries being generated by Apple AI. The latest beta updates are available now with the typical software update distribution systems. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.3 Beta 3 If you’re enrolled in the beta testing programs for iOS/iPadOS, you can find the latest update in the Settings app: Open “Settings” on the device, and then go to “General” Select “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.3 beta 3 or iPadOS 18.3 beta 3 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 3 If the Mac is enrolled in beta releases, you can find the latest beta update from Software Update: Pull down the  Apple menu and choose “System Settings” Select “General” and then go to “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 3 Installing any beta version of iOS, MacOS, or ipadOS, will require the device to restart to finish installation. When is the final version of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3 available? Apple goes through multiple beta builds before issuing a final version to the general public. Now that we’re on beta 3 and it’s the middle of the month, it’s conceivable that the final versions of iOS 18.3, macOS Sequoia 15.3, and iPadOS 18.3, will be made available either at the end of the month, or next month in February. Only Apple knows the exact release timeline of system software, however. The latest available non-beta final versions of system software are currently macOS Sequoia 15.2 for Mac, iOS 18.2.1 for iPhone, and iPadOS 18.2.1 for iPad.",
