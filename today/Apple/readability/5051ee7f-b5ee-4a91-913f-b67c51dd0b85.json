  "text": "A Florida congresswoman has introduced a new bill targeting Apple, aiming to boost competition and expand consumer choice by mandating third-party marketplaces like the EU. U.S. Representative Kat Cammack (R-FL) has introduced the App Store Freedom Act (via The Verge), a bill aimed at increasing competition and consumer choice in the mobile app marketplace. The legislation targets major app store operators—those with over 100 million U.S. users—including the App Store. If enacted, the bill would require these companies to allow users to install third-party app stores and designate them as default, grant developers equal access to development tools, and permit the use of third-party payment systems. Additionally, it mandates the ability to remove or hide pre-installed apps—something Apple already does. The bill also seeks to prevent app stores from forcing developers to use the company’s in-app payment systems, imposing pricing parity requirements, or punishing developers for distributing their apps elsewhere. Violations could lead to penalties from the Federal Trade Commission and civil fines up to $1 million per infraction. The bill has the support of the Coalition for App Fairness, which is compromised of Epic Games, Spotify, Match, and more. Read it in full here. 9to5Mac’s Take While courts have recently forced changes to Apple’s App Store rules, U.S. legislation has yet to make a similar impact. Instead, Apple has managed to turn the White House against the European Union for fining the company under regulations that require it to compete. That’s why a one-off bill like this doesn’t currently pose a serious threat to Apple’s business model. However, Apple is facing a major antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice—one with the potential to shake the foundation of its business model.
