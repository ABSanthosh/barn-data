  "text": "Canadian Aviation Electronics (CAE), a company specializing in flight simulation and training technologies, announced on Tuesday that it has been working on a new app that will use Apple Vision Pro’s special computing to train pilots. CAE is working on a professional pilot training app for Vision Pro In a blog post, CAE says it is the first to develop an immersive pilot training app for Apple Vision Pro. The app was demonstrated at NBAA-BACE in Las Vegas and could be a “game-changer” in pilot training. The tool is still in the final stages of development, but it brings “true-to-life precision” to interactions with the flight deck. There’s an “Exploration Mode” where pilots can touch the controls to see a description of each one, while “Guided Mode” guides the pilot to learn the aircraft’s procedures. There’s also a free mode that pilots can use to simulate any kind of interaction with the flight controls. CAE believes the app will be revolutionary as it will allow pilots to complete their training remotely from anywhere, without always having to rely on visiting a training center to use professional simulators. “This Apple Vision Pro app developed by CAE will allow pilots to familiarize themselves with the flight deck, practice critical procedures, and develop muscle memory for key functions from anywhere,” said Emmanuel Levitte, CAE’s Chief Technology and Product Officer. “It will allow pilots to engage with realistic flight deck environments to further ensure they are ready for their full-flight simulator sessions and become even better prepared for any situation.” According to CAE, the app is currently being tested on the Bombardier Global 7500 program and is expected to be launched in spring 2025. Support for more aircraft will be added in the future.
