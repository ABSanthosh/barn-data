It works with your Mac, MacBook and iPad, and is trim enough to go where you need it, fitting easily in a backpack or even a pocket. All that said, the Apple Magic Mouse certainly has detractors. The most notable criticism is that it maintains its sleek appearance by putting the charging port on the bottom so the input device can’t be used while getting juiced up.
