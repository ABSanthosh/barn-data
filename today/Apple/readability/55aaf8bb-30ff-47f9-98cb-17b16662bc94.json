  "text": "Apple on Wednesday launched an official Apple TV+ app for Android – almost seven years after the platform was launched. To promote the news in style, Apple has just shared a new ad telling the world that Apple TV+ is now on Android. Apple TV+ on Android The 15-second ad features clips from multiple popular Apple TV+ shows like Ted Lasso, Silo, Severance and The Morning Show. Apple says that “thrilling dramas, epic sci-fi, heartwarming comedies, and award-winning originals” are “now on Android.” Coincidentally or not, Apple chose a scene from Shrinking with the characters talking about “working together.” On the official Apple TV Instagram account, the company also shared multiple frames of Apple TV+ shows with the caption “Now streaming on Android.” The reaction from users in the comments section has been very positive, which suggests that there was a high demand for an Apple TV+ Android app. Previously, the only Apple service to have an Android app was Apple Music. Although anyone can access Apple TV+ via a web browser, the experience is far from ideal compared to a native app. With the app, Android users can now watch content in high resolution and also download movies and shows to watch them offline. Apple TV+ for Android is available on Google Play. The subscription costs $9.99 per month in the US with a 7-day free trial. You can try Apple TV+ for free for 3 months after buying a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV.
