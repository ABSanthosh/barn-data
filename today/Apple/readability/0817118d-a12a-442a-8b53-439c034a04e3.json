Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Rather than goofing around with Apple Intelligence, the courses in The 2025 ChatGPT Skills \u0026 Creativity Bundle could make you an AI master. From writing and graphic design to travel planning and productivity hacks, this massive bundle of ChatGPT courses will take you from an AI beginner to a well-rounded expert. The core AI concepts you master can give you a leg up in almost any endeavor. Learn the latest skills with this up-to-date bundle of ChatGPT courses, all for just $29.99 (regularly $249.95). ChatGPT courses help you make the most of AI While Apple Intelligence works (mostly) on Apple devices, some people complain that Apple’s AI features don’t prove as useful as they hoped. For one, the AI summaries in Messages and Mail sometimes prove confusing (or even totally bogus). Plus, image-generation tools like Genmoji and Image Playground might seem fun, they pale in comparison to rivals’ offerings. And Siri? Don’t get us started. Apple already delayed the rollout of a smarter, AI-powered Siri indefinitely. However, there’s one good thing about Siri. Ask Apple’s AI assistant something it can’t answer, and it will submit your question to ChatGPT (if you allow it). Apple even built ChatGPT into its system-wide Writing Tools. Obviously, to take full advantage of these Apple Intelligence features, you need to know how to make the most out of ChatGPT. That’s where this affordable ChatGPT course bundle comes in. ChatGPT course for writing and content creation No matter your current skill level using AI, these educational courses will help you get things done faster and better. To start, these courses will boost your prompt-writing skills so you get better responses from ChatGPT. If you don’t give ChatGPT proper direction, your results will suffer. Currently, you’re probably sputtering nonsense — maybe even yelling at the chatbot when it spits out unusable results. But with 22 courses in the “Creative Writing \u0026 Content Creation with ChatGPT” segment, you’ll fine-tune your technique. Also, you will learn effective methods for generating engaging, SEO-friendly content, whether it’s for your blog, social media posts, or a video script. The “Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT \u0026 Generative AI” course, with an additional 23 lessons, will take your understanding even further with advanced topics. Boost your business and personal productivity The “Office Productivity \u0026 Personal Productivity 10X with ChatGPT” course is all about getting things done efficiently. It consists of 20 lessons with a decidedly business-oriented focus. And they’re all approachable for students at all levels of AI knowledge. See how AI can streamline your processes in the office and at home to save you valuable time. Scale your content game with ChatGPT and Canva If you like graphic design program Canva, there’s a 12-lesson course for you. It shows you how to use ChatGPT to make a Canva design with text and images, and then edit the design in Canva. Marketers, entrepreneurs and creators can learn how to combine ChatGPT’s AI-powered copywriting with Canva’s design tools to produce high-quality content at scale. Let AI plan your next trip Enjoy jetting around the globe? The “ChatGPT for Travel: From Planning to Flying With ChatGPT” course shows you how to use the chatbot as your personal travel agent. Its eight lessons will show you how to efficiently research destinations, plan itineraries and find the best deals using AI, saving yourself some of the usual hassle of vacation planning.
