According to Apple’s press release: Students, educators, and their advocates can find out how to prepare for the challenge and sign up to be notified when applications open at developer.apple.com. Apple will recognize a total of 350 Swift Student Challenge winners whose submissions demonstrate excellence in innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. From this esteemed group, 50 Distinguished Winners will receive additional recognition and be invited to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino next summer. The company has also updated its Swift Coding Club, a website with resources for students preparing for the annual Challenge, and added new Develop in Swift Tutorials. I’m sure we’ll hear more about the Swift Student Challenge in February when it kicks off and then again closer to WWDC as we did this year. I’m glad Apple has extended the timeline for publicizing the Swift Student Challenge, which I’m sure will give students and educators more time to prepare for the event and submit their best work.",
