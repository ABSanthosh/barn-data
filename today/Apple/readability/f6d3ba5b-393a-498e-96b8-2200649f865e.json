  "text": "Typically when Apple and law enforcement are in the news together, it’s because of a standoff over user privacy. But today, a new report outlines the company’s efforts to build bridges with law enforcement—efforts that may be changing. Apple’s efforts to build bridges with police Thomas Brewster writes for Forbes: Twice in the last five years, Apple hosted behind-closed-doors conferences for police agencies from across the world, bringing cops together at the tech giant’s Cupertino headquarters to discuss the best ways to use its products, Forbes has learned. […] There’s a widespread perception that Apple has a combative relationship with law enforcement after the company refused to help the FBI hack into the iPhone of the shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attacks. But since then, it has ramped up collaboration with police through the conference and other meetings with agencies at both Cupertino HQ and its Elk Grove campus, as well as a variety of previously unreported projects helping cops use iPhones, Macs, Apple Vision Pro and CarPlay…emails show. Most of these projects have not been announced publicly. The report details two ‘Global Police Summit’ events that have been held so far. The first took place in 2019, and a second happened just last year in October 2023. Employees from around 50 police departments globally, with representation from seven countries, reportedly have attended. The events provided law enforcement an opportunity to gather at Apple Park and collaborate about the different ways they use technology in their work. Apple has also been building relationships with law enforcement, especially in its home state of California, to boost the adoption of Apple products in police and sheriff’s departments. For example, testing and conversations have happened with LAPD and other local agencies around using the Vision Pro to replace surveillance monitors, and CarPlay as an alternative to in-vehicle laptops. The timing of the story comes one year after the last Global Police Summit, and according to the report, the Apple employee who led the efforts—Gary Oldham—recently left the company. The details around his exit are unknown. Notably though, there was no Global Police Summit held this year. It’s unclear whether the event will return without Oldham at the helm. If you’re interested in the subject, I highly recommend reading the full Forbes report. It’s also on Apple News+.
