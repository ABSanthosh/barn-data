  "text": "Apple has announced that their annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) will be held online from June 9 to June 13, 2025. There’s also set to be a special event in Cupertino California at the Apple Park campus on June 9. Typically these special events are when Apple debuts upcoming operating systems for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro, and they sometimes will launch updated hardware on the same occasion as well. It’s almost a certainty that Apple will use the January 9 special event to launch iOS 19, MacOS 16, and iPadOS 19, along with the next major versions of system software for watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. Not much is known about these upcoming system software releases, though there are circulating rumors that iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS will receive fairly significant visual overhauls to the user interface and user experience. Some rumors suggest iOS will move towards more visual transparency and a UI closer to the visionOS interface, and away from the bright glaring whites that have been the hallmark of the iPhone and iPad experience since iOS 7 debuted with it’s bleached flat interface, obfuscated buttons and UI items, and neon icons. Over time Apple has refined the interface a bit and made it a little less starkly bright, and then later introduced Dark Mode, but for the most part the design language and interface appearance has been the same since iOS 7 and MacOS Yosemite debuted 13(!) years ago. Of course it’s possible that rumors of a redesigned interface will not pan out, so as usual take any rumor with a grain of salt. There’s also speculation that more Apple Intelligence AI features will debut, perhaps along with the previously promised improvements to Siri, the “intelligent assistant” from Apple that often talks out of nowhere but can’t tell you when a full moon is or even what month it is. Apple’s press release covers the announcement, but leaves out any specifics or details beyond mentioning a look at “the latest advancements in Apple software”: Apple today announced it will host its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) online from June 9 to 13, 2025. Developers and students will also have the opportunity to celebrate in person during a special event at Apple Park on June 9. Available for free to all developers, WWDC25 will spotlight the latest advancements in Apple software. As part of Apple’s ongoing commitment to supporting developers, the conference will provide them with unique access to Apple experts, as well as insight into new tools, frameworks, and features.
