  "description": "Macworld The Apple Watch Ultra 2 isn’t all that different than the original Apple Watch Ultra, but we love one thing: the new black titnium color. Unfortunately, it doesn’t go on sale as often as the natural titanium color, but today you can get a great deal on one: Amazon is seling the Apple Watch Ultra 2 with a black titanium case and black ocean band for $730, a savings of $69 and the price we’ve ever seen for this colorway. This is an amazing smartwatch with a ton of features, a super bright screen, and a super slick operating system. When we reviewed the Ultra 2, we gave it a four-star rating, finding it’s super great for tracking workouts, hiking trips, and so on. It comes with built-in GPS and cellular connectivity (for a monthly fee) so you always know where you are. Plus, it does a fantastic job tracking steps, distance, as well as calories burned. When cycling or hiking, it performs great, keeping up with your activity of choice, even going as far as to monitor your heart rate. It’s also got better battery life than Apple’s other watches, lasting a whopping 36 hours before it needs a charge. We really like the black ocean band that comes with it, but if you want to personalize your Apple Watch Ultra 2, Amazon’s Woot warehouse has a slew of deals for various solo loop bands as low as $15. These come in a wide range of colors and sizes, and are absolutely gorgeous, but make sure to read Apple’s instructions since they’re specific to each wrist size. Whichever color combination you choose, your Apple Watch Ultra 2 will look super sleek. So go grab an Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $730 at Amazon and a Solo Loop band for up to 70 percent off at Woot.
