  "text": "An iPhone 14, which the next generation of iPhone SE is said to be based on. Regular leaker Sonny Dickson has posted a photo of a pair of cases alleged to be for a fourth-generation iPhone SE, which could be announced in early 2025. Current iPhone SE cases for the 2022 third-generation model feature a back cutout for the single camera lens and flash, and that cutout is repeated on these alleged new cases. Likewise, a cutout for the mute switch is a staple of the current cases, and the leaked image suggests that Apple isn't going to change that either. The raised areas on the sides for volume up/down and power are also similar to where they were on the previous model, proportionally. That doesn't, however, mean any old iPhone SE cases will fit the forthcoming new model. New size, new style, new cases The reason for this is that the next iPhone SE is said to be based on the iPhone 14 chassis, making it considerably larger than the previous models. Rumors have suggested it will sport a 6.1-inch OLED screen, compared to the current model's 5.45-inch display and LED backlit panel. Even though the back-camera cutout in Dickson's leaked photo is identical to the one on the 2022 iPhone SE, it's expected to sport a 48 megapixel camera. This could be similar to the iPhone 15, with a 12MP selfie camera in the Dynamic Island on the front â€” both significant upgrades. The next iPhone SE is also anticipated to switch out Touch ID in favor of Face ID, and Lightning replaced with a USB-C connector. Given the move to Face ID, the iPhone SE fourth-generation will thus gain a notch â€” and at least some if not all Dynamic Island features. However, there have also been reports that the next iPhone SE will support Apple Intelligence, inferring that it will be based on the A18 chip and sport 8GB of RAM. Exactly when the new iPhone SE will arrive remains unclear. Conventional wisdom and the iPhone SE's track record suggests a spring of 2025 launch. If all or most of these reports turn out to be true, Apple would likely remove the iPhone 14 from sale when the fourth-gen iPhone SE arrives, as the two models would be very similar. It's not known whether the iPhone 14 Plus, currently still being offered, would also be dropped.",
