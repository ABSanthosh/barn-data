This sale from Cult of Mac Deals means you can land a refurbished M1 MacBook Air for only $429.99. That’s a crazy-good price for an Apple laptop that’s perfect for most people’s needs. Is the M1 MacBook Air still worth it? The MacBook Air has been a perennial crowd-pleaser ever since Apple CEO Steve Jobs pulled one out of a manila envelope in one of the most memorable product unveilings of all time. The laptop proves powerful enough to run most apps, but remains super-lightweight and not too expensive. Apple’s M1 chip, introduced in 2020, powers the refurbished MacBook Air in this sale. With its 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, the M1 chip handles everything from basic tasks to more demanding applications with impressive speed and efficiency. Its 16-core Neural Engine means it can handle Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered suite of features like Genmoji and Writing Tools. Whether you’re juggling multiple tabs, editing videos or working on a design project, the M1 chip ensures smooth operation. It’s powerful and portable, making it perfect for students who need a laptop that can keep up with their multitasking needs. This refurbished M1 MacBook Air packs a 13.3-inch Retina display (2,560 by 1,600 native resolution, 227ppi). It comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. Available in gold and the ever-popular space gray finishes, it weighs just 2.8 pounds. The power you crave, with the battery life you need Another major bonus of the MacBook Air M1 is its impressive battery life. Fully charged, this computer can last up to 18 hours. That’s a full day of classes, a lengthy homework session on the weekend or the approximate time it takes to agonize over a project that will ultimately take 90 minutes to finish once you get started. Connectivity is also a breeze, thanks to the two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. They let you easily hook up your external drives, monitors or any other peripherals you might need. Save on a refurbished M1 MacBook Air Grab the perfect laptop for students at a price that’s perfect for anyone. Pick up a refurbished M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for just $429.99 while supplies last. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
