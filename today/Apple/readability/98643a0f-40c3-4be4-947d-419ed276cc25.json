However, Vision Pro seems to work very well in specific niches, as the director of “Wicked” has now revealed that he used Apple’s headset during the film’s post-production. Apple Vision Pro was used in the post-production of ‘Wicked’ Jon M. Chu says he embraced Apple Vision Pro when working on “Wicked”. According to the director, Vision Pro was extremely useful for reviewing the film’s post-production on a giant virtual screen while he talked to other people working on the same project. “For Wicked, we had a lot of visual effects all around the world,” says Chu. “I could be at my house, and I could have a screen that was bigger than the one we had in the screening room, and I could be talking to all the people in all the different continents, and I would watch the playback.” At one point, the director mentioned being able to use his fingers to zoom in and “draw” on the screen to highlight potential things for editing. “It just adds new dimension to how you see things,” he explains. With Apple Vision Pro’s spatial computing technology, users can open multiple windows simultaneously and place them in the real-world environment. Apple also shared a one-minute video with Jon M. Chu talking about his experience with Vision Pro, which you can watch below: Before Wicked became a box office sensation and cultural phenomenon, Jon M. Chu was among the first filmmakers to put spatial computing to the ultimate test. Apple Vision Pro’s infinite canvas enabled him to edit and produce parts of the movie, fostering his creativity and imagination.
