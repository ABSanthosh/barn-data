  "text": "Apple has issued release candidate builds of iOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1, and iPadOS 18.1, making them available for users enrolled in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. These versions are the first to include Apple Intelligence support on compatible devices. Initial Apple Intelligence features include functionality for summarizing data, writing tools, and smart replies. Apple Intelligence has very strict system requirements, and only iPhone 15 Pro or better will have the features on iPhone, while any Mac must have an M1 chip or better, and any iPad must have an M1 or A17 Pro chip or better. Separate from the Apple Intelligence features, there are also various bug fixes and security patches to be included in these software updates. How to Install iOS 18.1 RC and/or iPadOS 18.1 RC Assuming you’re currently enrolled in the beta program: Open “Settings”, then go to “General” Select “Software Update” Select to update now to iOS 18.1 or iPadOS 18.1 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.1 RC If your Mac is actively in the beta program, updating to the 15.1 RC build is simple: From the  Apple menu go to “System Settings” Select “General” and then choose “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.1 If you’re installing the betas for the first time, you’ll find that Apple Intelligence has a waitlist that you must join before it becomes accessible on your device, though approval is usually immediate.
