Photo: Apple TV+ In a surprising development, Presumed Innocent — Apple TV+’s most-watched drama — will return with a fresh narrative unrelated to Scott Turow’s novel as well as a new female lead replacing star Jake Gyllenhaal for its second season, according to a report Tuesday.

Presumed Innocent season 2 changes: New source material and female lead for legal drama Presumed Innocent captivated audiences in its debut season with Jake Gyllenhaal’s compelling portrayal of Rusty Sabich in Turow’s story. But now the show takes a bold creative leap by introducing a new female protagonist, Leila Reynolds, and new source material, Deadline reported. This dramatic shift comes as the series transforms into an anthology format, drawing inspiration from emerging literary talent. The show’s creative team has secured the rights to Dissection of a Murder, an upcoming legal thriller by debut author Jo Murray. It’s scheduled for publication by Pan Macmillan in spring 2026. The novel centers on Leila Reynolds, a rookie attorney thrust into a complex murder case that becomes dangerously personal. Not only is she navigating unfamiliar legal waters. She must also contend with her husband serving as the prosecutor while protecting her own buried secrets. Why the bold course correction? This innovative approach to continuing the series addresses a unique challenge the production team faced. The first season was based on Turow’s bestselling novel Presumed Innocent. But the team saw no clear path forward within Turow’s existing works for a second season. So rather than force a continuation of the original story, the creative team, led by TV veterans David E. Kelley and J.J. Abrams, chose to reinvent the series. But it maintained a core focus on legal intrigue and personal drama. Sources close to the production suggest that while the show is embracing change, discussions have suggested carrying over one or two characters from the first season, similar to HBO’s successful strategy with The White Lotus. However, these plans remain unconfirmed. Both Apple TV+ and Warner Bros. Television declined to comment on details. Gyllenhaal remains an executive producer on the show The powerhouse creative team remains largely intact, with executive producers Kelley, Abrams and Gyllenhaal returning alongside Dustin Thomason, Matt Tinker and Rachel Rusch Rich. Abrams’ Bad Robot Productions and David E. Kelley Productions produce the series in association with Warner Bros. Television. Hopefully the bold new direction will pay off for Apple TV+ subscribers who made Presumed Innocent the platform’s most-viewed drama to date.
