  "text": "Amazon Prime’s Big Deal Days runs today and tomorrow, so just as I did for Prime Day before it, I’ve scoured the thousands of available deals for the best gear that I’ve used, tested, and love. For more of the gear that Federico and I use, check out our Setups page, too. Here are my top Prime Big Deal Days picks: Apple Hardware and Accessory Deals Studio Display with Stand (16% off) Apple’s Studio Display has been out for quite a while now, so it’s a regular among Amazon deals. I’ve been using mine for over two years, and it’s the perfect Mac or iPad compliment if you want a big, bright, and crisp display at your desk. MagSafe Charger (16% off) Apple recently updated its MagSafe charging puck that I use with my AirPod Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. The updated charger, which is Qi2 compatible, allows my iPhone to charge more quickly than was possible with earlier iPhone and charger pairings. Apple Pencil Pro (24% off) The Apple Pencil Pro isn’t an accessory that I use every day, but between Smart Script and the radial menu that appears when you squeeze the Pencil’s barrel, I’ve found myself using it more and more for taking notes, editing video in Final Cut Pro, and navigating the web. iPad Pro (11-inch) with M4 chip (10% off) I’ve had my 11-inch iPad Pro for a while now, and its M4 chip makes it the fastest device I own. That speed is handy for rendering and upscaling video, editing audio, and other computationally intense tasks. Plus, the display is unparalleled. AirPods Pro 2 (32% off) I use my AirPods Pro 2 every day. They sound great, and I take advantage of their active noise cancelation and transparency modes all the time. Soon, you’ll be able to use this model to test your hearing, and they’ll double as over-the-counter hearing aids, which will bring even more value to an already great product. Videogame Deals PlayStation 5 Slim (10% off) I have the original PS5, but Federico loves the slim model, which takes up less space in your home. With Astro Bot vying for game of the year on many reviewers’ lists, now is a great time to pick up a PS5 Slim if you don’t already have one. Playstation 5 Games Some of the best PS5 games are on sale too: Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales (43% off) God of War Ragnarök (42% off) Ratchet \u0026 Clank: Rift Apart (37% off) The Last of Us Part II Remastered (20% off) Rise of the Ronin SanDisk Nintendo-Branded microSD Cards I’m a sucker for these SanDisk microSD cards that include Nintendo iconography. Even though I jam them into a device rarely to be seen again, I like knowing they’re “Nintendo” cards. It doesn’t hurt that they’re fast, high-quality cards, too. I love the 256GB Super Mario Super Star cards (53% off) for retro handhelds and the Zelda 1TB cards (43% off) for my Switch because they can fit my entire game library. Other Deals Samsung T9 4TB External SSD (45% off) I own a couple of these 4TB SSDs and a couple of 2TB models, too. All of them have held up well over many months acting as Time Machine and Carbon Copy Cloner backups as well as outboard storage. With USB-C 3.2, these drives are fast, which makes them perfect for large backup jobs or moving around large sets of files. WD 20TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive (47% off) I’ve had the 18TB version of this USB-C 3.0 drive for almost a year, and it’s been fantastic because I can archive old project files and create backups for multiple devices, and I still have room to spare. It’s not super fast or quiet, but connected to my always-on Mac mini server, this drive has been perfect. Logitech Pebble 2 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Mac (21% off) I originally bought the Logitech Pebble keyboard and mouse to have a lightweight set of input devices that I could use with Windows handheld consoles. I still use the setup for that, but I’ve found that they are also a great fit with the iPad because they’re slim and light, making moving them around the house easy. UGREEN 200W USB-C Charger (23% off) I’ve been using this UGREEN desktop charger for a couple of years, and it’s been great because I can tuck it out of the way on one side of my desk where it’s barely noticeable. Then, if I have multiple devices to charge, I can stack them up and plug everything in at once. With 200W of power available, I can even plug in three or four devices at once and charge them quickly with the charger’s four USB-C and two USB-A ports. Anker 727 Charging Station (41% off) I use the Anker 727 Charging Station for connecting gaming consoles to an external display. With two standard wall outlets, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports, this charging station can come in handy for a wide variety of scenarios where you have just one available wall outlet but need more options. Belkin SoundForm Connect AirPlay 2 Adapter and Receiver (34% off) I have an older pair of Harman Kardon SoundSticks that only work over Bluetooth, but thanks to the Belkin SoundForm Connect, they now work just like any other AirPlay-compatible speaker. This is a great gadget for turning any speaker with a 3.5mm or optical audio input into an AirPlay speaker. Meross Smart Power Strip (24% off) The Meross Smart Power Strip is a good deal even when it isn’t on sale. The device is HomeKit-compatible, and its four outlets can be treated as one or as individual electrical sources in the Home app. The power strip also includes four USB-A ports that can be turned on and off as a single unit.
