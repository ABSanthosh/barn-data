  "text": "News Apple is reportedly looking to increase iPhone battery life the smart way. Image: Cult of Mac Rather than building a bigger battery into the iPhone 17 to extend battery life, Apple reportedly plans to use a smarter power source to achieve the desired result. The company reported is creating an AI system for iOS 19 to “analyze how a person uses their device and make adjustments to conserve energy,” according to a report published Monday. It could be one of many AI-powered features in the version of the iPhone’s operating system expected to launch this autumn. Making a smarter iPhone battery with AI The best handset in the world becomes useless when its battery goes flat. An obvious fix is bigger batteries, but these make for bulkier devices. Instead, Apple works to make its products as efficient as possible. Efficiency could prove especially important for the rumored iPhone 17 Air, which supposedly will be the thinnest ever … so slim its battery might not last some users a full day. Artificial intelligence could boost battery life in the sleek handset — and in the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup, too. That’s if leaked information published by Bloomberg about new AI technology supposedly coming in iOS 19 turns out to be correct. “To create the technology — part of the Apple Intelligence platform — the company is using battery data it has collected from users’ devices to understand trends and make predictions for when it should lower the power draw of certain applications or features,” reports Bloomberg. The same AI could show users on the iPhone’s Lock Screen how long a recharge will take to return their handset’s battery to 100%. Please stand by We might get confirmation of this new feature when Apple’s developers conference kicks off on June 9, as unveiling iOS 19 is surely on the WWDC25 agenda. Or Apple might hold off until unveiling the iPhone 17 Air this fall. Leaks point to an array of other changes coming in iOS 19. It might include a user interface redesign as Apple strives to make iPhone, iPad and Mac look more alike and greater support for external screens. We’re also still waiting for the promised smarter, AI-powered Siri.",
