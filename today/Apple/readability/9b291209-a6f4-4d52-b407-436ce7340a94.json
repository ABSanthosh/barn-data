Photo: Apple TV+ In the week of its season 2 finale,  Severance stayed near the top of the lists of most-watched streaming series, according to a pair of companies that track ratings. Week after week, the weird workplace drama on Apple TV+ keeps beating almost everything on any streaming service. Plus, the new comedy The Studio became one of the popular series on streaming last week. Severance mysteries keep a grip on audiences Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season, and when season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. One company that tracks ratings put the drama at the very top of its ratings charts five times since the new season started. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Severance sits at No. 2 for the week of March 17 through March 23. Rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 3 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of March 20 to March 26. Two ratings services say Severance is among the most popular streaming series in March 2025Charts: Reelgood/JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. But Apple itself chimed in recently, crowing that Severance recently passed Ted Lasso as the most popular Apple TV+ show ever. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. As noted, the season finale of Severance season two debuted last week, so the entire show is ready to binge watch. Be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two, episode three, episode four, episode five, episode six, episode seven, episode eight, episode nine and episode ten. Plus, start looking forward to Severance season three, which already got an official greenlight from Apple. Seth Rogen’s new comedy The Studio gets high ratings, too Plenty of viewers also checked out the recently launched The Studio, a comedy starring Seth Rogen, who also serves as co-creator, writer and director. Reelgood put it in the No. 10 slot on its list of popular shows on any streaming service last week — not a bad result considering the series premiered on the last day of that week. The official Apple TV+ description says: “In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their own insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.” The first two episodes of the series are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Wedneday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Severance, The Studio, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
