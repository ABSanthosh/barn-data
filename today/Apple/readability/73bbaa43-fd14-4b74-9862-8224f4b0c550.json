Photo: Cult of Mac Deals With the PlayAIBox — a combination wireless CarPlay adapter and car streaming device — you can enjoy Apple’s in-car infotainment system, stream video and more without physically connecting your iPhone to your car. It works with nearly all cars, and puts CarPlay (or whatever you want to mirror from your iPhone or Android device) on your in-car display. You could listen to your YouTube watchlist on the road, stream a quick episode of Fallout on your lunch break, or let your kids watch a movie while you watch the road. The first step is to get the PlayAIBox while it’s on sale for $74.97 (regularly $129.99). Disney+ in your car Apple’s CarPlay platform is great, but it’s even better when you go wireless. That means no more fussing with cables every time you get into or out of your automobile.  With the PlayAIBox, CarPlay can keep you safely connected without taking your eyes off the road. You’ll have hands-free access to calls, messages, navigation and music, as well as Siri support. Plus, the PlayAIBox wireless CarPlay adapter is kind of like having a Roku device or Amazon Fire TV stick in your car. In addition to all the benefits of CarPlay (or Android Auto, if that’s your jam), it offers a few bonuses. For safety reasons, CarPlay doesn’t support the YouTube app. But with PlayAIBox, you  mirror your iPhone or Android screen to pull up YouTube and listen or watch whatever you want. (Obviously, you won’t want to watch video while driving. That would be insane.) Stream YouTube, Netflix and more on your car’s screen wirelessly With this in-car streaming device, you follow the same simple process for Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+ and other streaming apps. You can use this wireless CarPlay adapter and streaming dongle to keep the kids entertained on a road trip without needing to buy them tablets. You can even bring your own movies and music by plugging in an SD card with up to 128GB of storage (not included). The setup process is simple. First, check if your car is compatible. The PlayAIBox works with more than 800 vehicle models, though certain makes are incompatible. (The manufacturer says the device is “compatible with 98% of car models 2016-present with OEM wired CarPlay and touchscreen. May not work with cars that have built in wireless CarPlay/Android Auto support as well as select BMW, Tesla, Mazda and Nissan models.”) Once you’ve double-checked that, simply connect your device via Bluetooth, wait a moment and you’re good to go. The first connection takes the longest, with a wait of around 45 seconds. From then on, you can connect to CarPlay wirelessly with this handy adapter every time you hop into your ride. Save on PlayAIBox wireless CarPlay adapter (works with Android Auto, too) Time to take this show on the road. Get the PlayAIBox with CarPlay, Android Auto and streaming support for just $74.97.
