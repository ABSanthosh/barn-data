  "text": "[flagged] The Website Hacker News Is Afraid to Discuss (daringfireball.net) 400 points by jgruber 1 day ago | hide | past | favorite | 214 comments The data was retrieved from the public HN dataset on BigQuery: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40644563 SELECT id, title, url, FORMAT_TIMESTAMP(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%m:%S\", timestamp, \"America/New_York\") AS submission_datetime, score, descendants as comments FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full` WHERE type = \"story\" AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(url, r\"daringfireball\\.net\") ORDER BY submission_datetime How then do you explain DF being #3 from 2007-2021 and #72 from 2021-2025? It’s clearly not blacklisted, but clearly is shitlisted, no? To be more explicit: asking hn@ycombinator.com why some submission vanished in a mysterious way does bring a clear answer in my experience. I wonder can a submitted post be flagged without displaying the leading tag? Because there is definitively something preventing Gruber's posts from reaching the first page although most of his posts are not overtly flagged.But as you say he should ask @dang for more informations. One of the theories I read somewhere is that there may be a threshold number of user-flags before the title gets tagged as [flagged], but flagging that happens fewer than that threshold still serves to down-weight the article. So there could be a lot of user-flags burying the article before it shows up as [flagged]. It must work that way. When I flag articles and they don't immediately show as `[flagged]`. I would guess the number of flags is weighted by upvotes, maybe (but less likely) by the karma of the person flagging the article. The software must track who flags articles since you can lose flagging privilege if you do it frivolously:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12173809As far as I know, once an article is flagged it cannot become unflagged by user action. Only dang can unflag articles he thinks the community deserves to discuss.Articles can also become `[dead]` which I think happens automatically for submissions detected as spam. Per dang, users can vouch for such submissions:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43268468 I think from the way stuff is getting flagged \u0026 the comments, it's really a change in the user base becoming slowly less techo-anarchist/libertarian and more rightwing/authoritarian curious.Something really in the water the last few years in tech circles. Or maybe just disgruntled as the stock compensation infinite money printer has ended. I disagree. Some cursory searches on Clickhouse show me:1. There was an exponential increase in people talking about FOSS, leveling out in 2021.2. There's been an exponential decrease in people talking about startups, leveling out in 2021.With that in mind, remember that there are karma gates to flagging and that you need many fewer flags than upvotes to sink something. My suspicion is that HN had a pretty big culture shift starting around 2016 but really peaking by 2021 that shifted from the old startup, builder focus to its current FOSS, anti-authoritarian mood. In other words the culture that used to be on Slashdot and technical subreddits found its way back onto HN. While the older HN was more homogeneous in its makeup and narrower in its topics it was also a lot less contentious than today's HN is, mirroring the culture found on Reddit and comment sections of tech-focused publications like The Verge. Today's HN is broad, unfocused, and a lot more like a mix of r/technology and r/programming than it used to be.Flaggers, I suspect, have older HN values. They preferred the narrower focus of the old site and really dislike the highly contentious big comment threads that are on today's HN. It's hard to have proof of this since flaggers only interact by flagging, but it certainly is the opinion that I have as an older user well over the karma threshold to flag. As such I suspect we're seeing a culture clash play out where the flaggers are trying to hold onto older HN values while commenters here are engaging with HN in the way it's considered in the zeitgeist today, namely an alternative to tech subreddits.Maybe the flaggers will keep the site balanced between the two perspectives but I suspect either the flaggers will get tired and churn. \u003e ...change in the user base...Agreed. (Change in the user base, or in the sentiments of the user base.)That user base, and its apparent coordination (directed, or emergent), is the main reason I don't engage as much here any more. It's a dirty pool. I'd love to see the results of some kind of sentiment analysis on HN comments over time. My hunch is that HN's user base has gotten deeply more rightwing over the years, similar to what's happening in many other online communities. Related to getting more rightwing: I'd also guess (without knowing the data) that the flagging:user activity ratio has steadily grown over the years. HN users are no longer willing to simply downvote comments/articles they disagree with and move on. We are becoming more interested in attempting to silence these comments/articles via flagging. I'd like to see whether the perceived rightward direction is new, younger people joining, or older people changing.Determining that scientifically is going to be near impossible.Kinda like convincing people to adopt Slashdot's moderation and meta-moderation lol. Pretty much all the stats coming out recently show youth male vote has gone much more +R than in recent history, so could very well be the case of the next gen of SWEs joining HNs and being mad about affronts to orange man.Some of it just feels like a small part of a constellation of cultural/society/business leader behavioral changes which are the natural pendulum swing overcorrection from peak +D sentiment in summer 2020 going back to the other end. Have you looked into how much of DF was about Apple and how much was about Donald Trump during the affected time periods? It seems that you write about tech a lot less and politics a lot more. Which is fine, it's your blog! But don't expect tech enthusiasts to automatically be interested in your opinion on immigration or whatever. Have you looked into the linked article? That's not what gruber is questioning.1. Obviously, a political article on DF is a poor fit2. But DF's non-political articles are also seemingly pooplisted, even ones that are clearly relevant to HN's audience3. There have been quite a few political articles from other sites that have gotten traction on DF without being pooplistedyeah I dunno it doesn't add up to me. i'm not saying it's a conspiracy or anything. perhaps it is just users flagging his articles and not some concerted moderator action. My question was, has Gruber written enough non-political articles to know? Like if the number of high quality, original (many DF posts are just links to content elsewhere), about tech articles is down 90%, then of course his article performance here will be down 90%. And that's before considering that Apple itself may have become less interesting and his writing skills may have slipped (reading too much politics on social media rots the brain, Google Elon Musk to find out more). My question was, has Gruber written enough non-political articles to know? It's easy to answer, right? I scrolled down the front page starting at today while watching some opening day baseball. I generally like DF so I was curious if I was just being biased.I counted:- 25 articles squarely about tech- 7 about politics, though it should be noted that I counted articles about the Signal leak in this category even though they certainly do involve technology- 6 that I considered \"in the middle\"; mostly about Apple's technical choices w.r.t. navigating EU legislation- 3 \"meta\" articles about DF sponsorships, podcast links, etcSo yeah, nowhere near \"90% less tech articles.\" Discarding the latter two categories it's 78% tech coverage. And it's not like he was ever 100% tech coverage. It's clearly not sufficient to explain his stuff getting insta-shitcanned off off of HN's front page, and he was getting shitcanned before Trump was elected in 2016 and he ramped up the politics. In Jan 2025 his archive has 13 articles. 5 were about Trump. One about Pebble was more link than original content. His archive for Jan 2014, Jan 2015, and Jan 2016 is 100% tech. Going from 100% quality content to 54% is a big drop. I'm sure you could get different results focusing on different time periods, but there's a clear shift away from Apple.So here's a question- if John himself is a lot less interested in Apple, and now prefers to discuss Trump or sports, perhaps Apple is a lot less interesting? I still follow it closely, but I no longer try to discuss WWDC or the September events with people I know because generally there's nothing that affects them. Their Apple devices work fine and the improvements aren't big enough to discuss with non-enthusiats. Apple is still a great company, but like IBM and Microsoft before, Apple is no longer the center of innovation. For anecdotal feedback I'm taking myself as an example, although I don't flag, I just don't upvote anymore.(At the same time I think there is a flag problem on HN. I'd recommend /active for a better view into HN discussions.)Historically I should be your target group, I'm a Mac user since it was uncool (and tribal), I think I have DF in my subscriptions since NetNewsWire 1. But I'm just not interested anymore, I fell off as a regular reader.Partly it is topical: I'm rather disinterested in inside baseball or opinions on journalism on Apple. \"Claim Chowder\" as a concept should have staid in the 2000s, I think. My Apple interests are more in the technical details or in the opinions of the wider Indie Devsphere or how people use their technology. Hence Michael Tsai's blog is my favourite Apple blog.And where you touch an Apple business aspect I'm often baffled by your reasoning. That your Apple-vs-EU-opinions are rather outlier opinions I don’t need to recap, although I found the tone of your language sometimes going in an off putting weird direction, almost as if those Europeans should not allowed to give themselves laws.But even when I share the complaint of a critical article of yours there is a fundamental disconnect. Taking your recent \"Rotten\" post: You closed the article with the hope of someone berating the lower ranks of Apple like Jobs did with MobileMe. I found that sociopathic by Jobs then and I find the suggestion absurd today. Telling the slaves to row harder has never motivated someone, I think.And even if, the software problem at Apple is managerial. Senior management invented the annual releases, probably for the Christmas season. Senior management started to announce features in advance, pushing them back more and more in the release year. Senior management releases features before they are ready. In my opinions the directly responsible individuals are Federighi and Dye, as good as that hair may be. And for all of it: Cook himself.Plus: Apple's position has fundamentally changed. Instead of an upstart, it is a trillion-dollar-behemoth. That changes how we look at the company. And the company has deeply changed, like all tech company they become more vertical and insular in their services (“Feudal” is a wrong metaphor, historically speaking, but it goes to an emotional truth). Why should we root for them anymore?Recently I tried helping someone to get a file from a PC to their iPhone. The best options were either weird file sharing services or an USB stick like a barbarian. I blame Apple. I remember a time when computers could talk to each other, based on shared, open technical standards. Of course I blame Apple. I been reader for a long time and this is my observation. From 2021-2025, Daring fireball's article were either boring or very few far in between. Most are either also ran reviews of Apple products, or just rants. The best article he came out with recently was the \"something rotten in Cupertino\", and is also when I notice a big uptick in frequency of blogs. It was well derserved ranking, or should I say FAIR. It's certainly possible there's a backend flag on the site.But from the comments I see on Reddit, I suspect there may be a simpler explanation: a lot of people for some reason really dislike John Gruber and view him as someone who slavishly praises Apple.I'm a big John Gruber fan, and I don't think this is true in the slightest. I think he thinks carefully, forms his own opinions, and is very willing to intensely criticize Apple as evidenced by his recent article on the State of Cupertino.But this means his pro and con opinions don't match typical opinions and this makes him polarizing. And hence some people will flag his articles reflexively or post reflexive dismissals. And Hacker News is heavily weighted to downrank polarizing articles.I've seen this same pattern happen with other topics where an article doesn't match the zeitgeist, even it the article itself is not flamebait. I think the Something Rotten in the State of Cupertino should have been at the top of Hacker News.But overall the algorithm has kept HN an interesting place. Any good moderation policy has side effects and tradeoffs.Dang would be the one to know, but it looks to me there's an innocuous explanation here. As for transparency, it's always frustrating to have it. But transparency in algo's invites gaming of those same algo's (and I don't mean by John). So I wouldn't expect the HN modteam to publish details about their algo.Edit: since I posted this, the article was flagged. Which I think may support the thesis. I will say the mod team might consider a vouch feature for articles the way one exists for users/comments. I think it ought to take a lot of vouching to counteract flags, but there are clearly articles where this is warranted. The OPSec breach this week was one of them (and it was restored). \u003e But overall the algorithm has kept HN an interesting place. Any good moderation policy has side effects and tradeoffs.I don’t think so. From his follow-up:\u003e My thesis is that the above might once have been an accurate summary of how Hacker News functions, but hasn’t been for years, and that there now exists a cabal of moderator/admins with their thumbs on the scale, and their personal predilections are the primary steering force of what’s permitted to surface and what gets ghosted. This moderation cabal operates more or less in secret. Their actions, and thus even their usernames, are invisible — lest the HN community discover that it’s steering things about as much as Maggie Simpson is.Sounds right to me. He cited the mod guidelines, which include:\u003eOther factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action.It's very plausible to me that there IS a negative site weighting to DF. But that it might come from the aggregate history of flags or angry/contentious comments posted on DF articles.It certainly could be a personal moderator thumb on the scale, but at the scale of HN I'd expect they have some automated formula for site weighting based on the other factors mentioned. I think a simpler theory for this or any site not ranking high is that a small group of users consistently flag the posts, and flags carry a lot of weight.We've seen this more blatantly with Elon articles. Almost any submission that paints him in a negative light gets flagged quickly and rarely makes the front page. This is paranoid conspiracy-theory stuff. Or it's bait. It's also not falsifiable. Dang can disclaim it but Gruber's next step would just be to write \"of course dang would say that.\"Frankly, I find this submission and Gruber's followup insufferable and it makes me want to read him less. I say that as a regular reader of his blog who's purchased several of his t-shirts over the years. But really, these posts alone make me no longer a fan. The treatment of Daring Fireball articles does feel inorganic to me, but if it is, no one who's talking can say whether it's because of mod abuse or a group of users who really hate the site and want to punish it.And ... while I can understand frustration and disappointment on his end, the long post yesterday, let alone a second post, and apparently now discussion of it on a podcast where he was a guest, is overboard. He often comes across as a touch full of himself, and it's on blatant display here. Don't blame anyone for being turned off. I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I don't think it's unique to DF. As someone who values design, I've noticing for a long time that it's become harder and harder for design-related content to gain traction on HN (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26901208).I think the explanation here is that HN has taken a hard turn towards Linux/OSS. Not to say those weren't always popular topics, but HN used to be a place for software and hardware generally, with an emphasis on making things, OSS being an obviously important component of that. Now OSS is emphasized more. To illustrate, let's do a thought experiment: Let's say someone in the industry does a detailed explanation of the VFX pipeline for a blockbuster movie, and compare that with an someone doing the same for an indie side-project using Blender. There was a time both of those would have been popular on HN, today I'd only bet on the second making it to the front page. Note I'm not making a value judgment here, just something I've observed. \u003e I suspect there may be a simpler explanation: a lot of people for some reason really dislike John Gruber and view him as someone who slavishly praises Apple.I think you are right. Defending Apple's customer unfriendly policies that forced the EU's hand has turned a lot of people off.I've been a long time reader of Gruber's, pretty much since he starts. And he's always favored Apple in a way that was reasonable. But the defense of the things Apple does that harms customers is not reasonable, and I think that turned off a lot of his former fans. I agree with this explanation. There is a sizable contingent of commenters on here who are just extremely negative on everything Apple. I read most of the big Apple threads and they're just overwhelmingly negative toward the company and, honestly, not very thoughtful. I think this has been a developing trend since I've been on HN. Since Gruber is coming at things from a pro-Apple, but nuanced place, I'm not at all surprised that his articles don't do well. That's possible, but the problem is his take on Apple's customer unfriendly policies is not nuanced at all. That’s exactly a topic that I think HN is collectively unhinged about, so I don’t even bother commenting. But I spend a lot of money with Apple and I like everything about their ecosystem, especially the locked down, Disneyland-esque sterile experience on my phone. I think most people would probably consider that acceptable as a specialty product, but chafe against it being half of a duopoly. And I think it's also grown less and less acceptable to people as Google (and Microsoft, for the other duopoly Apple contributes to) have also become increasingly anti-consumer.I don't resent the existence of Disneyland, but I probably would if 90% of all outdoor parks I could visit were either Disneyland or Facebookland. I suspect there may be a simpler explanation: a lot of people for some reason really dislike John Gruber and view him as someone who slavishly praises Apple. This is most definitely true but he, and Apple, have always been very polarizing. I don't think either one has become more polarizing? And if so, certainly not in some extremely sudden way that would explain DF's popularity on HN falling off of a cliff.HN's crowd has changed since its inception, but again, not in some really abrupt way. \u003e And hence some people will flag his articles reflexively or post reflexive dismissals.Prophetic. The Flagaroons have attacked. \"But this means his pro and con opinions don't match typical opinions and this makes him polarizing. And hence some people will flag his articles reflexively or post reflexive dismissals. And Hacker News is heavily weighted to downrank polarizing articles.\"The downranking is particularly weird since HN's professed norms go extremely hard on something along the lines of \"you should take atypical opinions seriously since they're more likely to contain new information than opinions that are conventional-wisdom-with-a-few-little-sprinkles-on-top.\" Sometimes the HN audience is very diligent about this norm. Reactions to Gruber's writing from the HN crown often show marked deficiencies in adherence to this norm. I'm not sure what, if anything, should be done about that by Gruber or HN's moderators, but I do believe that the problem is not located in Gruber's writing. \u003e The downranking is particularly weird since HN's professed norms go extremely hard on something along the lines of \"you should take atypical opinions seriously since they're more likely to contain new information than opinions that are conventional-wisdom-with-a-few-little-sprinkles-on-top.\"HN's \"professed norms\" (i.e., the guidelines) do not state that, and opinions, atypical or otherwise, have zero information content beyond the information that so-and-so holds such-and-such opinion.Atypical opinions may be, on average, more likely to be accompanied by intellectually interesting arguments, but that's, at best, a loose correlation, not an iron law that where one thing occurs the other will also. This is not at all weird if you are a HN user with somewhat unpopular opinions. The HN guidelines say flag something if it's egregious. People end up treating flagging as a stronger version of downvotes.My most recent experience being flagged matches this up: I was presenting an argument that Chrome's manifest V3 is a good thing and it was flagged to death. I have no doubt that some users just flag this kind of opinion reflexively. \u003eI'm a big John Gruber fanWhich is the problem and why I would guess that there is an automatic downranking to the domain, and why many knee-jerk flag entries from the site. Not that you specifically are a fan, but that a big enough minority of HN users would describe themselves as such and would submit and upvote entries from the site.The bulk of DF entries could best be described as opinion/my-take type content. What does John think about screen sizes (e.g. 3.5 inches is the \"sweet spot\"), or Mark Gurman, the EU, etc.Opinions generally do poorly here, for good reason. It is the junk food of content. It's easy and entertaining to read, especially if it agrees with our own notions so it's self-assuring, and if I think Apple are great I love to read opinions on why the EU are wrong with their DMA push, etc.I would also argue it's the laziest content to write. The whole blog-rush were millions of people spinning up blogs to give their hot take on Current Zeitgeist Thing, but then it turned out that more people want to write that than read it so it faded away.But because there were numbers of fans here, every Gruber opinion would shoot to the top of HN. It takes a tiny minority of HN users to make a story hit #1 -- right now the top four stories have barely dozens of upvotes -- so it would happen again and again and again, and people would click through and see an opinion about some thing and click back and they'd have no down arrow. Nor does the site weight \"click throughs but didn't vote up\". So people flag. Eventually, I presume, a domain downranking was applied.Daring Fireball isn't the only domain like this. There are various other \"I'm a fan of this guy!\" type personalities that would constantly top HN despite the content arguably not deserving it. Content that if it came from anywhere else would be considered blog spam. Content that could literally be just a comment on HN.There is another comment that opines that they want to see more daringfireball content on HN. I mean, they could just visit his site, or they could just hit https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net, but what they really seem to mean is that they want everyone else to see more content from DF.It's also ridiculous how people keep trying to make this an anti-Apple thing. Apple product announcements and technology releases do extremely well on here. Those have a real impact on the lives of most users of HN, whereas DF opinion entries don't.\u003esince I posted this, the article was flagged. Which I think may support the thesisWhines about voting/moderation on HN almost always do extremely poorly on here. In this case DF has had multiple multi-hundred upvoted submissions on here over the past couple of months, and the entitlement of actually complaining that every random post doesn't do numbers absolutely deserves to be flagged. \u003e Opinions generally do poorly here, for good reason. It is the junk food of content. It's easy and entertaining to read, especially if it agrees with our own notions so it's self-assuring, and if I think Apple are great I love to read opinions on why the EU are wrong with their DMA push, etc.This perspective on opinions doesn't seem accurate to me, e.g., opinion pieces (especially favorable) on Emacs, Neovim, and Blender seem to do really well here. I also disagree with the junk food characterization, I think people taking a strong stance on why they like something is often really valuable.\u003e There is another comment that opines that they want to see more daringfireball content on HN. I mean, they could just visit his site, or they could just hit https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net, but what they really seem to mean is that they want everyone else to see more content from DF.For the record, I personally share things here when I think they're worth discussing, i.e., it isn't because I want people to see something, it's because I want them to talk about it. \u003eopinion pieces (especially favorable) on Emacs, Neovim, and Blender seem to do really well hereYears and years ago, absolutely. There would be endless \"Why I Love NoSQL\" posts, then \"Why NoSQL Sucks\" the next day, each getting quickly pushed to the top by factions that don't even bother reading it they just agree with the title. That sort of thing gets quickly flagged to death now[1]. If you want that sort of content to do well it often has a lot of work, graphs, examples, evidence, etc, and even then HNers seem to actively detect when sites/authors are trying to use HN as an impression funnel and start to penalize it.On your specific examples (emacs, neovim, blender) a quick search on hn algolia returns few opinion-type piece with more than single digit upvotes for years. I actually found none but wasn't looking super hard.HN has shifted, and I would argue for the better. If you disagree with something on here, writing a hot take counterpoint blog entry and submitting it will likely flop. A few personalities using HN as their personal traffic funnel has faded.\u003eI personally share things here when I think they're worth discussingDF could add comments, though Gruber rejected them as a distraction from his own writing, so there's that.[1] One of the flagged posts in /active is a \"Why I'm Boycotting AI\", which is basically a \"take\" piece. It can still feed that \"that's my opinion\" sentiment and see upvotes, but it broadly grows tiring. This is the first thing I found searching for `vim` by date and finding something with enough upvotes to look like it made it to the homepage https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43168781Compare that to this piece from DF that I submitted that didn't make it to the homepage https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42231308The former is fine, but says nothing that hasn't been said about Vim a million times before, the latter is a detailed analysis of the way Apple functions from a small angle with huge implications (e.g., acquisitions like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro continue to be industry pillars).I don't like disparaging anyone's work the first piece is fine, but this comparison easily illustrates which piece is being treated with the kids gloves, and which sends some folks fuming.Look to be clear, I love Vim, it's the main app I use to do my work everyday, but it doesn't have the problem where you can't have a rational discussion about it like with Apple.Hacker News used to the place where you'd have a discussion about whether Apple acquiring Pixelmator has a chance to make it a Photoshop competitor, now instead it's the place where programmer's try to tell photographers that Photoshop peaked in 2007 and that they should really try Krita (so no I don't think HN has \"shifted for the better\", I miss those conversations). Pushed to the negatives? Outrageous!I'm writing a \"Why HN is conspiring against me: Earlier posts did well, but this one didn't\" essay and will promptly submit it to HN. It had better do well!I feel like Gruber fans are brigading this posts and the voting is very unfair. Stop the count!EDIT: While I wrote this comment out of humour it turns out that Gruber is quite literally funnelling his readers to this submission from his blog. So...hint of truth. \u003e But this means his pro and con opinions don't match typical opinions and this makes him polarizing. And hence some people will flag his articles reflexively or post reflexive dismissals. And Hacker News is heavily weighted to downrank polarizing articles.I suspect this is it. A subset of users flag and/or downvote daringfireball on sight if it reaches the front page and the HN algorithm treats that as a strong single I doubt you intended it, but your comment actually exemplifies why a lot of his articles likely get flagged and downranked. The comment is contentious, and also asserts that it is per se impossible for someone to disagree with the EU's stance on interoperability in good faith or that there may be legit downsides.Then you deliver an extended personal attack for some reason. And one that really doesn't seem supported on the merits. Gruber co-created markdown and published a reasonably well received app, Vesper.I think you're in good faith, and I mean my comment in that spirit. I point out the features of yours to show why the articles may get flagged if they generate comments that go against the spirit of the site.I think there's a strong case your comment goes against comment guidelines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7I glanced at the rest of your comments. None of them are remotely close to this! You're a polite and interesting commentator.My thesis is that for whatever reason John Gruber manages to draw this style of comment out of people, and that this has increased over time as anti Apple sentiment has grown.That's not John Gruber's fault and that isn't your fault, it's just the dynamic that emerges.Comment Guidelines: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html \u003e it is per se impossible for someone to disagree with the EU's stance on interoperability in good faith or that there may be legit downsides.Oh, you can definitely disagree. The problem is in good faith which Gruber shows none of. To the point of going from \"why the hell would you want to change your Messages default app\" to \"oh, it absolutely makes sense to chaneg the messages default app but it makes no sense to change Photos, EU is bad\" in a blink of an eye. The parent's point stands. Their comment isn't lacking context, and fundamentally it sounds like we all agree with their argument; the sentiment towards Apple has changed, and the environment these blogposts exist in is not the same. Gruber started blogging in an era when people had hope for Tim Cook, a sentiment that has basically dried up entirely today. The starry-eyed optimism for local-first development is dead in the Apple Intelligence era, and Apple's vision for the future is muddled.Yes, this is the dynamic that emerges. When trust breaks down over silly things like keyboard reliability and right to repair and third-party app stores and $99/year service fees, people that were once rooting for Apple start to question why we hold out hope at all. It's not Gruber's fault for remaining faithful, but many of his modern articles are out-of-touch with the reality of Apple's situation. It's like performative bewilderment at this point, which this OP article really seems to reflect. \u003eThe comment is contentious, and also asserts that it is per se impossible for someone to disagree with the EU's stance on interoperability in good faithOr qiestion moon landing in good faith Thanks for bringing my attention to the comment guidelines, I'll try to keep to them in the future. I assure you, I do write here in good faith.I'm open to listening to those who oppose the EU's position on Apple's ecosystem. I draw the line at people comparing Apple's circumstances with those portrayed in Harrison Bergeron. Apple, its developer community and its app ecosystem are unlike anyone in that story, and they certainly aren't oppressed rebels. That comparison was an editorial choice made by John Gruber in his coverage of tech news, including a link to a copy of the story he personally typeset. It rang loudly then of sentimental bias, and it's still ringing.I don't have evidence of the makeup of the Daring Fireball readership, but many of them are at least adjacent to the tech industry, and so his words have incredible reach, Hacker News notwithstanding. But what are his credentials? When he weighs the merits of a programming language, an API, a platform, or anything technical, I want him to speak from experience. Collaborating with Aaron Swartz twenty-one years ago on Markdown is respectfully not very relevant technical experience in the domains DF traditionally covers. Vesper was one ObjC app written by three people in 2013. I'm glad it was well-received, but again, what significance does Gruber's experience have? Why should the industry listen to him when he (admittedly not so often nowadays) discusses software development? If asked, I think he'd strongly agree that people in power should have considerable relevant experience.PS— the article that began this discussion is, \"The Website Hacker News Is Afraid to Discuss\". As you can see, I've been eager, not afraid, to discuss the merits of Daring Fireball, though not so eager as to upvote it on HN. \u003e But what are his credentials? When he weighs the merits of a programming language, an API, a platform, or anything technical, I want him to speak from experience.Sure, but he doesn't actually do that very much, does he? Like, that is absolutely not the focus of the blog. He talks a lot about the business of Apple, Apple's products and their direction, and how Apple interacts with various communities.I don't think someone needs to have an engineering degree to have a valid opinion about the things the EU is telling Apple to do. Apple's business relies tremendously on its developer relations. If Gruber doesn't regularly navigate that wedge of the ecosystem, then I don't think he can speak with authority on its soundness. I mean I wouldn't! I'd say that knowing and interacting with a lot of active developers probably counts. As far as I can tell, he has those connections. Thanks in turn for the thoughtful reply. I still hold to my own view, but you've dramatically raised the quality of argument I'd have to make to give a satisfying reply. Which is what I think Hacker News should aspire to.My interest was largely to point out what I saw as the meta trend around discussion of Daring Fireball posts, so I'll leave the debate there or we could be here all night. But I wish you well On a small point, from what I understand, I think full credits must be given to JG on MD it seems to be his own idea and implementation, my recollection of what I heard him discuss about it on his podcast in the past, was that Aaron Swartz helped him with some ideas and notes. Thanks for the correction! I'd edit my original comment if I could; it certainly makes the point stronger.If creating Markdown doesn't make you a technologist, what does? \u003e Case in point: just the other day, he equated the EU's rulings about Apple's ecosystem to the dystopian short story Harrison Bergeron. Rah, rah, Goliath! Sis boom bah!That was actually just over a year ago, and was in response to the US DOJ antitrust investigation (and didn't mention the EU at all). But, perhaps the fact that you remember it as \"just the other day\" is a hint that my suggesting \"Harrison Bergeron\" as a metaphor was uncomfortable but apt?https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/23/harrison-berger... I don't read your blog because your analyses ring true. I read your blog because you are an impactful pundit who I can stomach. Thoughtful people with large followings bore unspoken biases throughout the past and present, and it is my purposeful exercise to engage with the content of one who's alive mainly talks about Apple.I suspect you have many readers like me. I don't mean that we all disagree with you the exact same way— that would be absurd. I mean that we'll read something sincere but misguided, because that's a valuable element of discourse.Your Harrison Bergeron allusion wasn't apt, it was memorably cringey, a local extremum. It was ridiculous on its face. We can't know what Vonnegut would think of it, but he might have chosen to write you into Cat's Cradle. He created markdown, does that not tick the programmer / technologist box? Few people will create anything quite as impactful. He defined markdown 2 decades ago, and the definition had so many problems (ambiguities, etc) that people felt the need to define better definitions like Commonmark. Two decades ago. Does that mean his take on smartphone screen size or Blue Sky vs Threads is anything HN in general needs to hear? Probably not.But I'll bet if he wrote a considered piece on \"The Next Generation of Markdown\" or something it would do numbers.I mean, they compared him with Richard M. Stallman, who we know was extraordinarily consequential and influential in technology, but that doesn't mean his takes on oil or judges or whatever matters. I mean, RMS is still plugging away with posts and I've seen zero of them on this site. If RMS or Gruber released code with any frequency, I think the HN community would be very interested. I wouldn't necessarily warm up to either of them, but it would lend a lot of credence to whatever their stances are. \u003e John Gruber can be thoughtful and form his own opinion while still being an Apple shill.Cannot parse. Maybe using the word \"shill\" is putting too fine a point in it? Maybe. I landed on \"shill\" because it's a word he chose, and it seemed to fit when I read it. Let me try and define what it means, and how it's different from an advocate, an apologist or a sycophant.A shill promotes something to others partly because that thing's success aligns with their prosperity. That causal chain motivates them to look past the thing's flaws, the people it negatively impacts, and the merits of its alternatives. If we're talking about an org with a stance or policy, the shill is incentivized to align with the org's stance over the stance of its competitors, its customers, and even the org's previous stances, because it's the org in its current incarnation that rewards the shill. However, if the org does something to jeopardize its relation to the shill's prosperity, the shill can criticize the org. Pom poms are optional.Can someone with intelligence and an open mind be a shill? I emphatically believe so. Well-working minds and hearts can compartmentalize, rationalize and internalize. They can strengthen cognitive dissonance. The incentive to shill can live snugly in that habitat.Sidenote— In my personal opinion, if there were slightly more or louder John Grubers in the world, there'd be far fewer John Calhouns. Yeah, that was where I had a problem — a shill in my mind always toes the line, cannot be objective.(I'm too dense to understand your last sentence. :-) Sometimes when I take time to cogitate on a thing it will come to me though.) A good shill won't always toe the line. That would be too obvious.A shill should levy just enough dissent to retain some credibility among the most credulous. Usually by piling on to obviously losing causes. For instance if someone were an Apple shill, saying that the App Store review process is broken, the royalty split is untenable, XCode is shite and Apple's AI has been pretty bad are all obvious positions to take. These are blatant, undeniable positions.Someone could have those public positions and still be a shill.Is Gruber a shill? I mean, he seems entire dependant upon the Apple fanbase[1] for his income, and a lot of his credibility comes from access that Apple directly grants him. They give him products. He gets to host his \"Talk Show\" live at WWDC. He has done a number of interviews with Apple executives. He seems pretty firmly attached to the Apple teat and they serve up a supply of nutritious milk for him.The base post was flagged, presumably because it used the shill label, but it's pretty hard to get away from it. And maybe that's perfectly fine, and the industry has a lot of shills for different things and we all factor in where they're coming from. Most HNers expect a \"rose coloured glasses about Apple\" perspective from Gruber, so it is weighted against the content.[1] The Apple fanbase are a subset of Apple users. I'm typing this on an M4 Mac. My iPhone and iPad sit beside me. I'm a subscriber to Apple One Premier. Yet I'm not a fan. I don't, for instance, care at all how much profit Apple makes, much less excitedly gloating about what percentage of the market's profit they make. Nor do I get angry that Samsung copied some UI element or phone shape. Those are fan type topics. It's well documented that user flags affect the ranking of stories even before stories are marked as [flagged]. While flagging certainly contributes to the lack of discussion on your articles, I believe that the main reason is that, for the most part, the Hacker News audience is less interested in your take than it used to be.Case in point: In recent months, a lot of recent Trump/Elon posts have been flagged and disappeared from the front page, but still managed to garner hundreds of points and comments. My assumption is that a significant portion of users use hn.algolia.com, circumventing the flagging algorithm. Personally, I've recently found myself using hn.algolia.com (filtering for top stories in the last 24h) more often than news.ycombinator.com.If your issue was purely flagging-related, your articles should be able to generate engagement. That's why I'm saying I think there is a lack of interest.Personally, while I appreciate your work, it's become less interesting to me over time. The value of your blog to me is mainly around getting a perspective into how a die-hard Apple fan would think about a certain topic. This was fun in the period from 2007 until some point in the mid-2010s, when smartphones were revolutionary and the iPhone vs. Android ecosystem battle was still relevant. But ever since phones converged into commodities, it just stopped being interesting. No one is emotionally invested in their choice of phone anymore.Don't take my word for it. Compare the Google Trends for MacRumors [0] and Daring Fireball [1]. Both faced a sharp decline starting in the mid-2010s. It's not a surprise that engagement on Hacker News would mirror those trends.[0] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all\u0026geo=US\u0026q=%...[1] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all\u0026geo=US\u0026q=%... I don't see how a blog post complaining about vote counts is any more interesting than a comment complaining about vote counts. But ok, I'll bite. The articles are not ranked well because they're not interesting or useful.The one DF article I remember seeing recently is \"Why Can’t We Screenshot Frames From DRM-Protected Video on Apple Devices?\" and it seemed like just a fluffy post without any technical info and without any research, just an excuse to dog on other operating systems.Why do some setups allow screenshots and some don't? His post starts with \"I’m not entirely sure\" and doesn't get better from there. You can google \"what is widevine\" and get better info. In reality, different browsers and different OS's are certified to different Widevine levels, depending on whether the content goes through a sufficiently protected hardware path. But in Gruber's world, \"streaming services somehow don’t care about what Windows users do\" (spoiler alert, they obviously do), and you can take screenshots on Windows because \"Windows uses a less sophisticated imaging pipeline\" (naturally, because it wasn't created by the sophisticated Steve Jobs!)These posts are the tabloids of the tech world, and uninteresting unless you need a source to cite to win an argument about why your favorite computer company is morally superior to all the other computer companies. How then do you explain DF ranking #3 from 2007-2021, but dropping to #78 from 2021-2025? Are you saying my writing was significantly more interesting and useful for the first 14 years but dropped off a cliff starting in 2021, and the keen HN audience noticed the change immediately?You're making a perhaps-legitimate case for why DF should never have ranked well at HN. But the data shows that the opposite is true: for 14 years it was very popular here. I've enjoyed your work for close to multiple decades, probably fell on it back in 2005 from MacRumors, but much less in recent times. And I don't want to knock anyone's work, but I'll give you my perspective in good faith.1. Writing about Apple simply isn't interesting anymore. Nor has it been for close to a decade. They lost me around the butterfly keyboard fiasco.I know this isn't the full body of your work, but it's plenty of it. As a professional in the tech space for over 25 years, I went from being a devout Apple follower (installed the OSX beta on my Tibook back in the day), to basically not caring. They've gone from being innovative and evolving, and the best mix of Unix+GUI, to just being a system I'm forced to use for work. I'd rather use a Thinkpad/XPS/etc with Linux for anything else.2. Your writing has gotten dramatically more... cynical over the years? Maybe it's just a side effect of growing older, as I know I have too. But it's also why I stopped blogging on my blog, which was popular enough in enough circles.Like I said, this is just my perspective, so you can call me full of crap or whatever. \u003e 1. Writing about Apple simply isn't interesting anymore. Nor has it been for close to a decade. They lost me around the butterfly keyboard fiasco.I think this might have a lot to do with it. I considered myself a devout Apple fanboy a decade ago, but every software release and new product they've developed has been less and less interesting. It feels like they're abandoning me as a customer as I get older. And every former fanboy has that one \"straw broke the camel's back\" moment they can point to where they lost the faith. For you it was the terrible keyboards, for many it was the headphone jack. For me, it was a tiny change: They quietly dropped support for 1080i resolution around the time of macOS 10.5 or 11. Suddenly my Mac that ran my home theater could no longer drive my TV, just because Apple decided \"fuck this guy, we're not going to support this anymore.\"I still have an iPhone 7. No phone released since then have I really cared about enough to bother upgrading. I don't give a shit about emojis and chat stickers and more annoying notifications that butt into my life. I tried a lot of dates and I don't see any step change. I see a gradual decline. 2006-present: 5th 2010-present: 7th 2015-present: 19th 2020-present: 29th Who knows why that is. Maybe HN's audience has changed over the decades. Maybe your writing has. Maybe the novelty factor for Apple content is gone. Maybe there's just more competition for the front page now that HN is more mainstream. I just think it's unlikely that PG woke up one day and decided to screw you in particular.The Simpsons had far too many seasons, but Matt Groening eventually went on to create Futurama. I hope you figure things out. That “gradual decline” is an artifact of your maths, in which you're gradually changing the weight of recent years.Consider a sequence with an extreme drop-off: 100, 100, 100, 100, 40. Taking averages of all the numbers, then all but the first, all but the first 2, and so on, yields: 88, 85, 80, 70, 40. That might look like it includes a gradual decline, but clearly there's nothing gradual in the underlying data. Right you are, good catch. Here it is broken down by year then. year rank ---- ---- 2007 80 2008 13 2009 3 2010 1 2011 2 2012 9 2013 78 2014 14 2015 305 2016 363 2017 7 2018 65 2019 28 2020 7 2021 106 2022 353 2023 86 2024 82 I still don't see a step change. 2022 was bad, but not as bad as that slump in 2015-2016. \u003e I don't see how a blog post complaining about vote counts is any more interesting than a comment complaining about vote countsI see it as highly interesting, because the reason as to why is very fascinating. I know that's a problem around here to discuss, but I never understood why. I would like to see more DF on HN. The something rotten in Cupertino was a shattering post—people in my circle who do not read DF were discussing and sending it around, and I work at a place where so many dang people read HN. So I agree with Gruber’s concern.I’m surprised this post too is already flagged. Agree!To be clear though it is not some backend thing by dang etc. but rather users with enough reputation to get the flag button are flagging your posts just because they don’t like you. That is the likeliest explanation. The only explanation I have heard that makes sense is: The [flagged] tag only appears after a certain threshold amount of user-flags, however each user-flag contributes to the down-weight of the story.So if the [flagged] threshold is 10 user-flags, then 9 people can flag the article, burying it, and then only at the next user-flag, [flagged] shows up in the title.Of course, nobody but HN staff truly knows if this is how it works. The apparent 'ban' may related to the site's popularity.Who knows how the algorithm here works exactly, but people submit daringfireball links regularly......and few HN users would like HN to function as a link aggregator that just shows a random selection of the same dozen sites, day after day.One solution would be to penalise domains a little the more frequently they are submitted. Seems like a plausible explanation. Well, if John is correct, it's not too surprising that it is flagged...I've noticed that being critical of Musk or Trump is a flag-magnet as well.. I guess either the owners of the site are cough \"free-speech absolutists\" or there's some concerted effort to prevent criticism of them - the former seems a lot more likely. I'm pretty sure it's just individual people with enough karma doing a knee-jerk flagging on articles they don't like.Would be nice if someone with access to the backend checked the flagging stats to see if there's a ring of people doing it. It’s not just Gruber. As both a medium-high HN karma person and a Gruber fan I can say there is a definite reduction in the overall quality of discourse around Apple news versus general topics on HN. Much more knee jerk reactions.I theorize this is due to the overall startup versus incumbents focus as well as the hacker ethos of being opposed to more buttoned up closed systems meant for the general public. Like for example recent posts on EU regulation of Apple get generally favorable reactions and little analysis of actual consumer experience impact, of which Gruber is more keenly analytical.E.g. most of us on HN would generally appreciate having opt-in side loading and whatnot onto our Apple devices, like macOS. So Gruber just sounds like some kind of apologist when he says this would hurt consumers in the large. We more advanced hacker types are quick to say PEBKAC.But it’s a shame because his analysis actually offers really good insight in how to build successful consumer products the Apple way. \u003e I can say there is a definite reduction in the overall quality of discourse around Apple news versus general topics on HN. Much more knee jerk reactions.\"Knee jerk reactions\" presumes that Apple today behaves no differently than it did before when discussions \"felt\" more civil. That would be pretty far from the truth. Old Apple didn't piss off its developer community for the sake of protecting its walled garden, it didn't launch $3500 baubles nobody can afford and leave it to third party devs to fill the gaps. And the less said about Apple's foray into AI, the better. You know this comment made me realize something. Apple and Meta are basically in an escalating Cold War. Apple recently singled out Meta as the number one requester of privacy-sensitive APIs and beneficiary of EU-mandated broader access for 3rd parties. Meta responded by calling Apple “anticompetitive“ and lobbying for government intervention.[1]So let’s consider this comment with that in mind:* Meta is pissed off it doesn’t have more user data access inside Apple’s walled garden* Meta makes more affordable VR glasses* Meta released a high quality, developer friendly AI modelIn other words, these are all Meta-friendly points.I’m old enough to remember the Mac vs PC days when people would get utterly tribal on the internet about it. Maybe that’s where HN is at now. You can see why a startup focused third party developer community might lean towards busting open walled gardens.[1] https://apnews.com/article/apple-meta-european-union-digital... \u003eE.g. most of us on HN would generally appreciate having opt-in side loading and whatnot onto our Apple devicesHave you read any HN threads about apple and sideloading?The most upvoted comments in all of them is how sideloading and interoperability are worse than death and will bring on the endtimes. Why is this article flagged?Hacker News and Daring Fireball have so much in common:1. Both long-running sites 2. Both serve a curious and tech savvy audience 3. Both run zero graphics 4. Both appreciate / provide long-form journalismThey should be fine bedfellows. What's going on? My bet is that there are actual people with enough karma automatically flagging every df post without considering the content for a second.Would be cool if @dang could check the flagging data in the articles since the massive drop in 2021 and see if there are any patterns (same people doing the flagging for every article). I think the simplest and most likely explanation is that it’s dang himself who has a problem with Gruber. Yea, that's the saddest option. And I'll lean towards it unless dang weighs in on the thread somehow.Something happened in 2021 and mysteriously DF articles just fall off the front page immediately. Would love to hear from HN on why such an otherwise incredible popular site is so often blacklisted or censored vs what is allowed. Why not let users vote instead like other news? Or if truly not being censored bring receipts on what’s happening? \u003e Or if truly not being censored bring receipts on what’s happeningWhy is blacklisted or censorship for that domain taken as fact? IMHO the author didn't bring any conclusive receipts either. A 'bombshell' to me would include some original journalism, details we weren't otherwise aware of. I read that article, it is basically an essay about a guy realizing that the pedestal he puts Apple on may need some recalibration, just because their AI product sucks. Apple Maps in 2011 sucked too, the company is not immune to putting out crap. 100%. But if Gruber/Daringfireball are even shown for a split second, there's a kneejerk reaction to flag it before the flagger even often reads it. It's a shame. a \"bombshell\" for the bubble of Apple-superfans, shocked that their high priest is criticizing Apple, maybe. For the rest of the world? are we still calling one of the three biggest tech companies in the world a \"bubble\"? Get your head out of 1998. This is it for me. I've been using macs since 1985 (!) but I just don't think that blog is very interesting. From what I've seen, you're right that it's mostly Apple \"inside baseball\" and I just don't care. Don’t ask them. The only one who can give you a sure answer is @dang .My guess is that HN users flag the hell out of DF submissions for whatever reason, and that causes the so-called graylisting. But again only @dang can give you a straight answer.If you prefer email, Dan can be reached at hn@ycombinator.com. He seems like a friendly guy. Have you considered the possibility that the world has changed after 2020, and there's more to discuss re: technology and society than whatever Apple is up to? We've had Covid, meme stocks, Jan 6th, Huawei bans, Ukraine, NFTs, stablecoin collapses, Twitter takeover, AI everything, Chinese EVs, Tiktok ban....this list goes on. What exactly do you think my \"tactics\" were/are?I've only ever submitted one article of my own to Hacker News. This one. the content in the blog is yours, no? So people posting things that would cause flame wars from your domain is still your responsibility? At some point people stop engaging to disagree and start to flag. Your karma doesn't reflect the score expected from the blogger behind the top #3 website of HN. This should tell us something.Supporting a monopoly like Apple will sure attract a lot of detractors in a forum named \"hacker news\". The same would happen to Microsoft supporters 20 years ago. \u003e Your karma doesn't reflect the score expected from the blogger behind the top #3 website of HN. This should tell us something.Karma's a reflection of how much someone uses HN. Glancing at his account, it looks like he has never submitted anything before this article, and almost never comments. That account having low karma doesn't really tell us anything about him, beyond that he's not a HN regular. Blacklisted and censored?See: 120 submission in the past 12 months- https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=daringfireball.net\u0026ki...multiple submissions with \u003e 100 points.eg:* Publishing AI Slop Is a Choice (daringfireball.net) 167 points by mpweiher 10 months ago | past | 76 comments* Why can't we screenshot frames from DRM-protected video on Apple devices? (daringfireball.net) 173 points by ingve 25 days ago | past | 217 comments Drama aside, I thought I'd share a fun fact with the youngins: John Gruber (yes, the Apple blog guy) is the creator of Markdown. Thanks, John! It's funny, this post just got flagged.The shift from past popularity to apparent suppression is interesting, but without concrete proof, it remains speculation. Still, the frustration about opaque moderation resonates with me. What irritates some people (okay, me!) about Gruber's blog is that his takes are ultimately milquetoast.It's unlikely Gruber has published anything so incendiary that HN created a specific ban just for his site.More likely, there's something organic about Gruber's blog that HN's algorithm dislikes. Maybe its very popularity is what triggers a penalty - maybe due to the rate that HN users upvote it. While I avoid reading DF whenever possible personally, I'd never flag posts.I am sure only the moderators have visibility into what's going on here. I would hazard a guess that the user base of HN itself has changed in recent years. It's probably no accident that Gruber points out the ranking shifts in 2021 - a lot of things shifted 2020/2021 due to downstream pandemic impacts.It's hard to speculate without mod-level visibility though. I'd love for them to weigh in. This is weird. I know that there is a certain anti-Apple sentiment among many HN users (and I know my own posts get little traction here because of the domain name-or because of my employer…), but the gap here feels much wider. I'm rather anti-Apple but even I enjoy John's site from time to time. Hell, I had to vouch for this post just to see it. I can't think of any legitimate reason for his content to get flagged as often as it does and it's been happening for years. My personal guess is…I bet flags weigh more from high karma users. It seems likely that there is a small, dedicated band of anti-DF users with high karma who flag everything.It probably only takes a few people with enough karma to kill a post, which is consistent with the fact that some posts have a reasonable half life. I don’t think it’s a formal gray list. The anger reading the comments here from the folks who don't like DF/Apple is practically palpable, and that's obviously the reason the articles get flagged.I'm not sure where all that anger comes from (e.g., there isn't any company I've ever been as angry about as some of the commenters on this thread are). I suspect the response I'd get if I asked would be Apple did this or that, but personally, if I didn't like this or that I'd just buy a product from a different company and go about my day. I don't get hanging on to all that anger.(And frankly, I'd love if someone did what DF does for other platforms, I like hearing from fans of products and platforms what they see in them.) I suspect it's driven by the Olde School Linux / Free Software contingent of HN commenters / voters. Here is an example[1]:\"The #1 story on Hacker News at 2023:08:21T15:41Z is a 2021 discussion of Linux desktop packaging tools. Hypothesis: HN story up-voters are heavily drawn from Free / Open Source Software folks interested in issues that were broadly discussed in \"tech\" two decades ago (Linux for the desktop!) and are much less broadly discussed today.\"That anodyne observation garnered 5 downvotes. I mean, of course it was silly to treat Linux desktop packaging tools as the most important story in tech in 2023! Overall the dynamic feels like Wikipedia: people who participate are atypical, and nothing annoys them more than one's pointing out that they are atypical.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37211129 I agree, and expressed something similar in another command on this thread here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43493805 that HN is trending more and more from a general site for software/hardware makers, and more towards a Linux/OSS specific site.That's a notable trend overall, but not really a problem on its own. Every community is inevitably going to lean a certain way.But it doesn't really explain the anger. To be blunt, most of the comments criticizing DF/Apple in this thread sound unhinged to me, e.g., like Apple goes around living in these folks head rent free. I have difficulty understanding that mindset with something you can so easily avoid just by buying a product from another company? E.g., there are countless companies whose values don't align with my own, so I don't use their products, and that's the end of it. Why are these folks spending so much of their energy on hating this company that they can so easily avoid? And why is it just Apple that garner's this hatred, e.g., why not Nintendo for example, a company with a similar approach overall (closed, emphasis on product experience over specs) for example. My hypothesis is that about 300 people whose identities were formed by participating in the Slashdot / LWN / etc. communities c. 2000-2005 are active HN participants in 2025. They saw the dream of Linux beating Windows fail—and worse, they saw Macintosh become the high-status alternative to Windows. They saw the Olde Internet of hand-coded web sites be swamped by the arrival of humanity using smart phones, and they hate it. They are like 60 year old sports fans upset about the rise of analytics, or '70s rock fans bemoaning hiphop, or Socrates berating scribblers for displacing orators. Evidence: the 400-point popularity of dozens of recent stories on Firefox minutia—Firefox does not matter, nor does Brave (note: I worked for Mozilla for four years). The many, many stories about reviving the pre-smartphone Web. Probably other topic clusters I am forgetting—Web standards? \u003e like Apple goes around living in these folks head rent freeNot rent-free. 30% in the App Store. And 100% in the PWA they don't let me ask users to install. Are you saying these things make you angry at Apple? I.e., I'm still having trouble understanding, e.g., why not just make software for the many other platforms that are more aligned with your values? E.g., if I made games, I'd probably ship on Steam and not even try to ship on Nintendo, but I wouldn't hate Nintendo for that, I'd just target platforms that I'm more aligned with. I'm just having a hard time picturing hating another platform for having values different than mine when there are so many options available, why not just focus on the other options? \u003e I'm still having trouble understanding, e.g., why not just make software for the many other platforms that are more aligned with your values?I want to make software to users of smartphones, not to Apple users. There is nothing related to values. Gatekeeping the whole apps ecosystem for their own profit isn't a value anybody should share besides the shareholders. What's the most sympathetic way to state your position? E.g., I'm struggling with \"I'm angry because I can't make money off of iPhone users the way I want to\" that just doesn't sound sympathetic to me? Does it to you? (This may just be a conflict of values again, i.e., it sounds entitled to me to want to have equal access to sell your products to all smartphone users, regardless of their choices, that sounds super invasive to me in fact.)Also be curious what you think of console makers like Nintendo who have a similar approach regarding revenue cuts and access as Apple? Specifically why is there so much hate at Apple using this model but not Nintendo? Why do you think criticizing Apple's predatory strategies comes from hate? Do you hate everything you think it is bad? The sympathetic way is to not take disagreement as hate. Why do you hate people that dislike Apple's way of doing business? Do you hate everybody that dislike things you love?About Nintendo, I don't develop games nor play them, I couldn't care less about what the market leaders do. As an Apple user, I'm happy with the gatekeeping, it's why I use their products, and frankly I want more of it. If it was up to me I'd like to see them enforcing their human interface guidelines a lot more.Why can't you just develop for Android or Palm or Windows and be happy while leaving us alone to enjoy what we like? Can you at least appreciate the irony of calling Apple greedy when your main beef is they get in the way of you making money? There are also a lot of older Windows users, and users of failed platforms from the 80s and 90s, that absolutely hold deep seated anger at Apple and Steve Jobs. There were similar attitudes about Microsoft and Bill Gates in the 90s. After Gates left Microsoft a lot of that vitriol seemed to have dissipated, but some still aim it at Apple. The anger seems to usually be economically rooted, i.e. in terms of how Apple charges high prices for their hardware. Does hackernews publish its account/site weighting? If not, why not?From the FAQ: \u003e Other factors affecting rank include user flags, anti-abuse software, software which demotes overheated discussions, account or site weighting, and moderator action. I have no idea if DF is being \"suppressed\" or not, but I do know that I see DF articles appearing on HN frequently, so it doesn't feel like it. I have almost no interest in things Apple so rarely read them, but I see them a lot. I used to read DF semi regularly, like many others I didn’t always agree with the opinions but broadly I appreciated the thought and effort that went into them.I stopped abruptly when posts and tweets became (to me) shockingly pro Israel and excused/justified/diminished the ongoing genocide in Palestine.I understand the situation in Israel is complicated, and there is a strong relationship between the US and Israel, but as a citizen of a former occupied nation I can not stomach any attempts to rationalize the genocide happening in Palestine. Is this true? Shame if so – Daring Fireball and Hacker News are two of my favourite websites. You mean to tell me hackers are willing to astroturf? I am pretty sure SV angels sent emails to Portco’s telling them how to vote... not about content but in statewide elections. Some times the hive mind needs to think differently. I’ve been browsing the active list rather than the news list more recently. You can find that here: https://news.ycombinator.com/activeThis is #9 on the active page but nonexistent on news. I get a sense that active has more interesting content these days. I think folks are way more sensitive this year and react with downvotes and active shows that content.In some sense I think having an open mind and partaking in active discussions rather than just popular ones that please everyone is a better path forwards. I thought dang said once that any Apple article gets downranked automatically … and since Gruber predominately writes about Apple, his articles are probably experiencing that.But I can’t seem to find that comment here on HN that references how Apple articles get downranked. Likely Occam’s razor here. The answer is simple enough that Gruber even states it in his blog, writing:\u003e But if you look at the last four years, from 2021 through 2025, Daring Fireball ranks #72.\u003e Maybe I’ve lost my fastball, and I just don’t write so good no more. Or maybe it’s not me, but the Hacker News audience that has changed in recent years.The last four years are the outlier to his popularity on HN, and I don’t think it’s a coincidence that DF posted a lot of politically-charged takes during this timeframe, including opinions about covid, vax mandates, Ukraine, Israel/Palestine, Elon, and Trump.I suspect his takes frustrated many of his long-term readers, leading to less sharing and more flagging on HN - maybe by users with more influence - coupled with the site’s opaque algorithms/weightings picking up on the negative sentiment. As someone who's been reading Daring Fireball since 2004 and considers themselves an Apple fan, I think the algorithm is working exactly as intended if it's designed to limit intellectually dishonest content.Gruber has built a career on a predictable pattern: vociferously defend Apple's every decision (even contradicting his own previous positions when Apple changes course), construct elaborate post-rationalizations for their missteps, while simultaneously maintaining meticulous, years-long grudges against anyone who makes incorrect predictions about Apple.There's a stark difference between having perspective as an enthusiast and being a reflexive apologist. The \"Something Rotten in Cupertino\" piece is the exception that proves the rule - a rare deviation that doesn't erase the pattern of selective criticism that's defined his work for years.What's particularly frustrating is the pretense of even-handedness. I'd respect the work more if it were openly presented as Apple advocacy rather than positioned as independent analysis. The community's collective flagging behavior isn't \"censorship\" - it's quality control from readers who've recognized this pattern.HN's algorithm isn't suppressing contrarian viewpoints - it's responding to content that consistently fails to meet the intellectual honesty this community values. How then do you explain DF being HN's #3 personal blog from 2007-2021, but #72 from 2021-2025? Do you recall HN announcing a major algorithm change? I would guess a change in HN audience (anyone want to throw in COVID-19?) and a decline in Apple's popularity in general. I want to start off by seeing I totally get your point. Still I disagree.Where I think we agree is that John Gruber (JG) is 99% Apple's \"ideal customer\", while most HN readers are not: just like Apple he cares a lot about \"nice things\", \"it just works\", \"the best experience\" etc. even if it comes at the expense of price, consumer choice, open specifications, interoperability with other ecosystems etc. So we can intellectually disagree with JG when he defends some proprietary thing Apple built, but when JG writes that he loves that he himself is at least honest (and not an \"apologist\").Where we probably disagree is where he (in your eyes) \"vociferously defend Apple's every decision\". I think JG is often not defending Apple, but just explaining why they are doing the wrong/bad/weird thing. Similarly to how a newspaper can explain why Putin thinks he's in the right invading Ukraine: they are explaining the reasoning, not defending it.So we have a man that loves most of what Apple does because of an aligned view on what consumer tech should be, and \"kremlinologizes\" even when his views and Apple's might differ. Which gives the impression of a total apologist. Maybe (if he cares) JG could indicate a little better the times he's explaining Apple, not defending it. If you claim someone is a shill and always talks favorably about X, and there's a big headline article where X is absolutely THRASHED, that falsifies the hypothesis. I'm not sure your reading comprehension is that good. There's a difference between defending Apple's position and explaining why Apple took a position. Gruber generally doesn't put \"and Apple's position is bad\" after every sentence because he assumes the reader can decide for themselves.You see similar criticism of the Bible from people who claim it supports polygamy because it doesn't say \"and Jacob was WRONG to sleep with his slaves\". Well yeah, because you're supposed to read how it made his wife Leah feel and then decide for yourself. A lot of people today won't do that, which to me is intellectually lazy. Hoo boy; the idea that “intellectual honesty” bubbles to the top is an … interesting take to say the least. I don’t think it’s well-supported.Having an opinion and a tendency is not dishonest, and there’s plenty of garbage content that reaches and remains on the front page. I didn't say that intellectually honest content bubbles to the top, I said: \"I think the algorithm is working exactly as intended if it's designed to limit intellectually dishonest content\". There's a difference. Maybe it’s because Apple is rarely doing anything interesting these days and an unidimensional pundit's excruciatingly detailed analysis of that - is even less interesting.Add to that a writing style that is often biased, arrogant and inflammatory and you get even less interesting comments on this site.Exactly the same for Tim Bray, btw - except for Android stuff.There used to be a time when this stuff was hot, people took sides and breathlessly read anything they could find about the new stuff being released. That time has passed. We stopped caring.I can understand the demoting. I started reading DF when I was a college student, probably in 2002 or 2003. I listened to every iteration of The Talk Show that I can remember --- both runs with your former host, and the current edition from the very first episode. When I moved to Los Angeles and had no friends and felt lonely as hell all the time, I used to put on the keyboard episode of The Talk Show to give me something pleasant to fall asleep to.But John, your cheerleading for Israel's genocide --- man. Way before the election of the current cheerleader-in-chief for that effort, you were ahead of the game.You said that students who protested this genocide should be expelled from college (you've got a friend in the White House now, John!):\u003e These students should be expelled from college, not placated.https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/19/violenceAnd, most sickening of all, you cheered the indiscriminate pager attack that maimed children, which your friend in the White House has now got a golden pager memorializing:\u003e This whole operation sounds like it would make for a great movie.https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/17/israel-hezbolla...I could go on, but the effect was heartbreaking. My old friend, the voice in my little Pasadena apartment all those years ago, clapping for the maiming of children and howling for the expulsion of students who disagree with him? Who was this guy? Who is this guy? Had I read him wrong the whole time? Had I changed --- would I have loved those blown-up Lebanese kids back in 2002, and now I'd gone soft? I don't know. But if I'd visited DF for the first time in 2003 and found content calling for the expulsion of Iraq War protesters, I don't think I'd have made a second visit. I suspect it may be a mix of various factors:1. The HN audience’s preferences have changed over time2. There’s way more competition – the amount of great content to share and discuss has increased a lot3. Gruber apparently does not write as much or as well as he did a decade or so ago (at least according to many Daring Fireball readers I know)4. Yes, many readers don’t like him, but I would also say that many readers, especially younger ones, simply don’t care about him (related to point number 1)5. Related to all above, Gruber’s influence and relevance in tech debates have probably declined So you think I was consistently at #3 “as much and as well” from 2007-2021, and declined to #72 “as much and as well” quality in the last 4 years? If you discard that point (and it is a very subjective one and so easy to discard) there are still four other points that might have some weight. Are they? I mean, none of them are very objective.Except that #5 is objectively not true. Apple execs pay attention to DaringFireball. What he posts matters for that reason alone. He is a horrible apple shill, but he does have great insight and articulate reasoning on why things are the way they are. We should figure out where the block is and remove it. It's the kind of articulation you'd see in a McKinsey pitch deck. It's corporate apologia, heavily skewed towards Apple. His takes on Apple's 30% cut and the EU telling Apple to allow third party app stores, tell me he's speaking from the investor's POV than a developer's or consumer's. It's important to be able to read and understand both sides of an argument. Sadly most people prefer to read media that's slanted in the way they agree with.As for the EU, the land is devoid of innovation. Whether it's a cure for cancer, AI, a rocket to Mars, or you name it, chances are the next big thing will not be developed there. You can admire them for their socialist healthcare or whatever while still realizing that if the entire world operated like Europe progress would cease and another dark age would start. You don't have to see things in black and white. People on HN are human beings, and there are definitely Apple tribes and non-Apple tribes.Gruber also posts more now than in recent memory political observations and commentary. As he's gotten older his blog has expanded beyond just the Apple scene.While I've always felt DF got insta-banned by fanbois of other tribes regardless of the content of his posts (which should be discouraged here in some way imo) it's quite possible he's got folks on The Other Aisle that insta-flag him simply because they don't like his political views.If that's what's happening, or it's due to a decades-long disagreement with his taste and views regardless of the posts being submitted, that feels like unwarranted censorship that goes against the grain of HN's guidelines. Can anyone name another company that has something similar to a \"non-Apple tribe\"? And if not, why not? Which is really the question I can't figure out, why Apple makes some folks so angry and the same doesn't happen with other companies.(Preempting the only example I can think of, would be Internet Explorer, circa ~2000, which isn't really comparable because no one was defending IE then.) Meta is a funny one, because there doesn't really seem to be a \"pro-Meta\" contingent. They have lots of users, but not a lot of people who feel warmly about them as a company. There are many \"why is this flagged comments\" even by some old users who have been here a long time.If you search or view dang's comments you can see multiple explanations on why and how posts are flagged.Many people will flag if they think a submission will cause flame. And many people will flag if they see most comments are not constructive and are just complaining about comments. It doesn't make interesting reading. For what it's worth I came here via new comments and the submission was already flagged, so this is for whoever is left!Check out the usual guidelines:\"Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.\" and remember that people like interesting things. Keep this a good interesting place.Additionally there seems to be an increasing paranoid-like, conspiratorial, us vs them group mentality and accusation of brigading and censorship. This type of thinking are thought terminations and can morally hurt oneself. They don't encourage people to think of others as other people like themselves but encourages people to see more enemies around them and leads to dead end conclusions and prejudice. Strongly agree. I don't see how this post in any way deserves flagging based on the guidelines. Is there no karmic penalty for false flags? The other problem is that once he went political with his blo, things went down hill for him. And I was just put off when he starts talking sports....But seriously, that's a tough one. I get it that his audience are going to be interested in Apple stuff specifically, tech stuff generally, and not expect politics to creep into his blogs. And believe me, I do seek out havens free from the goings-on in the world as well.But it is also hard for me to imagine having a public forum (as he and other bloggers do) and to simply carry on business as usual as if the world were not spinning out of control (and if you don't think we are living now in extraordinary times I don't know what to say.).(Geerling guy, what planet do you live on? Oh, that's right, St. Louis.)(My complete escape from the happenings in the world is to go back and read old computer magazines or electronics magazines on archive.org.) I really don't see what's the issue here. Some people don't like Apple.Also:\u003e Initial reviews of the much-anticipated iPhone X appeared on October 31, but I’d only had the phone for 24 hours when the embargo droppedHaving Apple hardware before official launch (when review embargo is still on) tells me that the author will never publish bad press for apple, and is not to be trusted on reviewing Apple hardware.Apple is know for stopping shipping pre-release hardware to people that are honest in their review and that might call out questionable choice.The guy from unbox therapy said this pretty explicitly: when he started questioning apple's hardware design choices they stopped inviting them to their events and stopped sending them pre-release items.You can see something similar in mkbhd's videos where he's pretty much constantly walking on thin ice. He says and doesn't say stuff. My gut feeling regarding him is that he can get away with some of that because of his large audience. \u003e Apple is know for stopping shipping pre-release hardware to people that are honest in their review and that might call out questionable choice.I've been doing this for a long time and I'm not aware of a single case where this has happened. I'd love to write about this, so please let me know which reviewers, who had previously been seeded with review unit hardware from Apple, were dropped after they wrote honest review. (I don't think what you're describing is, in any way, an accurate description of Apple's relationship with Lewis Hilsenteger.) I visit daringfireball relatively regularly, and enjoy many of Gruber's takes. I know he's an Apple shill -- let's be honest and get that out of the way -- and his occasional softball criticizing some product or other doesn't change that, so I visit with a \"let's see what the Apple guy thinks\" angle.But let's be real - it's a hot takes/opinions site. It's basically the junk food of content. The world is absolutely awash in \"My opinion\" kind of blog entries like DF and they generally do extremely poorly on here, for good reason. There will be nothing technically revelatory in anything written there. Nothing that will really change anything. It's an Apple guy with opinions about stuff. For instance that 3.5\" was the \"sweet spot\" for smartphone screen sizes, coincidentally when Apple's smartphones only had 3.5\" screen sizes.Again, I still read it and sometimes enjoy it -- at least when he isn't on his bizarre Mark Gurman and/or Bloomberg \"they are my nemesis\" nonsense, which absolutely no one cares about but him. He leaves out the possibility of a voting ring. I am 90% certain several such rings exist, or have existed. I believe some rings are topical, some are user ID based, some are site based. A handful of 100+ comment/upvote submissions in the past month or so alone is not \"afraid to discuss\". That's hundreds or thousands of eyeballs. And your hot topics might also not be that unique so discussion is happening on other source articles at the same time. Not everything is going to be that interesting all the time. And stuff moves pretty fast around here. Come on now. What counts as an unhinged Trump take these days? Is it like \"yes, we should invade Canada!\" I don't expect anyone to change their vote based on a three sentence HN comment. It's just... it's an amusing accusation that someone's takes on Trump are irrational, when those takes are about the wackiest POTUS in history. This isn't reddit. OK so \"sir, this is wendys\" but doing flagging for shits and giggles devalues the system.Not that I think flagging isn't already weaponised. Two wrongs don’t make a right. HN and DF are both stubbornly wrong about refusing to use good typography and a sensible approach to responsive design.I know that stubbornness and misplaced pride go hand in hand, but it’s harming the both of them.I would definitely read DF more often if I didn’t have to use Safari’s reader mode just to be able to read it. Seems like bikeshedding to bring up typography. The greater matter is refusal to engage in civil, if lively, discussion and instead retreat into prior restraint and helicopter paternalistic declarations of what can and cannot be discussed. Ending anonymous voting is the key to sanity on social media. Comments explaining the vote would make it even better.It is then easier to see what is going on. You follow or ignore a thread whether the upvotes and downvotes are from \"your kind of people\" Ending anonymous voting is the key to sanity on social media. Comments explaining the vote would make it even better.It is then easier to see what is going on. You follow or ignore a thread whether the upvotes and downvotes are from \"your kind of people\" \u003e What bothers me isn’t so much that Daring Fireball is shitlisted at Hacker News — even though I really did enjoy reading the commentary on my posts back when they regularly surfaced there, and still do when one slips through the cracks.Did DF ever allow comments on its own website? I vaguely remember gruber once saying: “If you want to comment on my blog, write your own blog.”\u003e What bothers me is that it’s unexplained. Which, ultimately, seems not so much censorial as just cowardly.Huh. This is the one, thanks.\u003e You write on your site; I write on mine. That’s a response. I don’t use comments on Wilcox’s site to respond publicly to his pieces, but somehow it’s unfair that he can’t use comments on my site to respond to mine? What kind of sense is that even supposed to make? How is it hypocritical to hold the view that some places are intended to be open forums for comments from anyone, and others are not?Also, by not hosting my own comments, all public commentary on my writing is thus out of my control. I don't get to block comments I don't like here, or on Mastodon, or Twitter/X, or Bluesky. I think that's actually for the better. I see your take, but I disagree.DF is a blog and was conceived that way. HN is a discussion site. The two forms (blogging and internet discussions) are different. They serve different purposes and require different management styles.The discussions here do seem to be tamped down in some ways, and as a user, that takes something away from the experience.Relatedly: in general, I think \"hypocritical\" is not a big gotcha that ends discussions. Different things serve different purposes. Can you blame someone for not having any hateful comments on their website? Even if 98% were positive, that 2% could annoy the hell out of you. Moderation on HN is probably the most transparent you’ll find anywhere aside from Wikipedia, and HN is better than WP in terms of unbiased moderation. Dang and team have a stellar reputation and the idea that they’re covertly blacklisitng a personal blog is really silly.OP’s submissions are likely not popular because of a mixture of them being not that interesting or useful and also contentious. Contentious submissions get massively reduced in visibility automatically. And stuff like an iPhone review significantly after other mainstream reviews is just not that interesting. My thesis is that HN would like you to think their moderation is highly transparent, and it's very clear that the core HN audience believes that to be true, but that in fact it is not transparent at all.If the problem is with my writing \"being not that interesting or useful and also contentious\", how then do you explain Daring Fireball ranking #3 here from 2007-2021 but dropping to #78 from 2021-2025. Do you think my writing was that much more interesting and useful (and less contentious?) for the first 14 years of HN but changed suddenly in 2021?Or do you think HN's hidden admin moderation changed suddenly around 2021? I think the overall conclusion from this investigation must be: We'll never know because at the end of the day it's HN's site, and they are the only ones who know how moderation works. They have the logs and (presumably) the materialized dashboards showing what's going on, and we only get a peek at it when the lead moderator (dang) pulls back the curtain a little. He is very friendly, and actually very, very prompt at responding to questions (both over E-mail, and in-thread) but I've always thought the responses about moderation activity are pretty opaque. Any time something that looks like shenanigans gets mentioned, it's always vaguely attributed to \"user moderation\" or \"automated algorithms\" such as the flamewar detection, with very few admissions of HN staff putting their thumbs on the scale (in either direction). Best case, if it's true that everything is due to user moderation, it would appear the site is pretty vulnerable to organized brigading (for or against specific topics).So we'll never know for sure. Please keep writing.

Some cursory searches on Clickhouse show me:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. There was an exponential increase in people talking about FOSS, leveling out in 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. There\u0026#39;s been an exponential decrease in people talking about startups, leveling out in 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, remember that there are karma gates to flagging and that you need many fewer flags than upvotes to sink something. My suspicion is that HN had a pretty big culture shift starting around 2016 but really peaking by 2021 that shifted from the old startup, builder focus to its current FOSS, anti-authoritarian mood. In other words the culture that used to be on Slashdot and technical subreddits found its way back onto HN. While the older HN was more homogeneous in its makeup and narrower in its topics it was also a lot less contentious than today\u0026#39;s HN is, mirroring the culture found on Reddit and comment sections of tech-focused publications like The Verge. Today\u0026#39;s HN is broad, unfocused, and a lot more like a mix of r/technology and r/programming than it used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlaggers, I suspect, have older HN values. They preferred the narrower focus of the old site and really dislike the highly contentious big comment threads that are on today\u0026#39;s HN. It\u0026#39;s hard to have proof of this since flaggers only interact by flagging, but it certainly is the opinion that \u003ci\u003eI\u003c/i\u003e have as an older user well over the karma threshold to flag.

But what are his credentials? When he weighs the merits of a programming language, an API, a platform, or anything technical, I want him to speak from experience. Collaborating with Aaron Swartz twenty-one years ago on Markdown is respectfully not very relevant technical experience in the domains DF traditionally covers. Vesper was one ObjC app written by three people in 2013. I\u0026#39;m glad it was well-received, but again, what significance does Gruber\u0026#39;s experience have? Why should the industry listen to him when he (admittedly not so often nowadays) discusses software development?

For you it was the terrible keyboards, for many it was the headphone jack. For me, it was a tiny change: They quietly dropped support for 1080i resolution around the time of macOS 10.5 or 11. Suddenly my Mac that ran my home theater could no longer drive my TV, just because Apple decided \u0026#34;fuck this guy, we\u0026#39;re not going to support this anymore.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI still have an iPhone 7.

Still I disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere I think we agree is that John Gruber (JG) is 99% Apple\u0026#39;s \u0026#34;ideal customer\u0026#34;, while most HN readers are not: just like Apple he cares a lot about \u0026#34;nice things\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;it just works\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;the best experience\u0026#34; etc. even if it comes at the expense of price, consumer choice, open specifications, interoperability with other ecosystems etc. So we can intellectually disagree with JG when he defends some proprietary thing Apple built, but when JG writes that he loves that he himself is at least honest (and not an \u0026#34;apologist\u0026#34;).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere we probably disagree is where he (in your eyes) \u0026#34;vociferously defend Apple\u0026#39;s every decision\u0026#34;. I think JG is often not defending Apple, but just explaining why they are doing the wrong/bad/weird thing. Similarly to how a newspaper can explain why Putin thinks he\u0026#39;s in the right invading Ukraine: they are explaining the reasoning, not defending it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have a man that loves most of what Apple does because of an aligned view on what consumer tech should be, and \u0026#34;kremlinologizes\u0026#34; even when his views and Apple\u0026#39;s might differ. Which gives the impression of a total apologist.

And stuff like an iPhone review significantly after other mainstream reviews is just not that interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\n        \u003c/tbody\u003e\u003c/table\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003c/tr\u003e\n                \u003ctr id=\"43494030\"\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003ctable\u003e  \u003ctbody\u003e\u003ctr\u003e    \u003ctd indent=\"1\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"40\"/\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\n      \u003ccenter\u003e\u003ca id=\"up_43494030\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=43494030\u0026amp;how=up\u0026amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D43489058\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/center\u003e    \u003c/td\u003e\u003ctd\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy thesis is that HN would like you to think their moderation is highly transparent, and it\u0026#39;s very clear that the core HN audience believes that to be true, but that in fact it is \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e transparent at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the problem is with my writing \u0026#34;being not that interesting or useful and also contentious\u0026#34;, how then do you explain Daring Fireball ranking #3 here from 2007-2021 but dropping to #78 from 2021-2025.

They have the logs and (presumably) the materialized dashboards showing what\u0026#39;s going on, and we only get a peek at it when the lead moderator (dang) pulls back the curtain a little. He is very friendly, and actually very, very prompt at responding to questions (both over E-mail, and in-thread) but I\u0026#39;ve always thought the responses about moderation activity are pretty opaque. Any time something that looks like shenanigans gets mentioned, it\u0026#39;s always vaguely attributed to \u0026#34;user moderation\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;automated algorithms\u0026#34; such as the flamewar detection, with very few admissions of HN staff putting their thumbs on the scale (in either direction). Best case, if it\u0026#39;s true that everything is due to user moderation, it would appear the site is pretty vulnerable to organized brigading (for or against specific topics).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0026#39;ll never know for sure.
