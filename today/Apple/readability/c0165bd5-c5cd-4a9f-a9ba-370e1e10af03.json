  "text": "Have you ever wanted to customize the cursor in MacOS? Perhaps you want to use a Windows-style white cursor on your Mac, or a grey 3d looking Linux style cursor, or even cursors from the Wii interface on your Mac? You can do all of that and more with a free app called Mousescape for Mac. The Mac doesn’t offer a ton of cursor customization by default, though you can can change the Mac cursor to be larger, adjust the color with Accessibility settings, and turn on or off the shake-to-find feature, that’s about it. But that’s where Mousescape comes in, which allows you to use completely custom cursors on your Mac. Mousescape is easy to use, it’s free, and there are a variety of Mousescape cursor packs available to help you customize your experience. Let’s check out this fun little app. How to Use Custom Mouse Cursors on your Mac with Mousescape As usual, if you’re unfamiliar with unfamiliar with downloading apps from Github here’s how to do that but basically go to the ‘releases’ section and grab the latest version there. Download Mousescape and let it bypass Gatekeeper permissions by opening it through the Security \u0026 Privacy settings panel Download a mouse cursor pack (a handful of links below to start) and unzip it Drag the .cape files from the mouse cursor pack into the Mousescape app Apply the cursors to your Mac if you like them By default the Mousescape app does not include any cursors however, so you will need to find those. Don’t worry, we’ve got a few links below. Sample cursor packs for Mousescape A few of the sample cursor packs available out there for Mousescape are: grab some Wii pointer cursors Grab some white Windows-esque cursors Grab Windows or Linux style cursors for mousescape Captaine cursors If you search around the web you’ll find some more, but strangely there’s not a unified repository or forum focused on Mousescape cursors. For such a fun unique app, that seems like it’d be handy, but alas… Every once in a while you learn of a new fun app for Mac, and it brings you a little bit of joy. The apps don’t even have to be revolutionary or particularly useful, sometimes it’s a simple app that just allows a bit of customization or offers a little fun, in this case like Mousescape. In the recent past some of the similar type of ‘just for fun’ apps we have covered include adding Googly Eyes in the menu bar, or having flies buzz around your Trash can to remind you to empty it, or playing with a virtual bouncy ball on your screen from your Dock. I had never heard of MouseScape before, but then I came across this post on MacStories and it perked my interest, and once playing around a bit I was quickly hooked since I’m one of those people who enjoys customizing the Mac experience. Try it out yourself if you’re looking for some custom cursors, or for just another fun way to customize your Mac experience.",
