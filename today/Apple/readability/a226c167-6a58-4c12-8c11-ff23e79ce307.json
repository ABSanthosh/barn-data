  "description": "Macworld Unfortunately in recent years, the number of great games for Mac has declined because many are no longer supported. Every new version of macOS tends to break a few games, but macOS Catalina in 2019 meant that lot of games that used 32-bit code were no longer Mac compatible. At the same time that Apple went 64-bit only it also introduced Metal for 3D graphics, which left a lot of games developers with a decision: make new Mac versions of their games or stop making them. Unfortunately many chose the latter. This has started to change with the arrival of macOS Sonoma is here. With Sonoma, Apple provides two things: a new Game Porting Toolkit to make it easier for game developers to bring their games to the Mac, and a new Game Mode to ensure a game gets the highest priority on GPU and CPU, for better playability. Read: How to use Game Mode to boost performance. Following these changes we’ve seen more games coming to the Mac. Including Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and World of Warcraft: The War Within. Many more A-list games are coming to the Mac, including Assassins Creed: Shadows (November 2024), Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (December 2024), and Resident Evil 2 (date TBC). Just check out our roundup of the best Mac games for some of the highlights, we also have a round-up of the best free Mac games.  Even before the changes that Sonoma brought, and contrary to popular belief, Mac gamers already have plenty of top games titles to choose from – indeed, the most difficult part is narrowing down the options, and then finding the money to buy and time to play them. We can’t help with the latter, but the first problem is right up our alley. In this article, we’ve collected the best Mac games for your delectation – including some of the best new games. Below you will find what we believe are the greatest Mac games out there, together with links to the Mac App Store, Steam and other reputable vendors, so you can buy them right away. These are the very best games for Mac. They are in alphabetical order, not in order of preference (because everyone likes different things). November 2024: Including an update to the Diablo III review now that Blizzard has brought Diablo III up-to-date for Mac users. You may also like to take a look at our Best Mac for gaming guide. Plus we have an in-depth look at using an M1 MacBook Pro as a gaming laptop. And if you want some free games to try out on your Mac take a look at our round-up of the Best free Mac games. Best Mac Games 2024 Before we run through our list of the best games we’ve played on the Mac, here are games that we strongly recommend you play on the Mac in 2024. 1. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (Mac) Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mac App Store $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $19.99 at Mac App Store Apple Silicon, with Resident Evil: Village at the end of last year, quickly followed by Resident Evil 4 earlier this year. The latest addition to the range is Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Biohazard requires a Mac with an M1 or later, running macOS 13.0 or later. Biohazard also runs on the iPad, as long as it has an M1 processor and iPadOS 17, and even the iPhone, with iOS 17 and an A17 processor. It is cheaper than other games in the series, costing just $19.99/£15.99 on the Mac App Store. The game can be downloaded for free and run in demo mode, called ‘The Beginning Hour’, as an introduction to the main game. If you like the demo, you can buy the full game as an in-app purchase, and there’s an expansion pack available for another $19.99/£15.99. The game introduces Ethan Winters (who also appeared in Village), who searches for his wife, Mia, who vanished mysteriously three years ago. He receives an email from Mia asking for his help and gives him an address in a swampy backwater town in Louisiana. The game switches to an isolated first-person view, making every shadowy corridor seem even more oppressive and creepy. The game also makes clever use of the found-footage genre of horror movies, with Ethan finding old VHS tapes around the house that help fill in some of the background. There’s also a time-travel effect, where you can take actions during video segments in the past that impact on the present. Capcom recommends a game controller, but it’s possible to play with a keyboard and mouse if you prefer. Read our full Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (Mac) review 2. Death Stranding: Directors Cut (Mac) Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mac App Store $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $19.99 at Mac App Store Apple is currently attempting to make up for around 40 years of neglecting the Mac games scene – probably because it thinks that a few good games might help to boost sales of the new Vision Pro headset (cynical, moi? You betcha!). It hasn’t exactly catapulted the Mac games scene into the stratosphere, but there are a few high-profile games now starting to arrive on the Mac, and 2024 gets off to a good start with the arrival of Death Stranding, the idiosyncratic and sometimes downright bizarre game from Hideo Kojima, the renowned developer behind the long-running Metal Gear series. The game is set in a near-future version of the United States, in the aftermath of a mysterious apocalyptic event known as the Death Stranding, which has caused the collapse of society. All that’s left are a few scattered communities, which rely on ‘porters’ to deliver supplies and help set up a communications system called the Chiral network. That’s where you come in, playing Sam ‘Porter’ Bridges – who is voiced by, and modeled on the actor Norman Reedus of Walking Dead fame – as he trudges across the country delivering his supplies. Along the way, you’ll encounter terrorists and creepy invisible monsters called BTs (‘beached things’), but your real foe for much of the game is simply the environment around you. There is some combat in Death Stranding, but your main task as a porter is to struggle across the rocky, ruinous countryside as you embark on a series of missions to deliver your cargo of medicines and other supplies. The game is sometimes described as a ‘walking simulator ’ as you spend much of your time clambering over rocks, up hills, or wading across rushing rivers and streams. That may not sound terribly exciting, but there’s a lot of satisfaction as you struggle to slowly inch your way towards the peak of a craggy hill with your cargo intact. The game also has a dramatic cinematic flair – possibly a little too cinematic, as the first 45 minutes or so is really just a series of very long cut-scenes, interspersed only by a few brief sequences where you learn how to control Sam as he walks, jumps and wades across the rocky terrain. The long cut-scenes can try your patience in the early stages of the game, but they do look terrific – the landscapes have a cinematic scope, and the 3D graphics are tremendously detailed and realistic. And the feeling that this is the gaming equivalent of a blockbuster Hollywood production is further emphasized by cameos from a number of other Hollywood big names, including Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo Del Toro, and Lindsay Wagner. The graphics do require a bit of horsepower though. The game will only run on Macs and iPads that have an Apple Silicon processor (M1 or later), and running macOS 13.3 or iPadOS 17.0. We were pleased to find that the game ran well even on an iMac with an M1 processor, although we did have to lower the resolution to 1920×1080. You might need an M2 or M3 to really enjoy the game’s sweeping vistas and eerie special effects, but seeing a game like Death Stranding running on an M1 iMac gives us some hope for the future of games on the Mac. 3. Resident Evil 4 – Jump scares galore Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mac App Store $59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.99 at Mac App Store It can be a little tricky following the sequence of the Resident Evil games – especially as most of them have never been released on the Mac. Last year’s Resident Evil: Village was the eighth game in the long-running series, although it was the first ever to arrive on the Mac, and also one of the first games written specifically to run on Macs with Apple Silicon. However, Resident Evil 4 is actually a newer game (sort of) as it’s a remake of the original Resident Evil 4, which was first released back in 2005. Being a newer game means that it’s considerably more expensive, though, weighing in at a rather hefty $59.99/£57.99. However, it works hard to earn its keep with “juiced-up visuals and a reimagined story” as well as improved controls for combat and other character actions. And, thankfully, you can actually download the game for free and play through the opening section, before deciding if you want to go ahead and buy the full version of the game as an in-app purchase (along with some rather pricey DLC packs too). This installment follows the adventures of special agent Leon S. Kennedy – a floppy-haired special agent from an earlier game in the series – who has now been recruited to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the US President. Tracking her down to a village in Spain, Leon encounters a spooky cult called Los Iluminados, who have turned the villagers into crazed killers. You have to fight your way past the villagers and confront various bosses as you track down the President’s daughter and attempt to uncover the cult’s true plans. Resident Evil 4 has some good jump scares along the way, but it’s more action-oriented than Village and doesn’t have quite the same creepy and tense atmospherics. It certainly keeps you busy, though, as you shoot and slice your way through the villagers, and encounter the mysterious figures who control the cult. And, of course, it’s pretty gorey too, with a 17+ age rating. Like Resident Evil: Village, this game runs on Macs with Apple Silicon, and it ran pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with a basic M1 processor. It felt a little sluggish initially, but seemed to run quite smoothly once we turned the resolution down to 1,920 x 1,080, and experimented with some of the graphics settings (the game will also run on iPads with Apple Silicon, and even on the iPhone 15 Pro as well). 4. Frost Punk 2 – Winter wonderland? Price When Reviewed: $44.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $43 View Deal Mac App Store $44.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $43 at Steam$44.99 at Mac App Store When it launched a few years ago Frost Punk was a surprise hit. It tis a survival game based in an alternate 19th century world that has been plunged into a new ice age by a vast, global blizzard called the Great Frost. Frost Punk 2 is set 30 years after the original and you are tasked with finding new sources of food and fuel for the growing population and dealing with threats like hunger, crime and factional rivalries.  The new game has a prologue that introduces the story for new players, and also acts as a tutorial, in which you struggle through the icy ‘frostlands’ to reach a wrecked train and scavenge its resources. The game also looks great, with dramatic and imposing 3D graphics that look like Blade Runner with added snow. Frost Punk 2 is quite a challenging game, even for people who have played strategy games before. Basic tasks such as gathering resources can prove to be quite complex. Frost Punk 2 is a little more abstract than its predecessor, as you now need to step back and take more of an overview of the structure of this society. There are several difficulty levels, where you can adjust economic conditions, such as the scarcity of food and fuel. You can also modify the weather.  The scale of New London and its complex society provides a rich tapestry for the story that unfolds under your stewardship. Once you’ve finished the main game there’s also an ‘endless’ Utopia mode that allows you to start a new city by choosing from a variety of locations, with different terrain and weather conditions. Frost Punk 2 is available on both Steam and the Mac App Store, but the Steam version of the game is slightly cheaper. Read our full Frost Punk 2 review 5. Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown – The Prince on the Mac Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mac App Store $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $39.99 at Mac App Store The Lost Crown was released for Windows PCs at the start of 2024, but it took until December for it to appear on the Mac App Store where it’s working its way up Apple’s games chart. The Lost Crown is a side-scrolling game that combines combat and platform-jumping elements. It’s presented like an old-school 2D platform game where you mostly run left or right across the screen and use the Space bar to jump over obstacles. The game looks great with detailed backgrounds that create a real sense of atmosphere You play a young warrior called Sargon, who is a member of a group that modestly call themselves The Immortals. The kingdom of Persia is under attack from an enemy army, and Prince Ghassan has been taken captive and imprisoned on the magical Mount Qaf. Sargon and his associates head off to rescue the Prince, but soon discover that Mount Qaf is full of mystical enemies, puzzles and obstacles that have to be overcome. The game requires an M1 processor or later (so it won’t run on Intel Macs). However, the 2D presentation means that it doesn’t need a powerful Mac, and we had no trouble running it with high graphics settings at 4K resolution on a MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro chip. Read our full Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review 6. Total War: Pharaoh – New for Mac users Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.99 at Steam After a fairly epic detour into the fantasy worlds of Warhammer, the Total War series is back on its home turf once more, returning to the more traditional historical settings that the games have explored in the past. This time it’s ancient Egypt for Total War: Pharaoh, set in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, and covering the lands of Egypt itself, as well as neighboring Canaan and the Hittite Empire. There are eight factions spread across these three lands, all competing to take the throne of Egypt and become the next Pharoah (with additional factions available to purchase as DLC on Steam). Each faction has its own leader, with their own individual strengths and abilities, such as the reckless young warrior Ramesses (who has a tendency to “put the chariot before the horses”), and the cunning Tausret, who uses diplomacy and finance to pull the levers of power. If you’re new to the game then there are several tutorials available that introduce the basics of battle, as well as more advanced tactics, such as siege warfare, and learning how to use the land and weather to your advantage. Pharoah might not have the otherworldly spectacle of the Warhammer games, but it still looks great, with spectacular vistas as the rival armies charge across the desert dunes. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t run on older Macs that have Intel processors, but it ran quite smoothly on an iMac with a basic M1 processor when set to 1920×1080 resolution (and using the new gaming mode in macOS Sonoma). The main single-player campaign should keep you busy for quite a while, and as well as creating custom battles to hone your skills you can also customize the main campaign, adjusting the troops, resources and money that are available to make the game more challenging. It’s a shame, though, that the game’s multiplayer mode only allows you to play with other Mac users, as this means that – without being able to play against PC users – you’ll have a fairly limited choice of online opponents. 7. Baldur’s Gate 3 – Best single-player RPG Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.99 at Steam The original Baldur’s Gate games were classics of the RPG genre when the series was launched almost 25 years ago, but their 2D graphics haven’t aged well, despite an HD update in 2012. However, the forthcoming Baldur’s Gate 3 brings the series well and truly up to date with slick 3D graphics and a vast adventure that looks set to match the epic scale of its predecessors. It’s actually been available in ‘early access’ on Steam since 2020, but the game finally has a firm release date for August 2023 so you can now dive in and test drive the early chapters of the game to prepare yourself for the arrival of the full game in just a few months time. It’s not a true sequel as the story and the main characters are all new – set more than 100 years after BG2 – although it is still set in the famous Baldur’s Gate region from the popular Dungeons \u0026 Dragons table-top games (and – spoiler alert – some familiar faces do make a welcome reappearance). Rather than the powerful, god-like being that you became in Baldur’s Gate II, the new game lets you start from scratch with an entirely new character, chosen from the traditional D\u0026D selection of races and classes – humans, elves, dwarves, wizards, warriors and rogues – and you then awake to find yourself prisoner on a flying ship controlled by Mindflayers (a familiar villain from D\u0026D lore). The ship is attacked by dragons, but you’re able to escape – only to find that a Mindflayer larva has been implanted inside your brain. So, along with other survivors from the crashed ship, you set out to try to find a cure and then quickly find yourself embroiled in a mysterious war between the Mindflayers and an assortment of enemy races – who won’t be fully revealed until the game’s launch in the summer. The 3D graphics really bring the game to life as you and your companions wade into combat, but the spectacular visuals do need a fairly fast Mac in order to run properly. The developers says that the game will run on an Intel Mac with a quad-core CPU and an AMD graphics card, or on most Macs with M1 or M2 processors. However, we had to drop the resolution to just 1600×900 on our M1 iMac in order to get a playable 25fps, so an M1 Pro or higher might be better. Fortunately, the game’s turn-based combat doesn’t require lightning reflexes and high-speed action, so you can still get by with an M1 Mac if you need to. The decision to opt for turn-based combat might worry old-timers – like yours truly – who remember the terrific real-time-with-pause system of the original games. But turn-based is the trend these days, and if my time in the early access game is anything to go by then you’ll find that the old Baldur’s Gate magic will soon tempt you in as you “gather your party before venturing forth” – just like the good old days! 8. Valheim – Best survival game Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $19.99 at Steam There aren’t many survival games that have made it onto the Mac, so we were pleasantly surprised when developer Iron Gate recently announced a Mac version of its hugely successful Valheim. The PC game has been available in early access since 2021 – which means that you’re essentially paying to play a beta version of the game – but it’s received a series of updates over the last couple of years that add more and more features, and the game has now sold more than 10 million copies. Valheim follows the standard format for the survival. genre. Rather than providing a central story or quest, it simply drops you into the world of Valheim, which is based on Norse mythology, and then just leaves you to get on with things and decide how you want to play. The world includes several different biomes–regions with different terrain and climate–including leafy forests, snowy mountains or the barren Ashlands that were added in a recent update. You’ll start in a fairly welcoming leafy glade, where you can gather food and materials for crafting and building yourself a home. Many people seem quite happy to spend a lot of their time working on their homestead, hunting and crafting to make themselves comfortable in their new home (a bit like the Sims, except with Vikings and monsters). But, as you develop your crafting and building skills, you’ll need to wander a bit further afield and explore other biomes in order to find new materials and resources. As you visit each biome you’ll encounter a variety of beasts and monsters, which will force you to craft more powerful weapons and hone your Viking fighting skills. Each biome also has its own boss monster that you have to defeat as well, with the ultimate goal–when the game eventually emerges from early access–of reaching Viking heaven in Valhalla. It’s quite a challenging game, and the intentionally retro 3D graphics may not appeal to everyone, but many people are happy to spend months at a time just exploring, hunting and building their home in Valheim. If things get a bit tough then there’s a co-op mode available so that you can recruit up to nine friends to help you out, and the old-school graphics mean that the game runs well even on older Intel-based Macs (although Macs with Apple Silicon will need to be running macOS 14.0 or later). It’s available on both Steam and the Mac App Store – but just remember that this is an early access game, so you may experience a few bugs along the way. 9. Elder Scrolls Online (Gold Road Update) – Best non-subscription MMO Price When Reviewed: From $19.99 for base game; Gold Road Collection: $49.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $49.99 at Steam Elder Scrolls Online is one of the few MMO games that is available on the Mac, and it celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2024 with the launch of a major update called Gold Road. The game has seen a lot of changes along the way – both to the game itself, and also to the Mac platform, following the transition to Apple Silicon. The bad news is that developer Zenimax now states that Apple Silicon “is not officially supported”. In fact, the game does run on Macs with Apple Silicon – thanks to Rosetta – although some users have reported poor performance even on high-end Mac models. However, I was able to get a perfectly playable 40fps when running the game at 2,560 x 1,440 resolution with high graphics settings on my MacBook Pro with M2 Pro, and 55fps on medium graphics. There’s no free trial available for Elder Scrolls Online, but the game does run free play events every few months that allow you to play free of charge for a couple of weeks, so keep an eye out for these events if you’d like to check the game out before buying. One of the good things about Elder Scrolls Online is that – unlike MMO rivals such as World Of Warcraft – it doesn’t require a subscription to play. You do need to pay $19.99/£15.99 for the base game (until end of June 2024 this is $5.99 at Epic), or $49.99/£42.99 for the complete Gold Road Collection – which includes a whole decade’s worth of expansion packs – but after that you can play for as long as you want without having to pay a monthly subscription (although a subscription is available as an optional extra). Even the base game is huge, with a vast continent full of snowy mountains, windswept deserts and murky marshes for you to explore. There are epic quests, a wide range of skills and abilities to master and, of course, there are the inevitable dungeons and quite a few dragons that you can face on your adventures as well. As always, the Gold Road expansion adds a new region for you to explore, and a major new storyline called The Return Of Ithelia. It also introduces a major new magic system to the game, called Scribing, which provides new skills and spells that can be customized so that you can create a unique set of skills that really allow you to play just the way that you want. 10. Diablo III: 2024 Update: Best Action RPG Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Battle.net $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $39.99 at Battle.net It’s a little over 12 years since we originally reviewed the Mac version of Diablo III, and it’s safe to say that a lot has changed since then. The game still runs on Macs, but the transition to Apple Silicon has meant that it relies on Rosetta to run on modern Macs, and umpteen new versions of the macOS have introduced a few bugs that are annoying even if they don’t completely break the game. Now, completely out of the blue, the developers at Blizzard have announced an update – to version 2.7.8 – that brings Diablo III right up to date for Mac users. As well as being compatible with the most recent versions of the macOS and ironing out those old bugs, Diablo III now runs natively on Macs with either Intel processors or Apple Silicon – and that’s quite surprising for a game that’s this old. Season 30 was the end of the road for new game content, but Blizzard did introduce a number of new features that should help to keep diehard players interested. The new Solo Self Found mode (SSF) is a completely single-player mode that forces you to rely purely on weapons and items that you find on your own. A new feature called Visions Of Enmity opens portals to a series of mini-levels that are crammed full of monsters, but which provide a chest full of loot once you reach the final level. There’s also the Altar Of Rites, where you can sacrifice some of your hard-earned loot to gain a series of bonuses and buffs that will help you tackle the game’s many challenges in solo mode. The 2.7.8 update also arrived at the same time as Season 33 of Diablo III, that revisits the Shades Of The Nephilim theme and allows you to summon clone versions of your character to help you in battle. Unfortunately, Diablo IV, which was launched in 2023, still isn’t available for the Mac at all, but at least this revamp of Diablo III provides plenty of dungeon-crawling fun for Mac users. And, of course, there are options that may allow you to run Diablo IV as well, if you read our guide to the best virtual machine software for Macs. Read our full Diablo III review 11. The Elder Scrolls Online (High Isle Collection) Best non-subscription MMO Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $19.99 at Steam Along with World Of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls Online – or ESO to its thousands of fans – is one of the few A-List MMO titles that still supports the Mac (sadly, we lost Guild Wars 2 a couple of years ago…). But, unlike WoW, you don’t need to pay a monthly subscription to play the game, which makes it great value for players who want to immerse themselves in hundreds of hours of quests and adventures in the game’s online world of Tamriel. Some people – i.e. me – also prefer its grittier graphical style to the Disney-esque cartoon graphics of WoW. ESO keeps its fans coming back year after year by releasing regular expansions – which it refers to as Chapters, as each new chapter brings a new story and a new series of quests to the game, as well as opening up new zones for you to explore. The latest chapter is High Isle, which takes you to the homeland of the game’s Breton race, and throws you into a story of political intrigue involving High Isle’s rival factions and a mysterious organization known as the Ascendent Order. Other new features include a new deck-building card game that you can play to while away a few hours, and two new computer-controlled companions for players who prefer to go questing on their own. And, of course, there are plenty of new quests to complete and dungeons waiting to be plundered. You can buy the base version of the game for $19.99/£15.99 (until end of June 2024 this is $5.99 at Epic), or buy the High Isle Collection, which includes High Isle and all the previous chapters for $49.99/£42.99. Or, if you already own the game, you can just upgrade with High Isle on its own for $29.99/£24.99. Once you’ve bought the game you can play for as long as you want without paying a monthly subscription, and there are enough dungeons and quests already available to keep you busy for years. However, you can pay for an optional subscription if you want ($14.99/£8.99), which provides bonuses such as a larger inventory for storing all your gear and some extra gold coins to spend in the game’s online store. The Mac version of ESO did have a wobbly patch, around the time of Catalina, but it now runs well on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, and we were able to get a playable 30fps from the game at 1920×1080 resolution even on a basic M1 processor on our 24-inch iMac. 12. Resident Evil: Village – Best horror game Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mac App Store $39.99 View Deal Steam $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $39.99 at Mac App Store$39.99 at Steam The Resident Evil games are the sort of A-List titles that rarely come to the Mac, so the announcement at 2022’s WWDC that Resident Evil: Village would be released on the Mac at the end of the year was big news for Mac gamers. The game doesn’t disappoint either, providing a series of creepy locations for you to explore, and a variety of supernatural menaces to fight against. Mac users, of course, will be new to the games, but Village starts off with a brief recap of the previous game to bring us up to date. Three years ago – in Resident Evil 7 – Ethan Winters and his wife, Mia, were trapped by the Baker family in Louisiana, who had been infected – and mutated – by a mysterious black mold. They managed to escape, assisted by para-military operative Chris Redfield, and then three years pass by before things start to get weird all over again. Ethan and Mia are now living peacefully, along with their young daughter, Rose, until Redfield suddenly reappears, gunning Mia down in cold blood and kidnapping Rose. So, playing as Ethan, you now have to pick up the trail and try to figure out what is going on. It’s a frustrating game to get into at first, as the early stages of the game simply involve stumbling around a dark forest, liberally scattered with dead animals. Eventually, though, you discover the Village of the title, which is under siege by wolf-like Lycans, and find clues that suggest your daughter is being held in the conveniently creepy nearby castle. The pace barely lets up after that, with the game combining atmospheric horror and manic combat in equal measure (not to mention enough gore and bad language to merit a 17 age rating). Apple used the game at WWDC to demonstrate the graphical performance of its new M2 chips – but the good news is that we found the game runs pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with the older M1 chip. The bad news is that (a) it doesn’t run on Intel Macs at all, and (b) you’re paying extra for the Mac version, which costs $39.99/£34.99 on the Mac App Store, while the Windows version – released in 2021 – is half that price on Steam. It’s still a great game, though, and hopefully it’s just the first of many A-List titles that we can look forward to on the Mac in the new couple of years. 13. World Of Warcraft: Dragonflight – Best subscription MMO Price When Reviewed: $49.99, plus $12.99/month subscription Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Bilzzard $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $49.99 at Bilzzard World Of Warcraft has dominated the MMO genre for almost two decades now, and is one of the few A-list games to have staunchly supported the Mac throughout its history – in fact, it even provided an update that allowed the game to run on Apple Silicon Macs as early as November 2020. It’s had a few ups and downs in recent years – both in the real-world and in the game’s virtual world of Azeroth – but the release of the Dragonflight expansion at the end of 2022 was a welcome return to form, providing some important new features and also updating some of the more dated aspects of the game. Dragonflight costs $49.99/£39.99, and is required in order to enjoy new features such as raising your characters to the new maximum of Level 70. It also gives you access to the Dragon Isles, which contain four major new zones for you to explore and go adventuring. The Dragon Isles are also home to a new playable race of ‘draconic humanoids’ called Dracthyrs, who can play as the new Evoker class, which has the ability to choose between either healing or combat abilities. And, on entering the Dragon Isles, you can also obtain your own ‘drake’ – a flying dragon that allows you to learn a new set of ‘dragonriding’ skills that let you fly further, faster and higher as you explore the new zones. Throw in a more streamlined skill tree and a number of improvements to WoW’s aging interface, and the entire game feels more sprightly than it has done for several years. You don’t have to buy Dragonflight straight away though, as WoW still provides a free trial that takes you up to Level 20 for free, while owners of previous versions of the game can still continue to play – without the new Dragonflight features – by paying for a monthly subscription ($12.99/£9.99 per month, with discounts for three-month or six-month subscriptions). 14. Classic Marathon – Best Retro Action Game Price When Reviewed: Free Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam Free View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Free at Steam Apple is trying very hard to encourage games developers to come back to the Mac, but – around 30 years ago – there was a time when big-names such as Bungie actually developed their games on the Mac first (until Bungie was taken over by Microsoft). Before Bungie hit the big time with Halo, it made a name for itself with the Marathon series. The original Marathon games stopped running on the Mac long ago, but the entire Marathon series was recently revived with the help of an open-source programming team called Aleph One. The first Marathon game is now available on Steam as a free download – now called Classic Marathon – and it runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. The game is a real blast of retro fun, set aboard a space ship called The Marathon, which has been boarded by alien invaders. Your task is pretty straightforward and mostly involves running along lots of corridors blasting the living daylights out of the aliens. Along the way, you can log in to computer terminals that provide access to the ship’s onboard AI, which points you toward your next target or sends you looking for useful information. There’s a plot twist, though, as there seem to be rival AIs at work, each with their own agenda, and this keeps you thinking about what comes next, as well as just exercising your trigger finger in combat. The game’s old-school graphics obviously look a bit dated these days, but they have a lot of charm, and there’s a sense of satisfaction as you carefully attempt to pick off your enemies without wasting too much ammo – and a real sense of relief when you come across some spare ammo packs lying on the ground too. The somewhat clumsy control system isn’t quite so charming – it took me some time reading around on the Internet to discover that there’s no Save Game command, so you just have to hope you can survive all the way to the next checkpoint, where your game is saved automatically. But that’s part of the fun, as it puts extra pressure on you to stay alive, and to keep searching for hidden areas that may reward you with extra ammo or weapons. The two sequels – Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity – are also available, although you’ll need to download the open-source files from Aleph One’s own website, or wait for them to arrive on Steam for a more straightforward download and installation process. 15. Total War: Warhammer III – Best strategy game Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Steam 59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket 59.99 at Steam Perhaps the biggest game release of 2022 on the Mac, Total War: Warhammer III provided a truly epic conclusion to this popular series of strategy games. There’s no need to worry if you haven’t played any of the earlier games, though, as this three-quel includes an optional prologue, called The Lost God, that can act as an introduction for people who are new to the world of Warhammer. This prologue explains that the great Beard God, Ursun, who is worshipped by the human kingdom of Kislev has been imprisoned in the demonic Realms Of Chaos. In Ursun’s absence, a terrible winter has fallen over Kislev, so you start by playing Prince Barkov of Kislev, who leads a small band of warriors to discover the fate of Ursun. This section also acts as a tutorial for people who might be new to strategy games, and when you’re up to speed you can progress to the main campaign in which rival factions compete to reach Ursun and use his godly powers for their own ends. As well the people of Kislev, you can command another human kingdom called Grand Cathay, or turn to the dark side by playing one of the many demonic princes who all have their own monstrous armies. There’s Nurgle, the Plague Lord, whose somewhat squishy troops spread disease and decay, along with Khorne, the Blood God, the hedonistic Slaanesh, and Tzeentch, the master of Chaos Magic. And, finally, there’s the uber Daemon Price, whose powers – and even body parts – can be customized so that you can create a playing style that’s all your own. You can also buy additional DLC packs that add new factions and races to the game. There’s also a free add-on called Immortal Empires, which brings together campaign maps, factions and battles from all three Warhammer games into one vast and endlessly replayable series of battles. The good news is that the game will run on any Mac with an M1 or M2 processor – and we found that it ran at a smooth 30-40fps at 1920×1080 resolution even on a 24-inch iMac with a standard M1 processor. But while Intel Macs with AMD graphics may be able to run the game, there are a few technical glitches that can affect these Macs, so the game isn’t ‘officially supported’ on Intel Macs. 16. Football Manager 2024 – Best Football Game (aka Soccer for those in the U.S.) Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Sega $59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.99 at Sega There aren’t a lot of sports games available on the Mac, but the Football Manager series is a longtime supporter, and we get the 2024 edition at the same time as the PC and console versions too. The game is currently available via the Steam and Epic stores, but should also be coming to Apple Arcade soon as well. There’s also a new version of Football Manager 2024 Touch available for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. And, somewhat confusingly, the App Store also has a separate version, called Football Manager Mobile, which is only available to Netflix subscribers. One of the biggest changes this year is the arrival of the ‘J-League’, with 60 Japanese teams now added to the game, along with Japanese language support as well. There are also new playing modes, such as ‘Real World’ where players in your games move to new teams on the same dates as they do in real life. Each new version of the game tends to bring graphical improvements, and FM24 provides smoother animations for players as they charge around the pitch, more realistic physics for ball movement, and enhanced lighting effects to create a greater sense of atmosphere. And, of course, there are the inevitable AI features, such as the introduction of ‘Intermediaries’ that you can hire to go out and hustle for the best prices when you’re thinking of selling some players. There are also new Set Piece Coaches, who can help you to choose the best players for events such as free-kicks and corners. However, you’re up against tougher AI managers on opposition teams too, as they can now make smarter decisions when purchasing players that suit their tactical style. The game also follows recent trends in tactical play, such as the greater use of positional play, which allows players to switch positions when your team has possession. The sheer depth of all these tactical options means that Football Manager can be a bit daunting for more casual fans of the game, but there’s a demo version available on both Steam and Epic, so you can have a quick kick-about to see how you get on before buying the full game. 17. Grid Legends: Deluxe Edition – Best Racing Game Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Feral Interactive $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $39.99 at Feral Interactive It’s been quite a while since any of the Grid games were released on the Mac and, in fact, the Windows version of Grid Legends was first launched back at the start of 2022. However, the Deluxe Edition that’s just been launched on the Mac App Store does include all the game’s recent DLC add-ons – listed at more than $60/£60 on Steam for the Windows version – so it’s great value for racing fans on the Mac. You don’t have to be an ace F1 driver to play Grid Legends, though, as the game includes a variety of different modes that can appeal to casual players as well as experienced drivers who want a more demanding and realistic driving simulation. The game starts by throwing you into its Story mode, called Driven To Glory, which follows the Seneca Racing team as it tries to make its name in the new season. As well as following the action through a series of races, the Story mode is also presented as a kind of behind-the-scenes documentary, with video cut-scenes and interviews with some of the main drivers (including an appearance by the pre-Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa). Story mode is a good way for beginners to get started, but more experienced drivers can jump straight ahead into the Career mode. This provides five difficulty levels, and allows you to work your way up from rookie to a seasoned pro driver. There are 10 different racing discplines available, including Drift, Elimination and the arcade-action of Classic Car-nage, and the game lets you play on 24 different tracks in locations such as Brands Hatch, Barcelona Dubai and Miami. As you progress through the season, you can unlock 120 different vehicles, with different handling properties to suit your driving style. There’s also a Garage mode where you can upgrade and fine-tune your car to suit different terrain and weather conditions. The game also includes a Race Creator mode, where you can design your own custom race events, using different tracks, vehicles and weather conditions. It’s a shame, though, that the Mac version of the game is single-player only, and doesn’t have the multiplayer mode that’s available on the PC version. The game also requires an Apple Silicon processor, and doesn’t run on older Intel Macs. However, it ran more than fast enough for my somewhat chaotic driving skills on an M1 iMac with medium graphics and 1600×900 resolution, so you don’t need a super-fast Mac to put your pedal to the metal. 18. Lies of P – Apple’s Mac Game Of The Year Price When Reviewed: 59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price NeoWiz $59.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.99 at NeoWiz There aren’t many ‘soulsborne’ games available on the Mac – so called because they follow the format of the popular Lost Souls and Bloodborne games available on PC and consoles – but Lies Of P arrived on the Mac App Store recently and immediately walked off with Apple’s award for Mac Game Of The Year. The game is dedicated to Carlo Collodi, the author who created Pinocchio, and your main character is referred to as ‘the puppet of Gepetto’, so it’s clear who you’re supposed to be. This isn’t the cute Disney version of Pinocchio, though – for starters the little wooden boy has grown a bionic metal arm to give him some extra muscle, and one of your first tasks is to pick up a sword and choose a ‘path’ that determines your fighting style. The Path Of The Sweeper tends to focus on heavy, two-handed weapons, while the Path Of The Bastard lets you fight with lighter, faster weapons. Or, as a safe bet, you can choose the Path Of The Cricket, which combines elements of the other two fighting styles. Your puppet boy wakes in the city of Krat, a kind of steam-punk dystopia that has been over-run by rampaging puppets who have turned against their human masters. Guided by a cricket called Gemini (because Disney owns the name ‘Jiminy Cricket’) you fight your way across the city to locate Gepetto and end the puppet revolt. Like all soulsborne games, Lies Of P is very challenging, with a wide range of combat moves and skills that you have to master as you fight your way across the city. And, as the name suggests, the game also allows you to choose between telling lies or the truth as you encounter other characters in the game. The developers recommend using a game controller, rather than mouse and keyboard, and the game only runs on Apple Silicon, with no support for older Intel Macs. An M2 is recommended, but we still found the game playable on an iMac with a basic M1 processor, when running on medium graphics settings at 1920×1080, so most recent Mac models should be able to handle the game without too much trouble. The best games you can play on a Mac The best of the rest, in alphabetical order… Alien: Isolation – The Collection: Best Action Game Company: Feral Interactive Where to buy: Steam ($49.99/£34.99), Mac App Store ($39.99/£38.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 1GB graphics card Most of the games based on the Alien films have been pretty awful – in fact, Alien: Colonial Marines even prompted a lawsuit back in 2013 from disgruntled customers who felt they’d been misled by the advertising for the game. Fortunately, as our friends over at GameAgent recently remarked, Alien: Isolation is one of the “good Alien games”. Originally released for the PC in 2015, Alien: Isolation has arrived on the Mac and does a great job of capturing the tension and atmosphere of that very first Alien film. The game is set 15 years after Alien, following the discovery of the black-box flight-recorder from Ellen Ripley’s ship, The Nostromo. Ripley, of course, is still missing, so her daughter Amanda heads off to recover the black-box from the space station that found it. No prizes for guessing what Amanda and her team discover when they arrive at the space station: a toothy xenomorph on the loose, and gradually working its way through the terrified crew. Your task as Amanda is not to go in with all guns blazing, but simply to avoid the alien and stay alive – hiding inside a locker, or creating a distraction that will draw the alien away for a few crucial seconds. The game creates a real sense of tension, and the computer-controlled alien is smart enough to provide a really formidable foe. This ‘collection’ also includes a number of bonus missions, including Crew Expendable, which re-enacts events from the original Alien film. However, the game’s system requirements are pretty high, so you should check that your Mac is up to it before buying the game. Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition: Best RPG Company: Beamdog Where to buy: Steam ($4.99/£3.74), Mac App Store ($19.99/£19.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.7, dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 2.5GB hard disk The original Baldur’s Gate II was released way back in 1988 by the roleplaying gods at Bioware, and its 2D graphics will look pretty dated to anyone that has played modern roleplaying games such as Bioware’s Dragon Age series. Even so, it’s an essential purchase for anyone that has even the slightest interest in roleplaying games, and the sheer size of the game means that it’s excellent value for money. It’s a shame that this updated Enhanced Edition couldn’t be brought right up to date with more modern 3D graphics, but it does get a cosmetic makeover with high-def versions of the original artwork, so it doesn’t look too bad on modern computer screens. Besides, whether in 2D or 3D, Bioware’s great strength has always been its story-telling skill, and Baldur’s Gate II is as captivating now as it was nearly 30 years ago. It’s very much traditional fantasy fare – with you taking on the role of a warrior, wizard, rogue or cleric – but it’s done on a truly grand scale. Your character is just one of many mortal offspring spawned by the evil god Bhaal, and the game pits you against several of your own brothers and sisters as they vie to succeed Bhaal and claim his power as their own. There are hundreds and hundreds of quests along the way – around 300 hours worth if you try to complete them all – including power struggles within the guild of Shadow Thieves, and an epic battle with the wizard Irenicus, played in full scenery-chewing mode by Brit character actor David Warner. Throw in the return of bonkers barbarian Minsc and his giant space-hamster Boo, and BGII is a real retro treat for RPG fans. Braid: Best Platform Game Company: Hothead Games Where to buy: Mac App Store ($10.99/£10.99), Steam ($14.99/£10.99)System requirements: OS X 10.6.6 or later The first time you play Braid, you might be forgiven for thinking you’ve just bought a late 90s puzzle platformer. You jump and run like Mario, kill monsters by jumping on their heads and collect puzzle pieces. And then you’re introduced to Braid’s killer feature: you can turn back time. As you progress, you realise that this is a crucial part of the game’s mechanics. There are sections you can’t complete without winding back the action. Add in some fiendishly designed levels, a lot of old-school gaming and a genuinely great soundtrack, and you realise why Braid won all those awards. Civilization V: Brave New World – Best Strategy Game Company: AspyrWhere to buy: Steam ($29.99/£19.99), Green Man Gaming ($29.99/£19.99), Mac App Store ($29.99/£28.99)System requirements: OS X 10.6.8 or later The Civilization strategy games’ basic formula remains the same: you start with a bunch of cavemen and progress through history to create a civilisation that will rule the world. But the Civ series has long since passed the point where all you had to do was build up a big army. Civilization V beefed up the diplomacy elements and the Gods and Kings expansion pack added religion to the mix. Brave New World adds even more depth. There are nine new civilisations, including Portugal, Morocco, Brazil and the Zulus, but the real substance in Brave New World lies in the new cultural and ideological systems. The ‘Culture Victory’, for instance, is a new way of conquering the world, whereby nations can place musicians, writers and artists in key buildings, such as the Globe Theatre in London. There’s combat aplenty if that’s how you like your strategy games, but the political, religious and cultural elements that it adds to the mix create a game in which you really can develop an entire civilisation, rather than just building up a big army. Read our full Civilization V: Brave New World review. Disco Elysium: Best Detective RPG Company: ZAUMWhere to buy: Steam ($39.99/£34.99), GOG ($43.59/£34.99), Mac App Store ($39.99/£38.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.13.4 or later, Metal-Compatible graphics card It’s tough being a Mac gamer sometimes, watching great new games always arriving first on PC – and often never being released on the Mac at all. Last year’s launch of Disco Elysium was particularly galling for RPG fans, as we watched the PC version of the game mop up awards all over the place. However, the Mac version of Disco Elysium has suddenly appeared, with no advance publicity, and is widely available on all the main online game stores. As mentioned, Disco Elysium is a roleplaying game, but instead of medieval fantasy or futuristic sci-fi, the game casts you in the role of a drunken detective in a sort-of-contemporary setting, in the town of Revachol. You wake one morning in a sleazy hotel, with a mega-hangover, barely knowing who you are. After locating your trousers, you explore the hotel and encounter your partner, who reminds you that you are a detective investigating a murder case. You then set off to explore the local neighbourhood, interrogating suspects and looking for clues as you try to crack the case. Despite the contemporary setting many traditional roleplaying features are still in evidence – you can choose an ‘archetype’ for your character, such as the ‘Thinker’ who relies on deductive skills, or take the ‘Physical’ approach and try to intimidate suspects for information. There’s also an extensive set of additional skills, such as empathy or logic, that you can use to help you in your investigation. You don’t need to get too bogged down in stats and details, though, and you’ll soon be able to head off and explore the neighbourhood, which is wonderfully depicted, with grimy graphics and atmospheric music. Disco Elysium is the sort of absorbing, immersive game that can absorb you for hours on end. However, the system requirements for the 3D graphics are quite steep, so check to make sure your Mac can handle it first. Some of the language is a bit ripe too, so this definitely isn’t a game for younger children. Divinity: Original Sin 2: Best Multiplayer RPG Company: Larian StudiosWhere to buy: Steam ($26.99/£17.99), Mac App Store ($44.99/£43.99)System requirements: macOS 10.13.6 or later, MacBook Pro 2016 or later, MacBook Air 2017 or later, iMac with AMD graphics 2013 or later, Mac Mini 2018 At the end of 2018, the developers at Larian Studios announced that they were working with Apple – in itself a bit of a shock as Apple generally shows bugger-all interest in games on the Mac – to develop a Mac version of Original Sin 2 (one of the greatest RPGs of all time) using Apple’s Metal graphics system. There’s nothing half-hearted about the Mac version, either – as well as using Metal for the impressive 3D graphics, the game supports HDR (high dynamic range) on the latest Macs, as well as Mac-specific features such as Apple trackpads and the TouchBar on new MacBook Pro models. And the game’s multiplayer mode even works across both Macs and PCs, so you can play online with your friends (as long as you’ve all got the latest patches and updates). The only drawback here is that the Metal graphics require a fairly powerful Mac, so make sure to check the game’s system requirements before buying. Don’t worry if you’ve haven’t played the original game, as this sequel remains in the fantasy world of Rivellon, but steps forward in time and allows you to embark on an entirely new adventure. You start the game in a bit of trouble, as you’ve been captured and sentenced to jail for using a dangerous magical force called ‘Source’. Using Source gives you – and other ‘Sourcerors’ – great power, but it also creates a gateway to another dimension called The Void, allowing evil creatures to invade Rivellon. And, yep – you guessed it – your job is to save the world from the invading demons. The game begins with a helpful tutorial to get new players started, and newcomers can also opt for a ready-made ‘origin’ character that has already been set up for you. More experienced players can delve into character creation, with a wide variety of races on offer – with standard options such as humans, dwarves and elves complemented by more exotic lizards and undead – and the game also offers several difficulty levels and modes to cater for different playing styles and levels of experience. It might all sound like fairly routine fantasy fare, but Original Sin 2 is tremendously well-made and involving. There are few simple good-versus-evil choices, and sometimes you’ll find yourself wracked with guilt because you simply can’t find a nice, clean solution to a particular problem or a tricky side-quest. The solo game by itself will keep even hardened roleplaying fans absorbed through the dark winter months, and the various online and multiplayer modes will ensure that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that you’ll come back to time and time again. Elder Scrolls Online (plus Blackwood expansion): Best MMORPG Company: ZenimaxWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($59.99/£42.49), Steam ($59.99/£49.99). This is for the base game plus the expansion set; both sites also sell the base game, or just the upgrade, for a lower priceSystem requirements: macOS 10.13, Mac with quad-core CPU, discrete GPU with 1GB VRAM The Elder Scrolls Online is one of the few A-list MMORPG titles that supports the Mac, and ever since its launch back in 2014 the developers at Zenimax have kept their loyal players coming back by updating the game with a regular series of new ‘chapters’. These are essentially expansion packs that add more content, and occasionally new features too. But every year or so, Zenimax releases an update that makes major changes to the game in order to keep it feeling fresh and exciting – and 2021’s Blackwood expansion is one of the biggest updates for quite some time. The changes begin as soon as you enter the game. Even if you haven’t bought the Blackwood expansion there’s a new introductory tutorial that sends you to the island of Balfiera, where you can learn the ropes by helping the local townsfolk to fend off an invading army of monsters. Once you’ve completed the tutorial you’re given the option of entering a portal that can send you anywhere in the vast world of ESO. If you decide to head off to Blackwood, you’ll discover a vast new zone, full of quests and challenging dungeons. Blackwood also introduces a new companion system, which allows solo players to recruit a computer-controlled companion who can fight alongside you. This will be great for players – like me – who tend to play solo most of the time, with the new companion helping you to complete quests and tasks that might previously have been a bit too tough for one player on their own. Blackwood also introduces a new Gates of Oblivion storyline that will continue developing throughout this year, with a major quest that pits you against the demonic Prince Of Destruction, as he schemes to invade the mortal realm. The good news is that you don’t have to pay the full price for Blackwood right away, as the original base game now costs just £14.99/$19.99 – and no longer requires a monthly subscription to play. That contains enough action and adventure to keep you happy for months, before you decide if you want to visit Blackwood as well. Final Fantasy XIV Online: Best MMORPG Company: Square Enix Where to buy: Square Enix US store (from $19.99, plus $14.99 per month) or Square Enix EU store (from £9.99 + £7.69 monthly subscription); free trial also availableSystem requirements: Mac with OS X v10.14 or later, 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor As we’ve mentioned in the past, Final Fantasy XIV has had a bit of a chequered history – with the original Mac version in 2015 being so bad that the developers actually offered refunds. However, a series of updates over the past few years have seen FFXIV emerge as one of the top games in the MMORPG genre – despite the fact that, until recently, it was one of the few MMORPGs that still required a subscription to play. The latest update, which is now called Final Fantasy XIV Online, gives the game another major revamp, reworking the central quest system in order to give players a smoother introduction to the game’s vast online world. It also incorporates the Heavensward expansion pack that was previously sold separately, giving you even more quests and adventures to explore. Most important, though, is the new free trial system, which allows new players to sign up for a free account that provides access to vast areas of the game without paying for a subscription (although, to be honest, the registration process is a bit of a chore). Players with a trial account can take their characters all the way to level 60 – the maximum level with a subscription is 80 – and explore the main game and all the extra zones and quests in Heavensward for free. If you want to advance beyond L60 and explore new character classes and other new features then you will still need to buy a copy of the game and pay for a continuing subscription. However, you can start for as little as £9.99/$19.99 for the Online Starter Edition, and then decide if you want to continue your subscription, and buy the latest Shadowbringer expansion pack as well. Hearthstone: Best card game Company: BlizzardWhere to buy: playhearthstone.com (free to play, with in-game purchases)System requirements: macOS 10.10, Intel Core Duo, Nvidia GeForce 8600M or AMD Radeon HD 2600 Pro Hearthstone has been around for a few years now, and Blizzard’s typically slick presentation quickly established it as one of the leading computer card games. Like most card games, the basic version of Hearthstone is free to play, but offers a wide range of card packs that you can either buy with real money – starting from £2.99/€2.99 for two packs of five cards – or earn by collecting gold and treasure within the game itself. Picking up a trick from the long-running success of World Of Warcraft, Blizzard also releases special ‘expansion packs’ for Hearthstone every now and then, which bring new features to the game, as well as new cards and other goodies. But Hearthstone is still a fun game to play, even if you don’t want to spend a lot of money buying all the latest expansions. It’s a good option for newcomers to card games, with a simple tutorial that guides you through the main features of the game, and the basic/free version of Hearthstone still includes several different game modes that you can play in order to win new cards without spending any money at all. The game runs on most types of computer and mobile devices too, so you can switch between Mac, iOS and other devices using the same game account. Lego Star Wars Saga: Best Lego Game Company: Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Steam ($19.99/£15.49), Mac App Store ($19.99/£19.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5.8; 1.5GHz Intel processor; graphics card with 128MB VRAM No home should be without at least one Lego game, and if you pick up the Saga version you get the six games based on the Star Wars films for an affordable price. The sheer fun of playing with the Lego versions of Luke, Han, Yoda and Darth Vader will appeal to both adults and children. The six games in this pack offer a variety of different scenarios, including space battles, lightsaber duels, and the famous battle on the ice planet of Hoth. If you’re a Star Wars fan, Feral has also released a new Lego game based on the Clone Wars cartoon series, and there are other Lego games based on the Batman, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones films as well. Life Is Strange: Best Adventure Game Company: Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($3.20/£2.56), Steam ($19.99/£15.99, first episode free), Mac App Store ($17.99/£17.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.11 or later, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel processor, 8GB RAM, 512MB VRAM At first glance, Life Is Strange looks like a fairly conventional adventure game. You play a teenage girl called Max Caulfield who is having a bit of a bad day at school. Max ducks out of class and heads to the bathroom for a time-out, and as you wander the school corridors you can click on objects or people around you to gather information that guides you through the game. That’s routine adventure stuff, but life starts to get strange when Max witnesses the murder of her friend Chloe – and discovers that she has the ability to turn back time. Saving Chloe reveals a deeper mystery concerning a missing student called Rachel, so Max and Chloe set off to find Rachel and uncover the dark secrets of the sleepy town of Arcadia. That’s straightforward enough, but Chloe’s time-travelling abilities add a whole new dimension to the standard point-and-click adventure format. Sometimes a conversation with another character will reveal some useful information, allowing Chloe to go back and replay recent events so they have a different outcome. However, changing past events can have unexpected consequences, leading to some difficult – and dangerous – decisions. The story unfolds in five separate episodes, but you can check it out for free by downloading the first episode through Steam and then deciding if you want to explore the mystery further. We enjoyed its haunting, Buffy-esque depiction of the dark side of teenage life, and our only complaint is that the keyboard-and-mouse controls felt a bit clumsy so you’ll progress more smoothly if you have a proper game controller to help you out. Papers, Please: Best Puzzle Game Company: 3909 LLCWhere to buy: Steam ($9.99/£6.99), GOG ($9.99/£7.89)System requirements: 1.5GHz Core2Duo; OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) or later; 2 GB RAM; 100MB hard disk space Almost unclassifiable in normal gaming terms – we’ve put it with the puzzlers, although it’s really a bizarre take on the classic worker simulation – Papers, Please sees you taking up the post of border control in an authoritarian regime. Which is certainly a novel idea for a game. People enter your booth and present their papers; it’s your job to figure out if they can be allowed in. If you spot an irregularity in their paperwork, deny them entry. If their sob story touches your heartstrings, let them in. But if you let through too many dodgy types, or work too slowly, the money you earn will take a dip, and your family need to eat. Papers, Please is a quirky, interesting game set in a truly novel (and utterly bleak) environment. And while the level of profundity is debatable, there’s definitely more going on here than in your average worker sim. Read the full Papers, Please for Mac review The Sims 4: Best Sims Game Company: Maxis Where to buy: Origin ($4.79/£12.94), Best Buy ($39.99)System requirements: Mac OS X Lion; Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz; nVidia GeForce 320M; 4GB RAM; 10GB available HD space There’s a lot to take in with the latest addition to The Sims line-up: deeper customisation, more variety with actions, new careers and new places to explore. The Sims 4 had a lot to live up to after the success of The Sims 3, but it fills its predecessor’s shoes beautifully. You get a deeper level of character customisation than in previous generations. While you can still browse and select preset eyes, mouth, hair, etc, The Sims 4 allows you to fine-tune your character’s looks and build by clicking and dragging the area you want to tweak. Does your Sim’s belly protrude a little too much for your liking? Clicking on the troubled area and dragging it in will make your Sim thinner – it’s as easy as that. The build \u0026 design mode in The Sims was the basis for the game as a whole – it started off as a simulator that architects could use. And it’s fantastic here. It’s a great experience being able to design a home exactly how you want it to be and really gets your creative juices flowing. With more design options (like the ability to build “in the air” with no support below), houses in The Sims 4 looks more breathtaking than ever. You can pick up and move whole rooms whenever you fancy a change, and buy whole rooms of same-style furniture. For those of us without an eye for interior design, it allows us to really appreciate the game and the design process. Day-to-day life in The Sims 4 is more enjoyable, too. If your Sim is hungry, simply click on the hunger bar and the Sim will automatically feed themselves – the same applies to all their other needs too. It takes the effort out of the more mundane tasks and allows you more time to do the fun things with your Sim. The Sims 4 is a great game with so many options that you’ll lose yourself for hours at a time. Lewis Painter Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: Best RPG Company: AspyrWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($2.80/£2.01), Steam ($3.49/£2.51), Mac App Store ($9.99/£9.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.9.5, 2.2GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 256MB graphics card It’s more than a decade since the original Knights Of The Old Republic was first released, but that game is still selling well on the App Store even after all these years. So it came as a bit of a surprise when we realised that this sequel – originally released for PC back in 2005 – has only just arrived on the Mac for the first time. Like its predecessor, KOTOR II is set thousands of years in the past, long before the events of the Star Wars film series. You play one of the last surviving Jedi, who have been almost completely wiped out after a long war with the evil Sith Lords. At the start of the game you wake up injured and with no memory of recent events. Even your trusty light-sabre has gone missing, so your initial challenge is to recover your memory and your Jedi powers, and then set off to try and find any other Jedi that may have survived. There’s a wide range of skills and abilities that you can develop as you progress through the game, and you can focus on either light-sabre combat or spooky Force Powers depending on how you want to develop your character. There’s also a strong story and roleplaying element, full of political twists and turns, and moral decisions that will affect the final outcome of the game. The 3D graphics look a little dated now, but the intriguing storyline and light-sabre action will soon have you hooked, and at just £9.99 the game’s a real bargain for Star Wars fans. Total War: Warhammer II: Best Strategy Game Company: Creative Assembly/ Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Steam ($59.99/£39.99)System requirements: macOS 10.14, 2GHz Intel Core i5, Radeon R9 M290 or Intel Iris 540 with 2GB video memory Total War: Warhammer was a match made in Orc-heaven, as it combined the fantasy warfare of the Warhammer series with the large-scale battles of the Total War strategy games. So it’s no surprise that this follow-up offers more of the same, albeit with enough variety to make it worth coughing up the rather hefty £39.99/$59.99 on Steam. But you should check the game’s system requirements first, as the battling armies of elves, lizardmen and rodent-like Skaven need a pretty powerful Mac to handle their demanding 3D graphics. The story for the main single-player campaign is, to be honest, fairly trite fantasy fodder, with the game’s four rival factions competing to control a great, swirling vortex of magical energy floating up in the sky. That’s little more than an excuse to get the rival armies and heroes charging across the game’s vast landscapes, but the main campaign is well constructed and gives you plenty of different options for getting stuck into endless hours of fantasy fisticuffs. You can control any of the four rival races, and each race lets you choose between two Legendary Lords, who all have different storylines and starting locations, as well as their own special abilities that can be used to assist their troops in battle (and, if you’re new to the Total War games, one Lord for each race also gives you a handy tutorial to get started). That gives you eight different options for playing and re-playing the game, and if you also own the original Total War: Warhammer then you get a free bonus campaign thrown in as well. The game also includes a number of Battle modes that you can dip into for a quick fix every now and then, as well as a multiplayer mode. Wildermyth: Best RPG Company: Worldwalker GamesWhere to buy: Steam ($24.99/£19.49)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.13, 64-bit processor Wildermyth is an unusual and impressive roleplaying game with flexible character development that encourages you to go back and play through it again. It’s an immediately eye-catching game with ‘papercraft’ graphics that look like a child’s popup book, as your 2D characters use a turn-based combat system to move through hand-painted 3D environments. You start by creating a party with three characters: a warrior, a hunter (rogue) and mystic. These characters are created by the game, with their own personalities and backgrounds, although you can fine-tune each character by modifying their appearance, skills and other abilities. And, like all good roleplaying games, it allows you to make choices that affect the story and the relationships between the various characters. At various points you’ll be presented with options – drawn like panels from a comic book rather than dull lumps of text – that establish whether your characters are friends, rivals, or even in a romance, and this affects the way that the story develops and how the lives of your characters unfold. The tutorial could be a little clearer – I had to look up some videos on YouTube to help me get started – but the turn-based combat isn’t too difficult to master, and you can develop your party’s abilities to combine stealth, magic and weapon skills in any way that you like. And, at the end of each game, you can save favourite ‘legacy’ characters in order to bring them back the next time you play. This is where Wildermyth really stands out, as its story is ‘procedurally generated’ – it’s not entirely random, but is flexible within a framework that is controlled by the game itself. There’s enough variety within that framework to enjoy playing through again, and gives you the luxury of being reunited with your favourite characters to see how their stories and relationships continue to develop throughout their lives. World Of Warcraft: Best MMORPG Company: BlizzardWhere to buy: WoW (free for Starter Edition, plus $12.99/£8.99 monthly subscription)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5.8; Intel Core 2 Duo; graphics card with 256MB VRAM Its cutesy graphics aren’t to everyone’s taste, but World of Warcraft is still the game that rules the massively multiplayer online scene, with around seven million subscribers playing as wizards, priests, warriors and rogues. Part of that success is down to the release of regular expansion packs, such as 2010’s Cataclysm, which – quite literally – shook up the landscape, destroying some old areas and introducing new zones for you to explore. The fairly regular release of new material keeps experienced players happy, but to attract new players, Blizzard announced a Starter Edition of the game that allows you to play for free until your character reaches level 20. XCOM 2: Best Strategy Game Company: Feral Interactive Where to buy: Steam ($14.99/£8.74), Mac App Store ($49.99/£48.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X 10.11.2, 2.4GHz dual-core processor, discrete graphics card with 1GB VRAM The good news is that XCOM 2 arrived on the Mac at the same time as the PC version. The bad news is that the aliens won at the end of XCOM: Enemy Unknown back in 2013. So now we jump forward 20 years and the Earth is ruled by Advent – a coalition of alien overlords and their human collaborators (boo, hiss) – so it’s up to you to lead the human resistance movement and recruit a new XCOM team to wage a guerrilla war against the alien oppressors. Like its predecessor, XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game that provides an overhead isometric view of the battlefield so that you can plan your team’s moves as they approach their target. But the moment you pull the trigger the action switches to a close-up view – similar to a first person shooter – that gives it a more visceral feel than most conventional strategy games. There are five soldier classes available to help you out, including Sharpshooters with their long-range sniper skills, and Grenadiers who just charge in and blow up everything in sight. There’s also the Psi Operative, who adds a fantasy/sci-fi element with telepathic abilities such as Soulfire and mind-control. Each class also gets its own selection of different skills, giving you plenty of freedom to develop your team in a way that suits your combat style. There are other resources available too. Your base is a captured alien ship called the Avenger, and between missions you need to give careful thought to developing the engineering, research and armoury facilities on the ship in order to provide new weapons and technology for your team. It’s gripping stuff, and guaranteed to keep strategy fans glued to the screen for hours on end. Further reading That’s it! We’re done.

  "text": "Unfortunately in recent years, the number of great games for Mac has declined because many are no longer supported. Every new version of macOS tends to break a few games, but macOS Catalina in 2019 meant that lot of games that used 32-bit code were no longer Mac compatible. At the same time that Apple went 64-bit only it also introduced Metal for 3D graphics, which left a lot of games developers with a decision: make new Mac versions of their games or stop making them. Unfortunately many chose the latter. This has started to change with the arrival of macOS Sonoma is here. With Sonoma, Apple provides two things: a new Game Porting Toolkit to make it easier for game developers to bring their games to the Mac, and a new Game Mode to ensure a game gets the highest priority on GPU and CPU, for better playability. Read: How to use Game Mode to boost performance. Following these changes we’ve seen more games coming to the Mac. Including Resident Evil 7: Biohazard and World of Warcraft: The War Within. Many more A-list games are coming to the Mac, including Assassins Creed: Shadows (November 2024), Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (December 2024), and Resident Evil 2 (date TBC). Just check out our roundup of the best Mac games for some of the highlights, we also have a round-up of the best free Mac games.  Even before the changes that Sonoma brought, and contrary to popular belief, Mac gamers already have plenty of top games titles to choose from – indeed, the most difficult part is narrowing down the options, and then finding the money to buy and time to play them. We can’t help with the latter, but the first problem is right up our alley. In this article, we’ve collected the best Mac games for your delectation – including some of the best new games. Below you will find what we believe are the greatest Mac games out there, together with links to the Mac App Store, Steam and other reputable vendors, so you can buy them right away. These are the very best games for Mac. They are in alphabetical order, not in order of preference (because everyone likes different things). November 2024: Including an update to the Diablo III review now that Blizzard has brought Diablo III up-to-date for Mac users. You may also like to take a look at our Best Mac for gaming guide. Plus we have an in-depth look at using an M1 MacBook Pro as a gaming laptop. And if you want some free games to try out on your Mac take a look at our round-up of the Best free Mac games. Before we run through our list of the best games we’ve played on the Mac, here are games that we strongly recommend you play on the Mac in 2024. 1. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (Mac) Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Apple Silicon, with Resident Evil: Village at the end of last year, quickly followed by Resident Evil 4 earlier this year. The latest addition to the range is Resident Evil 7 Biohazard. Biohazard requires a Mac with an M1 or later, running macOS 13.0 or later. Biohazard also runs on the iPad, as long as it has an M1 processor and iPadOS 17, and even the iPhone, with iOS 17 and an A17 processor. It is cheaper than other games in the series, costing just $19.99/£15.99 on the Mac App Store. The game can be downloaded for free and run in demo mode, called ‘The Beginning Hour’, as an introduction to the main game. If you like the demo, you can buy the full game as an in-app purchase, and there’s an expansion pack available for another $19.99/£15.99. The game introduces Ethan Winters (who also appeared in Village), who searches for his wife, Mia, who vanished mysteriously three years ago. He receives an email from Mia asking for his help and gives him an address in a swampy backwater town in Louisiana. The game switches to an isolated first-person view, making every shadowy corridor seem even more oppressive and creepy. The game also makes clever use of the found-footage genre of horror movies, with Ethan finding old VHS tapes around the house that help fill in some of the background. There’s also a time-travel effect, where you can take actions during video segments in the past that impact on the present. Capcom recommends a game controller, but it’s possible to play with a keyboard and mouse if you prefer. Read our full Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (Mac) review 2. Death Stranding: Directors Cut (Mac) Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Apple is currently attempting to make up for around 40 years of neglecting the Mac games scene – probably because it thinks that a few good games might help to boost sales of the new Vision Pro headset (cynical, moi? You betcha!). It hasn’t exactly catapulted the Mac games scene into the stratosphere, but there are a few high-profile games now starting to arrive on the Mac, and 2024 gets off to a good start with the arrival of Death Stranding, the idiosyncratic and sometimes downright bizarre game from Hideo Kojima, the renowned developer behind the long-running Metal Gear series. The game is set in a near-future version of the United States, in the aftermath of a mysterious apocalyptic event known as the Death Stranding, which has caused the collapse of society. All that’s left are a few scattered communities, which rely on ‘porters’ to deliver supplies and help set up a communications system called the Chiral network. That’s where you come in, playing Sam ‘Porter’ Bridges – who is voiced by, and modeled on the actor Norman Reedus of Walking Dead fame – as he trudges across the country delivering his supplies. Along the way, you’ll encounter terrorists and creepy invisible monsters called BTs (‘beached things’), but your real foe for much of the game is simply the environment around you. There is some combat in Death Stranding, but your main task as a porter is to struggle across the rocky, ruinous countryside as you embark on a series of missions to deliver your cargo of medicines and other supplies. The game is sometimes described as a ‘walking simulator ’ as you spend much of your time clambering over rocks, up hills, or wading across rushing rivers and streams. That may not sound terribly exciting, but there’s a lot of satisfaction as you struggle to slowly inch your way towards the peak of a craggy hill with your cargo intact. The game also has a dramatic cinematic flair – possibly a little too cinematic, as the first 45 minutes or so is really just a series of very long cut-scenes, interspersed only by a few brief sequences where you learn how to control Sam as he walks, jumps and wades across the rocky terrain. The long cut-scenes can try your patience in the early stages of the game, but they do look terrific – the landscapes have a cinematic scope, and the 3D graphics are tremendously detailed and realistic. And the feeling that this is the gaming equivalent of a blockbuster Hollywood production is further emphasized by cameos from a number of other Hollywood big names, including Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo Del Toro, and Lindsay Wagner. The graphics do require a bit of horsepower though. The game will only run on Macs and iPads that have an Apple Silicon processor (M1 or later), and running macOS 13.3 or iPadOS 17.0. We were pleased to find that the game ran well even on an iMac with an M1 processor, although we did have to lower the resolution to 1920×1080. You might need an M2 or M3 to really enjoy the game’s sweeping vistas and eerie special effects, but seeing a game like Death Stranding running on an M1 iMac gives us some hope for the future of games on the Mac. 3. Resident Evil 4 – Jump scares galore Price When Reviewed: $59.99 It can be a little tricky following the sequence of the Resident Evil games – especially as most of them have never been released on the Mac. Last year’s Resident Evil: Village was the eighth game in the long-running series, although it was the first ever to arrive on the Mac, and also one of the first games written specifically to run on Macs with Apple Silicon. However, Resident Evil 4 is actually a newer game (sort of) as it’s a remake of the original Resident Evil 4, which was first released back in 2005. Being a newer game means that it’s considerably more expensive, though, weighing in at a rather hefty $59.99/£57.99. However, it works hard to earn its keep with “juiced-up visuals and a reimagined story” as well as improved controls for combat and other character actions. And, thankfully, you can actually download the game for free and play through the opening section, before deciding if you want to go ahead and buy the full version of the game as an in-app purchase (along with some rather pricey DLC packs too). This installment follows the adventures of special agent Leon S. Kennedy – a floppy-haired special agent from an earlier game in the series – who has now been recruited to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the US President. Tracking her down to a village in Spain, Leon encounters a spooky cult called Los Iluminados, who have turned the villagers into crazed killers. You have to fight your way past the villagers and confront various bosses as you track down the President’s daughter and attempt to uncover the cult’s true plans. Resident Evil 4 has some good jump scares along the way, but it’s more action-oriented than Village and doesn’t have quite the same creepy and tense atmospherics. It certainly keeps you busy, though, as you shoot and slice your way through the villagers, and encounter the mysterious figures who control the cult. And, of course, it’s pretty gorey too, with a 17+ age rating. Like Resident Evil: Village, this game runs on Macs with Apple Silicon, and it ran pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with a basic M1 processor. It felt a little sluggish initially, but seemed to run quite smoothly once we turned the resolution down to 1,920 x 1,080, and experimented with some of the graphics settings (the game will also run on iPads with Apple Silicon, and even on the iPhone 15 Pro as well). 4. Frost Punk 2 – Winter wonderland? Price When Reviewed: $44.99 When it launched a few years ago Frost Punk was a surprise hit. It tis a survival game based in an alternate 19th century world that has been plunged into a new ice age by a vast, global blizzard called the Great Frost. Frost Punk 2 is set 30 years after the original and you are tasked with finding new sources of food and fuel for the growing population and dealing with threats like hunger, crime and factional rivalries.  The new game has a prologue that introduces the story for new players, and also acts as a tutorial, in which you struggle through the icy ‘frostlands’ to reach a wrecked train and scavenge its resources. The game also looks great, with dramatic and imposing 3D graphics that look like Blade Runner with added snow. Frost Punk 2 is quite a challenging game, even for people who have played strategy games before. Basic tasks such as gathering resources can prove to be quite complex. Frost Punk 2 is a little more abstract than its predecessor, as you now need to step back and take more of an overview of the structure of this society. There are several difficulty levels, where you can adjust economic conditions, such as the scarcity of food and fuel. You can also modify the weather.  The scale of New London and its complex society provides a rich tapestry for the story that unfolds under your stewardship. Once you’ve finished the main game there’s also an ‘endless’ Utopia mode that allows you to start a new city by choosing from a variety of locations, with different terrain and weather conditions. Frost Punk 2 is available on both Steam and the Mac App Store, but the Steam version of the game is slightly cheaper. Read our full Frost Punk 2 review 5. Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown – The Prince on the Mac Price When Reviewed: $39.99 The Lost Crown was released for Windows PCs at the start of 2024, but it took until December for it to appear on the Mac App Store where it’s working its way up Apple’s games chart. The Lost Crown is a side-scrolling game that combines combat and platform-jumping elements. It’s presented like an old-school 2D platform game where you mostly run left or right across the screen and use the Space bar to jump over obstacles. The game looks great with detailed backgrounds that create a real sense of atmosphere You play a young warrior called Sargon, who is a member of a group that modestly call themselves The Immortals. The kingdom of Persia is under attack from an enemy army, and Prince Ghassan has been taken captive and imprisoned on the magical Mount Qaf. Sargon and his associates head off to rescue the Prince, but soon discover that Mount Qaf is full of mystical enemies, puzzles and obstacles that have to be overcome. The game requires an M1 processor or later (so it won’t run on Intel Macs). However, the 2D presentation means that it doesn’t need a powerful Mac, and we had no trouble running it with high graphics settings at 4K resolution on a MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro chip. Read our full Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown review 6. Total War: Pharaoh – New for Mac users Price When Reviewed: $59.99 After a fairly epic detour into the fantasy worlds of Warhammer, the Total War series is back on its home turf once more, returning to the more traditional historical settings that the games have explored in the past. This time it’s ancient Egypt for Total War: Pharaoh, set in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, and covering the lands of Egypt itself, as well as neighboring Canaan and the Hittite Empire. There are eight factions spread across these three lands, all competing to take the throne of Egypt and become the next Pharoah (with additional factions available to purchase as DLC on Steam). Each faction has its own leader, with their own individual strengths and abilities, such as the reckless young warrior Ramesses (who has a tendency to “put the chariot before the horses”), and the cunning Tausret, who uses diplomacy and finance to pull the levers of power. If you’re new to the game then there are several tutorials available that introduce the basics of battle, as well as more advanced tactics, such as siege warfare, and learning how to use the land and weather to your advantage. Pharoah might not have the otherworldly spectacle of the Warhammer games, but it still looks great, with spectacular vistas as the rival armies charge across the desert dunes. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t run on older Macs that have Intel processors, but it ran quite smoothly on an iMac with a basic M1 processor when set to 1920×1080 resolution (and using the new gaming mode in macOS Sonoma). The main single-player campaign should keep you busy for quite a while, and as well as creating custom battles to hone your skills you can also customize the main campaign, adjusting the troops, resources and money that are available to make the game more challenging. It’s a shame, though, that the game’s multiplayer mode only allows you to play with other Mac users, as this means that – without being able to play against PC users – you’ll have a fairly limited choice of online opponents. 7. Baldur’s Gate 3 – Best single-player RPG Price When Reviewed: $59.99 The original Baldur’s Gate games were classics of the RPG genre when the series was launched almost 25 years ago, but their 2D graphics haven’t aged well, despite an HD update in 2012. However, the forthcoming Baldur’s Gate 3 brings the series well and truly up to date with slick 3D graphics and a vast adventure that looks set to match the epic scale of its predecessors. It’s actually been available in ‘early access’ on Steam since 2020, but the game finally has a firm release date for August 2023 so you can now dive in and test drive the early chapters of the game to prepare yourself for the arrival of the full game in just a few months time. It’s not a true sequel as the story and the main characters are all new – set more than 100 years after BG2 – although it is still set in the famous Baldur’s Gate region from the popular Dungeons \u0026 Dragons table-top games (and – spoiler alert – some familiar faces do make a welcome reappearance). Rather than the powerful, god-like being that you became in Baldur’s Gate II, the new game lets you start from scratch with an entirely new character, chosen from the traditional D\u0026D selection of races and classes – humans, elves, dwarves, wizards, warriors and rogues – and you then awake to find yourself prisoner on a flying ship controlled by Mindflayers (a familiar villain from D\u0026D lore). The ship is attacked by dragons, but you’re able to escape – only to find that a Mindflayer larva has been implanted inside your brain. So, along with other survivors from the crashed ship, you set out to try to find a cure and then quickly find yourself embroiled in a mysterious war between the Mindflayers and an assortment of enemy races – who won’t be fully revealed until the game’s launch in the summer. The 3D graphics really bring the game to life as you and your companions wade into combat, but the spectacular visuals do need a fairly fast Mac in order to run properly. The developers says that the game will run on an Intel Mac with a quad-core CPU and an AMD graphics card, or on most Macs with M1 or M2 processors. However, we had to drop the resolution to just 1600×900 on our M1 iMac in order to get a playable 25fps, so an M1 Pro or higher might be better. Fortunately, the game’s turn-based combat doesn’t require lightning reflexes and high-speed action, so you can still get by with an M1 Mac if you need to. The decision to opt for turn-based combat might worry old-timers – like yours truly – who remember the terrific real-time-with-pause system of the original games. But turn-based is the trend these days, and if my time in the early access game is anything to go by then you’ll find that the old Baldur’s Gate magic will soon tempt you in as you “gather your party before venturing forth” – just like the good old days! 8. Valheim – Best survival game Price When Reviewed: $19.99 There aren’t many survival games that have made it onto the Mac, so we were pleasantly surprised when developer Iron Gate recently announced a Mac version of its hugely successful Valheim. The PC game has been available in early access since 2021 – which means that you’re essentially paying to play a beta version of the game – but it’s received a series of updates over the last couple of years that add more and more features, and the game has now sold more than 10 million copies. Valheim follows the standard format for the survival. genre. Rather than providing a central story or quest, it simply drops you into the world of Valheim, which is based on Norse mythology, and then just leaves you to get on with things and decide how you want to play. The world includes several different biomes–regions with different terrain and climate–including leafy forests, snowy mountains or the barren Ashlands that were added in a recent update. You’ll start in a fairly welcoming leafy glade, where you can gather food and materials for crafting and building yourself a home. Many people seem quite happy to spend a lot of their time working on their homestead, hunting and crafting to make themselves comfortable in their new home (a bit like the Sims, except with Vikings and monsters). But, as you develop your crafting and building skills, you’ll need to wander a bit further afield and explore other biomes in order to find new materials and resources. As you visit each biome you’ll encounter a variety of beasts and monsters, which will force you to craft more powerful weapons and hone your Viking fighting skills. Each biome also has its own boss monster that you have to defeat as well, with the ultimate goal–when the game eventually emerges from early access–of reaching Viking heaven in Valhalla. It’s quite a challenging game, and the intentionally retro 3D graphics may not appeal to everyone, but many people are happy to spend months at a time just exploring, hunting and building their home in Valheim. If things get a bit tough then there’s a co-op mode available so that you can recruit up to nine friends to help you out, and the old-school graphics mean that the game runs well even on older Intel-based Macs (although Macs with Apple Silicon will need to be running macOS 14.0 or later). It’s available on both Steam and the Mac App Store – but just remember that this is an early access game, so you may experience a few bugs along the way. Price When Reviewed: From $19.99 for base game; Gold Road Collection: $49.99 Elder Scrolls Online is one of the few MMO games that is available on the Mac, and it celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2024 with the launch of a major update called Gold Road. The game has seen a lot of changes along the way – both to the game itself, and also to the Mac platform, following the transition to Apple Silicon. The bad news is that developer Zenimax now states that Apple Silicon “is not officially supported”. In fact, the game does run on Macs with Apple Silicon – thanks to Rosetta – although some users have reported poor performance even on high-end Mac models. However, I was able to get a perfectly playable 40fps when running the game at 2,560 x 1,440 resolution with high graphics settings on my MacBook Pro with M2 Pro, and 55fps on medium graphics. There’s no free trial available for Elder Scrolls Online, but the game does run free play events every few months that allow you to play free of charge for a couple of weeks, so keep an eye out for these events if you’d like to check the game out before buying. One of the good things about Elder Scrolls Online is that – unlike MMO rivals such as World Of Warcraft – it doesn’t require a subscription to play. You do need to pay $19.99/£15.99 for the base game (until end of June 2024 this is $5.99 at Epic), or $49.99/£42.99 for the complete Gold Road Collection – which includes a whole decade’s worth of expansion packs – but after that you can play for as long as you want without having to pay a monthly subscription (although a subscription is available as an optional extra). Even the base game is huge, with a vast continent full of snowy mountains, windswept deserts and murky marshes for you to explore. There are epic quests, a wide range of skills and abilities to master and, of course, there are the inevitable dungeons and quite a few dragons that you can face on your adventures as well. As always, the Gold Road expansion adds a new region for you to explore, and a major new storyline called The Return Of Ithelia. It also introduces a major new magic system to the game, called Scribing, which provides new skills and spells that can be customized so that you can create a unique set of skills that really allow you to play just the way that you want. 10. Diablo III: 2024 Update: Best Action RPG Price When Reviewed: $39.99 It’s a little over 12 years since we originally reviewed the Mac version of Diablo III, and it’s safe to say that a lot has changed since then. The game still runs on Macs, but the transition to Apple Silicon has meant that it relies on Rosetta to run on modern Macs, and umpteen new versions of the macOS have introduced a few bugs that are annoying even if they don’t completely break the game. Now, completely out of the blue, the developers at Blizzard have announced an update – to version 2.7.8 – that brings Diablo III right up to date for Mac users. As well as being compatible with the most recent versions of the macOS and ironing out those old bugs, Diablo III now runs natively on Macs with either Intel processors or Apple Silicon – and that’s quite surprising for a game that’s this old. Season 30 was the end of the road for new game content, but Blizzard did introduce a number of new features that should help to keep diehard players interested. The new Solo Self Found mode (SSF) is a completely single-player mode that forces you to rely purely on weapons and items that you find on your own. A new feature called Visions Of Enmity opens portals to a series of mini-levels that are crammed full of monsters, but which provide a chest full of loot once you reach the final level. There’s also the Altar Of Rites, where you can sacrifice some of your hard-earned loot to gain a series of bonuses and buffs that will help you tackle the game’s many challenges in solo mode. The 2.7.8 update also arrived at the same time as Season 33 of Diablo III, that revisits the Shades Of The Nephilim theme and allows you to summon clone versions of your character to help you in battle. Unfortunately, Diablo IV, which was launched in 2023, still isn’t available for the Mac at all, but at least this revamp of Diablo III provides plenty of dungeon-crawling fun for Mac users. And, of course, there are options that may allow you to run Diablo IV as well, if you read our guide to the best virtual machine software for Macs. Read our full Diablo III review Price When Reviewed: $19.99 Along with World Of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls Online – or ESO to its thousands of fans – is one of the few A-List MMO titles that still supports the Mac (sadly, we lost Guild Wars 2 a couple of years ago…). But, unlike WoW, you don’t need to pay a monthly subscription to play the game, which makes it great value for players who want to immerse themselves in hundreds of hours of quests and adventures in the game’s online world of Tamriel. Some people – i.e. me – also prefer its grittier graphical style to the Disney-esque cartoon graphics of WoW. ESO keeps its fans coming back year after year by releasing regular expansions – which it refers to as Chapters, as each new chapter brings a new story and a new series of quests to the game, as well as opening up new zones for you to explore. The latest chapter is High Isle, which takes you to the homeland of the game’s Breton race, and throws you into a story of political intrigue involving High Isle’s rival factions and a mysterious organization known as the Ascendent Order. Other new features include a new deck-building card game that you can play to while away a few hours, and two new computer-controlled companions for players who prefer to go questing on their own. And, of course, there are plenty of new quests to complete and dungeons waiting to be plundered. You can buy the base version of the game for $19.99/£15.99 (until end of June 2024 this is $5.99 at Epic), or buy the High Isle Collection, which includes High Isle and all the previous chapters for $49.99/£42.99. Or, if you already own the game, you can just upgrade with High Isle on its own for $29.99/£24.99. Once you’ve bought the game you can play for as long as you want without paying a monthly subscription, and there are enough dungeons and quests already available to keep you busy for years. However, you can pay for an optional subscription if you want ($14.99/£8.99), which provides bonuses such as a larger inventory for storing all your gear and some extra gold coins to spend in the game’s online store. The Mac version of ESO did have a wobbly patch, around the time of Catalina, but it now runs well on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, and we were able to get a playable 30fps from the game at 1920×1080 resolution even on a basic M1 processor on our 24-inch iMac. 12. Resident Evil: Village – Best horror game Price When Reviewed: $39.99 The Resident Evil games are the sort of A-List titles that rarely come to the Mac, so the announcement at 2022’s WWDC that Resident Evil: Village would be released on the Mac at the end of the year was big news for Mac gamers. The game doesn’t disappoint either, providing a series of creepy locations for you to explore, and a variety of supernatural menaces to fight against. Mac users, of course, will be new to the games, but Village starts off with a brief recap of the previous game to bring us up to date. Three years ago – in Resident Evil 7 – Ethan Winters and his wife, Mia, were trapped by the Baker family in Louisiana, who had been infected – and mutated – by a mysterious black mold. They managed to escape, assisted by para-military operative Chris Redfield, and then three years pass by before things start to get weird all over again. Ethan and Mia are now living peacefully, along with their young daughter, Rose, until Redfield suddenly reappears, gunning Mia down in cold blood and kidnapping Rose. So, playing as Ethan, you now have to pick up the trail and try to figure out what is going on. It’s a frustrating game to get into at first, as the early stages of the game simply involve stumbling around a dark forest, liberally scattered with dead animals. Eventually, though, you discover the Village of the title, which is under siege by wolf-like Lycans, and find clues that suggest your daughter is being held in the conveniently creepy nearby castle. The pace barely lets up after that, with the game combining atmospheric horror and manic combat in equal measure (not to mention enough gore and bad language to merit a 17 age rating). Apple used the game at WWDC to demonstrate the graphical performance of its new M2 chips – but the good news is that we found the game runs pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with the older M1 chip. The bad news is that (a) it doesn’t run on Intel Macs at all, and (b) you’re paying extra for the Mac version, which costs $39.99/£34.99 on the Mac App Store, while the Windows version – released in 2021 – is half that price on Steam. It’s still a great game, though, and hopefully it’s just the first of many A-List titles that we can look forward to on the Mac in the new couple of years. 13. World Of Warcraft: Dragonflight – Best subscription MMO Price When Reviewed: $49.99, plus $12.99/month subscription World Of Warcraft has dominated the MMO genre for almost two decades now, and is one of the few A-list games to have staunchly supported the Mac throughout its history – in fact, it even provided an update that allowed the game to run on Apple Silicon Macs as early as November 2020. It’s had a few ups and downs in recent years – both in the real-world and in the game’s virtual world of Azeroth – but the release of the Dragonflight expansion at the end of 2022 was a welcome return to form, providing some important new features and also updating some of the more dated aspects of the game. Dragonflight costs $49.99/£39.99, and is required in order to enjoy new features such as raising your characters to the new maximum of Level 70. It also gives you access to the Dragon Isles, which contain four major new zones for you to explore and go adventuring. The Dragon Isles are also home to a new playable race of ‘draconic humanoids’ called Dracthyrs, who can play as the new Evoker class, which has the ability to choose between either healing or combat abilities. And, on entering the Dragon Isles, you can also obtain your own ‘drake’ – a flying dragon that allows you to learn a new set of ‘dragonriding’ skills that let you fly further, faster and higher as you explore the new zones. Throw in a more streamlined skill tree and a number of improvements to WoW’s aging interface, and the entire game feels more sprightly than it has done for several years. You don’t have to buy Dragonflight straight away though, as WoW still provides a free trial that takes you up to Level 20 for free, while owners of previous versions of the game can still continue to play – without the new Dragonflight features – by paying for a monthly subscription ($12.99/£9.99 per month, with discounts for three-month or six-month subscriptions). 14. Classic Marathon – Best Retro Action Game Price When Reviewed: Free Apple is trying very hard to encourage games developers to come back to the Mac, but – around 30 years ago – there was a time when big-names such as Bungie actually developed their games on the Mac first (until Bungie was taken over by Microsoft). Before Bungie hit the big time with Halo, it made a name for itself with the Marathon series. The original Marathon games stopped running on the Mac long ago, but the entire Marathon series was recently revived with the help of an open-source programming team called Aleph One. The first Marathon game is now available on Steam as a free download – now called Classic Marathon – and it runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs. The game is a real blast of retro fun, set aboard a space ship called The Marathon, which has been boarded by alien invaders. Your task is pretty straightforward and mostly involves running along lots of corridors blasting the living daylights out of the aliens. Along the way, you can log in to computer terminals that provide access to the ship’s onboard AI, which points you toward your next target or sends you looking for useful information. There’s a plot twist, though, as there seem to be rival AIs at work, each with their own agenda, and this keeps you thinking about what comes next, as well as just exercising your trigger finger in combat. The game’s old-school graphics obviously look a bit dated these days, but they have a lot of charm, and there’s a sense of satisfaction as you carefully attempt to pick off your enemies without wasting too much ammo – and a real sense of relief when you come across some spare ammo packs lying on the ground too. The somewhat clumsy control system isn’t quite so charming – it took me some time reading around on the Internet to discover that there’s no Save Game command, so you just have to hope you can survive all the way to the next checkpoint, where your game is saved automatically. But that’s part of the fun, as it puts extra pressure on you to stay alive, and to keep searching for hidden areas that may reward you with extra ammo or weapons. The two sequels – Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity – are also available, although you’ll need to download the open-source files from Aleph One’s own website, or wait for them to arrive on Steam for a more straightforward download and installation process. 15. Total War: Warhammer III – Best strategy game Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Perhaps the biggest game release of 2022 on the Mac, Total War: Warhammer III provided a truly epic conclusion to this popular series of strategy games. There’s no need to worry if you haven’t played any of the earlier games, though, as this three-quel includes an optional prologue, called The Lost God, that can act as an introduction for people who are new to the world of Warhammer. This prologue explains that the great Beard God, Ursun, who is worshipped by the human kingdom of Kislev has been imprisoned in the demonic Realms Of Chaos. In Ursun’s absence, a terrible winter has fallen over Kislev, so you start by playing Prince Barkov of Kislev, who leads a small band of warriors to discover the fate of Ursun. This section also acts as a tutorial for people who might be new to strategy games, and when you’re up to speed you can progress to the main campaign in which rival factions compete to reach Ursun and use his godly powers for their own ends. As well the people of Kislev, you can command another human kingdom called Grand Cathay, or turn to the dark side by playing one of the many demonic princes who all have their own monstrous armies. There’s Nurgle, the Plague Lord, whose somewhat squishy troops spread disease and decay, along with Khorne, the Blood God, the hedonistic Slaanesh, and Tzeentch, the master of Chaos Magic. And, finally, there’s the uber Daemon Price, whose powers – and even body parts – can be customized so that you can create a playing style that’s all your own. You can also buy additional DLC packs that add new factions and races to the game. There’s also a free add-on called Immortal Empires, which brings together campaign maps, factions and battles from all three Warhammer games into one vast and endlessly replayable series of battles. The good news is that the game will run on any Mac with an M1 or M2 processor – and we found that it ran at a smooth 30-40fps at 1920×1080 resolution even on a 24-inch iMac with a standard M1 processor. But while Intel Macs with AMD graphics may be able to run the game, there are a few technical glitches that can affect these Macs, so the game isn’t ‘officially supported’ on Intel Macs. Price When Reviewed: $59.99 There aren’t a lot of sports games available on the Mac, but the Football Manager series is a longtime supporter, and we get the 2024 edition at the same time as the PC and console versions too. The game is currently available via the Steam and Epic stores, but should also be coming to Apple Arcade soon as well. There’s also a new version of Football Manager 2024 Touch available for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. And, somewhat confusingly, the App Store also has a separate version, called Football Manager Mobile, which is only available to Netflix subscribers. One of the biggest changes this year is the arrival of the ‘J-League’, with 60 Japanese teams now added to the game, along with Japanese language support as well. There are also new playing modes, such as ‘Real World’ where players in your games move to new teams on the same dates as they do in real life. Each new version of the game tends to bring graphical improvements, and FM24 provides smoother animations for players as they charge around the pitch, more realistic physics for ball movement, and enhanced lighting effects to create a greater sense of atmosphere. And, of course, there are the inevitable AI features, such as the introduction of ‘Intermediaries’ that you can hire to go out and hustle for the best prices when you’re thinking of selling some players. There are also new Set Piece Coaches, who can help you to choose the best players for events such as free-kicks and corners. However, you’re up against tougher AI managers on opposition teams too, as they can now make smarter decisions when purchasing players that suit their tactical style. The game also follows recent trends in tactical play, such as the greater use of positional play, which allows players to switch positions when your team has possession. The sheer depth of all these tactical options means that Football Manager can be a bit daunting for more casual fans of the game, but there’s a demo version available on both Steam and Epic, so you can have a quick kick-about to see how you get on before buying the full game. Price When Reviewed: $39.99 It’s been quite a while since any of the Grid games were released on the Mac and, in fact, the Windows version of Grid Legends was first launched back at the start of 2022. However, the Deluxe Edition that’s just been launched on the Mac App Store does include all the game’s recent DLC add-ons – listed at more than $60/£60 on Steam for the Windows version – so it’s great value for racing fans on the Mac. You don’t have to be an ace F1 driver to play Grid Legends, though, as the game includes a variety of different modes that can appeal to casual players as well as experienced drivers who want a more demanding and realistic driving simulation. The game starts by throwing you into its Story mode, called Driven To Glory, which follows the Seneca Racing team as it tries to make its name in the new season. As well as following the action through a series of races, the Story mode is also presented as a kind of behind-the-scenes documentary, with video cut-scenes and interviews with some of the main drivers (including an appearance by the pre-Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa). Story mode is a good way for beginners to get started, but more experienced drivers can jump straight ahead into the Career mode. This provides five difficulty levels, and allows you to work your way up from rookie to a seasoned pro driver. There are 10 different racing discplines available, including Drift, Elimination and the arcade-action of Classic Car-nage, and the game lets you play on 24 different tracks in locations such as Brands Hatch, Barcelona Dubai and Miami. As you progress through the season, you can unlock 120 different vehicles, with different handling properties to suit your driving style. There’s also a Garage mode where you can upgrade and fine-tune your car to suit different terrain and weather conditions. The game also includes a Race Creator mode, where you can design your own custom race events, using different tracks, vehicles and weather conditions. It’s a shame, though, that the Mac version of the game is single-player only, and doesn’t have the multiplayer mode that’s available on the PC version. The game also requires an Apple Silicon processor, and doesn’t run on older Intel Macs. However, it ran more than fast enough for my somewhat chaotic driving skills on an M1 iMac with medium graphics and 1600×900 resolution, so you don’t need a super-fast Mac to put your pedal to the metal. 18. Lies of P – Apple’s Mac Game Of The Year Price When Reviewed: 59.99 There aren’t many ‘soulsborne’ games available on the Mac – so called because they follow the format of the popular Lost Souls and Bloodborne games available on PC and consoles – but Lies Of P arrived on the Mac App Store recently and immediately walked off with Apple’s award for Mac Game Of The Year. The game is dedicated to Carlo Collodi, the author who created Pinocchio, and your main character is referred to as ‘the puppet of Gepetto’, so it’s clear who you’re supposed to be. This isn’t the cute Disney version of Pinocchio, though – for starters the little wooden boy has grown a bionic metal arm to give him some extra muscle, and one of your first tasks is to pick up a sword and choose a ‘path’ that determines your fighting style. The Path Of The Sweeper tends to focus on heavy, two-handed weapons, while the Path Of The Bastard lets you fight with lighter, faster weapons. Or, as a safe bet, you can choose the Path Of The Cricket, which combines elements of the other two fighting styles. Your puppet boy wakes in the city of Krat, a kind of steam-punk dystopia that has been over-run by rampaging puppets who have turned against their human masters. Guided by a cricket called Gemini (because Disney owns the name ‘Jiminy Cricket’) you fight your way across the city to locate Gepetto and end the puppet revolt. Like all soulsborne games, Lies Of P is very challenging, with a wide range of combat moves and skills that you have to master as you fight your way across the city. And, as the name suggests, the game also allows you to choose between telling lies or the truth as you encounter other characters in the game. The developers recommend using a game controller, rather than mouse and keyboard, and the game only runs on Apple Silicon, with no support for older Intel Macs. An M2 is recommended, but we still found the game playable on an iMac with a basic M1 processor, when running on medium graphics settings at 1920×1080, so most recent Mac models should be able to handle the game without too much trouble. The best games you can play on a Mac The best of the rest, in alphabetical order… Alien: Isolation – The Collection: Best Action Game Company: Feral Interactive Where to buy: Steam ($49.99/£34.99), Mac App Store ($39.99/£38.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 1GB graphics card Most of the games based on the Alien films have been pretty awful – in fact, Alien: Colonial Marines even prompted a lawsuit back in 2013 from disgruntled customers who felt they’d been misled by the advertising for the game. Fortunately, as our friends over at GameAgent recently remarked, Alien: Isolation is one of the “good Alien games”. Originally released for the PC in 2015, Alien: Isolation has arrived on the Mac and does a great job of capturing the tension and atmosphere of that very first Alien film. The game is set 15 years after Alien, following the discovery of the black-box flight-recorder from Ellen Ripley’s ship, The Nostromo. Ripley, of course, is still missing, so her daughter Amanda heads off to recover the black-box from the space station that found it. No prizes for guessing what Amanda and her team discover when they arrive at the space station: a toothy xenomorph on the loose, and gradually working its way through the terrified crew. Your task as Amanda is not to go in with all guns blazing, but simply to avoid the alien and stay alive – hiding inside a locker, or creating a distraction that will draw the alien away for a few crucial seconds. The game creates a real sense of tension, and the computer-controlled alien is smart enough to provide a really formidable foe. This ‘collection’ also includes a number of bonus missions, including Crew Expendable, which re-enacts events from the original Alien film. However, the game’s system requirements are pretty high, so you should check that your Mac is up to it before buying the game. Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition: Best RPG Company: Beamdog Where to buy: Steam ($4.99/£3.74), Mac App Store ($19.99/£19.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.7, dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 2.5GB hard disk The original Baldur’s Gate II was released way back in 1988 by the roleplaying gods at Bioware, and its 2D graphics will look pretty dated to anyone that has played modern roleplaying games such as Bioware’s Dragon Age series. Even so, it’s an essential purchase for anyone that has even the slightest interest in roleplaying games, and the sheer size of the game means that it’s excellent value for money. It’s a shame that this updated Enhanced Edition couldn’t be brought right up to date with more modern 3D graphics, but it does get a cosmetic makeover with high-def versions of the original artwork, so it doesn’t look too bad on modern computer screens. Besides, whether in 2D or 3D, Bioware’s great strength has always been its story-telling skill, and Baldur’s Gate II is as captivating now as it was nearly 30 years ago. It’s very much traditional fantasy fare – with you taking on the role of a warrior, wizard, rogue or cleric – but it’s done on a truly grand scale. Your character is just one of many mortal offspring spawned by the evil god Bhaal, and the game pits you against several of your own brothers and sisters as they vie to succeed Bhaal and claim his power as their own. There are hundreds and hundreds of quests along the way – around 300 hours worth if you try to complete them all – including power struggles within the guild of Shadow Thieves, and an epic battle with the wizard Irenicus, played in full scenery-chewing mode by Brit character actor David Warner. Throw in the return of bonkers barbarian Minsc and his giant space-hamster Boo, and BGII is a real retro treat for RPG fans. Braid: Best Platform Game Company: Hothead Games Where to buy: Mac App Store ($10.99/£10.99), Steam ($14.99/£10.99)System requirements: OS X 10.6.6 or later The first time you play Braid, you might be forgiven for thinking you’ve just bought a late 90s puzzle platformer. You jump and run like Mario, kill monsters by jumping on their heads and collect puzzle pieces. And then you’re introduced to Braid’s killer feature: you can turn back time. As you progress, you realise that this is a crucial part of the game’s mechanics. There are sections you can’t complete without winding back the action. Add in some fiendishly designed levels, a lot of old-school gaming and a genuinely great soundtrack, and you realise why Braid won all those awards. Civilization V: Brave New World – Best Strategy Game Company: AspyrWhere to buy: Steam ($29.99/£19.99), Green Man Gaming ($29.99/£19.99), Mac App Store ($29.99/£28.99)System requirements: OS X 10.6.8 or later The Civilization strategy games’ basic formula remains the same: you start with a bunch of cavemen and progress through history to create a civilisation that will rule the world. But the Civ series has long since passed the point where all you had to do was build up a big army. Civilization V beefed up the diplomacy elements and the Gods and Kings expansion pack added religion to the mix. Brave New World adds even more depth. There are nine new civilisations, including Portugal, Morocco, Brazil and the Zulus, but the real substance in Brave New World lies in the new cultural and ideological systems. The ‘Culture Victory’, for instance, is a new way of conquering the world, whereby nations can place musicians, writers and artists in key buildings, such as the Globe Theatre in London. There’s combat aplenty if that’s how you like your strategy games, but the political, religious and cultural elements that it adds to the mix create a game in which you really can develop an entire civilisation, rather than just building up a big army. Read our full Civilization V: Brave New World review. Disco Elysium: Best Detective RPG Company: ZAUMWhere to buy: Steam ($39.99/£34.99), GOG ($43.59/£34.99), Mac App Store ($39.99/£38.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.13.4 or later, Metal-Compatible graphics card It’s tough being a Mac gamer sometimes, watching great new games always arriving first on PC – and often never being released on the Mac at all. Last year’s launch of Disco Elysium was particularly galling for RPG fans, as we watched the PC version of the game mop up awards all over the place. However, the Mac version of Disco Elysium has suddenly appeared, with no advance publicity, and is widely available on all the main online game stores. As mentioned, Disco Elysium is a roleplaying game, but instead of medieval fantasy or futuristic sci-fi, the game casts you in the role of a drunken detective in a sort-of-contemporary setting, in the town of Revachol. You wake one morning in a sleazy hotel, with a mega-hangover, barely knowing who you are. After locating your trousers, you explore the hotel and encounter your partner, who reminds you that you are a detective investigating a murder case. You then set off to explore the local neighbourhood, interrogating suspects and looking for clues as you try to crack the case. Despite the contemporary setting many traditional roleplaying features are still in evidence – you can choose an ‘archetype’ for your character, such as the ‘Thinker’ who relies on deductive skills, or take the ‘Physical’ approach and try to intimidate suspects for information. There’s also an extensive set of additional skills, such as empathy or logic, that you can use to help you in your investigation. You don’t need to get too bogged down in stats and details, though, and you’ll soon be able to head off and explore the neighbourhood, which is wonderfully depicted, with grimy graphics and atmospheric music. Disco Elysium is the sort of absorbing, immersive game that can absorb you for hours on end. However, the system requirements for the 3D graphics are quite steep, so check to make sure your Mac can handle it first. Some of the language is a bit ripe too, so this definitely isn’t a game for younger children. Divinity: Original Sin 2: Best Multiplayer RPG Company: Larian StudiosWhere to buy: Steam ($26.99/£17.99), Mac App Store ($44.99/£43.99)System requirements: macOS 10.13.6 or later, MacBook Pro 2016 or later, MacBook Air 2017 or later, iMac with AMD graphics 2013 or later, Mac Mini 2018 At the end of 2018, the developers at Larian Studios announced that they were working with Apple – in itself a bit of a shock as Apple generally shows bugger-all interest in games on the Mac – to develop a Mac version of Original Sin 2 (one of the greatest RPGs of all time) using Apple’s Metal graphics system. There’s nothing half-hearted about the Mac version, either – as well as using Metal for the impressive 3D graphics, the game supports HDR (high dynamic range) on the latest Macs, as well as Mac-specific features such as Apple trackpads and the TouchBar on new MacBook Pro models. And the game’s multiplayer mode even works across both Macs and PCs, so you can play online with your friends (as long as you’ve all got the latest patches and updates). The only drawback here is that the Metal graphics require a fairly powerful Mac, so make sure to check the game’s system requirements before buying. Don’t worry if you’ve haven’t played the original game, as this sequel remains in the fantasy world of Rivellon, but steps forward in time and allows you to embark on an entirely new adventure. You start the game in a bit of trouble, as you’ve been captured and sentenced to jail for using a dangerous magical force called ‘Source’. Using Source gives you – and other ‘Sourcerors’ – great power, but it also creates a gateway to another dimension called The Void, allowing evil creatures to invade Rivellon. And, yep – you guessed it – your job is to save the world from the invading demons. The game begins with a helpful tutorial to get new players started, and newcomers can also opt for a ready-made ‘origin’ character that has already been set up for you. More experienced players can delve into character creation, with a wide variety of races on offer – with standard options such as humans, dwarves and elves complemented by more exotic lizards and undead – and the game also offers several difficulty levels and modes to cater for different playing styles and levels of experience. It might all sound like fairly routine fantasy fare, but Original Sin 2 is tremendously well-made and involving. There are few simple good-versus-evil choices, and sometimes you’ll find yourself wracked with guilt because you simply can’t find a nice, clean solution to a particular problem or a tricky side-quest. The solo game by itself will keep even hardened roleplaying fans absorbed through the dark winter months, and the various online and multiplayer modes will ensure that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that you’ll come back to time and time again. Company: ZenimaxWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($59.99/£42.49), Steam ($59.99/£49.99). This is for the base game plus the expansion set; both sites also sell the base game, or just the upgrade, for a lower priceSystem requirements: macOS 10.13, Mac with quad-core CPU, discrete GPU with 1GB VRAM The Elder Scrolls Online is one of the few A-list MMORPG titles that supports the Mac, and ever since its launch back in 2014 the developers at Zenimax have kept their loyal players coming back by updating the game with a regular series of new ‘chapters’. These are essentially expansion packs that add more content, and occasionally new features too. But every year or so, Zenimax releases an update that makes major changes to the game in order to keep it feeling fresh and exciting – and 2021’s Blackwood expansion is one of the biggest updates for quite some time. The changes begin as soon as you enter the game. Even if you haven’t bought the Blackwood expansion there’s a new introductory tutorial that sends you to the island of Balfiera, where you can learn the ropes by helping the local townsfolk to fend off an invading army of monsters. Once you’ve completed the tutorial you’re given the option of entering a portal that can send you anywhere in the vast world of ESO. If you decide to head off to Blackwood, you’ll discover a vast new zone, full of quests and challenging dungeons. Blackwood also introduces a new companion system, which allows solo players to recruit a computer-controlled companion who can fight alongside you. This will be great for players – like me – who tend to play solo most of the time, with the new companion helping you to complete quests and tasks that might previously have been a bit too tough for one player on their own. Blackwood also introduces a new Gates of Oblivion storyline that will continue developing throughout this year, with a major quest that pits you against the demonic Prince Of Destruction, as he schemes to invade the mortal realm. The good news is that you don’t have to pay the full price for Blackwood right away, as the original base game now costs just £14.99/$19.99 – and no longer requires a monthly subscription to play. That contains enough action and adventure to keep you happy for months, before you decide if you want to visit Blackwood as well. Final Fantasy XIV Online: Best MMORPG Company: Square Enix Where to buy: Square Enix US store (from $19.99, plus $14.99 per month) or Square Enix EU store (from £9.99 + £7.69 monthly subscription); free trial also availableSystem requirements: Mac with OS X v10.14 or later, 2.4GHz Intel Core i5 processor As we’ve mentioned in the past, Final Fantasy XIV has had a bit of a chequered history – with the original Mac version in 2015 being so bad that the developers actually offered refunds. However, a series of updates over the past few years have seen FFXIV emerge as one of the top games in the MMORPG genre – despite the fact that, until recently, it was one of the few MMORPGs that still required a subscription to play. The latest update, which is now called Final Fantasy XIV Online, gives the game another major revamp, reworking the central quest system in order to give players a smoother introduction to the game’s vast online world. It also incorporates the Heavensward expansion pack that was previously sold separately, giving you even more quests and adventures to explore. Most important, though, is the new free trial system, which allows new players to sign up for a free account that provides access to vast areas of the game without paying for a subscription (although, to be honest, the registration process is a bit of a chore). Players with a trial account can take their characters all the way to level 60 – the maximum level with a subscription is 80 – and explore the main game and all the extra zones and quests in Heavensward for free. If you want to advance beyond L60 and explore new character classes and other new features then you will still need to buy a copy of the game and pay for a continuing subscription. However, you can start for as little as £9.99/$19.99 for the Online Starter Edition, and then decide if you want to continue your subscription, and buy the latest Shadowbringer expansion pack as well. Hearthstone: Best card game Company: BlizzardWhere to buy: playhearthstone.com (free to play, with in-game purchases)System requirements: macOS 10.10, Intel Core Duo, Nvidia GeForce 8600M or AMD Radeon HD 2600 Pro Hearthstone has been around for a few years now, and Blizzard’s typically slick presentation quickly established it as one of the leading computer card games. Like most card games, the basic version of Hearthstone is free to play, but offers a wide range of card packs that you can either buy with real money – starting from £2.99/€2.99 for two packs of five cards – or earn by collecting gold and treasure within the game itself. Picking up a trick from the long-running success of World Of Warcraft, Blizzard also releases special ‘expansion packs’ for Hearthstone every now and then, which bring new features to the game, as well as new cards and other goodies. But Hearthstone is still a fun game to play, even if you don’t want to spend a lot of money buying all the latest expansions. It’s a good option for newcomers to card games, with a simple tutorial that guides you through the main features of the game, and the basic/free version of Hearthstone still includes several different game modes that you can play in order to win new cards without spending any money at all. The game runs on most types of computer and mobile devices too, so you can switch between Mac, iOS and other devices using the same game account. Lego Star Wars Saga: Best Lego Game Company: Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Steam ($19.99/£15.49), Mac App Store ($19.99/£19.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5.8; 1.5GHz Intel processor; graphics card with 128MB VRAM No home should be without at least one Lego game, and if you pick up the Saga version you get the six games based on the Star Wars films for an affordable price. The sheer fun of playing with the Lego versions of Luke, Han, Yoda and Darth Vader will appeal to both adults and children. The six games in this pack offer a variety of different scenarios, including space battles, lightsaber duels, and the famous battle on the ice planet of Hoth. If you’re a Star Wars fan, Feral has also released a new Lego game based on the Clone Wars cartoon series, and there are other Lego games based on the Batman, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones films as well. Life Is Strange: Best Adventure Game Company: Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($3.20/£2.56), Steam ($19.99/£15.99, first episode free), Mac App Store ($17.99/£17.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.11 or later, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel processor, 8GB RAM, 512MB VRAM At first glance, Life Is Strange looks like a fairly conventional adventure game. You play a teenage girl called Max Caulfield who is having a bit of a bad day at school. Max ducks out of class and heads to the bathroom for a time-out, and as you wander the school corridors you can click on objects or people around you to gather information that guides you through the game. That’s routine adventure stuff, but life starts to get strange when Max witnesses the murder of her friend Chloe – and discovers that she has the ability to turn back time. Saving Chloe reveals a deeper mystery concerning a missing student called Rachel, so Max and Chloe set off to find Rachel and uncover the dark secrets of the sleepy town of Arcadia. That’s straightforward enough, but Chloe’s time-travelling abilities add a whole new dimension to the standard point-and-click adventure format. Sometimes a conversation with another character will reveal some useful information, allowing Chloe to go back and replay recent events so they have a different outcome. However, changing past events can have unexpected consequences, leading to some difficult – and dangerous – decisions. The story unfolds in five separate episodes, but you can check it out for free by downloading the first episode through Steam and then deciding if you want to explore the mystery further. We enjoyed its haunting, Buffy-esque depiction of the dark side of teenage life, and our only complaint is that the keyboard-and-mouse controls felt a bit clumsy so you’ll progress more smoothly if you have a proper game controller to help you out. Papers, Please: Best Puzzle Game Company: 3909 LLCWhere to buy: Steam ($9.99/£6.99), GOG ($9.99/£7.89)System requirements: 1.5GHz Core2Duo; OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) or later; 2 GB RAM; 100MB hard disk space Almost unclassifiable in normal gaming terms – we’ve put it with the puzzlers, although it’s really a bizarre take on the classic worker simulation – Papers, Please sees you taking up the post of border control in an authoritarian regime. Which is certainly a novel idea for a game. People enter your booth and present their papers; it’s your job to figure out if they can be allowed in. If you spot an irregularity in their paperwork, deny them entry. If their sob story touches your heartstrings, let them in. But if you let through too many dodgy types, or work too slowly, the money you earn will take a dip, and your family need to eat. Papers, Please is a quirky, interesting game set in a truly novel (and utterly bleak) environment. And while the level of profundity is debatable, there’s definitely more going on here than in your average worker sim. Read the full Papers, Please for Mac review The Sims 4: Best Sims Game Company: Maxis Where to buy: Origin ($4.79/£12.94), Best Buy ($39.99)System requirements: Mac OS X Lion; Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz; nVidia GeForce 320M; 4GB RAM; 10GB available HD space There’s a lot to take in with the latest addition to The Sims line-up: deeper customisation, more variety with actions, new careers and new places to explore. The Sims 4 had a lot to live up to after the success of The Sims 3, but it fills its predecessor’s shoes beautifully. You get a deeper level of character customisation than in previous generations. While you can still browse and select preset eyes, mouth, hair, etc, The Sims 4 allows you to fine-tune your character’s looks and build by clicking and dragging the area you want to tweak. Does your Sim’s belly protrude a little too much for your liking? Clicking on the troubled area and dragging it in will make your Sim thinner – it’s as easy as that. The build \u0026 design mode in The Sims was the basis for the game as a whole – it started off as a simulator that architects could use. And it’s fantastic here. It’s a great experience being able to design a home exactly how you want it to be and really gets your creative juices flowing. With more design options (like the ability to build “in the air” with no support below), houses in The Sims 4 looks more breathtaking than ever. You can pick up and move whole rooms whenever you fancy a change, and buy whole rooms of same-style furniture. For those of us without an eye for interior design, it allows us to really appreciate the game and the design process. Day-to-day life in The Sims 4 is more enjoyable, too. If your Sim is hungry, simply click on the hunger bar and the Sim will automatically feed themselves – the same applies to all their other needs too. It takes the effort out of the more mundane tasks and allows you more time to do the fun things with your Sim. The Sims 4 is a great game with so many options that you’ll lose yourself for hours at a time. Lewis Painter Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: Best RPG Company: AspyrWhere to buy: Green Man Gaming ($2.80/£2.01), Steam ($3.49/£2.51), Mac App Store ($9.99/£9.99)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.9.5, 2.2GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 256MB graphics card It’s more than a decade since the original Knights Of The Old Republic was first released, but that game is still selling well on the App Store even after all these years. So it came as a bit of a surprise when we realised that this sequel – originally released for PC back in 2005 – has only just arrived on the Mac for the first time. Like its predecessor, KOTOR II is set thousands of years in the past, long before the events of the Star Wars film series. You play one of the last surviving Jedi, who have been almost completely wiped out after a long war with the evil Sith Lords. At the start of the game you wake up injured and with no memory of recent events. Even your trusty light-sabre has gone missing, so your initial challenge is to recover your memory and your Jedi powers, and then set off to try and find any other Jedi that may have survived. There’s a wide range of skills and abilities that you can develop as you progress through the game, and you can focus on either light-sabre combat or spooky Force Powers depending on how you want to develop your character. There’s also a strong story and roleplaying element, full of political twists and turns, and moral decisions that will affect the final outcome of the game. The 3D graphics look a little dated now, but the intriguing storyline and light-sabre action will soon have you hooked, and at just £9.99 the game’s a real bargain for Star Wars fans. Total War: Warhammer II: Best Strategy Game Company: Creative Assembly/ Feral InteractiveWhere to buy: Steam ($59.99/£39.99)System requirements: macOS 10.14, 2GHz Intel Core i5, Radeon R9 M290 or Intel Iris 540 with 2GB video memory Total War: Warhammer was a match made in Orc-heaven, as it combined the fantasy warfare of the Warhammer series with the large-scale battles of the Total War strategy games. So it’s no surprise that this follow-up offers more of the same, albeit with enough variety to make it worth coughing up the rather hefty £39.99/$59.99 on Steam. But you should check the game’s system requirements first, as the battling armies of elves, lizardmen and rodent-like Skaven need a pretty powerful Mac to handle their demanding 3D graphics. The story for the main single-player campaign is, to be honest, fairly trite fantasy fodder, with the game’s four rival factions competing to control a great, swirling vortex of magical energy floating up in the sky. That’s little more than an excuse to get the rival armies and heroes charging across the game’s vast landscapes, but the main campaign is well constructed and gives you plenty of different options for getting stuck into endless hours of fantasy fisticuffs. You can control any of the four rival races, and each race lets you choose between two Legendary Lords, who all have different storylines and starting locations, as well as their own special abilities that can be used to assist their troops in battle (and, if you’re new to the Total War games, one Lord for each race also gives you a handy tutorial to get started). That gives you eight different options for playing and re-playing the game, and if you also own the original Total War: Warhammer then you get a free bonus campaign thrown in as well. The game also includes a number of Battle modes that you can dip into for a quick fix every now and then, as well as a multiplayer mode. Wildermyth: Best RPG Company: Worldwalker GamesWhere to buy: Steam ($24.99/£19.49)System requirements: Mac with OS X v10.13, 64-bit processor Wildermyth is an unusual and impressive roleplaying game with flexible character development that encourages you to go back and play through it again. It’s an immediately eye-catching game with ‘papercraft’ graphics that look like a child’s popup book, as your 2D characters use a turn-based combat system to move through hand-painted 3D environments. You start by creating a party with three characters: a warrior, a hunter (rogue) and mystic. These characters are created by the game, with their own personalities and backgrounds, although you can fine-tune each character by modifying their appearance, skills and other abilities. And, like all good roleplaying games, it allows you to make choices that affect the story and the relationships between the various characters. At various points you’ll be presented with options – drawn like panels from a comic book rather than dull lumps of text – that establish whether your characters are friends, rivals, or even in a romance, and this affects the way that the story develops and how the lives of your characters unfold. The tutorial could be a little clearer – I had to look up some videos on YouTube to help me get started – but the turn-based combat isn’t too difficult to master, and you can develop your party’s abilities to combine stealth, magic and weapon skills in any way that you like. And, at the end of each game, you can save favourite ‘legacy’ characters in order to bring them back the next time you play. This is where Wildermyth really stands out, as its story is ‘procedurally generated’ – it’s not entirely random, but is flexible within a framework that is controlled by the game itself. There’s enough variety within that framework to enjoy playing through again, and gives you the luxury of being reunited with your favourite characters to see how their stories and relationships continue to develop throughout their lives. World Of Warcraft: Best MMORPG Company: BlizzardWhere to buy: WoW (free for Starter Edition, plus $12.99/£8.99 monthly subscription)System requirements: Mac OS X 10.5.8; Intel Core 2 Duo; graphics card with 256MB VRAM Its cutesy graphics aren’t to everyone’s taste, but World of Warcraft is still the game that rules the massively multiplayer online scene, with around seven million subscribers playing as wizards, priests, warriors and rogues. Part of that success is down to the release of regular expansion packs, such as 2010’s Cataclysm, which – quite literally – shook up the landscape, destroying some old areas and introducing new zones for you to explore. The fairly regular release of new material keeps experienced players happy, but to attract new players, Blizzard announced a Starter Edition of the game that allows you to play for free until your character reaches level 20. Company: Feral Interactive Where to buy: Steam ($14.99/£8.74), Mac App Store ($49.99/£48.99)System requirements: Mac with OS X 10.11.2, 2.4GHz dual-core processor, discrete graphics card with 1GB VRAM The good news is that XCOM 2 arrived on the Mac at the same time as the PC version. The bad news is that the aliens won at the end of XCOM: Enemy Unknown back in 2013. So now we jump forward 20 years and the Earth is ruled by Advent – a coalition of alien overlords and their human collaborators (boo, hiss) – so it’s up to you to lead the human resistance movement and recruit a new XCOM team to wage a guerrilla war against the alien oppressors. Like its predecessor, XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game that provides an overhead isometric view of the battlefield so that you can plan your team’s moves as they approach their target. But the moment you pull the trigger the action switches to a close-up view – similar to a first person shooter – that gives it a more visceral feel than most conventional strategy games. There are five soldier classes available to help you out, including Sharpshooters with their long-range sniper skills, and Grenadiers who just charge in and blow up everything in sight. There’s also the Psi Operative, who adds a fantasy/sci-fi element with telepathic abilities such as Soulfire and mind-control. Each class also gets its own selection of different skills, giving you plenty of freedom to develop your team in a way that suits your combat style. There are other resources available too. Your base is a captured alien ship called the Avenger, and between missions you need to give careful thought to developing the engineering, research and armoury facilities on the ship in order to provide new weapons and technology for your team. It’s gripping stuff, and guaranteed to keep strategy fans glued to the screen for hours on end. Further reading That’s it! We’re done.

He receives an email from Mia asking for his help and gives him an address in a swampy backwater town in Louisiana. The game switches to an isolated first-person view, making every shadowy corridor seem even more oppressive and creepy. The game also makes clever use of the found-footage genre of horror movies, with Ethan finding old VHS tapes around the house that help fill in some of the background. There’s also a time-travel effect, where you can take actions during video segments in the past that impact on the present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCapcom recommends a \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232002/the-best-console-controllers-for-playing-games-on-a-mac.html\"\u003egame controller\u003c/a\u003e, but it’s possible to play with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668394/the-best-keyboards-for-mac.html\"\u003ekeyboard\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668496/best-mouse-for-macbook-and-mac.html\"\u003emouse\u003c/a\u003e if you prefer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2411905/resident-evil-7-biohazard-for-macos-review.html\" score=\"4.5\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tResident Evil 7: Biohazard (Mac) review \t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"2.

You betcha!). It hasn’t exactly catapulted the Mac games scene into the stratosphere, but there are a few high-profile games now starting to arrive on the Mac, and 2024 gets off to a good start with the arrival of Death Stranding, the idiosyncratic and sometimes downright bizarre game from Hideo Kojima, the renowned developer behind the long-running Metal Gear series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is set in a near-future version of the United States, in the aftermath of a mysterious apocalyptic event known as the Death Stranding, which has caused the collapse of society. All that’s left are a few scattered communities, which rely on ‘porters’ to deliver supplies and help set up a communications system called the Chiral network. That’s where you come in, playing Sam ‘Porter’ Bridges – who is voiced by, and modeled on the actor Norman Reedus of Walking Dead fame – as he trudges across the country delivering his supplies. Along the way, you’ll encounter terrorists and creepy invisible monsters called BTs (‘beached things’), but your real foe for much of the game is simply the environment around you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is some combat in Death Stranding, but your main task as a porter is to struggle across the rocky, ruinous countryside as you embark on a series of missions to deliver your cargo of medicines and other supplies. The game is sometimes described as a ‘walking simulator ’ as you spend much of your time clambering over rocks, up hills, or wading across rushing rivers and streams. That may not sound terribly exciting, but there’s a lot of satisfaction as you struggle to slowly inch your way towards the peak of a craggy hill with your cargo intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game also has a dramatic cinematic flair – possibly a little too cinematic, as the first 45 minutes or so is really just a series of very long cut-scenes, interspersed only by a few brief sequences where you learn how to control Sam as he walks, jumps and wades across the rocky terrain. The long cut-scenes can try your patience in the early stages of the game, but they do look terrific – the landscapes have a cinematic scope, and the 3D graphics are tremendously detailed and realistic. And the feeling that this is the gaming equivalent of a blockbuster Hollywood production is further emphasized by cameos from a number of other Hollywood big names, including Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo Del Toro, and Lindsay Wagner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe graphics do require a bit of horsepower though. The game will only run on Macs and iPads that have an Apple Silicon processor (M1 or later), and running macOS 13.3 or iPadOS 17.0. We were pleased to find that the game ran well even on an iMac with an M1 processor, although we did have to lower the resolution to 1920×1080. You might need an M2 or M3 to really enjoy the game’s sweeping vistas and eerie special effects, but seeing a game like Death Stranding running on an M1 iMac gives us some hope for the future of games on the Mac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"3.

Last year’s Resident Evil: Village was the eighth game in the long-running series, although it was the first ever to arrive on the Mac, and also one of the first games written specifically to run on Macs with Apple Silicon. However, Resident Evil 4 is actually a newer game (sort of) as it’s a remake of the original Resident Evil 4, which was first released back in 2005.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a newer game means that it’s considerably more expensive, though, weighing in at a rather hefty $59.99/£57.99. However, it works hard to earn its keep with “juiced-up visuals and a reimagined story” as well as improved controls for combat and other character actions. And, thankfully, you can actually download the game for free and play through the opening section, before deciding if you want to go ahead and buy the full version of the game as an in-app purchase (along with some rather pricey DLC packs too).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis installment follows the adventures of special agent Leon S. Kennedy – a floppy-haired special agent from an earlier game in the series – who has now been recruited to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the US President. Tracking her down to a village in Spain, Leon encounters a spooky cult called Los Iluminados, who have turned the villagers into crazed killers. You have to fight your way past the villagers and confront various bosses as you track down the President’s daughter and attempt to uncover the cult’s true plans. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResident Evil 4 has some good jump scares along the way, but it’s more action-oriented than Village and doesn’t have quite the same creepy and tense atmospherics. It certainly keeps you busy, though, as you shoot and slice your way through the villagers, and encounter the mysterious figures who control the cult. And, of course, it’s pretty gorey too, with a 17+ age rating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike Resident Evil: Village, this game runs on Macs with Apple Silicon, and it ran pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with a basic M1 processor. It felt a little sluggish initially, but seemed to run quite smoothly once we turned the resolution down to 1,920 x 1,080, and experimented with some of the graphics settings (the game will also run on iPads with Apple Silicon, and even on the iPhone 15 Pro as well).\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"4.

It tis a survival game based in an alternate 19th century world that has been plunged into a new ice age by a vast, global blizzard called the Great Frost. Frost Punk 2 is set 30 years after the original and you are tasked with finding new sources of food and fuel for the growing population and dealing with threats like hunger, crime and factional rivalries. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new game has a prologue that introduces the story for new players, and also acts as a tutorial, in which you struggle through the icy ‘frostlands’ to reach a wrecked train and scavenge its resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game also looks great, with dramatic and imposing 3D graphics that look like Blade Runner with added snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrost Punk 2 is quite a challenging game, even for people who have played strategy games before. Basic tasks such as gathering resources can prove to be quite complex. Frost Punk 2 is a little more abstract than its predecessor, as you now need to step back and take more of an overview of the structure of this society. There are several difficulty levels, where you can adjust economic conditions, such as the scarcity of food and fuel. You can also modify the weather. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe scale of New London and its complex society provides a rich tapestry for the story that unfolds under your stewardship.

This time it’s ancient Egypt for Total War: Pharaoh, set in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, and covering the lands of Egypt itself, as well as neighboring Canaan and the Hittite Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are eight factions spread across these three lands, all competing to take the throne of Egypt and become the next Pharoah (with additional factions available to purchase as DLC on \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937780/Total_War_PHARAOH/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e). Each faction has its own leader, with their own individual strengths and abilities, such as the reckless young warrior Ramesses (who has a tendency to “put the chariot before the horses”), and the cunning Tausret, who uses diplomacy and finance to pull the levers of power. If you’re new to the game then there are several tutorials available that introduce the basics of battle, as well as more advanced tactics, such as siege warfare, and learning how to use the land and weather to your advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePharoah might not have the otherworldly spectacle of the Warhammer games, but it still looks great, with spectacular vistas as the rival armies charge across the desert dunes.

However, the forthcoming Baldur’s Gate 3 brings the series well and truly up to date with slick 3D graphics and a vast adventure that looks set to match the epic scale of its predecessors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s actually been available in ‘early access’ on Steam since 2020, but the game finally has a firm release date for August 2023 so you can now dive in and test drive the early chapters of the game to prepare yourself for the arrival of the full game in just a few months time. It’s not a true sequel as the story and the main characters are all new – set more than 100 years after BG2 – although it is still set in the famous Baldur’s Gate region from the popular Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons table-top games (and – spoiler alert – some familiar faces do make a welcome reappearance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than the powerful, god-like being that you became in Baldur’s Gate II, the new game lets you start from scratch with an entirely new character, chosen from the traditional D\u0026amp;D selection of races and classes – humans, elves, dwarves, wizards, warriors and rogues – and you then awake to find yourself prisoner on a flying ship controlled by Mindflayers (a familiar villain from D\u0026amp;D lore). The ship is attacked by dragons, but you’re able to escape – only to find that a Mindflayer larva has been implanted inside your brain. So, along with other survivors from the crashed ship, you set out to try to find a cure and then quickly find yourself embroiled in a mysterious war between the Mindflayers and an assortment of enemy races – who won’t be fully revealed until the game’s launch in the summer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 3D graphics really bring the game to life as you and your companions wade into combat, but the spectacular visuals do need a fairly fast Mac in order to run properly. The developers says that the game will run on an Intel Mac with a quad-core CPU and an AMD graphics card, or on most Macs with M1 or M2 processors. However, we had to drop the resolution to just 1600×900 on our M1 iMac in order to get a playable 25fps, so an M1 Pro or higher might be better. Fortunately, the game’s turn-based combat doesn’t require lightning reflexes and high-speed action, so you can still get by with an M1 Mac if you need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision to opt for turn-based combat might worry old-timers – like yours truly – who remember the terrific real-time-with-pause system of the original games. But turn-based is the trend these days, and if my time in the early access game is anything to go by then you’ll find that the old Baldur’s Gate magic will soon tempt you in as you “gather your party before venturing forth” – just like the good old days!\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"8.

The PC game has been available in early access since 2021 – which means that you’re essentially paying to play a beta version of the game – but it’s received a series of updates over the last couple of years that add more and more features, and the game has now sold more than 10 million copies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eValheim follows the standard format for the survival. genre. Rather than providing a central story or quest, it simply drops you into the world of Valheim, which is based on Norse mythology, and then just leaves you to get on with things and decide how you want to play. The world includes several different biomes–regions with different terrain and climate–including leafy forests, snowy mountains or the barren Ashlands that were added in a recent update. You’ll start in a fairly welcoming leafy glade, where you can gather food and materials for crafting and building yourself a home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany people seem quite happy to spend a lot of their time working on their homestead, hunting and crafting to make themselves comfortable in their new home (a bit like the Sims, except with Vikings and monsters). But, as you develop your crafting and building skills, you’ll need to wander a bit further afield and explore other biomes in order to find new materials and resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you visit each biome you’ll encounter a variety of beasts and monsters, which will force you to craft more powerful weapons and hone your Viking fighting skills. Each biome also has its own boss monster that you have to defeat as well, with the ultimate goal–when the game eventually emerges from early access–of reaching Viking heaven in Valhalla. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s quite a challenging game, and the intentionally retro 3D graphics may not appeal to everyone, but many people are happy to spend months at a time just exploring, hunting and building their home in Valheim. If things get a bit tough then there’s a co-op mode available so that you can recruit up to nine friends to help you out, and the old-school graphics mean that the game runs well even on older Intel-based Macs (although Macs with Apple Silicon will need to be running macOS 14.0 or later). It’s available on both Steam and the Mac App Store – but just remember that this is an early access game, so you may experience a few bugs along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Elder Scrolls Online (Gold Road Update) - Best non-subscription MMO \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Elder-Scrolls-Update.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $19.99 for base game; Gold Road Collection: $49.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cp\u003eElder Scrolls Online is one of the few MMO games that is available on the Mac, and it celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2024 with the launch of a major update called Gold Road. The game has seen a lot of changes along the way – both to the game itself, and also to the Mac platform, following the transition to Apple Silicon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news is that developer Zenimax now states that Apple Silicon “is not officially supported”. In fact, the game does run on Macs with Apple Silicon – thanks to Rosetta – although some users have reported poor performance even on high-end Mac models. However, I was able to get a perfectly playable 40fps when running the game at 2,560 x 1,440 resolution with high graphics settings on my MacBook Pro with M2 Pro, and 55fps on medium graphics. There’s no free trial available for Elder Scrolls Online, but the game does run free play events every few months that allow you to play free of charge for a couple of weeks, so keep an eye out for these events if you’d like to check the game out before buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the good things about Elder Scrolls Online is that – unlike MMO rivals such as World Of Warcraft – it doesn’t require a subscription to play.

There are epic quests, a wide range of skills and abilities to master and, of course, there are the inevitable dungeons and quite a few dragons that you can face on your adventures as well. As always, the Gold Road expansion adds a new region for you to explore, and a major new storyline called The Return Of Ithelia. It also introduces a major new magic system to the game, called Scribing, which provides new skills and spells that can be customized so that you can create a unique set of skills that really allow you to play just the way that you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"10.

The game still runs on Macs, but the transition to Apple Silicon has meant that it relies on Rosetta to run on modern Macs, and umpteen new versions of the macOS have introduced a few bugs that are annoying even if they don’t completely break the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, completely out of the blue, the developers at Blizzard have announced an update – to version 2.7.8 – that brings Diablo III right up to date for Mac users. As well as being compatible with the most recent versions of the macOS and ironing out those old bugs, Diablo III now runs natively on Macs with either Intel processors or Apple Silicon – and that’s quite surprising for a game that’s this old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeason 30 was the end of the road for new game content, but Blizzard did introduce a number of new features that should help to keep diehard players interested. The new Solo Self Found mode (SSF) is a completely single-player mode that forces you to rely purely on weapons and items that you find on your own. A new feature called Visions Of Enmity opens portals to a series of mini-levels that are crammed full of monsters, but which provide a chest full of loot once you reach the final level. There’s also the Altar Of Rites, where you can sacrifice some of your hard-earned loot to gain a series of bonuses and buffs that will help you tackle the game’s many challenges in solo mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe 2.7.8 update also arrived at the same time as Season 33 of Diablo III, that revisits the Shades Of The Nephilim theme and allows you to summon clone versions of your character to help you in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2474751/a-preview-of-diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-and-what-to-expect.html\"\u003eDiablo IV\u003c/a\u003e, which was launched in 2023, still isn’t available for the Mac at all, but at least this revamp of Diablo III provides plenty of dungeon-crawling fun for Mac users.

But, unlike WoW, you don’t need to pay a monthly subscription to play the game, which makes it great value for players who want to immerse themselves in hundreds of hours of quests and adventures in the game’s online world of Tamriel.

The latest chapter is High Isle, which takes you to the homeland of the game’s Breton race, and throws you into a story of political intrigue involving High Isle’s rival factions and a mysterious organization known as the Ascendent Order. Other new features include a new deck-building card game that you can play to while away a few hours, and two new computer-controlled companions for players who prefer to go questing on their own. And, of course, there are plenty of new quests to complete and dungeons waiting to be plundered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can buy the base version of the game for $19.99/£15.99 (until end of June 2024 this is \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-elder-scrolls-online\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"epicgames\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e$5.99 at Epic\u003c/a\u003e), or buy the High Isle Collection, which includes High Isle and all the previous chapters for $49.99/£42.99.

The game doesn’t disappoint either, providing a series of creepy locations for you to explore, and a variety of supernatural menaces to fight against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMac users, of course, will be new to the games, but Village starts off with a brief recap of the previous game to bring us up to date. Three years ago – in Resident Evil 7 – Ethan Winters and his wife, Mia, were trapped by the Baker family in Louisiana, who had been infected – and mutated – by a mysterious black mold. They managed to escape, assisted by para-military operative Chris Redfield, and then three years pass by before things start to get weird all over again. Ethan and Mia are now living peacefully, along with their young daughter, Rose, until Redfield suddenly reappears, gunning Mia down in cold blood and kidnapping Rose. So, playing as Ethan, you now have to pick up the trail and try to figure out what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a frustrating game to get into at first, as the early stages of the game simply involve stumbling around a dark forest, liberally scattered with dead animals. Eventually, though, you discover the Village of the title, which is under siege by wolf-like Lycans, and find clues that suggest your daughter is being held in the conveniently creepy nearby castle. The pace barely lets up after that, with the game combining atmospheric horror and manic combat in equal measure (not to mention enough gore and bad language to merit a 17 age rating).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple used the game at WWDC to demonstrate the graphical performance of its new M2 chips – but the good news is that we found the game runs pretty well even on a 24-inch iMac with the older M1 chip. The bad news is that (a) it doesn’t run on Intel Macs at all, and (b) you’re paying extra for the Mac version, which costs $39.99/£34.99 on the Mac App Store, while the Windows version – released in 2021 – is half that price on Steam. It’s still a great game, though, and hopefully it’s just the first of many A-List titles that we can look forward to on the Mac in the new couple of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"13.

It’s had a few ups and downs in recent years – both in the real-world and in the game’s virtual world of Azeroth – but the release of the Dragonflight expansion at the end of 2022 was a welcome return to form, providing some important new features and also updating some of the more dated aspects of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDragonflight costs $49.99/£39.99, and is required in order to enjoy new features such as raising your characters to the new maximum of Level 70. It also gives you access to the Dragon Isles, which contain four major new zones for you to explore and go adventuring. The Dragon Isles are also home to a new playable race of ‘draconic humanoids’ called Dracthyrs, who can play as the new Evoker class, which has the ability to choose between either healing or combat abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, on entering the Dragon Isles, you can also obtain your own ‘drake’ – a flying dragon that allows you to learn a new set of ‘dragonriding’ skills that let you fly further, faster and higher as you explore the new zones. Throw in a more streamlined skill tree and a number of improvements to WoW’s aging interface, and the entire game feels more sprightly than it has done for several years. You don’t have to buy Dragonflight straight away though, as WoW still provides a free trial that takes you up to Level 20 for free, while owners of previous versions of the game can still continue to play – without the new Dragonflight features – by paying for a monthly subscription ($12.99/£9.99 per month, with discounts for three-month or six-month subscriptions).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"14.

The original Marathon games stopped running on the Mac long ago, but the entire Marathon series was recently revived with the help of an open-source programming team called Aleph One. The first Marathon game is now available on Steam as a free download – now called Classic Marathon – and it runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game is a real blast of retro fun, set aboard a space ship called The Marathon, which has been boarded by alien invaders. Your task is pretty straightforward and mostly involves running along lots of corridors blasting the living daylights out of the aliens. Along the way, you can log in to computer terminals that provide access to the ship’s onboard AI, which points you toward your next target or sends you looking for useful information. There’s a plot twist, though, as there seem to be rival AIs at work, each with their own agenda, and this keeps you thinking about what comes next, as well as just exercising your trigger finger in combat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game’s old-school graphics obviously look a bit dated these days, but they have a lot of charm, and there’s a sense of satisfaction as you carefully attempt to pick off your enemies without wasting too much ammo – and a real sense of relief when you come across some spare ammo packs lying on the ground too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe somewhat clumsy control system isn’t quite so charming – it took me some time reading around on the Internet to discover that there’s no Save Game command, so you just have to hope you can survive all the way to the next checkpoint, where your game is saved automatically.

There’s no need to worry if you haven’t played any of the earlier games, though, as this three-quel includes an optional prologue, called The Lost God, that can act as an introduction for people who are new to the world of Warhammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis prologue explains that the great Beard God, Ursun, who is worshipped by the human kingdom of Kislev has been imprisoned in the demonic Realms Of Chaos. In Ursun’s absence, a terrible winter has fallen over Kislev, so you start by playing Prince Barkov of Kislev, who leads a small band of warriors to discover the fate of Ursun. This section also acts as a tutorial for people who might be new to strategy games, and when you’re up to speed you can progress to the main campaign in which rival factions compete to reach Ursun and use his godly powers for their own ends. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well the people of Kislev, you can command another human kingdom called Grand Cathay, or turn to the dark side by playing one of the many demonic princes who all have their own monstrous armies. There’s Nurgle, the Plague Lord, whose somewhat squishy troops spread disease and decay, along with Khorne, the Blood God, the hedonistic Slaanesh, and Tzeentch, the master of Chaos Magic. And, finally, there’s the uber Daemon Price, whose powers – and even body parts – can be customized so that you can create a playing style that’s all your own. You can also buy additional DLC packs that add new factions and races to the game. There’s also a free add-on called Immortal Empires, which brings together campaign maps, factions and battles from all three Warhammer games into one vast and endlessly replayable series of battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news is that the game will run on any Mac with an M1 or M2 processor – and we found that it ran at a smooth 30-40fps at 1920×1080 resolution even on a 24-inch iMac with a standard M1 processor. But while Intel Macs with AMD graphics may be able to run the game, there are a few technical glitches that can affect these Macs, so the game isn’t ‘officially supported’ on Intel Macs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Football Manager 2024 - Best Football Game (aka Soccer for those in the U.S.) \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Football-Manager-2024.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"1920\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$59.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cp\u003eThere aren’t a lot of sports games available on the Mac, but the Football Manager series is a longtime supporter, and we get the 2024 edition at the same time as the PC and console versions too. The game is currently available via the Steam and Epic stores, but should also be coming to Apple Arcade soon as well. There’s also a new version of Football Manager 2024 Touch available for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. And, somewhat confusingly, the App Store also has a separate version, called Football Manager Mobile, which is only available to Netflix subscribers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest changes this year is the arrival of the ‘J-League’, with 60 Japanese teams now added to the game, along with Japanese language support as well. There are also new playing modes, such as ‘Real World’ where players in your games move to new teams on the same dates as they do in real life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEach new version of the game tends to bring graphical improvements, and FM24 provides smoother animations for players as they charge around the pitch, more realistic physics for ball movement, and enhanced lighting effects to create a greater sense of atmosphere. And, of course, there are the inevitable AI features, such as the introduction of ‘Intermediaries’ that you can hire to go out and hustle for the best prices when you’re thinking of selling some players. There are also new Set Piece Coaches, who can help you to choose the best players for events such as free-kicks and corners. However, you’re up against tougher AI managers on opposition teams too, as they can now make smarter decisions when purchasing players that suit their tactical style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game also follows recent trends in tactical play, such as the greater use of positional play, which allows players to switch positions when your team has possession. The sheer depth of all these tactical options means that Football Manager can be a bit daunting for more casual fans of the game, but there’s a demo version available on both Steam and Epic, so you can have a quick kick-about to see how you get on before buying the full game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"2802\" height=\"1576\" alt=\"Grid Legends: Deluxe Edition - Best Racing Game\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Grid-2.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"2802\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$39.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been quite a while since any of the Grid games were released on the Mac and, in fact, the Windows version of Grid Legends was first launched back at the start of 2022. However, the Deluxe Edition that’s just been launched on the Mac App Store does include all the game’s recent DLC add-ons – listed at more than $60/£60 on Steam for the Windows version – so it’s great value for racing fans on the Mac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to be an ace F1 driver to play Grid Legends, though, as the game includes a variety of different modes that can appeal to casual players as well as experienced drivers who want a more demanding and realistic driving simulation. The game starts by throwing you into its Story mode, called Driven To Glory, which follows the Seneca Racing team as it tries to make its name in the new season. As well as following the action through a series of races, the Story mode is also presented as a kind of behind-the-scenes documentary, with video cut-scenes and interviews with some of the main drivers (including an appearance by the pre-Doctor Who Ncuti Gatwa).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eStory mode is a good way for beginners to get started, but more experienced drivers can jump straight ahead into the Career mode. This provides five difficulty levels, and allows you to work your way up from rookie to a seasoned pro driver. There are 10 different racing discplines available, including Drift, Elimination and the arcade-action of Classic Car-nage, and the game lets you play on 24 different tracks in locations such as Brands Hatch, Barcelona Dubai and Miami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you progress through the season, you can unlock 120 different vehicles, with different handling properties to suit your driving style. There’s also a Garage mode where you can upgrade and fine-tune your car to suit different terrain and weather conditions. The game also includes a Race Creator mode, where you can design your own custom race events, using different tracks, vehicles and weather conditions. It’s a shame, though, that the Mac version of the game is single-player only, and doesn’t have the multiplayer mode that’s available on the PC version. The game also requires an Apple Silicon processor, and doesn’t run on older Intel Macs. However, it ran more than fast enough for my somewhat chaotic driving skills on an M1 iMac with medium graphics and 1600×900 resolution, so you don’t need a super-fast Mac to put your pedal to the metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"18.

This isn’t the cute Disney version of Pinocchio, though – for starters the little wooden boy has grown a bionic metal arm to give him some extra muscle, and one of your first tasks is to pick up a sword and choose a ‘path’ that determines your fighting style. The Path Of The Sweeper tends to focus on heavy, two-handed weapons, while the Path Of The Bastard lets you fight with lighter, faster weapons. Or, as a safe bet, you can choose the Path Of The Cricket, which combines elements of the other two fighting styles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour puppet boy wakes in the city of Krat, a kind of steam-punk dystopia that has been over-run by rampaging puppets who have turned against their human masters. Guided by a cricket called Gemini (because Disney owns the name ‘Jiminy Cricket’) you fight your way across the city to locate Gepetto and end the puppet revolt. Like all soulsborne games, Lies Of P is very challenging, with a wide range of combat moves and skills that you have to master as you fight your way across the city. And, as the name suggests, the game also allows you to choose between telling lies or the truth as you encounter other characters in the game. The developers recommend using a game controller, rather than mouse and keyboard, and the game only runs on Apple Silicon, with no support for older Intel Macs. An M2 is recommended, but we still found the game playable on an iMac with a basic M1 processor, when running on medium graphics settings at 1920×1080, so most recent Mac models should be able to handle the game without too much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-best-games-you-can-play-on-a-mac\"\u003eThe best games you can play on a Mac \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe best of the rest, in alphabetical order…  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"alien-isolation-the-collection-best-action-game\"\u003eAlien: Isolation – The Collection: Best Action Game\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Feral Interactive\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"feralinteractive\"\u003eFeral Interactive\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Alien: Isolation on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($49.99/£34.99),  \u003ca title=\"Alien: Isolation - The Collection on Mac App Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/alien-isolation-collection/id973568088\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"apple\"\u003eMac App Store\u003c/a\u003e ($39.99/£38.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e Mac OS X 10.5, 2.0GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 1GB graphics card\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the games based on the Alien films have been pretty awful – in fact, Alien: Colonial Marines even prompted a lawsuit back in 2013 from disgruntled customers who felt they’d been misled by the advertising for the game. Fortunately, as our friends over at GameAgent recently remarked, Alien: Isolation is one of the “good Alien games”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally released for the PC in 2015, Alien: Isolation has arrived on the Mac and does a great job of capturing the tension and atmosphere of that very first Alien film. The game is set 15 years after Alien, following the discovery of the black-box flight-recorder from Ellen Ripley’s ship, \u003cem\u003eThe Nostromo\u003c/em\u003e. Ripley, of course, is still missing, so her daughter Amanda heads off to recover the black-box from the space station that found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNo prizes for guessing what Amanda and her team discover when they arrive at the space station: a toothy xenomorph on the loose, and gradually working its way through the terrified crew. Your task as Amanda is not to go in with all guns blazing, but simply to avoid the alien and stay alive – hiding inside a locker, or creating a distraction that will draw the alien away for a few crucial seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game creates a real sense of tension, and the computer-controlled alien is smart enough to provide a really formidable foe. This ‘collection’ also includes a number of bonus missions, including Crew Expendable, which re-enacts events from the original Alien film. However, the game’s system requirements are pretty high, so you should check that your Mac is up to it before buying the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition-best-rpg\"\u003eBaldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Edition: Best RPG\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/Best_Mac_games_Baldurs_Gate_2_1200_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Baldur\u0026#39;s Gate II\" title=\"Best Mac games: Baldur\u0026#39;s Gate II\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Beamdog\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.beamdog.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"beamdog\"\u003eBeamdog\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Baldur\u0026#39;s Gate II: Enhanced Edition on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/Baldurs_Gate_II_Enhanced_Edition/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($4.99/£3.74),  \u003ca title=\"Baldur\u0026#39;s Gate II on the Mac App Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/id746413884\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"apple\"\u003eMac App Store\u003c/a\u003e ($19.99/£19.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e Mac OS X 10.7, dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 2.5GB hard disk\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe original Baldur’s Gate II was released way back in 1988 by the roleplaying gods at Bioware, and its 2D graphics will look pretty dated to anyone that has played modern roleplaying games such as Bioware’s Dragon Age series. Even so, it’s an essential purchase for anyone that has even the slightest interest in roleplaying games, and the sheer size of the game means that it’s excellent value for money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a shame that this updated Enhanced Edition couldn’t be brought right up to date with more modern 3D graphics, but it does get a cosmetic makeover with high-def versions of the original artwork, so it doesn’t look too bad on modern computer screens. Besides, whether in 2D or 3D, Bioware’s great strength has always been its story-telling skill, and Baldur’s Gate II is as captivating now as it was nearly 30 years ago. It’s very much traditional fantasy fare – with you taking on the role of a warrior, wizard, rogue or cleric – but it’s done on a truly grand scale. Your character is just one of many mortal offspring spawned by the evil god Bhaal, and the game pits you against several of your own brothers and sisters as they vie to succeed Bhaal and claim his power as their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are hundreds and hundreds of quests along the way – around 300 hours worth if you try to complete them all – including power struggles within the guild of Shadow Thieves, and an epic battle with the wizard Irenicus, played in full scenery-chewing mode by Brit character actor David Warner. Throw in the return of bonkers barbarian Minsc and his giant space-hamster Boo, and BGII is a real retro treat for RPG fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"braid-best-platform-game\"\u003eBraid: Best Platform Game\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/best_mac_games_braid_800_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Braid\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Hothead Games\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://braid-game.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"braid-game\"\u003eHothead Games\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca title=\"Playdead\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://playdead.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"playdead\"\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Braid on the Mac App Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/braid/id411902645\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"apple\"\u003eMac App Store\u003c/a\u003e ($10.99/£10.99),  \u003ca title=\"Braid on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($14.99/£10.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e OS X 10.6.6 or later\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time you play Braid, you might be forgiven for thinking you’ve just bought a late 90s puzzle platformer.

Last year’s launch of Disco Elysium was particularly galling for RPG fans, as we watched the PC version of the game mop up awards all over the place. However, the Mac version of Disco Elysium has suddenly appeared, with no advance publicity, and is widely available on all the main online game stores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, Disco Elysium is a roleplaying game, but instead of medieval fantasy or futuristic sci-fi, the game casts you in the role of a drunken detective in a sort-of-contemporary setting, in the town of Revachol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou wake one morning in a sleazy hotel, with a mega-hangover, barely knowing who you are. After locating your trousers, you explore the hotel and encounter your partner, who reminds you that you are a detective investigating a murder case. You then set off to explore the local neighbourhood, interrogating suspects and looking for clues as you try to crack the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the contemporary setting many traditional roleplaying features are still in evidence – you can choose an ‘archetype’ for your character, such as the ‘Thinker’ who relies on deductive skills, or take the ‘Physical’ approach and try to intimidate suspects for information. There’s also an extensive set of additional skills, such as empathy or logic, that you can use to help you in your investigation. You don’t need to get too bogged down in stats and details, though, and you’ll soon be able to head off and explore the neighbourhood, which is wonderfully depicted, with grimy graphics and atmospheric music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDisco Elysium is the sort of absorbing, immersive game that can absorb you for hours on end. However, the system requirements for the 3D graphics are quite steep, so check to make sure your Mac can handle it first. Some of the language is a bit ripe too, so this definitely isn’t a game for younger children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"divinity-original-sin-2-best-multiplayer-rpg\"\u003eDivinity: Original Sin 2: Best Multiplayer RPG\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/combat_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Divinity: Original Sin 2\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Larian Studios\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.larian.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"larian\"\u003eLarian Studios\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Divinity: Original Sin on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($26.99/£17.99),  \u003ca title=\"Divinity: Original Sin 2 on the Mac App Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/divinity-original-sin-2/id1441532941\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"apple\"\u003eMac App Store\u003c/a\u003e ($44.99/£43.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e macOS 10.13.6 or later, MacBook Pro 2016 or later, MacBook Air 2017 or later, iMac with AMD graphics 2013 or later, Mac Mini 2018\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of 2018, the developers at Larian Studios announced that they were working with Apple – in itself a bit of a shock as Apple generally shows bugger-all interest in games on the Mac – to develop a Mac version of Original Sin 2 (one of the greatest RPGs of all time) using Apple’s Metal graphics system. There’s nothing half-hearted about the Mac version, either – as well as using Metal for the impressive 3D graphics, the game supports HDR (high dynamic range) on the latest Macs, as well as Mac-specific features such as Apple trackpads and the TouchBar on new MacBook Pro models. And the game’s multiplayer mode even works across both Macs and PCs, so you can play online with your friends (as long as you’ve all got the latest patches and updates). The only drawback here is that the Metal graphics require a fairly powerful Mac, so make sure to check the game’s system requirements before buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t worry if you’ve haven’t played the original game, as this sequel remains in the fantasy world of Rivellon, but steps forward in time and allows you to embark on an entirely new adventure. You start the game in a bit of trouble, as you’ve been captured and sentenced to jail for using a dangerous magical force called ‘Source’. Using Source gives you – and other ‘Sourcerors’ – great power, but it also creates a gateway to another dimension called The Void, allowing evil creatures to invade Rivellon. And, yep – you guessed it – your job is to save the world from the invading demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game begins with a helpful tutorial to get new players started, and newcomers can also opt for a ready-made ‘origin’ character that has already been set up for you. More experienced players can delve into character creation, with a wide variety of races on offer – with standard options such as humans, dwarves and elves complemented by more exotic lizards and undead – and the game also offers several difficulty levels and modes to cater for different playing styles and levels of experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt might all sound like fairly routine fantasy fare, but Original Sin 2 is tremendously well-made and involving. There are few simple good-versus-evil choices, and sometimes you’ll find yourself wracked with guilt because you simply can’t find a nice, clean solution to a particular problem or a tricky side-quest. The solo game by itself will keep even hardened roleplaying fans absorbed through the dark winter months, and the various online and multiplayer modes will ensure that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that you’ll come back to time and time again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/best_mac_games_elder_scrolls_blackwood_no_logo.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Elder Scrolls Online - Blackwood\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Zenimax\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"elderscrollsonline\"\u003eZenimax\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy: \u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca title=\"Green Man Gaming: The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Blackwood\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online-collection-blackwood-pc/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"greenmangaming\"\u003eGreen Man Gaming\u003c/a\u003e ($59.99/£42.49),  \u003ca title=\"Steam: The Elder Scrolls Online - Blackwood\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400970/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online__Blackwood/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($59.99/£49.99).

These are essentially expansion packs that add more content, and occasionally new features too. But every year or so, Zenimax releases an update that makes major changes to the game in order to keep it feeling fresh and exciting – and 2021’s Blackwood expansion is one of the biggest updates for quite some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe changes begin as soon as you enter the game. Even if you haven’t bought the Blackwood expansion there’s a new introductory tutorial that sends you to the island of Balfiera, where you can learn the ropes by helping the local townsfolk to fend off an invading army of monsters.

Blackwood also introduces a new companion system, which allows solo players to recruit a computer-controlled companion who can fight alongside you. This will be great for players – like me – who tend to play solo most of the time, with the new companion helping you to complete quests and tasks that might previously have been a bit too tough for one player on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBlackwood also introduces a new Gates of Oblivion storyline that will continue developing throughout this year, with a major quest that pits you against the demonic Prince Of Destruction, as he schemes to invade the mortal realm.

It also incorporates the Heavensward expansion pack that was previously sold separately, giving you even more quests and adventures to explore. Most important, though, is the new free trial system, which allows new players to sign up for a free account that provides access to vast areas of the game without paying for a subscription (although, to be honest, the registration process is a bit of a chore).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePlayers with a trial account can take their characters all the way to level 60 – the maximum level with a subscription is 80 – and explore the main game and all the extra zones and quests in Heavensward for free. If you want to advance beyond L60 and explore new character classes and other new features then you will still need to buy a copy of the game and pay for a continuing subscription. However, you can start for as little as £9.99/$19.99 for the Online Starter Edition, and then decide if you want to continue your subscription, and buy the latest Shadowbringer expansion pack as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"hearthstone-best-card-game\"\u003eHearthstone: Best card game\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/best_mac_games_hearthstone_1600a_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Hearthstone\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e \n\u003ca title=\"Blizzard\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"blizzard\"\u003eBlizzard\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy: \u003c/strong\u003e \n\u003ca title=\"playhearthstone.com\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"playhearthstone\"\u003eplayhearthstone.com\u003c/a\u003e (free to play, with in-game purchases)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e macOS 10.10, Intel Core Duo, Nvidia GeForce 8600M or AMD Radeon HD 2600 Pro\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHearthstone has been around for a few years now, and Blizzard’s typically slick presentation quickly established it as one of the leading computer card games.

You play a teenage girl called Max Caulfield who is having a bit of a bad day at school. Max ducks out of class and heads to the bathroom for a time-out, and as you wander the school corridors you can click on objects or people around you to gather information that guides you through the game. That’s routine adventure stuff, but life starts to get strange when Max witnesses the murder of her friend Chloe – and discovers that she has the ability to turn back time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSaving Chloe reveals a deeper mystery concerning a missing student called Rachel, so Max and Chloe set off to find Rachel and uncover the dark secrets of the sleepy town of Arcadia. That’s straightforward enough, but Chloe’s time-travelling abilities add a whole new dimension to the standard point-and-click adventure format. Sometimes a conversation with another character will reveal some useful information, allowing Chloe to go back and replay recent events so they have a different outcome. However, changing past events can have unexpected consequences, leading to some difficult – and dangerous – decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe story unfolds in five separate episodes, but you can check it out for free by downloading the first episode through Steam and then deciding if you want to explore the mystery further. We enjoyed its haunting, Buffy-esque depiction of the dark side of teenage life, and our only complaint is that the keyboard-and-mouse controls felt a bit clumsy so you’ll progress more smoothly if you have a proper game controller to help you out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"papers-please-best-puzzle-game\"\u003ePapers, Please: Best Puzzle Game\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/Best_Mac_games_Papers_Please_1000_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Papers, Please\" title=\"Best Mac games: Papers, Please\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"3909 LLC\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.papersplea.se/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"papersplea\"\u003e3909 LLC\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy: \u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca title=\"Papers, Please on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($9.99/£6.99),  \u003ca title=\"Papers, Please on GOG\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.gog.com/game/papers_please\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"gog\"\u003eGOG\u003c/a\u003e ($9.99/£7.89)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e 1.5GHz Core2Duo; OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) or later; 2 GB RAM; 100MB hard disk space\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost unclassifiable in normal gaming terms – we’ve put it with the puzzlers, although it’s really a bizarre take on the classic worker simulation – Papers, Please sees you taking up the post of border control in an authoritarian regime.

The Sims 4 had a lot to live up to after the success of The Sims 3, but it fills its predecessor’s shoes beautifully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou get a deeper level of character customisation than in previous generations. While you can still browse and select preset eyes, mouth, hair, etc, The Sims 4 allows you to fine-tune your character’s looks and build by clicking and dragging the area you want to tweak. Does your Sim’s belly protrude a little too much for your liking? Clicking on the troubled area and dragging it in will make your Sim thinner – it’s as easy as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe build \u0026amp; design mode in The Sims was the basis for the game as a whole – it started off as a simulator that architects could use. And it’s fantastic here. It’s a great experience being able to design a home exactly how you want it to be and really gets your creative juices flowing. With more design options (like the ability to build “in the air” with no support below), houses in The Sims 4 looks more breathtaking than ever. You can pick up and move whole rooms whenever you fancy a change, and buy whole rooms of same-style furniture. For those of us without an eye for interior design, it allows us to really appreciate the game and the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDay-to-day life in The Sims 4 is more enjoyable, too. If your Sim is hungry, simply click on the hunger bar and the Sim will automatically feed themselves – the same applies to all their other needs too. It takes the effort out of the more mundane tasks and allows you more time to do the fun things with your Sim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sims 4 is a great game with so many options that you’ll lose yourself for hours at a time. \u003cstrong\u003eLewis Painter\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-best-rpg\"\u003eStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: Best RPG\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/star_wars_1_thumb.png\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Aspyr\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.aspyr.com\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"aspyr\"\u003eAspyr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy: \u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca title=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II on Green Man Gaming\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-mac/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"greenmangaming\"\u003eGreen Man Gaming\u003c/a\u003e ($2.80/£2.01),  \u003ca title=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/208580/STAR_WARS_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II__The_Sith_Lords/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($3.49/£2.51),  \u003ca title=\"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II on Mac App Store\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/star-wars-knights-old-republic/id960778634\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"apple\"\u003eMac App Store\u003c/a\u003e ($9.99/£9.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e Mac OS X 10.9.5, 2.2GHz dual-core Intel processor, 4GB RAM, 256MB graphics card\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s more than a decade since the original Knights Of The Old Republic was first released, but that game is still selling well on the App Store even after all these years. So it came as a bit of a surprise when we realised that this sequel – originally released for PC back in 2005 – has only just arrived on the Mac for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike its predecessor, KOTOR II is set thousands of years in the past, long before the events of the Star Wars film series. You play one of the last surviving Jedi, who have been almost completely wiped out after a long war with the evil Sith Lords. At the start of the game you wake up injured and with no memory of recent events. Even your trusty light-sabre has gone missing, so your initial challenge is to recover your memory and your Jedi powers, and then set off to try and find any other Jedi that may have survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a wide range of skills and abilities that you can develop as you progress through the game, and you can focus on either light-sabre combat or spooky Force Powers depending on how you want to develop your character. There’s also a strong story and roleplaying element, full of political twists and turns, and moral decisions that will affect the final outcome of the game. The 3D graphics look a little dated now, but the intriguing storyline and light-sabre action will soon have you hooked, and at just £9.99 the game’s a real bargain for Star Wars fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"total-war-warhammer-ii-best-strategy-game\"\u003eTotal War: Warhammer II: Best Strategy Game\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/overview_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: Total War: Warhammer II\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Creative Assembly\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.creative-assembly.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"creative-assembly\"\u003eCreative Assembly\u003c/a\u003e/ \u003ca title=\"Feral Interactive\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.feralinteractive.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"feralinteractive\"\u003eFeral Interactive\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Total War: Warhammer II on Steam\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($59.99/£39.99)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e macOS 10.14, 2GHz Intel Core i5, Radeon R9 M290 or Intel Iris 540 with 2GB video memory\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTotal War: Warhammer was a match made in Orc-heaven, as it combined the fantasy warfare of the Warhammer series with the large-scale battles of the Total War strategy games. So it’s no surprise that this follow-up offers more of the same, albeit with enough variety to make it worth coughing up the rather hefty £39.99/$59.99 on Steam. But you should check the game’s system requirements first, as the battling armies of elves, lizardmen and rodent-like Skaven need a pretty powerful Mac to handle their demanding 3D graphics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe story for the main single-player campaign is, to be honest, fairly trite fantasy fodder, with the game’s four rival factions competing to control a great, swirling vortex of magical energy floating up in the sky. That’s little more than an excuse to get the rival armies and heroes charging across the game’s vast landscapes, but the main campaign is well constructed and gives you plenty of different options for getting stuck into endless hours of fantasy fisticuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can control any of the four rival races, and each race lets you choose between two Legendary Lords, who all have different storylines and starting locations, as well as their own special abilities that can be used to assist their troops in battle (and, if you’re new to the Total War games, one Lord for each race also gives you a handy tutorial to get started). That gives you eight different options for playing and re-playing the game, and if you also own the original Total War: Warhammer then you get a free bonus campaign thrown in as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe game also includes a number of Battle modes that you can dip into for a quick fix every now and then, as well as a multiplayer mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"wildermyth-best-rpg\"\u003eWildermyth: Best RPG\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/best_mac_games_wildermyth_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: WIldermyth\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Worldwalker Games\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://wildermyth.com/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"wildermyth\"\u003eWorldwalker Games\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"Steam: Wildermyth\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/763890/Wildermyth/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"steampowered\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e ($24.99/£19.49)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e Mac with OS X v10.13, 64-bit processor\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWildermyth is an unusual and impressive roleplaying game with flexible character development that encourages you to go back and play through it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an immediately eye-catching game with ‘papercraft’ graphics that look like a child’s popup book, as your 2D characters use a turn-based combat system to move through hand-painted 3D environments. You start by creating a party with three characters: a warrior, a hunter (rogue) and mystic. These characters are created by the game, with their own personalities and backgrounds, although you can fine-tune each character by modifying their appearance, skills and other abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, like all good roleplaying games, it allows you to make choices that affect the story and the relationships between the various characters. At various points you’ll be presented with options – drawn like panels from a comic book rather than dull lumps of text – that establish whether your characters are friends, rivals, or even in a romance, and this affects the way that the story develops and how the lives of your characters unfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe tutorial could be a little clearer – I had to look up some videos on YouTube to help me get started – but the turn-based combat isn’t too difficult to master, and you can develop your party’s abilities to combine stealth, magic and weapon skills in any way that you like. And, at the end of each game, you can save favourite ‘legacy’ characters in order to bring them back the next time you play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where Wildermyth really stands out, as its story is ‘procedurally generated’ – it’s not entirely random, but is flexible within a framework that is controlled by the game itself. There’s enough variety within that framework to enjoy playing through again, and gives you the luxury of being reunited with your favourite characters to see how their stories and relationships continue to develop throughout their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"world-of-warcraft-best-mmorpg\"\u003eWorld Of Warcraft: Best MMORPG\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3484158/Best_Mac_games_World_of_Warcraft_Draenor_960_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Best Mac games: World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor\" title=\"Best Mac games: World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCompany: \u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca title=\"Blizzard\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"blizzard\"\u003eBlizzard\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere to buy:\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003ca title=\"World of Warcraft\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/games/wow/\u0026amp;xcust=1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/670824/best-mac-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" data-subtag=\"1-3-670824-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"blizzard\"\u003eWoW\u003c/a\u003e (free for Starter Edition, plus $12.99/£8.99 monthly subscription)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem requirements:\u003c/strong\u003e Mac OS X 10.5.8; Intel Core 2 Duo; graphics card with 256MB VRAM\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIts cutesy graphics aren’t to everyone’s taste, but World of Warcraft is still the game that rules the massively multiplayer online scene, with around seven million subscribers playing as wizards, priests, warriors and rogues.

The bad news is that the aliens won at the end of XCOM: Enemy Unknown back in 2013. So now we jump forward 20 years and the Earth is ruled by Advent – a coalition of alien overlords and their human collaborators (boo, hiss) – so it’s up to you to lead the human resistance movement and recruit a new XCOM team to wage a guerrilla war against the alien oppressors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike its predecessor, XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy game that provides an overhead isometric view of the battlefield so that you can plan your team’s moves as they approach their target. But the moment you pull the trigger the action switches to a close-up view – similar to a first person shooter – that gives it a more visceral feel than most conventional strategy games.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are five soldier classes available to help you out, including Sharpshooters with their long-range sniper skills, and Grenadiers who just charge in and blow up everything in sight. There’s also the Psi Operative, who adds a fantasy/sci-fi element with telepathic abilities such as Soulfire and mind-control. Each class also gets its own selection of different skills, giving you plenty of freedom to develop your team in a way that suits your combat style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other resources available too. Your base is a captured alien ship called the Avenger, and between missions you need to give careful thought to developing the engineering, research and armoury facilities on the ship in order to provide new weapons and technology for your team. It’s gripping stuff, and guaranteed to keep strategy fans glued to the screen for hours on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"further-reading\"\u003eFurther reading\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s it!
