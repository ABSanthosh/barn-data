Image: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac To heck with “go big or go home” because there’s never been a better time to go mini: these Mac mini deals are the cheapest way to buy a new Mac. The Mac mini is a desktop computer, so you’ll need to supply your own display, keyboard and mouse. It seamlessly replaces an aging PC and its diminutive size fits on any desk. And even though Black Friday sales are still weeks away, now is an ideal time to buy. Apple’s smallest Mac carries big discounts. The entry level (and current) M2 and M2 Pro models at least 12% off, while the prior M1 model can be had for $400. This post contains affiliate links.

(M2 Pro model pictured)Photo: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac The Mac mini with M2 is the cheapest way to buy a brand new Mac. It fits into any kind of setup, with whatever peripherals you have. The Mac mini is the ideal choice for desktop PC switchers — you can keep everything you already have in place, but your bulky tower is swapped out for a tiny aluminum Mac. The M2 can handle it all, whether you want a simple desktop for remote work, a family computer or a home server in the closet. Mac mini with M2, 256 GB: $529 on Amazon (full price $599, 12% off) Mac mini with M2, 512 GB: $699 on Amazon (full price $799, 13% off) The biggest discount on the best Mac mini with M2 Pro The Mac mini with M2 Pro is a low-cost powerhouse of a computer. Although it has the same tiny footprint, it packs even more ports and power. I use my M2 Pro Mac mini for everything — writing, graphic design, video editing, podcasting, gaming. It doesn’t slow down for a second. It has a fan, but you’ll never hear it. That’s the sheer power of Apple silicon. In my review, I called it “the best value in the entire computer industry,” and that’s even more true today. A Mac mini with M2 Pro and 512 GB of storage can be yours for $1,149, a huge $150 discount. Mac mini with M2 Pro, 512 GB: $1,149 on Amazon (full price $1,299, 12% off) Refurbished Mac mini with M1: The cheapest way to get Apple silicon The absolute cheapest way to buy into a recent Mac is the Mac mini with M1 at $400. The unit at this cost is refurbished, but it’s hard to best the price. The M1 chip is the first generation of Apple silicon on the Mac, after Apple switched away from Intel processors. It’s still plenty fast for everyday tasks and will likely be supported for many years to come. It has the same plethora of ports around the back in the same compact aluminum case. It’s rare that you have the chance to buy such an excellent machine at an incredible price. Get it while supplies last. Refurb Mac mini with M1, 256 GB: $400 on Amazon (full price $699, 42% off) This article on Mac mini deals was originally published on October 9, 2024.
