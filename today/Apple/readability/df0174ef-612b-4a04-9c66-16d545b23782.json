  "text": "China has detained four Taiwanese employees at Foxconn’s Zhengzhou plant, the largest iPhone production facility in the world, responsible for around 80% of global production. The employees were detained using powers the Chinese government last year granted to itself. No specific reason has yet been given, but it seems likely the move is political … China detains four Foxconn employees The WSJ reports. Four Taiwanese employees at Chinese facilities that make products for Apple have been detained by local authorities, Taiwanese officials said, the latest example of corporate detentions that have hurt business confidence […] One of the agencies said the employees were accused of an offense akin to breach of trust, although the exact nature of the allegations couldn’t be determined […] Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) […] described the allegations as bizarre and said improper detention could severely damage investor confidence in China.  Neither Apple nor Foxconn has commented, but the MAC said there had been no financial loss. Likely a political motive Relations between China and Taiwan have grown increasingly strained in recent years, up to and including China practicing moves to blockade the island as part of an invasion plan. UK and US intelligence agencies and the military believe there is a serious risk of an invasion in 2027, the 100th anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army. Apple chipmaker TSMC has reportedly made plans to remotely disable its machines to prevent China getting its hands on the advanced tech in the event of an invasion. Detentions of employees are a relatively new weapon employed by China to send a chilling message to those who support are vocal about Taiwan’s claim to independence. China announced new rules targeting individuals it labels as “Taiwan independence die-hards,” threatening them with the death penalty […] The council in June upgraded its alert level for travel to China to the second-highest level, saying Taiwanese people should avoid nonessential trips. It said Beijing’s tightened national-security laws have led to Taiwanese citizens being illegally detained or interrogated.  The latest development further adds to pressure on Apple to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing.
