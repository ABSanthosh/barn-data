But other reviewers had more to say about the performance boost from the Apple M4 processor. Read on for a range of thoughts from reviewers on the 2024 iMac with M4. Apple significantly redesigned the iMac in 2021 to be super slim. An upgrade to the all-in-one desktop launches this week, but the overall design remains essentially identical. A 24-inch, 4.5K Retina Display is the centerpiece, just as before. Reviewers don’t knock the design. TechCruch calls it “a more playful, entry-level system that’s at home inside a dorm room.” While the overall shape stays the same, the look has changed. “This time every single color has been gently updated,” noted the review in Forbes. “There’s a fresher feel to the colors this time around, with a little more punch, especially on the back of the iMac.” iJustine offers a side-by-side visual comparison: Pink vs Red iMac pic.twitter.com/lOiHO9cxNe — iJustine (@ijustine) November 7, 2024 So much faster The previous iMac uses an Apple M3 processor, and Apple speed boosted the 2024 model with the more powerful M4 chip. “The new iMac with the M4 cranked out the highest CPU-related benchmarks I’ve seen on an all-in-one computer — including Intel and AMD-based machines — and it had (by far) the best GPU scores among machines with integrated graphics,” noted the Wired review. Testing done with the Geekbench 6 cross-platform benchmarking app by Cnet found that Apple’s new desktop with the M4 scored 14,890 on the multi-core CPU test. For comparison, its predecessor with an Apple M3 scored an 11,712 on the same test — chalk up a 27% increase for the new model. Virtually every reviewer praises Apple doubling the minimal amount of RAM. For example, Ars Technica’s reviewer wrote, “Apple’s addition of 16GB RAM to the basic $1,299 model makes it a whole lot more appealing for the vast majority of people who just want to take the computer out of the box and plunk it on a desk and be done. ” M4 iMac reviews: Final thoughts “The iMac remains a great entry-level desktop for those who’d rather not be bothered buying an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, et al,” said TechCrunch. And Forbes summarized the Mac by saying, “This is a general-use device and it remains the most attractive, approachable and delightful all-in-one around.” Preorder today The M4 iMac’s base model, which ships with an 8-core M4 chip and two USB-C ports, costs $1,299. The 10-core CPU and GPU variant with four USB-C ports is available for $1,499. You can preorder the machine today, and retail availability is scheduled for November 8.
