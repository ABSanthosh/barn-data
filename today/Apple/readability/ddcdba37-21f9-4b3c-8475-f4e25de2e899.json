Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Joining the Apple ecosystem can cost a pretty penny, but not when you opt for a refurbished MacBook Air. Buying a barely used Apple laptop offers a more affordable way to join the family. Want in? You can purchase a refurbished MacBook Air from 2017 for just $229.97 for a limited time. Refurbished MacBook Air from 2017: A budget Apple laptop First off, the downside. This laptop came out before Apple silicon gave MacBooks unsurpassed power and efficiency. And that means it won’t work with Apple Intelligence, the suite of AI features the company is steadily building out. Still, if you need a basic Apple laptop at a budget price, this refurbished MacBook Air from 2017 might work for you. Featuring an Intel Core i5 processor, Intel Graphics HD 6000 and 8GB of memory, it easily handle most daily computing needs. Of course, you might need more horsepower if you plan on serious video editing or intense graphical workloads. But if you only plan on web browsing and streaming, this laptop should suit you perfectly. Lightweight, with a classic Apple design As the name suggests, the 13.3-inch MacBook Air is exceptionally light, weighing just under 3 pounds. Plus, it’s less than an inch thick at its widest, so you’ll hardly notice you’re carrying it if you slip it into your bag. And Apple’s classic aluminum wedge design still looks stunning (and feels sturdy). The battery offers up to 12 hours of usage off a single charge, making it an excellent travel companion or school computer. Video correspondence comes through clearly, thanks to the screen’s sharp 1,440 x 900 native resolution. Wi-Fi lets you connect to the web wirelessly, while Bluetooth enables you to sync with your favorite MacBook accessories. This 2017 MacBook Air earned an A-grade refurbished rating. That means it will arrive in near-mint condition, with minimal to no scuffing or scratches from previous use. You’ll essentially receive a new device without the high price tag, giving it a second life away from a landfill. Save on a refurbished MacBook Air Whether you’re overdue for a new laptop, could use a supplemental workstation or want an affordable computer for the kids, this opportunity delivers spectacular value. Grab a refurbished MacBook Air for $229.97. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change. All sales handled by StackSocial, our partner who runs Cult of Mac Deals.
