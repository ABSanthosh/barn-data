  "text": "Starting later this month, Prime Video subscribers will be able to subscribe to Apple TV+ through Amazon. Specific details about the business arrangement between Apple and Amazon are not known. However, Apple presumably believes it can reach more subscribers by offering TV+ as an add-on subscription for Prime Video subscribers. This quote from Eddy Cue provided in the press release from Amazon says as much: “We want to make Apple TV+ and its award-winning library of series and films from the world’s greatest storytellers available to as many viewers as possible,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Services. “We’re thrilled that Prime Video will now offer Apple TV+, giving viewers an incredible breadth of viewing options.” Meanwhile, Amazon suggests “one billing relationship, in one convenient app” is what will convince Prime members to subscribe to Apple TV+ in this new way. Apple similarly sells video subscriptions to competing services through the Channels function of the Apple TV app. Prime Video is not one of those services yet. Why subscribe through Amazon? What’s interesting about this partnership is that it doesn’t really expand Apple TV+ distribution yet. Apple TV+ service is generally available everywhere Amazon Prime Video service is offered. However, it may help potential Apple TV+ subscribers overcome the hurdle of figuring out how to subscribe to Apple TV+ service through Apple. A common misconception with Apple TV+ service is that an Apple TV hardware set-top box is required to access the streaming video service on a television. In reality, Apple TV+ is available through the Apple TV app on virtually all smart TVs, set-top boxes and steaming sticks, gaming consoles, and the web. Subscribing to Apple TV+ through Amazon Prime Video would provide a proper app experience on Android. If a better TV+ experience on Android was a goal for Apple, however, bringing the Apple TV app to Android would give Apple more control over the user experience. Apple TV+ through Prime Video will cost the same $9.99/month as Apple TV+ directly from Apple. Prime Video is a separate subscription that ranges from $8.99/month to $17.98/month.
