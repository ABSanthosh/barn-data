  "text": "We recently reported on a video by YouTuber Jon Prosser, who claims to have seen an internal build of iOS 19. In the video, Prosser showed a sneak peek at what to expect for the new design of the next version of iOS. Now the YouTuber is back with more images based on alleged leaked internal builds of iOS 19, this time showing the new icons, floating bars, and more. Latest iOS 19 leaks According to Prosser, the app icons will have a new shape in between the current one and a perfect circle, so they’ll look more rounded, but not like in visionOS or watchOS. As Apple is rumored to make iOS more like visionOS, users can also expect redesigned menus with more shadows and depth. Not only that, but some elements will shimmer as the user moves the device. The system’s Tab View, which is what Apple calls the tabs inside apps, will look a lot like what exists in visionOS and even in the Photos app of iOS 18. The bar in apps like Music and App Store will float on the screen with a new interface for the Search tab. In apps like Messages, the search field now appears at the bottom of the screen. If what Prosser saw is true, the redesign won’t be as drastic as expected – but it will certainly make iOS 19 feel fresh. For example, the iOS 19 Settings app concept shown by Prosser looks similar to the current app, but each list now has shadows and wider spacing between each item. You can watch Prosser’s video below: The YouTuber was the first to suggest that Apple has been working on a new interface for iOS 19. He shared a mockup of what could be a brand new Camera app for the iPhone with buttons floating on the screen. The rumor was corroborated by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said earlier this month that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will mark the “most significant upgrade” to the interface in years. To back up the rumors, the WWDC 2025 artwork unveiled a few days ago is heavily inspired by visionOS, with glass-like elements, depth and shadows. We’ll find out the truth on June 9, when Apple will hold the WWDC 2025 opening keynote.
