  "text": "News Thriller film \"The Gorge\" is coming soon to Apple TV+. Photo: Apple TV+ Popular young movie stars Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy star alongside Sigourney Weaver in the upcoming thriller film The Gorge on Apple TV+, the streamer revealed Thursday. It noted the film, which has no firm release date yet, will get promoted along with season 2 of hit series Severance at pop culture festival CCXP24 in early December. “They’re not keeping you out. They’re keeping them in,” reads the tagline for the Apple Original Film. And in bigger news for fans of the mind-bending workplace drama series, Apple noted Severance returns with its second season January 17 (for those who don’t already know). Genre-bending thriller film The Gorge coming to Apple TV+ sometime after CCXP24 promo in December Apple TV+ will promote The Gorge movie and Severance season 2 from the Thunder Stage and on the expo floor at CCXP24. The event will feature “can’t-miss panel conversations and unforgettable events and fan experiences” on Saturday, December 7, in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Here’s how Apple TV+ describes the “genre-bending, action-packed” film The Gorge: Two highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late. Scott Derrickson directed The Gorge from a script by Zach Dean. Skydance Media’s David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger produced the film alongside Crooked Highway’s Derrickson, C. Robert Cargill, Sherryl Clark, as well as Dean, Adam Kolbrenner and Gregory Goodman. Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy star in thriller “The Gorge.”Photo: Apple TV+ Severance season 2 airs January 17, 2025 Fans of Severance, rejoice. If you can just make it through the winter holidays, you can start watching the celebrated, Emmy Award-winning workplace thriller’s second season on January 17, 2025, as we previously reported. The show hails from executive producer Ben Stiller and stars Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette. And the second season brings in new series regular Sarah Bock. The WWDC24 keynote featured an Apple TV+ reel with Severance season two footage of Adam Scott walking down a Lumon Industries hallway with balloons.Photo: Apple TV+ As you may already now, in Severance, Mark Scout (Scott) leads a team at the mysteriously sinister Lumon Industries. Those employees underwent a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. What happens at work — and it’s weird — stays at work. “This daring experiment in ‘work-life balance’ is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself,” Apple TV+ said. “In season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.” That’s not a lot to go on, but the show has been reliably engrossing so far. Watch the season 2 trailer here. Watch them on Apple TV+ While you wait for The Gorge, there’s plenty of action and other movies to watch on Apple TV+ — in addition to the whole first season of Severance. The service is available by subscription for $9.99 with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. For a limited time, customers who purchase and activate a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac or iPod touch can enjoy three months of Apple TV+ for free. After launching in November 2019, “Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have been honored with 515 wins and 2,308 award nominations and counting,” the service said. In addition to award-winning movies and TV shows (including breakout soccer comedy Ted Lasso), Apple TV+ offers a variety of documentaries, dramas, comedies, kids shows and more. Source: Apple TV+",
