  "text": "Apple introduced the Pro Display XDR in 2019 with its $4999 price tag, no included stand, and an optional Pro Stand for $999. Since then, despite all of the advancements in display technology, Apple has left it untouched. While there isn’t a ton to go off of, there are a couple of smaller details that give us an idea on what Apple is working on. Apple Silicon chip Apple released the Studio Display in 2022, and it had one unique advantage over most displays: it was powered by an A13 Bionic. This allowed it to have cool features like Center Stage and spatial audio. Pro Display XDR, since it was released three years prior, does not include an Apple Silicon chipset. However, according to a Bloomberg report from 2022, that is one thing Apple is planning for the next-generation model: Apple is working on multiple new external monitors as well, including an update to the Pro Display XDR that was launched alongside the Intel Mac Pro in 2019. It is possible, however, that the company’s next high-end display will ship after the Mac Pro, as the computer is further along in development than the monitor. Those new monitors — like the Studio Display launched with the Mac Studio — will include Apple silicon. That helps the screens rely less on resources from the attached computer. Presuming this two-year-old rumor holds up – which could make sense given the fact that Gurman mentioned that the display was behind in development, then we can likely expect some sort of Apple Silicon chipset in the Pro Display XDR 2. This could allow for the Pro Display XDR to have a built in camera and speakers, something it doesn’t currently. Quantom-dot display According to display analyst Ross Young, Apple will be adopting quantom-dot films in the next generation Pro Display XDR, similar to the new M4 MacBook Pro: Now that Apple has adopted [quantum dot] films in the MacBook Pro, it will be interesting to see if they replace KSF films and KSF phosphors in other Apple products. KSF films are found in previous MiniLED MacBook Pro’s and the Mac Pro Display XDR. We expect the next version of the Mac Pro Display to adopt it. It isn’t clear if this means Apple will adopt mini-LED in the next generation Pro Display XDR, which currently uses a higher end IPS panel with local-dimming zones. We also have no concrete information regarding refresh rate, though it would be nice if we got a 120Hz panel, especially since MacBooks have had that for over three years, and the Pro Display XDR costs over $5000. Other rumors Last year, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple will be releasing a 27-inch miniLED display in 2025. It’s unlikely that this is in reference to the Pro Display XDR, since it has a 32-inch display size, but it’s relevant to mention regardless, as Kuo refers to it as a “high end monitor.” According to Kuo, this display will be thinner, and also have narrower bezels. Additionally, we’ve reported on 9to5Mac that Apple is working on a display with a 7K resolution, which seems plausible for a future Pro Display XDR. Release date Display analyst Ross Young shared with 9to5Mac that he currently expects the Pro Display XDR 2 to launch in late 2025 or early 2026, though there isn’t yet anything concrete.
