  "description": "Macworld We’re just a couple of months away from iPhone seasons, and we’ve been inundated with reports about the changes coming, which include leaked photos of the iPhone 17 Air in protective wrap, video of dummy Airs, and a video of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Now, a new set of leaked photos gives us another look at just how thin (and thick) the new iPhones will be. Majin Bu on X has posted a few purported leaked photos of the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro, both in black. Three things stand out about the photos: the thinness of the iPhone 17 Air, the size of the camera bars on each camera, and the richness of the black on each phone. Majin Bu/X Majin Bu/X The iPhone 17 Air is remarkably thin, and barely thick enough to accommodate the side button. It has a wide camera bar that looks a lot like the ones on the Google Pixel, but it’s positioned higher on the back of the phone. There’s also a lot of space between the left camera and the right LED flash, which could have something to do with the placement of the Dynamic Island and sensors needed for Face ID. The camera bars and thinness have been reported in previous leaks, and Bu’s photos are consistent with what’s been reported. However, the sheer size of the bar compared to previous iPhone releases is shockingly big, especially on the Pro models. Compared to previous leaks and renders, the polish on these phones seem very similar to how they will look in the real world, and the camera bar is likely to be a very polarizing design element. The iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be announced at an Apple event this September. Check out our iPhone 17 guide for all the latest leaks and rumors.",
