  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Univershuffle is a new music discovery app that shuffles all of the songs on Apple Music, completely at random – no AI or algorithms involved. It offers the ultimate experience for finding new music, so long as you’re willing to sort through a ton of songs. The app is available for free in a limited capacity, though you’ll need to link an Apple Music account to listen to songs in their entirety. It launched on the App Store this week. Top features Once you have an Apple Music account linked, you can shuffle through songs as you please. You can exclude certain genres, that way you can better suit your music tastes. If you find songs you like, there’s also quick buttons to add it to a playlist, or add it to your Apple Music library. If you happen to come across a song in another language, the app has a feature to translate titles, leveraging Apple’s Translate API. Just tap the title and it’ll translate it. There’s also a mappable button, allowing you to have a shortcut to perform your favorite action in app, whether that be instantly adding a song to your playlist, or adding the album to your library. The app has support for Apple Shortcuts and Siri, and will also iCloud Sync across your various devices. Interactive home screen widgets are also offered. Pricing Univershuffle is pretty usable for free, as long as you have your Apple Music account linked. If you don’t, you’ll be limited to 30 second segments of songs. However, if you do, you can use the app completely ad-free for your first 10 songs, and the app will display ads afterwards. If you’d like the ad-free experience, you can buy Univershuffle Premium, which has a “tip jar” sort of payment model. You can unlock it for as low as $5 one time, but theres varying tiers if you’d like to support the developer more, with options for $10, $25, or $50. There’s also options to subscribe if you’d like to support the developer on an ongoing basis. Subscriptions start at $1.49/month, and you get to keep the premium features even if you cancel – so long as you’ve paid more than $5 collectively. Download Univershuffle Univershuffle is available for free on the App Store, for devices running iOS 17 and macOS 15 or later. It supports iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro – and you can download it here. You can also read the developers blog post if you’d like to learn more about the app. Follow Michael: X/Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
