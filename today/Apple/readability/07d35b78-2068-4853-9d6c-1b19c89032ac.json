  "text": "NewsTop Stories Install iOS 18.3.1 if you have any concern your iPhone might get hacked. Or if you just don’t want bugs. Screenshot: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac iOS 18.3.1, iPadOS 18.3.1 and more updates went out Monday. These bring bug fixes, while a security update makes them highly recommended for anyone with a compatible iPhone or iPad. In addition, you can download macOS Sequoia 15.3.1, watchOS 11.3.1 and visionOS 2.3.1 — each with their own fixes — now as well. iOS 18.3, macOS 15.3 and iPadOS 18.3 went out in late January with a range of bug fixes and a few other tweaks. It seems Apple didn’t clean up everything, though, because users can now download and install small follow-up versions for each. For iPhone and iPad users, the main purpose seems to be to close a security hole in these devices that’s been used by hackers. The official descriptions for iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1 make clear that the updates bring no new features. They say, “This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.” The watchOS description is even more succinct. “This update provides important security fixes and is recommended for all users,” Apple says. Speaking of security fixes, Apple closed a bug used by hackers against iPhone and iPad. Without the fix, Cupertino warned that “a physical attack may disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device.” It’s considered critical because the security hole is actually being used: “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” How to install iOS 18.3.1, macOS Sequoia 15.3.1 and more iPhone and iPad users can install iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1 directly by opening the Settings app and going to General \u003e Software Update. Alternatively, update your devices by connecting them to a Mac (or to a PC running iTunes). To download the macOS Sequoia update, go to Apple menu  \u003e About This Mac. Then click Software Update. Alternatively, install the new version from the App Store. (Note: At the time of this writing, Apple had not yet updated the version of macOS in the App Store. But it should happen soon.) You can install the watchOS update directly onto an Apple Watch, as long as the wearable remains connected to Wi-Fi. From the Settings app, just navigate to General \u003e Software Update. Or you can install it from an iPhone by opening the Apple Watch app and going to My Watch \u003e General \u003e Software Update. And Vision Pro users might need the Cult of Mac guide on how to update visionOS.",
