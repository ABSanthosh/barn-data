  "text": "Apple today has launched a new service program for iPhone 14 Plus models, where a ‘very small percentage’ of devices may show no rear camera preview. This is the first iPhone service program in a couple years, with the last one being in 2021 where some iPhone 12 models experienced an earpiece speaker problem. This new service program is for iPhone 14 Plus models sold between April 10th, 2023 and April 28th, 2024 – potentially affecting around a year of iPhone 14 Plus models. iPhone 14 Plus launched in September 2022, so the issue didn’t pop up until later on. You can check whether or not your iPhone 14 Plus is impacted by inputting your serial number on Apple’s website. If you’re impacted, Apple will fix the issue free of charge, presuming your iPhone has no other forms of damage. Apple states that this program covers eligible iPhone 14 Plus models for 3 years after the original date of purchase. Additionally, if you paid to have your iPhone 14 Plus serviced for this issue, you can request a refund. If your iPhone does need service, Apple will “verify” that it’s eligible for service. You have a number of options for completing the repair, including: Find an Apple Authorized Service Provider Make an appointment at an Apple Retail Store Contact Apple Support to arrange mail-in service via the Apple Repair Center Last but not least, this issue only impacts iPhone 14 Plus models sold during the aforementioned window. If you have an iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max model, you cannot utilize this service program.
