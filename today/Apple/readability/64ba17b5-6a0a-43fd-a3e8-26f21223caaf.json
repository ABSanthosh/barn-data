It feels that 2025 has been a keyboard odyssey for this reviewer. Specifically, an odyssey through a wide range of keyboards offered by one of the most prolific manufacturers in the industry: Keychron. Ranging from large to small, lightweight to heavyweight, wireless, wired, and everything in between. All with features to meet any workspace needs. Countless companies compete for consumer attention and dollars in the field. Keychron continues to stand out as a company determined to meet every style preference and need within it. The final stop on my personal Keychron odyssey is the Q14 Max Keyboard. This one is a heavy mechanical behemoth that seeks to find a place in my day-to-day workspace. Keychron Q14 Max review: Inside the boxThe Q14 Max is a 96 percent mechanical keyboard with an Alice key configuration. It connects to my Mac via a wired connection or wirelessly using a 2.4GHz dongle or Bluetooth. Keychron Q14 Max review: The box. The keyboard arrives in a black box with a metallic logo. The keyboard and accessories are packaged in heavy foam cutouts for maximum travel safety. Inside the box: Q14 Max keyboard Quick start guide USB-A to USB-C cable Extension Adapter USB 2.4 GHz dongle Hex driver Keycap and puller tool Extra keycaps (for Mac or Windows configurations) PCB Stabilizers ManualKeychron Q14 Max review: Build QualityThe Q14 Max is a 96 percent mechanical keyboard with a metal case. That combination means it is very. Keychron keyboards are consistently beefy and incredibly sturdy. There is nothing about the keyboard, switches, cables, or tools that suggests cutting corners on materials or engineering. You probably could drop this keyboard off the roof, and it would survive. Keychron Q14 Max review: The full Alice layout, with a flipped Numpad positionKeychron has a history of offering its keyboards in only one color. But with the Q14 Max Keychron, it offers Carbon Black and Shell White colorways. This is something encouraging to see from Keychron. We all have personal aesthetics for our workspaces, and a range of colors would be nice to choose from. The Q14 Max arrives with Gateron Jupiter switches as standard, and these are the only switches available for the Q14 Max on the Keychron website. Keychron Q14 Max review: Rear switchesThe back of the keyboard has a single USB-C port for charging or using the keyboard in wired mode. There are two switches on the back center of the keyboard. One switch allows you to switch between wireless or cable connection types, while the other toggles between Mac and Windows configurations. Keychron does include optional keycaps so that you can change the physical keys between the two layout types. Keychron Q14 Max review: CustomizationThe Q14 Max offers Keychron's double-shot PBT keycaps and three colors for switch options: Red, Banana Yellow, and Brown. Red refers to the linear switches that are \"Quiet\", while the Brown and Banana variants refer to \"Tactile\" and \"Clicky\" profiles. Your choice of switch depends on how you want your typing experience to feel and sound. Keychron Q14 Max review: The RGB lightingThe keyboard includes 22 types of RGB backlight settings. The lights themselves are bright but unobtrusive, making their use a nice accent to the overall experience. This is compared to some manufacturers' keyboard backlighting that I am convinced is visible from outer space. The Keychron Launcher is a web-based tool that allows you to change everything from keymapping to the internal RGB lights. It also allows you to add your own custom macros. The Launcher requires you to connect the Q14 Max to your computer with the USB-C cable provided, along with a USB-C to USB-A adapter if needed, to customize it. Once your preferences are set, you can return to wireless use. Keychron Q14 Max review: In useThe month of use prior to writing this review was not an easy experience. This is because it uses an Alice layout. The Q14 Max divides the keyboard in half, separates them, and angles them inward as part of the Alice layout. This is different from the typical keyboards most people use, as it is supposed to be more ergonomic. This is not a keyboard style I regularly use. That would be a low-profile 75 percent keyboard, so switching to the Q14 Max was a struggle against muscle memory. This is not the keyboard's fault. It is simply years of traditional layout usage being a hurdle, but one that could be overcome with time and practice. Keychron Q14 Max review: Alice layouts take some relearningThe keyboard is a southpaw configuration, which I found interesting, but it took me a moment to reconcile the full number pad on the left side of the keyboard. This keyboard is not mobile. If you need to slide or move your keyboard easily and often, like I do with my drawing tablet workspace, the Q14 Max is not for you at all. It does not move easily, and as a 96 percent keyboard, it will take up a sizeable portion of your desk workspace. What was lovely about the Q14 Max is the quiet, satisfying \"Thock\" sound the Banana Yellow switches deliver while typing. This is a large, heavy keyboard, but the keys and the feel of the experience are wonderful. The volume adjustment push knob on the Q14 Max is a simple but great quality-of-life feature. I will always sing Keychron's praises for including it on so many of their keyboards. Keychron Q14 Max review: Solid, if this is what you are looking forThe quality of the Q14 Max is amazing, and it is a solid mechanical keyboard if you know what you are investing in. The retail price of the Q14 Max is $249 — not a small or casual investment for a keyboard. Keychron Q14 Max review: The left-side Numpad means you have arrow keys on the far right side. At this retail price, you are making an informed decision, or you are taking a risk on something new. That is something many consumers are simply not able to do financially. I have tested many Keychron mechanical keyboards, and I love the consistent build quality, weight, and potential for customization in their products. Even so, the Alice configuration and size of the Q14 disqualified it from ever being a standard in my workspace. Your mileage may vary. Keychron Q14 Max ProsQuiet tactile keys High build quality Excellent customization options in softwareKeychron Q14 Max ConsSteep entry cost Alice style key layout for those not accustomed to using it Larger workspace footprintLike we've said before, if you hate the Alice layout, this keyboard is not for you. In that case, it's a 2 out of 5, tops. But, if you're looking for the sometimes-spendy ergonomic fit that the Q14 Max provides, this is an excellent keyboard. Rating 4 out of 5Where to buy the Keychron Q14 MaxThe Keychron Q14 Max is available on the Keychron website for $249. A barebone knob version is also available for $229.",
