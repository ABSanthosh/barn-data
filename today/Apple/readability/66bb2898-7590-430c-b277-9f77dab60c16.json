The game first launched on April 21, 2023, for PlayStation, Xbox, and Windows PC via the Epic Games Store. It later arrived on Steam on April 22, 2024. The new Mac version, released on July 24, 2025, is part of Apple's growing effort to bring AAA titles to macOS, including full support for Apple Silicon. Dead Island 2 on Mac is listed as the \"Ultimate Edition\" and is available as a universal app through the Mac App Store. It supports MetalFX upscaling and takes advantage of hardware acceleration on M1, M2, and M3 chips. As with other major Mac game releases, there's no need for a third-party launcher or streaming service. The game includes the base campaign, expansion packs, and additional content in one package. However, cross-play with Windows or console users is not currently supported. Device requirementsDead Island 2 is only available on Macs with Apple Silicon chips. It requires macOS 13.0 or later and is optimized for M1, M2, and M3 systems. The game includes the base campaign, expansion packs, and additional content in one package.The game joins other recent high-profile Mac releases such as Resident Evil Village, No Man's Sky, and Death Stranding. Apple has promoted these titles at recent WWDC events as part of a broader strategy to legitimize macOS as a viable gaming platform. Developers are increasingly porting games to Mac using Apple's Game Porting Toolkit, along with new tools in Xcode and Metal 3. These efforts align with the company's long-term push to unify performance across iPhone, iPad, and Mac using Apple Silicon. Dead Island 2 is available now on the Mac App Store for $69.99. It's also available on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation, and Xbox.",
