  "text": "News Jared Harris and Lou Llobell in Foundation season 3, the latest hit for Apple TV+. Photo: Apple TV+ Foundation season 2 was a huge hit for Apple TV+, the new season 3 started off with strong ratings, and it continues to draw viewers as the seasons progresses. After a two-year wait, fresh episodes of the sci-fi series hit streaming earlier in July, and it’s already one of the most popular shows available. Plus, the Apple TV+ sci-fi action comedy series Murderbot stayed strong even after its freshman season wrapped up. Complex and thrilling Foundation returns to high ratings Foundation tells the story of a band of exiles struggling to save humanity during and after the fall of a Galactic Empire. The Apple TV+ series adapts Isaac Asimov’s groundbreaking novels from the 1940s and 1950s. Bringing seminal novels to the screen is always challenging, but Apple is nailing it. Season 2 earned a 100% critics approval rating from the review-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, while season 3 has an 88% approval rating. And a large audience is tuning in. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services, and Foundation sits at No. 7 for the week of July 14 through July 20. A ratings service says Foundation season 3 is one of the most popular streaming series. Plus, Murderbot did even better last week.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. In the new season, The Mule — a pirate armed with devastating mind-control powers — complicate the Cleonic Dynasty’s slow-motion collapse and the efforts of Hari Seldon’s Foundation to salvage what it can of humanity. The first three episodes of Foundation season 3 are ready to stream now. The next should appear on Friday. Murderbot still slays even as series wraps up Apple TV+ continues having plenty of success with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Murderbot, Apple’s previous foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follows the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. It’s a combination that works, because the series stayed popular its entire run. JustWatch put the series at No. 9 on its chart of most popular streaming series last week (see chart above). And that’s a despite the season finale streaming on July 11. Alexander Skarsgård, who won Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG awards for roles that include Succession, Big Little Lies and True Blood, plays the eponymous lead character. With the finale premiering weeks ago, the entire Murderbot season 1 can be watched now. And fans can look forward to season 2. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming highly rated series like Foundation and Murderbot, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
