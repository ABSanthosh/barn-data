Photo: Apple/Cult of Mac The listings in Apple Maps for restaurants, hotels, golf courses and more got rankings and reviews from expert sources starting on Wednesday. This includes information from Michelin Guide, Golf Digest and others. These join the reviews already in the app that were submitted by regular users, and the ones brought over from Yelp. Expert restaurant and hotel reviews come to Apple Maps Apple Maps tries to be more than navigation software — though it’s very good at that important task. It includes listings for businesses with reviews, star ratings, the hours they’re open, and other information to help consumers decide where they want to go, not simply how to get there. To add depth to the reviews, the application now lets users view and search for Michelin-starred, Green Star and Bib Gourmand restaurants, along with Michelin Key hotels. Soon, rankings and reviews from The Infatuation and Golf Digest will be added to Maps, too. In addition, the place cards Apple Maps now include descriptions and images from expert sources. “Michelin Guide, The Infatuation, and Golf Digest are leading industry experts that consumers rely on for finding the best restaurants, hotels, and golf courses, and we’re excited to bring their valuable insights and accolades to our users in Apple Maps,” said David Dorn, Apple’s senior director of Internet Software and Services Product. The new features start in the United States, and Apple promises that support for additional regions is coming in the future. Reserve a table or tee time through Apple Maps Going beyond additional information, Apple Maps now lets consumers book rooms at select hotels. The option to schedule restaurant reservations through Michelin and tee times through Supreme Golf is coming soon. Apple Maps comes preinstalled on every iPhone. For anyone who deleted it, the software can be downloaded from the App Store. It’s free to use.",
