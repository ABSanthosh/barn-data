  "text": "Cyber Monday MacBook Air deals start at just $799 for 16GB RAM models. Apple retailers Amazon and Best Buy are competing for the best price on Apple's MacBook Air, with both sitting at $799. You can head straight to Amazon and Best Buy to pick up the $799 MacBook Air deal that's valid through Cyber Monday (or while supplies last). This 13-inch M2 model has an 8-core GPU. It's also equipped with 16GB of RAM, the new standard Apple implemented in October across the current Mac lines. You can save on the M3 model as well, with the standard 13-inch 16GB/256GB spec available for as low as $899. The larger 15-inch display, meanwhile, can be snagged for as low as $1,044. If you're interested in the cheapest price possible, the closeout M1 model with only 8GB RAM is marked down to $599 at Walmart. The lowest prices on hundreds of configuration can be found in our Mac Price Guide.
