  "text": "Apple has introduced their annual Holiday advertisement for the 2024 season, titled “Heartstrings”, and it’s an unusually moving commercial that focuses on hearing loss and the hearing aids feature of AirPods Pro 2 (which happen to be hugely discounted on Amazon right now, if you’re in the market). In the touching and family oriented commercial, a small family is gathered around a Christmas tree opening presents, and as the father reminiscences about his daughter growing up over the years, he gets a nudge from his wife to listen to his daughter singing a rendition of “Our House” by Crosby, Stills, and Nash, where he puts in his AirPods and is able to hear her clearly. Grab a tissue, get in the holiday spirit, and watch the commercial on YouTube or below! The description along with the YouTube video is embedded below, emphasizing how hearing loss is often undiagnosed for years: “For so many of us, sound and how we hear shape how we connect to the world around us. Yet, people with hearing loss wait an average of 10 years before getting their hearing tested and fitted for hearing aids. Leaving millions unaware they’re living with hearing loss and without the assistance they need. Now with the world’s first end-to-end hearing health experience, you have access to a Hearing Test that provides scientifically validated results within minutes and the ability to activate a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature on your AirPods Pro 2 — right from home.” The hearing aid functionality is now built directly into AirPods Pro 2 and includes an official hearing test as well, but even other model AirPods have the Live Listen feature that works like a hearing aid too, just unofficially so.",
