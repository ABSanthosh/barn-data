  "text": "A new post from leaker Majin Bu shows off iPhone 17 Pro's camera bar yet again in possible case marketing material. The new photos from Bu show the iPhone 17 Pro in marketing material for an unknown company's cases. The pictures show the elongated and long-rumored \"camera bar\" type design for the back, that places the cameras on the left side, while the flash and LiDAR sensor move to the opposite side. The colors shown in the photos posted by Bu suggest case colors of off-white, light blue, light green, a light purple, and a charcoal gray. In one photo, the camera bar is shown in a dark gray, but most images show the camera bar as white â€” suggesting Apple will keep the color choices for the 17 Pro models themselves the same as the iPhone 16 Pro. This new report comes after several previous claims from rival leaker Sonny Dickson, who offered photos of the supposed cases in March and earlier in April. The new leak from Bu looks much more like typical case promotional photos. In March, Bu showed off a series of metal plates for the iPhone 17 Pro Max that are likely to be used by case makers. This also illustrated the move of the flash and Lidar sensor to the right side of the back of the iPhone. An alleged promotional shot of the iPhone 17 Pro covers â€” image credit: Majin BuOther rumors surrounding the iPhone 17 lineup have included claims of new vapor chamber cooling, as well as claims of a RAM upgrade. Bu has a mixed track record, but does often get details that turn out to be correct. However, Bu also claimed that the iPhone 15 would get two front-facing cameras, which turned out to be false. This rumor is rated likely due to the increasing number of images showing the camera bar in cases from various sources.",
