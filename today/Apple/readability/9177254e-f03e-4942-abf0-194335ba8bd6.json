To mark the day, Apple has announced Global Close Your Rings Day, encouraging Apple Watch users to meet their daily fitness goals. If you have an Apple Watch and close your Activity rings on April 24th, you’ll get a special limited edition award on your watch and animated stickers in Messages. Apple is also giving away a special pin that the company says is inspired by the award, starting April 24, while supplies last. In a press release, Apple’s chief operating officer, Jeff Williams said: Apple Watch has changed the way people think about, monitor, and engage with their fitness and health. A decade ago, we introduced Activity rings — and since then, Apple Watch has grown to offer an extensive set of features designed to empower every user. People write to us almost every day sharing how Apple Watch has made a difference in their life, from motivating them to move more throughout the day, to changing the trajectory of their health. For more on the event and statistics on the benefits customers who close their rings have seen, you can read Apple’s press release here.
