  "text": "Opera released an update on Tuesday for Opera One, the company’s web browser focused on AI tools. With the new version, Opera One makes it easier for users to access Discord, Slack, and Bluesky directly from the sidebar with just a click. Update brings new features to Opera One Previously available in a beta version, these shortcuts are now available to the public with the latest version of Opera One. Integration with Discord, Slack, and Bluesky joins integrations with WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram. Users can choose which platforms they want to enable in the sidebar. Once enabled, the platform can be accessed from the Opera One sidebar. As a result, users can send messages on their favorite platform without leaving the web browser or having to open a dedicated tab. “We’re integrating these three new applications in the sidebar of Opera One so you can have quick and convenient access to them while browsing – reducing the need of several open tabs and apps at the same time,” the company said in a press release. If you already have the latest version of Opera One installed, all you have to do is click on the three-dot button in the sidebar and select which apps you want to use. You can always decide which apps to enable or disable. In addition to the new shortcuts, Opera One also got new themes with the update. Earlier this month, Opera launched another new browser called Opera Air – this one focused on mindfulness features aimed at helping users relax while surfing the web. You can download Opera browsers for free from the company’s website. They’re all compatible with macOS.
