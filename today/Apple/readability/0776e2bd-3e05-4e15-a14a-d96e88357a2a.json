  "text": "News Qi2 25W makes wireless charging up to 70% faster. Image: Wireless Power Consortium Wireless charging just got faster. A new version of the Qi standard brings power transfers up to 25 watts — it’s dubbed Qi2 25W (logically enough). Over a dozen devices already support it, including recent iPhones. And the Wireless Power Consortium once again teased that Android handset makers would adopt the new standard… finally. Qi2 25W improves wireless charging Apple adopted the original Qi wireless charging standard with the iPhone 8, but significantly improved it with MagSafe starting with the iPhone 12. Apple’s enhanced version puts magnets around the wireless charging coil to automatically align the iPhone to compatible accessories. The Wireless Power Consortium originally developed Qi, and liked Apple’s improvement so much that it built it into Qi2. But it only went up to 15W. The WPC on Wednesday took the wraps off Qi v2.2.1 AKA Qi2 25W. “Consumers will be delighted when they experience Qi2 25W as it delivers nearly 70% more power than the original Qi2,” said Fady Mishriki, chair of the WPC’s Board of Directors. Phone and accessory makers get on board “The momentum building behind the next stage in the evolution of the Qi standard is incredible,” Mishriki also said. “The number of devices in the Qi2 25W certification queue for launch is unprecedented, as is the quality and breadth of our members’ product designs.” iPhone 16 models (except the iPhone 16e) already support Qi2 25W. In addition, the WPC said Wednesday that 14 devices, receivers, and transmitters completed Qi2 25W certification testing in a limited launch last week. One of these is the Aukey LC-MC213 Qi2.2 MagFusion 2X 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger ($60.29), a multi-device stand that is available for pre-order now. Or use the updated version of the Apple MagSafe charger released in autumn 2024 for 25W charging. Android and Qi2 25W? As part of the Qi2 25W launch, the WPC promised “major Android smartphones will join the Qi2 ecosystem for the first time with this launch.” That would be a significant turnaround, as the previous version of Qi2 drew little attention from Android makers. For example, Samsung put a hobbled version in the Galaxy S25 but none of its other models. The WPC didn’t name any specific Android makers who are ready to adopt the standard. The lack of Androids with Qi2 support has surely hurt accessory makers, as they’ve had only iPhone users as customers for these products. Perhaps that will finally change.",
