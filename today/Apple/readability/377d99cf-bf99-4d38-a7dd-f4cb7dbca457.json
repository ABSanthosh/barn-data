Photo: Comcast Xfinity customers can enjoy the action of Sunday Night Soccer for no extra charge starting this week. The show brings a weekly, featured Major League Soccer game throughout the season. The same games are also available for Apple TV+ subscribers, as well as those with an MLS Season Pass from Apple. Apple and Comcast team up for free Sunday night MLS soccer games Apple serves as the exclusive source for streaming Major League Soccer in more than 100 countries. Watching all the fun comes with an MLS Season Pass, but Sunday Night Soccer offers just a taste. The show serves up prime time games that Apple promises bring “the league’s most compelling matchups,” along with pregame and postgame shows. Now the weekly games will be free for Xfinity customers, appearing within the channel guide on Xfinity X1 and the Xfinity Stream app throughout the duration of the season. They stream in both English and Spanish. “Adding Sunday Night Soccer for free introduces even more customers to all the excitement of the season and continues our commitment to deliver greater value at no additional cost,” said Vito Forlenza, Comcast’s vice president of sports entertainment. Starts this week MLS Sunday Night Soccer on X1 and Stream launches on May 18, just in time for MLS’s special Rivalry Week double header. At 7 p.m. Eastern, Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF take on Orlando City SC, followed by MLS’s biggest rivalry when LA Galaxy meets LAFC. As mentioned, Apple TV+ subscribers already can watch Sunday Night Soccer. Those for whom one soccer match a week isn’t enough should opt for an MLS Season Pass. This subscription brings every live regular-season match, all MLS Cup playoff matches, and the Leagues Cup — all with no blackouts. The 2025 season schedule shows that the season extends through October 19. Matches are watched in the free Apple TV app, which is available for a wide variety of platforms.
