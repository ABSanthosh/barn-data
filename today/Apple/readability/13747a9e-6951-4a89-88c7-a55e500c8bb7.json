  "text": "Meta on Thursday announced new features coming to Threads, the company’s microblogging platform. Users will now have the option to add specific topics to their profiles, as well as more controls over who can reply or quote a post. Profile topics and more new features coming to Threads As detailed by Meta in a blog post, the platform has been exploring letting users choose topics to add to their profiles. These topics are displayed in the user’s bio and help other people find your profile based on what you like. For example, you can add topics such as design, coffee, and why not, Apple? “Tapping a topic on someone’s profile will lead directly to conversations about it, making it easier to connect with people who share your interests – and easier for those people to find you,” the company explains. While composing a new post, users will also see suggested tags based on Threads’ trending topics. Threads is also adding more controls for users to decide who can interact with their posts. Starting today, you can choose to allow replies and quote-posts only from your followers. Meta also notes that it has softened its policies on political posts. Last but not least, Threads is finally rolling out the new video player in its mobile app to everyone. “Our media player is now more sophisticated, with new pause, play and skip buttons that make videos simpler to watch. We’ve also added a pinned progress bar to the player, so you can move backward and forward in videos more easily.” The Threads app is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you update the app to the latest version in order to get access to the new features.
