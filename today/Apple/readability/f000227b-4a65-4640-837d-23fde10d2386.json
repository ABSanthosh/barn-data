  "text": "Alongside today’s debut of Submerged, the first scripted film captured in Apple Immersive Video, Apple also released a behind-the-scenes look at the film as well as details of immersive content coming to Apple Vision Pro users in the U.S. later this year. The Making of Submerged offers an inside look at the process behind shooting the immersive film. Writer/director Edward Berger and director of photography James Friend break down the unique considerations that went into telling a story in this new format. Apple offered even more insight into the creative process behind Submerged: Shot on location in Prague, Brussels, and Malta over three weeks, Submerged was filmed using a full-scale 23-ton submarine set made with real steel, brass, and metal that was modeled after WWII-era vessels. Significant portions of the set were built to withstand being fully submerged, and featured practical camera traps and special effects that were uniquely rigged to expose Apple Immersive Video cameras to sparks, steam, water, and fire without breaking viewers’ sense of immersion. Cast members who might appear out of frame or focus in a 2D feature were meticulously scripted, and participated in extensive stunt rehearsals, including freedive training in dive tanks and open water, to maintain continuity and realism. It’s both fascinating and inspiring to see the ways the creative team behind Submerged adapted traditional filmmaking techniques to meet the challenges and embrace the opportunities of immersive video. The film itself is now available for Vision Pro owners to stream for free in the TV app in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. Apple has more immersive content on the way for Vision Pro users in the U.S. later this year, too, with global availability to follow. Here’s what fans of immersive video can expect: 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend: an immersive short film featuring footage from the event, including the Slam Dunk contest, the first-ever NBA vs. WNBA 3-Point Challenge, Stephen vs. Sabrina, the Rising Stars game, and highlights from the All-Star Game (available next Friday, October 17) The Weeknd: an immersive music video for a new song from The Weeknd’s upcoming album, Hurry Up Tomorrow (available in November) Adventure: a new episode of the extreme sports series centered on freediver Ant Williams’ attempt to best his record for the longest distance under ice with just a single breath (available in December) Concert for One: a new concert series featuring intimate performances from the world’s biggest artists, starting with British singer-songwriter RAYE (available later this year) The first episode of aerial travel series Elevated, featuring a trip around the islands of Hawai’i, is being made available outside the U.S. today. And early next year, Apple will release another episode of Elevated taking viewers on a crisp autumn journey through Maine’s winding coastlines and beautiful rivers, as well as a new episode of Adventure that follows sport climber Kai Lightner as he free-solo climbs over the rocky coves of Majorca, Spain. All of these immersive video releases sound exciting, and I look forward to experiencing them. With lack of content being a primary concern among Vision Pro owners, it’s good to see new releases scheduled at a regular pace to keep users engaged. Based on today’s announcements, we have lots of immersive content to look forward to in the coming months.
