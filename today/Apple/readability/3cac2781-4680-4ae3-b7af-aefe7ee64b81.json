  "description": "Macworld Every year, as Apple’s WWDC approaches, speculation about what new products may arrive alongside all the big software announcements. While sources claim that Apple has been working on a new interface for iOS, macOS, and other operating systems, we haven’t heard much about new hardware coming at WWDC. There are rumors about products in the works—most notably new Macs and the “HomePad” smart home hub—but the reality is, if you’re expecting to see new hardware at WWDC 2025, you’re likely to be disappointed. WWDC is a software event Historically, WWDC is an event focused almost entirely on software. After all, it’s a conference for developers. Every year, Apple not only reveals its plans for the future of its operating systems at the event, but also gives developers early access to new APIs and frameworks. This enables them to start optimizing their apps for the new platforms months ahead of public releases. While there have been occasional hardware announcements, such as the original HomePod, the transition to Apple silicon in 2020, and the first look at the Apple Vision Pro in 2023, those moments were tightly linked to developer needs. This year, rumors suggest that Apple has been working on new hardware products that could be a good fit for WWDC, but it doesn’t look like they’ll be ready in time for this year’s event. Here’s why. HomePad: Delayed In an effort to take HomeKit to the next level, Apple has been working on a smart home hub with a built-in screen for several years. The idea is to let users easily control their HomeKit accessories, such as lamps, heaters, and robot vacuum cleaners, even when their phone isn’t around. While the actual name of the device is unclear, reports claim it will combine aspects of the HomePod and iPad in a single product focused on the smart home, so it’s been dubbed HomePad. Apple is reportedly making a new smart home hub that combines an iPad with a HomePod, but it’s likely not shipping for a while.Foundry Along with the smart home capabilities, HomePad will reportedly also function as an Apple TV-like entertainment device so users can stream video and music, or make FaceTime calls from its built-in camera. Essentially, it will be a home companion device that is either mounted to a wall or sits in a dock. While the HomePad was once expected to launch in the spring, recent reports claim the project is delayed, possibly until 2026. The main reason is due to a deep integration with Apple Intelligence and the new Siri experience, which have been beset with issues. It’s possible that Apple gives a sneak peek of HomePad at WWDC, as it did with HomePod and Vision Pro, but most reports say Apple is focused on fixing Siri first. M5 Macs and iPads: Not yet WWDC has been a hot spot for new Macs in recent years, with Apple Silicon, the redesigned M2 MacBook Air, and the M2 Ultra chip all making their debuts at WWDC. As such, there has been speculation about whether Apple will announce any new Mac hardware at WWDC. With the exception of the Mac Pro, which hasn’t seen any updates since 2022, Apple has already completed the transition of the entire Mac lineup to the M4 chip, introduced last year with the iPad Pro. In theory, this could mean that Apple will move onto the next generation of chips at WWDC, but don’t count on it. Apple typically unveils the first new Macs with the next generation of chips in the fall, around October and November. And according to multiple sources in the industry, this will be the case once again this year. A new iPad Pro with the M5 chip and M5 MacBook Pro are said to be on track for the second half of 2025. It’s possible that Apple unveils a new high-end chip for the aging Mac Pro, but most reports claim that Apple will keep the current model around until the M5 Ultra arrives. Could the M5 debut at WWDC? It’s not likely.Foundry iPhone 17: Coming in September Although in the past Apple has introduced new iPhone models at WWDC, it’s been more than a decade since an iPhone model debuted at the event. Besides, the iPhone 16e only just arrived in March, and the iPhone 17 lineup will arrive in September. One of the main reasons is that the new iPhone always ships with the new version of iOS announced at WWDC, so Apple needs time to test and refine the new software before launching the new phone. So if you’re planning to buy an iPhone 17, you’ll have to wait until September at least. Apple Vision Pro 2: Maybe next year The first Apple Vision Pro is decidedly a developer device. It was announced at WWDC 2023 but didn’t ship until 2024, mainly so developers had time to build new apps for the headset. And with a $3,499 price tag, it’s still basically a developer kit.  The current Vision Pro is powered by the M2 chip, which some consumers may consider outdated for a product that costs $3,500. Although Apple is rumored to be working on an updated Vision Pro with an M5 chip inside, this model is unlikely to arrive before next year. According to a report from The Information, Apple has reportedly set aside the Vision Pro 2 project to work on a more affordable version of its mixed reality headset, but that model isn’t expected to ship for a while either. So while we’ll get a look at the new visionOS software, the same hardware is likely sticking around for at least another year. WWDC will likely be very software-centric this year.Foundry What to expect instead at WWDC 2025? Once again, this WWDC will be all about software and services, so expect major updates across all Apple platforms. From iOS 19 to macOS 16 (or possibly iOS 26 and macOS 26), Apple’s operating systems will be updated with a new, more modern interface. Sources believe that the new design language will be similar to what Apple introduced with visionOS, which has more depth and shadows rather than a completely flat interface. Apple is also rumored to be working on new features to make iPadOS more similar to macOS, as well as further improving Apple Intelligence and the Siri experience. So there will be plenty to get excited about at WWDC 2025, but it almost certainly won’t involve any new devices. WWDC 2025 kicks off on June 9 with an opening keynote. Be sure to follow Macworld’s full coverage of the event.",

So while we’ll get a look at the new visionOS software, the same hardware is likely sticking around for at least another year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Steve Jobs Theater WWDC24\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=300%2C200\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=768%2C512\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=1200%2C800\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=1240%2C826\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-steve-jobs-theater.jpg?resize=150%2C100\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eWWDC will likely be very software-centric this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFoundry\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-expect-instead-at-wwdc-2025\"\u003eWhat to expect instead at WWDC 2025?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, this WWDC will be all about software and services, so expect major updates across all Apple platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html\"\u003eiOS 19\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html\"\u003emacOS 16\u003c/a\u003e (or \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2796806/report-apples-wwdc-os-design-overhaul-will-bring-new-branding-too.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2796806/report-apples-wwdc-os-design-overhaul-will-bring-new-branding-too.html\"\u003epossibly iOS 26 and macOS 26\u003c/a\u003e), Apple’s operating systems will be updated with a new, more modern interface.
