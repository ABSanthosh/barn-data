  "text": "Apple fans visiting the company’s iconic Fifth Avenue store in New York were treated to an unexpected moment this week: following a panel on Apple TV+ hit series Severance, Apple CEO Tim Cook and actor Brad Pitt took the stage to promote the upcoming Apple Original Film F1 The Movie. Their appearance followed an earlier panel at the store, with cast members from Severance joined a conversation moderated by Entertainment Tonight’s Nischelle Turner. Actors Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Dichen Lachman and Jen Tullock discussed the show’s second season, which recently finished its run after a long hiatus following its Emmy-winning debut. Back to F1 Pitt, who stars in the racing drama officially hitting theaters and IMAX screens on June 27, greeted the audience alongside Cook and called F1 The Movie the “most visceral racing film ever made.” Cook, meanwhile, took the opportunity to highlight the role of iPhone camera technology in capturing the film’s high-speed, in-car footage. The visit wrapped up with a showing of the film’s latest trailer, giving attendees a glimpse of the action-heavy, IMAX-focused cinematography that Apple and Warner Bros. are banking on to draw audiences. F1 The Movie, directed by Joseph Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick), and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Remember The Titans) and Lewis Hamilton, follows Brad Pitt as a veteran Formula 1 driver making a dramatic return to the sport. The film was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends to lend extra authenticity to the on-track scenes. As for Severance, both seasons are now streaming on Apple TV+, with the series continuing to build on its critical acclaim and growing fanbase. Two spinoff series are in discussion, while Season 3 is also underway. Apple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Studio, The Morning Show, Shrinking and Silo.
