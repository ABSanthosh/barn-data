  "text": "Apple has released a new entry level model iPhone, dubbed iPhone 16e. The iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone SE in the lineup, and introduces a modernized design along with some nice updated features for a low-end model, along with a higher price tag. iPhone 16e includes a 6.1″ OLED display with PWM (replacing the 4.7″ flicker-free LCD display on iPhone SE). The new device includes Face ID with a notch at the top of the display, doing away with the Home button and Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The new iPhone 16e also has a USB-C port for charging, meaning you’ll need to replace any Lightning cables. Inside, the iPhone 16e is powered by a speedy and energy efficient A18 chip, with support for Apple Intelligence. iPhone 16e comes standard with 128GB of storage, along with a single 48 megapixel rear camera, and a 12 megapixel front camera for selfies and FaceTime. You can get iPhone 16e in black or white color options, and with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities. Pricing starts at $599 for the base model iPhone 16e. If you’re in the market for a new iPhone, the iPhone 16e with its intriguing set of features might appeal to you at the $599 price point. Another option is to buy a used or refurbished older model iPhone, like a refurbished iPhone 14 Pro, which won’t support Apple Intelligence but does still use a Lightning charger and have a telephoto lens camera (this is what I personally did when the iPhone 15 came out, since I have a half dozen Lightning cables and didn’t want to make the switch to USB-C yet I simply bought a refurb’d iPhone 14 Pro), or even a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro which will support Apple Intelligence and does have a USB-C port for charging. There are also various refurbished iPhone 16 Pro models available, but at less of a discount. You can learn more about the new iPhone 16e and order one now at apple.com.",
