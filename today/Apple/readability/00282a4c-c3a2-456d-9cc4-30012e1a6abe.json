Apple on Wednesday held the last day of its super week of Mac announcements, this time with the launch of a new generation MacBook Pro with an M4 chip.

For completeness, you can still buy a new Mac with 8GB of RAM: the Walmart-exclusive M1 MacBook Air which, nevertheless, still supports Apple Intelligence. Not that I would have expected Apple’s volume sales discount Mac to get this bump but, still, it is not yet the end of an era.",
