  "description": "Macworld Even with everything USB-C, keeping all your gear charged and ready can be tiring if you have to plug in cables left and right. This Anker MagSafe 3-in-1 cube will solve that problem for you, and you can get one for $104 instead of its usual $150, within pennies of its all-time-low price. Not only will this charger stand handle your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, but it will also take very little space on your desk. The very top part of the cube is a magnetic charger for your phone. It flips open so you can also check out your notifications while it’s charging. In the space behind the magnetic charger, you can place your AirPods with a wireless charging case. A little drawer pops open on the side of the cube, allowing you to place your Apple Watch over it to charge, which is super handy. Given how little space all this occupies, this Anker MagSafe cube is perfect for traveling, too! Oh, and you won’t have to worry about any cables or wall chargers because a 30W USB-C wall charger is included in the package. Frankly, there’s no reason not to get this Anker Magsafe charging cube for $104 as this is one of the best prices we’ve seen for it. Buy now at Amazon",
