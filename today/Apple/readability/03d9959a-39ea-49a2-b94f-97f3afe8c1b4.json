Almost every rumor surrounding iOS 26 has focused on the possible redesign that'll bring it closer to visionOS. Few feature updates leak out, if ever, but a last-minute rumor reveals five possible changes coming in iOS 26. According to reliable, anonymous sources speaking to 9to5Mac, there are a few app-specific features we can expect on June 9. These features could offer some nice quality-of-life upgrades that users will immediately notice. First, Messages is rumored to get a new live translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. When a text arrives in a language other than the one the user has set for the system, a translation will be automatically provided. Apple could also be bringing polls to Messages â€” a feature available in rival messaging apps and iMessage apps. It could also use contextual data and AI to help users generate polls on the fly. Apple's Music app could get an update that brings full-screen animated album artwork to the Lock Screen. Currently, album art is shown in a square on the Lock Screen and doesn't animate. Expect this feature to basically turn the Lock Screen into the Apple Music Now Playing screen. Select albums have full-screen animating artwork in this view. Apple Notes is possibly getting a long-requested nerdy feature â€” the ability to export notes in Markdown. It's something power users look for and it's available in competing apps. Finally, the rumor suggests CarPlay will also have a UI change to reflect the wider ecosystem visionOS-like redesign. This one feels obvious, but it hadn't been mentioned in rumors before. There are only a few days left before Apple reveals everything during WWDC 2025. Everything from iOS 26 to new Apple Intelligence features is expected.",
