By supporting numerous file formats, it’s the perfect solution to bring your work together in one powerful hub. What sets DEVONthink apart is its many information retrieval features. The app learns from the way you use it, so it can automatically classify and tag your documents. Plus, with advanced Boolean operators and smart groups of saved searches, it’s simple to create refined searches that you can return to whenever you need them. DEVONthink has lightning-fast search, too. It uses advanced AI to go beyond simple keyword searches, finding the most relevant documents instantly. The app is also the perfect companion for web-based research. You can automatically pull from RSS feeds, save webpages in a variety of formats, including Markdown, and then highlight, comment, and take notes. The app can even suggest connections between documents and provide contextual recommendations using its integrated AI. With OCR technology built in, DEVONthink is also perfect for going paperless. Just scan in your documents, and DEVONthink takes care of making them text-searchable. Everything in your DEVONthink database can sync between multiple Macs, as well as iPhones and iPads. The app also uses industry-grade encryption to secure your documents and offers easy export of documents in multiple formats. There’s never been a better time to bring order to your information. DEVONtechnologies is offering 10% off on all versions of DEVONthink to MacStories readers for a limited time.
