Following the launch of an iPhone generation, analysts check out the state of the supply chain to see if there are any signs of lessened demand. In the case of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, that doesn't seem to be the case. According to TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in a Wednesday X post, the assembly orders in the supply chain \"remain unchanged\" for the moment.

Continuing manufacturing of specific models during a typical holiday is a big sign of continued demand. Kuo says demand for the Pro models \"has generally met expectations so far.\" iPhone 16 shipment updates1. Assembly orders almost remain unchanged. Suppliers had been asked to continue producing two Pro models during China's National Day holiday, indicating that demand for the Pro models has generally met expectations so far. 2. Some component orders— (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) October 9, 2024 Despite demand, there has been a slight curtailing of some component orders from mid-November. However, the reduction is \"essentially negligible\" to Kuo, being between 3% and 5%. Those cuts are also being applied primarily to the base and Plus models of iPhone 16. Demand for those models are said to be \"lackluster\" compared to the 2023 releases. As for the Pro models, shipments are similar to the iPhone 15 Pro line at this point after launch. Kuo adds that the current shipping times for Pro models are actually shorter than the iPhone 15 Pro versions. Kuo's focus on the supply chain will be how U.S. market demand and shipments change in late October, coinciding with the release of Apple Intelligence.",
