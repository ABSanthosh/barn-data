Pre-orders begin Friday, September 13, with availability beginning Friday, September 20. “iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus mark the beginning of a new era for iPhone with Apple Intelligence delivering powerful, personal, and private experiences to our users,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “With new ways to discover the world around you and capture memories using Camera Control; a 48MP Fusion camera that gives you two optical-quality cameras in one; a big boost in battery life; and powerful, efficient performance thanks to the A18 chip, this is the perfect time for customers to upgrade or make the switch to iPhone.” iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be available in five bold colors: black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine. Built for Apple Intelligence Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16 lineup harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Apple Intelligence maintains the privacy and security of user data with Private Cloud Compute. This groundbreaking approach provides the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers — an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update, with the first set of features rolling out next month in U.S. English for most regions around the world. Apple Intelligence combines the power of Apple-built generative models with personal context while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy. Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing. With systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. In the Notes and Phone apps, users can also record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to recall key points. With systemwide Writing Tools, available with the first set of Apple Intelligence features, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write. Apple Intelligence helps users prioritize with summarized notifications, along with Priority Messages in Mail, a feature that understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user’s inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of previewing the first few lines. Available with the first set of Apple Intelligence features, Priority Notifications in Apple Intelligence elevate what’s most important, and summaries help users scan stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen. Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri follows along when users stumble over their words, and maintains context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and switch fluidly between text and voice as they accelerate everyday tasks. Siri also now has extensive product knowledge to answer thousands of questions about features on iPhone and other Apple devices. Coming with the first set of Apple Intelligence features, Siri becomes more natural, contextually relevant, and personal, with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. Additional Apple Intelligence features will roll out later this year and in the months following, including Image Playground, which allows users to create playful images in moments. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be able to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users’ content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. And while using iOS 18 features like Siri and Writing Tools, users will also be able to easily access ChatGPT from OpenAI. Users will be able to create an original Genmoji to express themselves — taking emoji to an entirely new level. A Beautiful New Design with Industry-Leading Durability iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are beautiful and built to last. iPhone holds its value longer than any other smartphone thanks to its industry-leading durability, including the strong back glass, a water- and dust-resistant design, regular software updates, and the latest-generation Ceramic Shield with an advanced formulation that is 50 percent tougher than the first generation and 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone.1 The internal design of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus has been reengineered to allow for an even larger battery and to better dissipate heat, while making battery service easier. With the new internal design and advanced power management of iOS 18, the batteries are optimized to offer a big boost in battery life. Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, the Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology and the Dynamic Island offers an exceptional viewing experience.2 The latest-generation Ceramic Shield has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The Action button comes to iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Users can quickly open the camera, flashlight, or controls; switch between Ring and Silent; recognize music with Shazam; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can also access in-app functionality, like helping a user unlock and lock their car with FordPass.3 The Action button allows users to quickly access useful features. By default, it switches between Ring and Silent, or users can choose from a wide set of actions for even more convenience and versatility. Introducing Camera Control Camera Control — a result of thoughtful hardware and software integration — elevates the camera experience on the iPhone 16 lineup. It is packed with innovation, including a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. Camera Control can quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording so users don’t miss the moment. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options — such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field — to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Snapchat. A user captures a photo of a person holding a ball with iPhone 16. A user adjusts settings while capturing a portrait with iPhone 16. A user captures video of a splash in a lake with iPhone 16. Camera Control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click. Camera Control is easy to use in portrait or landscape, and users can adjust various settings simply by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. One click launches the camera, another takes a photo, and a click-and-hold starts video recording so users don’t miss the moment. Later this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. Camera Control will also serve as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search on Google to find where they can buy an item, or to benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared. Camera Control will enable visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places around them faster than ever before. New Camera Experiences The powerful new camera system helps users capture both everyday moments and cherished memories like never before. The 48MP Fusion camera enables a 2x optical-quality Telephoto option, which is like having two cameras in one, so users can get closer to the subject to easily frame a photo. In addition to wider-angle shots, the new 12MP Ultra Wide camera with autofocus enables macro photography. The Ultra Wide camera also gathers up to 2.6x more light for higher image quality. Additionally, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now take spatial photos and videos to help users relive memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro. A closeup image of a frog. An image of a person leaning on a colorful pink-and-purple building. A selfie is shown with a grassy landscape leading to the sea. A person poses against a billiards table in a low-light room. A headshot shows a person with foliage in the background. The same headshot shown in the previous image — with a person and foliage in the background — is now zoomed in. A portrait of a person with their head resting on their hand. The new 12MP Ultra Wide camera, now with autofocus, enables macro photography to capture a subject up close in stunning detail. The new 12MP Ultra Wide camera helps users capture unique perspectives. Selfies with the Ultra Wide camera help users get creative with their framing.

Leveraging the tight integration of hardware and software, the 48MP Fusion camera enables a 2x optical-quality Telephoto option. The 48MP Fusion camera helps users capture stunning photos and videos in sharp detail. Next-generation Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customize their photos by locally adjusting color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style. A wider set of styles offers more creative options for editing a photo’s aesthetic, and styles can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later. iPhone 16 shows a Photographic Styles screen with four options and the prompt to “Choose Style.” iPhone 16 shows a Photographic Styles screen with a photo of a person and a gold style selected. Styles can be further personalized with an easy-to-use new control pad and intensity dial for simultaneous adjustments across tone and color. The latest generation of Photographic Styles lets users express their creativity like never before and simultaneously adjust tone and color throughout the image. Photographic Styles have a deeper understanding of skin undertones so users can personalize how they appear in photos, and there are more creative styles, called Moods, to change the overall aesthetic of the photo. Styles can be further personalized with an easy-to-use new control pad and intensity slider for simultaneous adjustments across tone and color. Video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. Both iPhone models introduce creative new ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix — allowing users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality. The iPhone 16 lineup introduces wind noise reduction, which uses powerful machine learning algorithms to reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality. Powered by Apple Intelligence, users can search for specific photos in the Photos app using natural language, and search for specific moments in video clips. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject. Available with the first set of Apple Intelligence features, the Clean Up tool in Photos can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject. A18: Next-Level Performance and Mobile Gaming A18 delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency, and is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology to further accelerate Apple Intelligence. An upgraded 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs ML models up to 2x faster than the A16 Bionic chip. The 6-core CPU is 30 percent faster than the A16 Bionic chip and faster than all the competition. It is also more power efficient and can run the same workload with 30 percent less power than A16 Bionic. The 5-core GPU is up to 40 percent faster and 35 percent more efficient than A16 Bionic to power stunning graphics performance for Apple Intelligence, and puts a powerful gaming device in users’ pockets. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, games on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus more accurately represent the behavior of light with up to 5x higher frame rates than with software-based ray tracing. Both models support the AAA games previously only available on iPhone 15 Pro, as well as new titles like Honor of Kings: World with an ultra graphics mode optimized for the iPhone 16 lineup, coming next year. Game Mode in iOS 18 delivers more consistent frame rates while making AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories incredibly responsive. The efficiency of A18 and the device’s rearchitected internal design deliver up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming while ensuring Apple Intelligence runs efficiently on iPhone.

It is packed with innovation, including a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. Camera Control can quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording so users don’t miss the moment. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options — such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field — to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Snapchat.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"camera-control\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-e250bc1f3ba3fc5d80c308dd7c413a9b\" href=\"#gallery-e250bc1f3ba3fc5d80c308dd7c413a9b\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-e250bc1f3ba3fc5d80c308dd7c413a9b\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA user captures a photo of a person holding a ball with iPhone 16.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-af2d2da92dda6b6b504073b1f81fca11\" href=\"#gallery-af2d2da92dda6b6b504073b1f81fca11\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-af2d2da92dda6b6b504073b1f81fca11\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA user adjusts settings while capturing a portrait with iPhone 16.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-fb7854bc02996e3e45ab447a1427d698\" href=\"#gallery-fb7854bc02996e3e45ab447a1427d698\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-fb7854bc02996e3e45ab447a1427d698\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA user captures video of a splash in a lake with iPhone 16.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-e250bc1f3ba3fc5d80c308dd7c413a9b\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-e250bc1f3ba3fc5d80c308dd7c413a9b\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:easy-camera-access\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eCamera Control provides instant, easy access to the camera with just a click.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2024/09/apple-introduces-iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus/article/Apple-iPhone-16-Camera-Control-01-240909.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -

Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style.
