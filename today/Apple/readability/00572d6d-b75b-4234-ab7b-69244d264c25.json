  "text": "Apple’s new M4 MacBook Air is currently down to just $849, and I’ve made no secret of the fact that I’m a big fan of the device. If you’ve recently purchased an M4 Air, here are my recommendations for the best accessories to accompany your new laptop—and most won’t break the bank. On the go M4 MacBook Air protection One of the Air’s best features—it’s right in the name—is how lightweight and portable it is. When carrying it on the go, I have three recommendations for protective cases. tomtoc’s MacBook sleeve is water-resistant, durable, and offers solid protection. You can get it in black, gray, or navy blue fabrics. What’s especially nice about tomtoc’s option is that it comes with a bonus accessory pouch to match the sleeve, all at a solid price. The company also offers a beefier protective case with additional pockets for more storage and a nice carrying handle. If you want to go a different direction, this leather MacBook sleeve is my recommendation. It gets you the more premium feel of leather while also offering some handy additional features. Desk use at home or in the office Wherever your main desk setup resides, whether at home or away, here are some desk accessories that will make your MacBook Air fit right in. HumanCentric’s vertical stand laptop holder is a great way to prop up your MacBook Air when it’s not in use, freeing up desk real estate and helping set a minimalist feel. This wood variant of the vertical stand is another great option that could fit better into your existing desk aesthetic. If for ergonomic or multi-display reasons you need to prop up your MacBook Air, Twelve South’s aluminum laptop stand will raise it to eye level while offering a sleek, minimalist look. Finally, this applies to basically any Apple product, but AirPods Pro 2 are my go-to accessory for whatever device I’m using. They’re currently discounted to just $169 on Amazon and I can hardly imagine using the MacBook Air or any other Apple product without them. Fast charging and extra ports The M4 MacBook Air offers support for fast charging, but you’ll first need a bigger charging brick than what comes with the machine. Anker’s 100W USB-C power brick is far more affordable than Apple’s first-party options and provides performance that’s just as reliable. Longer charging cables can give you more flexibility in a variety of different environments. There are plenty of great options, but I like this 10ft USB-C cable from Baseus as a low-cost way to get extra charging reach. The MacBook Air only comes with two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports plus MagSafe. For more versatility, I recommend Anker’s USB-C 8-in-1 hub with Ethernet, HDMI, SD, and more. It’s small enough to be easy to throw in a bag for travel, but powerful enough to be your full-time desk USB-C dock too. What are your go-to accessories for the M4 MacBook Air?
