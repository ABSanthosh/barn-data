  "text": "Apple on Tuesday officially launched Apple Pay, its payment platform, for users in Paraguay. The news was confirmed by Mastercard on its website, which also reveals that customers of the main banks in Paraguay can now use Apple Pay. Apple Pay now available in Paraguay In a blog post, Mastercard praised the technology built by Apple and confirmed that cards issued by Banco Continental, Itaú and Ueno Bank can now be added to Apple’s Wallet app. “We are delighted to work with our issuers to bring the ease, security and privacy of Apple Pay to consumers in Paraguay. This launch reinforces Mastercard’s commitment to providing innovative solutions for people to choose how they want to pay,” said Federico Cofman, Mastercard Leader for Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Paraguay joins the list of other countries in South America where Apple Pay is available, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Colombia. With Apple Pay, iPhone and Apple Watch users can pay in stores using their devices by holding them near the credit and debit card reader. Apple Pay also works online for apps and website. In this case, the feature is also available for iPad and Mac users. Apple Pay is now available in more than 80 countries around the world. On a related note, Apple last week also expanded the availability of Tap to Pay on iPhone to more countries, including Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Romania, and Sweden. With the platform, users can turn their iPhone into a sales terminal to accept contactless payments. Via: MacMagazine.
