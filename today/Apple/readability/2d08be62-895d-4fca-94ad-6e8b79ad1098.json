  "text": "A new regulatory filing shows Ikea is planning a temperature and humidity sensor that will use Matter-over-Thread, meaning HomeKit users won't be required to also buy an Ikea hub. After slow and delayed moves to support the Matter standard for smart homes, Ikea's as-yet unannounced temperature and humidity sensor called Timmerflotte, will support the Matter-over-Thread connectivity standard. Details of the device have been revealed in an FCC regulatory filing. Up until now, the company's smart home products have largely relied on Wi-Fi or the Zigbee protocol to communicate with its own hubs, though it has released sensors that work with HomeKit since 2018. The new Timmerflotte sensor shouldn't require an Ikea hub, and is expected to work with any Matter-compatible smart home hubs. According to HomeKit News, though, Ikea plans to use Matter-over-Thread in the new sensor to communicate with its own Dirigera hub. This hub was updated to support Matter as of September 11, 2024, and the hub has included a Thread-supporting radio. Ikea's forthcoming, Matter-over-Thread supporting Timmerflotte sensor — image credit: FCC/IkeaThe new sensor would also work with existing Apple or third-party Matter Controller devices, removing the need for an Ikea hub in homes that are using other Matter-over-Thread hubs. The Timmerflotte runs off two AA batteries, and appears to be about the size of a typical smoke alarm. The new device is expected to receive FCC approval, but there are no details about when the Timmerflotte could arrive in stores.",
