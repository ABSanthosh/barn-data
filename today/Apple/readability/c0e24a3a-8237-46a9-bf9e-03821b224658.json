  "text": "According to a new rumor, Apple Vision Pro will finally get Apple Intelligence in an upcoming update alongside a new spatial media app. Apple Vision Pro launched in February 2024, and very little native content or apps have been released in the year since. Apple Intelligence was revealed later in 2024, but it hasn't come to the headset, but that may change soon. Bloomberg has said that Apple will bring Apple Intelligence features, such as including Genmoji, writing tools, and Image Playground, to the $3,500 headset, expanding the technology beyond recent Mac, iPad, and iPhone models. If true, it would help flesh out the feature set of the Apple Vision Pro. In addition, the report mentions the possibility of a new app for delivering more spatial content to the Apple Vision Pro. This could potentially take the form of a specialized store or collection of available spatial videos and apps from Apple and other companies. Third-party apps already exist that curate user-uploaded content or host libraries of 3D and VR videos for Apple Vision Pro users. It isn't clear if this app would try to replace these use cases or work as another source. This news is likely what was shared during rumored briefings Apple apparently held on Friday. While those briefings were behind closed doors, the information has likely been leaked, which resulted in this report. Apple Vision Pro is still in its early days as a platform. It needs more content and more developer support if it is going to thrive as anything beyond an expensive curiosity, and Apple Intelligence may help with that.",
