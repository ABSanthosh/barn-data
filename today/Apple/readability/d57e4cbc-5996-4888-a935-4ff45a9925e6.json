A trailer for the Netflix crime drama \"iHostage\" on YouTube teases the upcoming release of the film on the streaming service. While Netflix often releases films and shows based on real events, \"iHostage\" is unusual as it's set in an Apple Store. The film is inspired by the real-life hostage situation that occurred in February 2022. A man walked into an Apple Store and took a hostage at gunpoint, resulting in a tense standoff between the man and police. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeLater reports claimed the attacker wanted $230 million in cryptocurrency. In the ensuing hours, the perpetrator fired shots at police, and there were reports he was also carrying explosives, which were later found to be not armed. The standoff ended when the hostage took an opportunity to escape, running away on foot. The hostage taker attempted to run after him, but was run over by a police vehicle, and later died in hospital. Police said approximately 70 people were rescued from the Apple Store, including four who hid in a closet. The Netflix adaptation takes a number of perspectives, including from the perpetrator, the hostages, and the emergency services. In the film, much like the real-life event, a Bulgarian man is caught up by the armed assailant. The film is directed by Bobby Boermans, written by Simon de Waal, and produced by Horizon Film. It will be available globally on Netflix on April 18.",
