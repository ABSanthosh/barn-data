  "text": "Apple has debuted iPadOS 26 today, complete with some notable new features and changes to the iPad operating system. First to notice is the new numerical versioning system, with iPadOS 26 jumping many version numbers ahead of the current iPadOS 18 version, following a numerical system much like Microsoft used to use for Windows (remember Windows 95, Windows 98, ME (Millenium Edition), Windows 2000, etc?). This is in line with versioning changes to the entire Apple operating system suite as well, including iOS 26, MacOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26. Like the rest of the Apple operating system lineup, iPadOS 26 gets an obvious visual refresh into the Liquid Glass look, with more translucency and transparency, and shinier icons and interface elements. You’ll also find the iPad has new multitasking features, including improvements to multitasking with easier windowing of apps, and a new menu bar system that is app-specific and that seems to rely on the fancier optional iPad Magic Keyboard with trackpad accessories. There’s also a new Background Tasks feature that keeps you updated on background processes, like video exports. Files app on iPadOS 26 has some improvements, including the ability to drag and drop files into the Dock for easier access. Much like macOS Tahoe and iOS 26, you’ll find that iPadOS 26 has the inclusion of the Phone app just in case you want to make phone calls from your iPad, and an updated Messages app interface that makes it look like WhatsApp or FaceBook Messenger with custom backgrounds and poll options for group chats. The iPad also gains the Preview app, along with the Journal app, and a new Games app, with iPadOS 26. iPadOS 26 launches as a beta for developers today, with a public beta arriving next month, and the final version will launch this fall.",
