Top reviews from the United States 5.0 out of 5 starsVerified Purchase AirPods Pro 2: Subtle Upgrades, Major Impact for Everyday Users Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024 I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years—standard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge,... See more I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years—standard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. Here’s what I’ve noticed after using them.The biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it's in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2’s ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There’s also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn’t in the first version. It’s made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.In terms of sound, I wouldn’t say it’s a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you’re really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.One of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I’m getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable—no more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.Something I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I’m happy to report that it’s still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful—something the previous model didn’t offer, which was a frustrating limitation.AppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they’ve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don’t have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you're covered from day one.For me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot—whether I’m listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you’re like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you’re not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that’s likely coming soon.In conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it's definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.712 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

See more Dear Apple,You made a great pair of headphones. The clarity is superb, the noise cancellation can be used for any task (that requires some ear protection like shooting at a gun range, for example), the fact you can nod your head to answer a call or shake your head to reject a call, the battery life, the fit, everything is so nicely made. My favorite feature is the head movement to answer or deny a call. I am not sure how they achieved this but I am very happy with it to be honest. I thought it was a gimmick and it would never work but it works perfectly on my 16Pro. I came from a set of Beats earbuds and they didn’t have this feature and they’re made by Apple as well. I think I will get one for my dad because he’s always wanted one. This is by far the best earbuds for the price. Thanks again Apple!10 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

See more First, please comment if you have any questions and I would love to respond to help!I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It’s stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I’m heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it’s so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!1,115 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

I use the hearing aid functionality Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2024 A couple months ago I got “commercial” hearing aids from the VA.

However, I didn’t like how they operated so I gave them back, and they’re going to order a different brand/model, which I’ll have in about three months (!) So I went in search of quality, inexpensive hearing aids to fill the gap. (My hearing loss is considered mild, at -32db on one side and -39db on the other.) I got the AirPods last Friday, and the software for hearing aid support rolled out last night (iOS 18.1) So this will be a two part review.Part one is the overall operation as earbuds for music and calls. These are my first ever Apple branded sound devices. Once I got the correct tips installed and the buds fitted, I was ready to go. OMG! The sound quality overall is the best of any earbuds I’ve ever owned, and by a huge margin. Astonishing bass, and crisp high range. (My hearing loss is in the upper ranges.) I’m beyond happy. Overall, the only thing I’m dissatisfied with is the battery life at 5-6 hours, but the extremely fast recharge speed eases that compliant. Voice quality when on a call is crystal clear. Controls are easy, though a bit hard to operate considering how small they are.Part two is the hearing aid function. The first thing I had to do was take a hearing test with the included software. (However, if you prefer to use a third party hearing test, you can import that profile and use it.) The hearing test takes about 5 minutes, after which the hearing aid sound enhancement profile is set automatically and they start up. I was totally gobsmacked at how well these things work! They boost the exact freqs I need. They actually work considerably better than those $7000 (egads!) hearing aids that I returned.Now for the ANC. At home, I sit right in front of a large, noisy window air conditioner. On the opposite side of the room is a dehumidifier (I live in south central Texas, where it was 91° yesterday.) Between these two pieces of equipment, it’s pretty noisy here. I turned on ANC and the room went absolutely silent. So silent that I thought I’d popped a circuit breaker and everything had stopped running. I removed one of the AirPods, and the noise returned. Amazing.In short, everything I’d hoped the commercial hearing aids would do, the AirPods actually DID. I consider this the smartest purchase I’ve made in years. Only one negative, and that’s the ear tips. None of the provided sizes are a good fit for me, so I’m now looking to memory foam replacements. But that’s a very small gripe. If you’re looking at these, either for music or hearing, don’t hesitate. You’ll be glad you got them.EDIT: I had to go to a doctor appointment across town today. Part of the route is on a toll highway with an 80 mph speed limit and heavy traffic. I got up to speed and turned on noise cancel mode. INSTANTLY the car was completely silent at 80 mph. No road rumble, no engine noise, no wind noise, no traffic noise. It was an amazing and invigorating experience. Oh, for those wondering about recharge time, if you take them all the way down to 0% battery and they shut down (I’ve now ascertained that 6 hours is about what you get with all the options turned on), it only takes about 15 minutes in the charge case and you’ll easily get another 3-4 hours out of them.EDIT2: Okay, I’ve had these for almost a month, and I just keep liking them more and more. I didn’t mention pairing in my original text above, so I need to mention it here. There is, in effect, no pairing that you need to do, at least in the Apple-verse. By the time I’d opened the charging case and looked at the buds, they’d already paired with both my iPhone and iPad. I didn’t have to go into settings on my iOS devices, or press any buttons on the case. Just open case and it’s done. As a computer engineer for 40 years, I have never seen a faster or more seamless pairing of anything.One more word on recharging: just today I took them all the way to zero. Dropped them in the charger and in FIVE MINUTES they were at 24%.I am in love with the hearing aid functionality. I hear sounds in movies that I’d never heard before in my life, even when my hearing was perfect. And I can adjust amplification either by going into settings on my iPhone, or sliding my finger up or down on the stem.203 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

See more I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Pro, and they’ve quickly become my favorite tech accessory. The noise cancellation is incredibly effective, creating a truly immersive sound experience that drowns out background noise, making it great for work or travel. The transparency mode is also a fantastic feature, allowing me to hear my surroundings when needed without having to take them off.The sound quality is impressive, with a balanced bass and clear mids and highs that work well for various music genres. The fit is comfortable and secure, even during workouts, thanks to the customizable silicone tips. They also come with sweat and water resistance, making them suitable for the gym or outdoor activities.Battery life is solid, and I love the convenience of wireless charging with the case. The integration with the Apple ecosystem is seamless—switching between my iPhone, iPad, and Mac is effortless.Overall, the AirPods Pro are a bit pricey, but the quality, features, and ease of use make them worth it if you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem.

See more I recently purchased the iPod Pro and I must say, it has truly been a game-changer for me. The noise cancellation feature is hands down my favorite aspect of these earphones. As someone who travels frequently, being able to block out all the noise around me, especially on airplanes, has been a lifesaver.The noise cancellation on the iPod Pro is incredibly effective, allowing me to focus on my work, read a book, or even catch some shut-eye without being interrupted by the surrounding noise. It creates a peaceful and serene environment, even in the midst of a bustling airport or during a noisy flight.Not only does the noise cancellation work like a charm, but the sound quality of the iPod Pro is top-notch. The audio is crisp, clear, and immersive, making my music, podcasts, and audiobooks sound better than ever. The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and the fit is secure, ensuring they stay in place no matter how active I am.Overall, I highly recommend the iPod Pro to anyone who values peace and quiet, especially during travel. The noise cancellation feature is a game-changer, allowing you to create your own little oasis of tranquility wherever you go. It has truly enhanced my travel experience and I can't imagine flying without them now.9 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

See more The Apple AirPods Pro 2 truly elevate the listening experience, especially with their impressive noise cancellation and adaptive audio features. The sound quality is crisp, with enhanced bass and clarity that makes music and calls enjoyable. I also love the convenience of the USB-C charging and the quick pairing with Apple devices, which is seamless as expected. The added hearing aid mode is a great bonus and works well for ambient sound clarity.However, there are a couple of limitations worth noting. First, the battery life could be better—lasting about six hours per charge, which requires recharging in the middle of the day if you use them continuously. Additionally, although the silicone ear tips come in multiple sizes, they don’t always provide a perfect fit for everyone. For longer listening sessions, the fit can feel slightly uncomfortable, especially when moving around or working out.Overall, they are a worthwhile upgrade, especially for Apple users, but there's some room for improvement to make them perfect for all-day wear.16 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

See more I've owned all versions of airpods, normal, pro, max, etc. My favorite one for the longest time was the Airpod Pros \"version 1\". This product is the Airpods Pro \"version 2\". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC \"level\". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that.*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that.*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.*Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer \"v3\" ones that are coming out sometime next year.The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells \u0026 whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost.149 people found this helpful Share Report this reviewOptional: Why are you reporting this?Off topicNot about the productInappropriateDisrespectful, hateful, obsceneFakePaid for, inauthenticWe’ll check if this review meets our community guidelines.

Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. Here’s what I’ve noticed after using them.\u003cp\u003eThe biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it\u0026#39;s in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2’s ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There’s also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn’t in the first version. It’s made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of sound, I wouldn’t say it’s a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you’re really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I’m getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable—no more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I’m happy to report that it’s still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful—something the previous model didn’t offer, which was a frustrating limitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they’ve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don’t have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you\u0026#39;re covered from day one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot—whether I’m listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you’re like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you’re not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that’s likely coming soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it\u0026#39;s definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-hook=\"helpful-vote-statement\"\u003e712 people found this helpful\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-action=\"ssf-share-icon\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-ssf-share-icon\" data-ssf-share-icon=\"{\u0026#34;treatment\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;T1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;t\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;taf_twitter_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_copy_url_changeover\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Link copied!\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_whatsapp_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;WhatsApp\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_share_bottom_sheet_title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Share this product with friends\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_pinterest_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Pinterest\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_copy_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Copy Link\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_email_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Email\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_facebook_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Facebook\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_line_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;LINE\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_sms_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Text Message\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;shareDataAttributes\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;marketplaceId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isInternal\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ingress\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isRobot\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;requestId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0HSVBWRSCCSQNAG4VC08\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;customerId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;asin\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;B0D1XD1ZV3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;userAgent\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_6 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;MWEB\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;weblab\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;REVIEWS_SOCIAL_SHARE_533007\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;refId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;dprv\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review on Amazon: AirPods Pro 2: Subtle Upgrades, Major Impact for Everyday Users\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;refererURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unknown\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;emailSubject\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review on Amazon: AirPods Pro 2: Subtle Upgrades, Major Impact for Everyday Users\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B0D1XD1ZV3/RB47WOU0Q32Y5\u0026#34;}\"\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShare\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"report-abusive-review-bottom-sheet-preload-RB47WOU0Q32Y5\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch4\u003eReport this review\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOptional: Why are you reporting this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eOff topic\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot about the product\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eInappropriate\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisrespectful, hateful, obscene\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eFake\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaid for, inauthentic\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll check if this review meets our \u003cspan data-action=\"cr-popup\" data-cr-popup=\"{\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF\u0026amp;ref=cm_cr_cg\u0026#34;}\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF\u0026amp;ref=cm_cr_cg\"\u003ecommunity guidelines\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.

My favorite feature is the head movement to answer or deny a call. I am not sure how they achieved this but I am very happy with it to be honest. I thought it was a gimmick and it would never work but it works perfectly on my 16Pro. I came from a set of Beats earbuds and they didn’t have this feature and they’re made by Apple as well.

The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It’s stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I’m heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it’s so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLong story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-hook=\"helpful-vote-statement\"\u003e1,115 people found this helpful\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan data-action=\"ssf-share-icon\" data-csa-c-type=\"widget\" data-csa-c-func-deps=\"aui-da-ssf-share-icon\" data-ssf-share-icon=\"{\u0026#34;treatment\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;T1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;t\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;taf_twitter_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_copy_url_changeover\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Link copied!\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_whatsapp_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;WhatsApp\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_share_bottom_sheet_title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Share this product with friends\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_pinterest_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Pinterest\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_copy_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Copy Link\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_email_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Email\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_facebook_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Facebook\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_line_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;LINE\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;taf_sms_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Text Message\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;shareDataAttributes\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;marketplaceId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ATVPDKIKX0DER\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isInternal\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ingress\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isRobot\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;requestId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;0HSVBWRSCCSQNAG4VC08\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;customerId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;asin\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;B0D1XD1ZV3\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;userAgent\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_6 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;MWEB\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;weblab\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;REVIEWS_SOCIAL_SHARE_533007\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;refId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;dprv\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review on Amazon: READ BEFORE PURCHASE! 😊\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;refererURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unknown\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;emailSubject\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Review on Amazon: READ BEFORE PURCHASE! 😊\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/review/B0D1XD1ZV3/R3H55DLDY8DCXL\u0026#34;}\"\u003e\n\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShare\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"report-abusive-review-bottom-sheet-preload-R3H55DLDY8DCXL\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch4\u003eReport this review\u003c/h4\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOptional: Why are you reporting this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eOff topic\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot about the product\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eInappropriate\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisrespectful, hateful, obscene\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ch5\u003eFake\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaid for, inauthentic\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll check if this review meets our \u003cspan data-action=\"cr-popup\" data-cr-popup=\"{\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;url\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF\u0026amp;ref=cm_cr_cg\u0026#34;}\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF\u0026amp;ref=cm_cr_cg\"\u003ecommunity guidelines\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e.

However, I didn’t like how they operated so I gave them back, and they’re going to order a different brand/model, which I’ll have in about three months (!) So I went in search of quality, inexpensive hearing aids to fill the gap. (My hearing loss is considered mild, at -32db on one side and -39db on the other.) I got the AirPods last Friday, and the software for hearing aid support rolled out last night (iOS 18.1) So this will be a two part review.\u003cp\u003ePart one is the overall operation as earbuds for music and calls. These are my first ever Apple branded sound devices. Once I got the correct tips installed and the buds fitted, I was ready to go. OMG! The sound quality overall is the best of any earbuds I’ve ever owned, and by a huge margin. Astonishing bass, and crisp high range. (My hearing loss is in the upper ranges.) I’m beyond happy. Overall, the only thing I’m dissatisfied with is the battery life at 5-6 hours, but the extremely fast recharge speed eases that compliant. Voice quality when on a call is crystal clear. Controls are easy, though a bit hard to operate considering how small they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart two is the hearing aid function. The first thing I had to do was take a hearing test with the included software. (However, if you prefer to use a third party hearing test, you can import that profile and use it.) The hearing test takes about 5 minutes, after which the hearing aid sound enhancement profile is set automatically and they start up. I was totally gobsmacked at how well these things work! They boost the exact freqs I need. They actually work considerably better than those $7000 (egads!) hearing aids that I returned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow for the ANC. At home, I sit right in front of a large, noisy window air conditioner. On the opposite side of the room is a dehumidifier (I live in south central Texas, where it was 91° yesterday.) Between these two pieces of equipment, it’s pretty noisy here. I turned on ANC and the room went absolutely silent. So silent that I thought I’d popped a circuit breaker and everything had stopped running. I removed one of the AirPods, and the noise returned. Amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, everything I’d hoped the commercial hearing aids would do, the AirPods actually DID. I consider this the smartest purchase I’ve made in years. Only one negative, and that’s the ear tips. None of the provided sizes are a good fit for me, so I’m now looking to memory foam replacements. But that’s a very small gripe. If you’re looking at these, either for music or hearing, don’t hesitate. You’ll be glad you got them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT: I had to go to a doctor appointment across town today. Part of the route is on a toll highway with an 80 mph speed limit and heavy traffic. I got up to speed and turned on noise cancel mode.  INSTANTLY the car was completely silent at 80 mph. No road rumble, no engine noise, no wind noise, no traffic noise. It was an amazing and invigorating experience.  Oh, for those wondering about recharge time, if you take them all the way down to 0% battery and they shut down (I’ve now ascertained that 6 hours is about what you get with all the options turned on), it only takes about 15 minutes in the charge case and you’ll easily get another 3-4 hours out of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEDIT2: Okay, I’ve had these for almost a month, and I just keep liking them more and more. I didn’t mention pairing in my original text above, so I need to mention it here. There is, in effect, no pairing that you need to do, at least in the Apple-verse. By the time I’d opened the charging case and looked at the buds, they’d already paired with both my iPhone and iPad. I didn’t have to go into settings on my iOS devices, or press any buttons on the case. Just open case and it’s done. As a computer engineer for 40 years, I have never seen a faster or more seamless pairing of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne more word on recharging: just today I took them all the way to zero.

The added hearing aid mode is a great bonus and works well for ambient sound clarity.\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are a couple of limitations worth noting. First, the battery life could be better—lasting about six hours per charge, which requires recharging in the middle of the day if you use them continuously. Additionally, although the silicone ear tips come in multiple sizes, they don’t always provide a perfect fit for everyone.

This product is the Airpods Pro \u0026#34;version 2\u0026#34;. It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.\u003cp\u003e*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;. It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn\u0026#39;t have that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that\u0026#39;s about all I can say about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn\u0026#39;t have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Quality hasn\u0026#39;t declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn\u0026#39;t locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod\u0026#39;s quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that\u0026#39;s a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn\u0026#39;t activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I\u0026#39;m not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you\u0026#39;re the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don\u0026#39;t worry!
