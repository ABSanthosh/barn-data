  "text": "Sports fans might appreciate a neat little free Mac app called MenuScores, which places a game of your choice in the menu bar, which you can use to keep track of scores or game start times with a quick glance. It’s that simple, no frills, nothing overengineered or fancy, just sports scores in your Mac menu bar. If that sounds good to you, grab the free app for your Mac, set the game of your choice to keep track of, and away you go. Grab MenuScores from github here If you’re new to Github, you might find downloading apps from there is not exactly intuitive for regular people, so here’s a little walkthrough on how to successfully do that. Once you download MenuScores, try launching it and you’ll get the standard Gatekeeper response about the app being unable to open, so head over to System Settings \u003e Privacy \u0026 Security \u003e scroll all the way down, then choose “Open Anyway” to bypass the Gatekeeper protection. Now it’s just a matter of choosing the game you want to keep an eye on, and that’s it! The game of your choice is now in the menu bar of your Mac, where you can easily watch the game scores while you work on your Mac. Pretty nifty, huh? Help, I can’t see the MenuScores menu bar item! If you can’t see the MenuScores menu bar item, your menubar is probably too full. If you find your Mac menu bar is super cluttered, which happens quickly on the bizarro-design-decision Notch Macs, then you’ll likely need to remoe and/or disable menu bar items on the Mac. Most of them you can simply command+drag out of the menu bar to remove the icons for, but removing the Shortcuts menu bar icon is weirdly challenging, and some others must be disabled directly from whatever their corresponding apps are too. MenuScores Supported Sports \u0026 Leagues MenuScores offers games and scores to follow for the MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL, NCAA FOOTBALL, NCAA BASKETBALL, F1, PGA, LGA, WNBA, UEFA, EPL, ESP, GER, ITA, NLL, and who knows, maybe even more in the future. For me personally, I’m using this for MLB games at the moment, and I’ll get a lot more use out of MenuScores during college football season, but regardless of which sports or leagues you follow, you’ll likely enjoy the free app on your Mac. I stumbled into this app while looking for a simple way to see scores updated on the Mac, so a quick shoutout to Justin Potts over at Lifehacker for mentioning this handy tool.",
