  "text": "One of the best features of modern MacOS versions, from Sequoia 15.0 onward, is iPhone Mirroring, which allows Mac users to interact with their iPhone and use their iPhone directly from their Mac. iPhone Mirroring is almost entirely full featured in that you can access basically every iPhone feature from the Mac… but “almost entirely” is not entirely, because some iPhone functionality is not accessible currently with iPhone Mirroring. One of the more prominent iPhone features that iPhone Mirroring does not currently support is Control Center, which is how you access many of the iPhone features and quick toggles for networking, Shazam, accessibility toggles, amongst many other capabilities. Another prominent iPhone feature that is inaccessible from iPhone Mirroring at the moment is Notification Center. What both of these iPhone features have in common, other than not being available in iPhone Mirroring on the Mac, is that they require swiping down from the top of an iPhone screen to access. This could be part of the issue, and it could just be an oversight as Apple develops the feature further. If you were wondering how to access Control Center from iPhone Mirroring, you’re certainly not alone, as many other Mac users with iPhone Mirroring have the same questions and complaints all around the internet. The ability access Control Center and Notification Center from iPhone Mirroring is low hanging fruit and obviously desirable, which suggests we are very likely to gain this capability in the near future with an upcoming software update, probably to MacOS Sequoia. Of course that is speculation, and it’s always possible that Apple will never support the capability on the Mac, but there isn’t a particularly strong argument for that. Thus, while this capability is not yet available, it’s reasonable to assume in the near future we’ll have this ability in iPhone Mirroring on the Mac. So to be clear, while you can not currently access Control Center or Notification Center on iPhone from within iPhone Mirroring on a Mac, it’s likely these features will be introduced in an upcoming MacOS update. Whether that arrives as macOS Sequoia 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, or later, or MacOS 16 for that matter, remains uncertain, however. Just hold tight, and install those software updates as they come available!",
