  "text": "In a world of many \"samey\" Mac mechanical keyboards, the Epomaker Split65 stands out. It features a split design that's supposedly more ergonomic, but not everyone will actually be able to type with it. I'm a sucker for a keyboard and I have more than enough of them lying around my office — perhaps too many. But when Epomaker offered the Split65 for review, I couldn't say no, if only because it's so different. Sure, it's a mechanical keyboard like the rest, but one look at it tells the story. This is a keyboard that splits in the middle for added, customizable ergonomics. But there's more here than that, including a hugely useful knob for volume control. It's nice to type on, and I like using it. Unfortunately, as the title probably gave away, there's a problem. And for me, that problem comes when I use the Split65's main feature. Thankfully, this is a keyboard that I enjoy using, thanks to its customizability. Yes, this keyboard splits, but it also goes back together — and that changes everything for me. Epomaker Split65 keyboard review: What's in the boxThe Split65, as the name suggests, is a 65% keyboard, and I received the ANSI layout version for review. It can connect to a Mac or PC via Bluetooth, a 2.4GHz dongle, or a USB-C wired connection — I used the latter. Epomaker Split65 review: You can close the keyboard if you prefer, thankfully.Alongside the keyboard, buyers will also get the dongle, a USB-C to A cable, and a user manual. You'll also get a keycap puller so you can swap out the caps if you choose to later. Epomaker also includes some spare switches in case you break any when swapping your keycaps. Finally, there's a cable for connecting the two halves of the keyboard together. With its 65% layout, the keyboard isn't a large one, but it does have everything most people need. If you've used any other 65% keyboard, this one will be familiar. At the top-right of the Split65, there is a media knob that controls the volume, allowing for quick adjustments. It is relatively smooth to use and well-suited for media applications. The model that I received came with double-shot PBT keycaps with the Cherry profile. There's backlighting as you'd expect, with south-facing RGB per-key lighting on offer. Other notable features include 3/5 pin mechanical switches, plastic plate construction, and an ABS top case and iron bottom case. N-key rollover support is present to help avoid ghosting when typing. Epomaker Split65 keyboard: The handy volume knob is a great feature.The switches are Epomaker's in-house offering, with Wisteria Linear and Flamingo switches offered. I received the latter, which sports a 60g bottom-out force at 3.8mm travel. Around the back of the keyboard, you'll find a switch for power and connectivity mode as well as a USB-C port. You'll also find an additional USB-C port on each half of the keyboard, which you need to use with the provided cable — otherwise, one half won't work. Of course, the main feature here is that split design. It's somewhat down the middle of the keyboard, and you can position the two halves however you like. You don't have to split the keyboard, though, which is good news for some of us. Pushing the two halves together is satisfying thanks to built-in magnets that keep everything locked together. Do that, and you essentially have a normal 65% keyboard with a knob, and that's no bad thing at all. Epomaker Split65 keyboard review: CustomizationMost enthusiast keyboards these days can be customized, and the Split65 is no different. It supports QMK/VIA for programming and customization, offering plenty of options. The keyboard can be customized by programming and mapping keys, setting up macros, and more. You can easily adjust the keyboard's lighting all from a web interface — it's incredibly easy to use. This being a hot-swappable keyboard, you can of course choose to add your own switches and keycaps, too. Epomaker Split65 keyboard review: In useI've been using the Epomaker Split65 with my MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, predominantly connected via a cable. My testing found that Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity worked just fine, though. I've also predominantly used the Split65 in its closed configuration, which admittedly, defeats the point somewhat. I did try using it in the split setup, but I found that I simply couldn't get on with it. That's my issue, not the keyboard's. The flexibility offered by the cable between the two halves means you can find the right placement for your wrists. Except you're me. I think the problem is that I've spent decades typing on a keyboard, and my hands expect it to be in a certain place. The keys are always, generally, in the same location. Epomaker Split65 review: Not many keyboards have multiple USB-C ports.Changing that breaks my brain, but I could no doubt have trained it if I had given it long enough. Unfortunately, as someone who types for a living, I couldn't afford that luxury. However, if you're a fan of ergo keyboards, you'll get on just fine. And I'd wager you'll enjoy the typing experience. I found the keys felt solid and thunky — a technical term — in use, if a little loud, and the feedback was sufficient. Touch typing wasn't an issue (when closed) for me, and I don't feel that I typed any more slowly or lost any accuracy. For my testing, the volume knob was the star of the show. So much so that I now miss it when using other keyboards. I also appreciated the ease of customization thanks to the QMK/VIA support. On a negative note, the keyboard comes with Mac and PC support, but no Mac keycaps. That means you'll need to know which keys do what without looking at them. It's a relatively minor thing, but I think any keyboard with dual support should have keycaps for both. They can't possibly cost that much to throw in the box, can they? Epomaker Split65 keyboard review: An ergo keyboard that's better when it isn'tAs I mentioned, I use a lot of keyboards. But the Epomaker Split65 is the only one that features a split design. And that was probably the problem during my testing. I strongly expect that people who use a fixed ergonomic keyboard will very much enjoy the split65. The flexibility it offers makes it a great option, with plenty of features. Those features make the Split65 a keyboard I'll often continue to use after writing this review. I might even try using it in that split configuration again, too. From the media knob to the easy customization, I think the Split65 has plenty to offer. It helps that it's a looker, too, in an understated kind of way. At $120, it isn't the most expensive keyboard I've ever tested. And it could be a bargain if it helps stop your wrists from hurting, too. Epomaker Split65 keyboard: Pros A flexible ergonomic design Plenty of customization options A handy media control knob Plenty of connectivity options Epomaker Split65 keyboard: Cons Possibly too clacky for some No Mac-specific keycaps Some might prefer more keys Epomaker Split65 keyboard: Rating 4 out of 5 Where to buy the Epomaker Split65 keyboardYou can buy the Epomaker Split65 keyboard for $119.99 directly from Epomaker's website. Alternatively, you can buy it from Amazon for the same $119.99 price — albeit often discounted to around $108.",
