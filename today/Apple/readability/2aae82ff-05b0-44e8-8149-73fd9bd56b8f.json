From March 25-31, you can save up to 50% on Dreame’s cutting-edge vacuum lineup and more with an additional 5% discount available on select products using the exclusive promo code “dreame9to5” for 9to5 readers. Robot vacuums: AI-powered cleaning solutions X40 Ultra leads Dreame’s robot vacuum lineup with revolutionary AI navigation and comprehensive cleaning capabilities. This flagship model features a 12,000Pa Vormax suction system, extendable and liftable side brush, and auto-empty functionality that redefines hands-free cleaning. The multi-spectrum OmniDirt detection technology intelligently identifies dirt and automatically rewashes areas that need extra attention. During the spring sale, X40 Ultra is available at $600 off its original $1,499.99 price. The L40 Ultra offers similar premium features including an extendable side brush and auto-empty base, available with a significant $600 discount. For those seeking a more budget-friendly option, the L10s Ultra Gen 2 delivers pet-friendly cleaning with MopExtend technology and comprehensive pathfinding capabilities, now priced $450 below retail. Wet \u0026 dry vacuums: powerful floor care Dreame’s wet and dry vacuum lineup features the H12 Pro, a cordless one-step cleaning solution that offers powerful performance for various surfaces. With edge-to-edge cleaning capabilities, dual-rotation self-cleaning, and auto hot air drying, the H12 Pro ensures thorough cleaning even in tight corners. Powered by a 6×4,000mAh battery pack and high-speed brushless motor, it delivers exceptional cleaning performance. During the spring promotion, the H12 Pro is available for $180 less than its regular $449.99 price. The premium H14 Pro takes floor cleaning to the next level with its lie-flat design, powerful suction, and GlideWheel movement technology, now discounted by $300. The standard H14 model maintains the lie-flat cordless design with powerful cleaning capabilities at a more accessible price point, now $200 off. Stick vacuums: versatile cleaning power Dreame’s Z30 cordless stick vacuum delivers impressive multi-surface cleaning with industry-leading 310AW suction power — the highest in Dreame’s cordless lineup as of May 2024. This versatile model features the innovative CelesTect™ technology that visually reveals hidden dust on both carpets and hard floors through specialized celeste lighting. The Z30 excels at pet hair management with its dedicated deshedding tool specifically engineered for medium to long-haired dogs and cats. Anti-tangle ridges in the main brush prevent hair wrapping, while the Clean-to-Edge™ design reaches within 7mm of walls for comprehensive corner cleaning. For health-conscious consumers, the Z30 boasts a 99.99% whole-machine filtration efficiency for particles as small as 0.1μm, featuring an H14 HEPA filter that captures 99.9% of bacteria and viruses including E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain coronaviruses. Battery performance is equally impressive, with up to 90 minutes of runtime in Eco mode and coverage capability of approximately 300m² on a single charge. During the spring cleaning promotion, save $180 on this versatile model, bringing the price down from $599.99 to just $419.99. The more affordable R10 features anti-tangle technology, built-in headlights, and rechargeable functionality, now available with a $110 discount. Beyond cleaning: Pocket Hair Dryer The Pocket Hair Dryer brings Dreame’s engineering excellence to personal care. This ultra-lightweight (300g) powerhouse features a high-performance 110,000 RPM motor that delivers professional-grade drying in as little as 40 seconds. With 300 million negative ions per cm³, it actively conditions hair while drying. The innovative 3-form foldable design transforms between storage (‘N’ shape), styling (‘1’ shape with curling nozzle), and smoothing (‘7’ shape with unfrizz nozzle) configurations. Five temperature modes and two airflow speeds ensure customized styling for all hair types, while intelligent NTC temperature sensing maintains a safe 57°C constant temperature to prevent heat damage. Despite its powerful performance, the Pocket operates at just 60dB for a quiet styling experience. Originally priced at $159.99, the Pocket Hair Dryer is now available at $70 off during the spring promotion. The spring cleaning promotion runs March 25-31, with all discounted products available through Amazon. For maximum savings, don’t forget to use promo code “dreame9to5” for an additional 5% off eligible models. This is the perfect opportunity to elevate your spring cleaning routine with Dreame’s intelligent, powerful cleaning technologies at their most affordable prices of the season.
