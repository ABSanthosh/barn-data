  "text": "A new report out today from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) shows that while AirPods remain the most popular wireless earbuds among iPhone users, Apple might be feeling the pressure of slowing growth. From 59% to 57%, and back again According to the report, 44% of iPhone owners now report having Bluetooth earbuds, up slightly from 41% last year and 39% the year before. However, 59% of those say they own AirPods. That’s a 2% bump from last year, but it’s also right back to where it was in 2023. In other words, Apple has managed to recover some lost ground, but growth is essentially flat over the past two years. Big picture-wise, while the numbers show that roughly 1 in 4 iPhone owners use AirPods, they also suggest there’s still headroom Apple hasn’t quite figured out how to convert. Recent discounts either mean inventory cleanup, or strategic push According to the report, last week’s aggressive Amazon Prime Day discount was quickly matched in price by Best Buy and Walmart. AirPods Pro 2 were available for just $149 (and can still be found for $169), down from the usual $249. CIRP notes that while the deals weren’t offered directly by Apple, they were likely coordinated to move units for one of two possible reasons: Some speculate Amazon (and therefore Apple) wants to move AirPods inventory before introducing a new model. It’s hard to imagine that two companies as skilled at managing their supply chains could possibly need to do that. We think both companies just want to sell a lot of AirPods and had the margin capacity to sell them at prices that could drive extraordinary volume. The report also notes that as the iPhone upgrade cycle continues to stretch, AirPods offer Apple a chance to capitalize on a faster-moving product line. In fact, they mention that AirPods are one of the most frequently reordered items on Amazon, whether to replace a lost bud or swap out an aging pair with fading battery life. AirPods deals on Amazon AirPods Pro 2, USB-C Charging: $169 (down from $249) AirPods 4 USB-C Charging: $89.99 (down from $129) AirPods 4, USB-C and Wireless Charging: $119 (down from $179) AirPods Max, USB-C Charging, Midnight: $529.99 Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
