The latest hint comes from former cast member Nick Mohammed, who played assistant coach Nate Shelley on the hit show. Mohammed posted a video on X.com on January 16th to announce that some of the early dates on his forthcoming UK tour will be rearranged due to unnamed \"filming.\" Mohammed was scheduled to kick off the tour for \"Show Pony,\" a live \"show that goes wrong\" type comedy involving music and magic, in April. In character as the show's eccentric lead character Mr. Swallow, Mohammed explains in the short video that the re-arrangement of some dates is \"due to some filming I've not been able to shift.\" In the video, he refuses to name what it is he'll be filming, but a \"Believe\" sign is partially seen near the end of the announcement, leaving little doubt. â€” Nick Mohammed (@nickmohammed) January 16, 2025\"Ted Lasso\" was Apple TV+'s first big hit series, following the surprise Oscar win for its first original movie, Coda. While the third season of \"Ted Lasso\" ended with Ted (Jason Sudekis) announcing he was quitting to return home to Kansas, its ending was widely praised and regarded as a strong and emotional wrap-up. From rumors to industry confirmationOne of the first solid clues that the show might return for fourth season came in the form of a comment from Apple CEO Tim Cook. Actor Jeremy Swift (who played Leslie Higgins) recounted a conversation with Cook in which the CEO expressed hope for a fourth season. Nick Mohammed as Mr. Swallow in \"Show Pony.\" Image: British Comedy GuideIn August of 2024, a trade paper reported that Warner Brothers had picked up options on Hanna Waddingham (Rebecca), Swift, and Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent). There was no word if star Jason Sudekis had been approached, but he had previously indicated satisfaction with the way the show ended. In October 2024, Apple TV aficionado Sigmund Judge posted on X.com that season 4 of \"Ted Lasso\" would enter pre-production in January. Mohammed's announcement of rescheduled theatre dates would suggest that pre-production is now underway, and contracts are being signed for a return.

According to my sources, the football drama is now confirmed to return next year with a fourth instalment, with London shoots beginning in early 2025! pic.twitter.com/3tZszHy7w1â€” Sigmund Judge (@sigjudge) October 3, 2024Shortly after the report from Judge, the Film \u0026 Television Industry Alliance's Production List including an entry for \"Ted Lasso (Season 4)\" in its list. Shooting was listed as taking place in London and unspecified US locations, but casting was unspecified. Sudekis was reported to have been satisfied with the original ending of the show, and has not yet indicated any interest in revisitng the part. His most recent production listing is as the voice of the lead character in the 2024 movie Hitpig!.",
