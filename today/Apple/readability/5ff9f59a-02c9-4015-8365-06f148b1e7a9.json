Photo: Apple TV+ Anybody care for a big taste of Silo season 2 ahead of the hit sci-fi series’ November 15 air date on Apple TV+? The streamer dropped a “sneak peak” Friday of the show’s new season — literally the first five minutes of episode one. Outside the silo in which countless generations have lived, main character Juliette not only explores the hellscape that supposedly will kill her, but sees ominous signs of what came (way) before. We get a major flashback. “Watch the first 5 minutes of Silo Season 2,” the YouTube page says. “Juliette lives.” So yeah, she’s not dead. At least not yet. This post contains affiliate links.

Watch sneak peek aheado of Silo season 2 premiere on Apple TV+ November 15 In the video, which follows a previous season 2 trailer, we see silo dwellers scheming in darkness, appearing to mass for some sort of conflict. The leader wears a sheriff’s badge like the one Juliette wore, having assumed that role in season 1 after an unlikely promotion from engineer. As the tension builds, it becomes apparent the group plans to forcefully gain entry to a heavily guarded silo entrance with the path forward just a narrow grated walkway over a long drop. With a battle cry of “Freedom!” from the attackers, a vicious fight ensues. And afterward, questions linger. Who were they and where were they going? Was it a past insurrection in the silo, or an attack from one silo to another? (Previous peeks outside in season 1 showed there might be many.) And when did this quest for freedom happen, anyway? Later we see Juliette moving around outside the silo after her eventual exit in season one. Everyone who leaves dies, goes the accepted wisdom. But she appears to prove that false, as many suspected might be true. Wearing her spacesuit, she passes a tattered flag and then begins to see the desiccated, skeletal remains of people who died long before. Were these the fighters we saw earlier? The sneak peek video shows the attacking fighters exiting the silo. “Let’s go outside,” the sheriff says, to cheers. But maybe it didn’t go so well.Photo: Apple TV+ It’s a tantalizing preview of the hit show’s new season. Both season are based on Hugh Howey’s sci-fi book series. And if you haven’t watched, here’s how Apple TV+ describes the show: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. In addition to Ferguson, Silo season two stars new addition Steve Zahn, alongside returning stars Tim Robbins, Common, Harriet Walter, Chinaza Uche, Avi Nash, Alexandria Riley, Shane McRae, Remmie Milner, Clare Perkins, Billy Postlethwaite, Rick Gomez, Caitlin Zoz, Tanya Moodie and Iain Glen. Apple Studio produces the show, executive produced by Graham Yost, Michael Dinner, Nina Jack, Joanna Thapa, Ferguson, Morten Tyldum, Howey, Fred Golan, Rémi Aubuchon and AMC Studios.
