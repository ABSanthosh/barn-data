  "text": "Apple Intelligence is an intriguing and powerful set of AI features available on the latest models of Mac, iPhone, and iPad with modern versions of system software. These AI features are tied to ChatGPT and range from useful writing and summarization tools, to business plan creation, to writing emails on your behalf, image generation with Image Playground, and more, but not everyone has an interest in these sort of features. If you’re an iPhone, Mac, or iPad user and you want to turn off Apple Intelligence features on your devices, read along to learn how to do that. How to Turn Off Apple Intelligence on Mac Turning off Apple Intelligence on the Mac is easy: Go to the  Apple menu and choose System Settings Go to “Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri” Toggle the switch for Apple Intelligence to the OFF position Confirm that you want to disable Apple Intelligence on the Mac The feature will be disabled immediately and you will no longer have access to the various AI tools on the Mac. How to Disable Apple Intelligence on iPhone \u0026 iPad Turning off Apple Intelligence on iPhone and iPad is a simple settings toggle: Open the “Settings” app and choose “Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri” Toggle the setting for “Apple Intelligence” to the OFF position Confirm that you want to disable Apple Intelligence on your iPhone or iPad With Apple Intelligence turned off, you will no longer have access to the variety of AI features on iPhone or iPad. An interesting side benefit of disabling Apple Intelligence is that doing so recovers around 7GB of storage space on your device, so if you’re tight on storage, you can regain storage by disabling the AI feature on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Note that if you do not have these settings options available on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, that means you do not have Apple Intelligence support on that particular device, and there is nothing to turn off or disable. Like any other setting, you can always reverse course and make a quick settings adjustment to re-enable the feature if you so choose. It’s worth pointing out that some Mac, iPhone, and iPad users have never enabled the feature themselves, but have found that Apple Intelligence turns itself on automatically after installing a system software update onto their device, so therefore if you have no interest in the feature or having it enabled on your device, you might want to peak into settings anyway. Do you use Apple Intelligence or did you disable it? Why or why not? Share your thoughts in the comments.",
