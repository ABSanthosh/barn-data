  "text": "The Type to Siri feature on Mac is super useful, particularly now that Siri has Apple Intelligence features. Using Type to Siri is perhaps even more handy for Mac users than using the voice activated Siri commands, but some Mac users may find themselves accidentally triggering Type to Siri by inadvertently pressing the initiating command sequence. If you wish to change the keyboard shortcut for Type to Siri on Mac, you can do so rather quickly with a settings change, as we’ll detail here. How to Change Type to Siri Keyboard Shortcut on Mac Here is how you can quickly change the keyboard shortcut for initiating Type to Siri on Mac: Go to the  Apple menu and choose “System Settings” Select “Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri” Select the “Keyboard Shortcut” dropdown menu to choose your desired keyboard shortcut for starting Type to Siri on MacOS, the default options are: fn/globe+S, Press Left Command key twice, Press Right command key twice, Press either command key twice, Customize (you can select just about any keyboard shortcut this way) The new keyboard shortcut is active right away, press it to confirm your choice to summon Type to Siri There you go, your new Type to Siri shortcut is now active on the Mac. If you find yourself accidentally initiating the Type to Siri feature on Mac with the double press of command key, something that many Mac users are discovering, you might try switching the Type to Siri keyboard shortcut to Globe/Fn+S instead, or something else entirely using the customize feature. Or, if you only use one of the Command keys, you might find switching the keyboard shortcut to the non-used Command key to be helpful as well. Since most Mac users primarily interact with their computers by using the keyboard and mouse/trackpad, the Type to Siri feature is arguably more broadly useful on the Mac than it is on iPhone, or even iPad. Therefore, pick a keyboard shortcut that works for you and how you’d like to initiate your Siri interactions. While Type to Siri has been around for a while now, it’s much more useful in MacOS Sequoia 15 and newer on Apple Silicon Macs because of Apple Intelligence support, so if you’re using an older Mac operating system, or a non-Apple Silicon Mac, you might find the feature to be a bit underwhelming in comparison. Don’t forget that you can always use ChatGPT to gain similar AI features (and that some aspects of Apple Intelligence is offloaded to ChatGPT anyway!). What do you think of the new and improved Type to Siri on Mac? Did you change your keyboard shortcut to initiate the feature? Share with us your experiences and thoughts in the comments.",
