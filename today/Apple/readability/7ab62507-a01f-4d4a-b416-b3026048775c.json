Issues surrounding Apple Intelligence have been cropping up throughout the day Thursday, and it may be due to a botched backend push from Apple. Users began noticing the lack of on-device Apple Intelligence early Thursday, and issues have continued propagating across devices and regions. There's nothing on Apple's system status page that would indicate there are any issues, though there isn't a section for Apple Intelligence. AppleInsider has reached out to Apple about the issue. I personally noticed an issue around noon when trying to test Workout Buddy in watchOS 26. In spite of setting it up a week prior, the Apple Watch acted like it didn't exist. My coworkers encountered similar issues with various aspects of Apple Intelligence throughout the day. Peeks through social media indicate that others are running into random issues as well. It's as if Apple Intelligence has been turned off even though it primarily runs locally to the user's device. A Reddit post and a post to the Apple Developer forums confirm the widespread nature of the issue. These links were originally shared on Mastodon by MacStories Editor-in-Chief Federico Viticci. An Apple Intelligence flawIf you're wondering how an on-device system could be down, you're not alone. When users first enabled Apple Intelligence with iOS 18.1 and the other operating systems, the models were downloaded locally. Apple executives shared that Apple Intelligence models have been updated frequently since the public release through over-the-air updates. It seems this is the culprit for the slow, but spreading outage. iPhones, Macs, iPads, and even Apple Vision Pros are likely pinging Apple's servers regularly for updates to select systems like Apple Intelligence. These updates likely aren't triggered until a user goes to access one of the systems, which may explain the suddenness of some of the feature disappearances. I personally used Writing Tools multiple times since 1 p.m., and suddenly they're gone from all of my devices. My Mac mini is the only device still offering Apple Intelligence. There's a chance this is isolated to devices running the latest developer betas for the 26 series of updates. We have not received any reports of it occurring on non-beta devices as of this publication. The outage will likely be a short one as Apple works to fix whatever bottleneck is preventing the Apple Intelligence update from propagating. Until then, you'll have to deal with the old Siri style and a lack of on-device tools like Visual Intelligence and Writing Tools.",
