The update makes it a little easier than before to decide whether you get the standard AirPods or step up to the AirPods Pro 2. Let’s look at the differences between the three earphones–there’s a lot more than just the shape and fit. This guide will help you make the proper buying decision for yourself or the person you’re shopping for. AirPods and AirPods Pro features compared Here’s a quick reference chart detailing the features for the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancelation, and AirPods Pro 2.

They sit at the opening of the ear canal. This design leave a little bit of space between the earbuds and the ear canal. Apple says the AirPods 4 “provide a natural and secure fit for more people than ever.” The AirPods 4 and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation have the exact same design; the differences are with internal features. The AirPods Pro do have ear tips, which are extensions of the earbud that fit into the opening of the ear canal. This design creates a seal for the ear canal that muffles outside sound. Both the AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro feature a shorter stem length than the original AirPods. Also, both are available only in white. The AirPods 4 has a narrower case than the AirPods Pro 2.

Both also support Conversation The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips affect its Active Noise Cancellation. Since the ear tips block out external sounds, the ANC is more effective with the AirPods Pro than the AirPods 4 with ANC, which still uses ANC well. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 Spatial Audio and sound quality The AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and the AirPods Pro 2 support Spatial Audio with head tracking. Apple AirPods 4 (with ANC) Read our review Price When Reviewed: $179 with Active Noice Cancelation Best Prices Today: $168.99 at Amazon | $179 at Adorama | $179 at Apple Also, the three models use Apple’s H2 chip for audio processing, so the sound quality is similar between them. The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips and how they reduce outside sound, however, does affect the quality–the AirPods Pro 2 sounds “purer” than the AirPods 4. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 controls and features Both AirPods 4 models have stems with force touch sensors, which allow you to use a pinch to control audio playback and phone calls. The AirPods Pro 2 has the same force touch sensors, but the stems also allow for swipe motions to control volume, and you can hold the stems to switch listening modes. All three models are sweat and water resistant, but they are not waterproof so they can’t be worn swimming. AirPods Pro 2 USB-C Read our review Price When Reviewed: $249 Best Prices Today: $157.95 at B\u0026H | $249 at Apple | $297.50 at Amazon While all three models work with Find My, the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2 have charging cases with speakers that play Find My alerts. The AirPods Pro 2 will soon have a new Hearing Air feature that allows the earphone to be used as over-the-counter hearing aids. The feature includes a Hearing Test and a Hearing Protection feature. This will be coming as a free firmware update by the end of 2024; if you already own AirPods 2, you don’t need to buy anything. The Hearing Air is not available for the AirPods 4. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 battery life The AirPods 4 earbuds last five hours on a full charge. The case stores 30 hours of charge. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation’s battery life is affected by the ANC feature: With ANC on all the time, Apple states a four-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 20 hours of available charge in the case.  With ANC off all the time, Apple states a five-hour battery life for the earbuds, and 30 hours of available charge in the case. If you switch between ANC on and off, battery life is adversely affected when it’s on and your get an earbud battery life between four and five hours. AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 wireless charging The AirPods 4 does not have wireless charging. It charges through USB-C. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation supports wireless and USB-C charging. It works with the Apple Watch and Qi chargers. It doesn’t support MagSafe, but a MagSafe charger will work if you place the case in the dead center of the charger and balance it. It doesn’t make a magnetic connection to stay in place. The AirPods Pro 2 supports wireless and USB-C charging. It works with the Apple Watch and Qi chargers, and it does support MagSafe.

While there are a lot of similarities between the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2, there are a few factors to consider. The obvious decision to make is whether you want Active Noise Cancellation. If not, your only choice is the AirPods 4. If you do want it, then you need to choose between the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2. (You can always turn off ANC if you don’t want to use it.) If you do want Active Noise Cancellation, decide whether you want ear tips or not. If you think ear tips are uncomfortable or don’t like the effect they have on sound, then the AirPods 4 with ANC are for you. If you’re fine with ear tips or want to maximize the effect of ANC, then the AirPods Pro 2 are your pick. Maybe, instead you’re most concerned with fit and you’re fine with either ear tips or no ear tips. The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips help secure the ear buds in your ear. Apple says the AirPods 4 fit better than ever, but they still sit at the opening of your ear canal and are not as secure as the AirPods Pro 2. The only way to insure a proper fit is to try them on before a purchase. If you absolutely want ear tips, your only choice is the AirPods Pro 2. If you have ruled out the AirPods Pro 2 and are deciding between the two AirPods 4 models, the major difference (beside ANC, which you don’t have to use) is the charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC’s case supports wireless charging and has a Find My speaker for alerts. Ask yourself, is the extra $50/£50 worth ANC, wireless charging, and Find My alerts? If you want to use the AirPods as a hearing aid, the AirPods Pro 2 is your choice. Keep in mind that that this feature isn’t available yet and will require a free firmware update that you can do on a Wi-Fi network at home. One last consideration is price. The prices in this article are Apple’s list prices; you can often find price reductions at third-party retailers such as Amazon. In fact, the AirPods Pro 2 are often on sale for $190/£190, just $10/£10 more than the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. If you are okay with ear tips, then the AirPods Pro 2 can be had at a good price.",

Painter / Foundry\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"which-one-should-you-buy\"\u003eWhich one should you buy?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there are a lot of similarities between the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2, there are a few factors to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe obvious decision to make is whether you want Active Noise Cancellation. If not, your only choice is the AirPods 4. If you do want it, then you need to choose between the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation and the AirPods Pro 2. (You can always turn off ANC if you don’t want to use it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do want Active Noise Cancellation, decide whether you want ear tips or not. If you think ear tips are uncomfortable or don’t like the effect they have on sound, then the AirPods 4 with ANC are for you. If you’re fine with ear tips or want to maximize the effect of ANC, then the AirPods Pro 2 are your pick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, instead you’re most concerned with fit and you’re fine with either ear tips or no ear tips. The AirPods Pro 2’s ear tips help secure the ear buds in your ear. Apple says the AirPods 4 fit better than ever, but they still sit at the opening of your ear canal and are not as secure as the AirPods Pro 2. The only way to insure a proper fit is to try them on before a purchase. If you absolutely want ear tips, your only choice is the AirPods Pro 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have ruled out the AirPods Pro 2 and are deciding between the two AirPods 4 models, the major difference (beside ANC, which you don’t have to use) is the charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC’s case supports wireless charging and has a Find My speaker for alerts. Ask yourself, is the extra $50/£50 worth ANC, wireless charging, and Find My alerts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to use the AirPods as a hearing aid, the AirPods Pro 2 is your choice. Keep in mind that that this feature isn’t available yet and will require a free firmware update that you can do on a Wi-Fi network at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne last consideration is price. The prices in this article are Apple’s list prices; you can often find price reductions at third-party retailers such as Amazon. In fact, the AirPods Pro 2 are often on sale for $190/£190, just $10/£10 more than the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation. If you are okay with ear tips, then the AirPods Pro 2 can be had at a good price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
