  "text": "Three weeks into 2025, Apple has now updated its CarPlay website with one small, but noteworthy change: CarPlay 2 is no longer promised to arrive in 2024, thus confirming the delay. Apple, however, says its work on next generation CarPlay continues… Updated CarPlay site removes promised launch date, but Apple confirms ongoing development Apple’s plans to ship CarPlay 2 (‘next generation of CarPlay’) have hit an official delay. Apple’s website has been updated to remove any reference to a 2024 deadline (first seen by MacRumors). In a statement to 9to5Mac, however, Apple said that it is still working with “several automakers” to implement the next generation CarPlay experience: The next generation of CarPlay builds on years of success and insights gained from CarPlay, delivering the best of Apple and the automaker in a deeply integrated and customizable experience. We continue to work closely with several automakers, enabling them to showcase their unique brand and visual design philosophies in the next generation of CarPlay. Each car brand will share more details as they near the announcements of their models that will support the next generation of CarPlay. All throughout 2024, Apple’s CarPlay site claimed that the first models with CarPlay 2 would arrive in 2024. Even in December, the language remained unchanged, leading some (myself included) to believe a launch announcement would arrive just before the deadline passed. The same thing had played out the prior year, for example, when Apple promised the first CarPlay 2-supporting automakers would be announced. They kept that promise, just barely, with a December news drop. But in 2024, Apple’s new CarPlay deadline came and went with no change. What’s next after CarPlay 2’s delay? Plenty of signs exist that Apple’s still working on its new CarPlay system, beyond the statement shared above—but it’s just not ready yet. Personally, I’d love to see Apple take CarPlay in a new direction by building CarPlay 2 tools into the existing system. That way, millions of existing CarPlay users can benefit from the upgrades. For now though, all we know is that Apple and its automaker partners are continuing to develop the next generation of CarPlay—and all we can do is wait. Are you interested in getting CarPlay 2, or would you prefer that the first CarPlay just got better? Let us know in the comments.
