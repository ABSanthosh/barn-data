Photo: The new Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma promises to transform how Mac users connect their devices while delivering blazing-fast data speeds, support for massive SSD storage expansion, expanded display capabilities and RGB lighting, the gaming peripherals giant said Wednesday. Priced at $399.99, the dock stands in the first wave of major accessories to fully embrace Intel’s latest Thunderbolt 5 standard. “The Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock is designed to meet the growing need for faster data transfer and robust multi-display support,” said Travis Furst, notebooks and accessories chief at Razer. Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock Chroma: Massive bandwidth boost for creative professionals As with any new Thunderbot 5 dock, the headline feature of Razer’s new dock is its incredible data transfer capabilities. Thunderbolt 5 delivers up to 120Gb/s burst bandwidth with 80Gb/s sustained bidirectional speeds — nearly 12 times faster than USB 3.0 and more than double the practical bandwidth of Thunderbolt 4. This massive increase in data throughput makes the dock particularly appealing for creative professionals working with large media files, high-resolution video content and demanding workflows. The enhanced bandwidth enables seamless operation of high-performance peripherals and ultra-fast storage while supporting daisy-chaining with other Thunderbolt devices. Built-in storage expansion and power delivery And here’s a unique feature that sets Razer’s dock apart from competitors. An internal M.2 PCIe Gen 4 slot supports up to 8TB of SSD storage expansion. This integrated storage provides rapid file access and can serve as a central repository for large projects or media libraries. It works with Thunderbolt Share. The dock also delivers up to 140W of power delivery, sufficient to charge even the most power-hungry MacBook Pro models. Triple 4K display support transforms workspace setup This image from Razer gives a good sense of what you can connect to the new dock. And Mac users should appreciate the dock’s impressive display capabilities. It supports up to three 4K monitors at 120Hz refresh rate or a single 8K display at 60Hz refresh rate. This multi-monitor support is ideal for professionals who need expanded screen real estate for video editing, graphic design or multitasking across multiple applications. The dock simplifies setup by consolidating everything into a single Thunderbolt 5 cable connection. The 11-in-1 connectivity hub includes four Thunderbolt 5 ports, three DisplayPort 2.1 connections, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, Gigabit Ethernet, and a 3.5mm audio combo jack. An SD card slot supports UHS-II speeds. That makes it convenient for photographers and videographers to transfer files directly from their cameras. Mac compatibility and RGB customization The dock works with Apple’s latest Thunderbolt 5-enabled Macs, including the MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, along with the M4 Pro-powered Mac mini and Mac Studio. For users with older Macs, the dock offers backward compatibility with Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 standards. Mac users can take advantage of Razer’s signature RGB Chroma lighting through the Razer Synapse macOS utility. It’s available for Apple Silicon models running macOS Ventura or later. The customizable underglow lighting adds visual appeal while maintaining the dock’s sleek aluminum construction. Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock: TB5 timing and availability Thunderbolt 5 adoption remains limited in the broader PC ecosystem. But Apple’s embrace of the standard in its latest high-end Macs positions the company’s users to immediately benefit from the enhanced capabilities. You can buy Razer Thunderbolt 5 Dock from Razer’s website and Amazon in black for $399.99 and from Razer in Mercury white for $389.99. The dock’s premium pricing reflects its cutting-edge technology and comprehensive feature set. Basically, it’s an investment for professionals who need maximum performance and connectivity options from their Mac setup. Buy from: Razer or Amazon Source: Razer",
