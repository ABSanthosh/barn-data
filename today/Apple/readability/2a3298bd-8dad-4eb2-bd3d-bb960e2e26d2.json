  "text": "Amazon-owned Woot has launched a flash deal on a closeout 16-inch MacBook Pro that's equipped with an impressive 8TB of storage. If you're looking for a heavily discounted Apple laptop, Woot's weekend flash sale has dropped the 16-inch M1 Max model to $2,119.99 for 24 hours only. Grab the 24-hour deal Equipped with Apple's M1 Max chip with a 10-core CPU and 24-core GPU, which was a significant chip upgrade when the line was released in Late 2021, this laptop offers the benefits of Apple Silicon for users still running an Intel spec. It also has 32GB of memory. The real standout feature, though, is the 8TB SSD — which was a $2,400 upgrade at the time — bringing the original MSRP to $5,499. For those that don't want to deal with external storage and want to adhere to a budget, this open-box model from Woot offers ample space at a fraction of the price of a current model with a large storage capacity. The cheapest 8TB model from the current M4 Max line is on sale for $5,399, more than $3,000 higher than this deal. For content creators getting started in the business, this machine can put you on your way without breaking the bank. According to Woot, the laptops are in new, open-box condition and come with a 90-day Woot warranty. Prime members get free standard shipping, with delivery as early as Jan. 23. The offer is limited to three units per customer and the deal is set to end at 10pm Pacific Time on Jan. 11, or while supplies last.",
