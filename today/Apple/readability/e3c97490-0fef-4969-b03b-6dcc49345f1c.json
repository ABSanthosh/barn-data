  "text": "Following the release of updates for Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro, Apple has also updated its Final Cut Camera app for iPhone. With the new version of the app, users can finally capture Log videos using the HEVC codec, as well as preview Log videos with the Apple Log LUT and more. Read on as we detail what’s new in Final Cut Camera. What’s new with Final Cut Camera for iPhone One of the biggest changes coming to Final Cut Camera is the ability to capture Log-encoded HEVC video. Previously, Log was only available for ProRes videos, which take up a lot more space. Now users can benefit from the increased flexibility and dynamic range of Log combined with smaller HEVC files. In addition, the update also adds the option to enable LUT preview while recording in Log, so that users can see the “vibrancy of the original scene” in SDR or HDR with Apple Log LUT. For iPhone 16 Pro users, the Final Cut Camera update also enables 4K video capture at 120fps for cinematic slow motion. Moreover, Apple is also bringing advanced tilt and and roll indicators to help users compose their shots. For those unfamiliar, Final Cut Camera is an app from Apple that lets creators “wirelessly connect and remotely direct each video angle with powerful pro controls.” Although the app was first presented as a companion tool for controlling the iPhone camera from the iPad, it also works on the iPhone as a standalone app. With the app, users can adjust things like white balance and manual focus while monitoring zebras and measuring audio. It also provides ISO and shutter speed controls, as well as making it easy to switch between resolutions and video formats. The interface is very straightforward and also highlights the iPhone’s battery level and remaining storage. With Final Cut Camera, you can also easily transfer media to a Final Cut project on the iPad or save footage directly to connected external storage. The app is available for free on the App Store and requires an iPhone running iOS 17.6 or later (while some features require the latest iPhones).
