Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Thanks to a settlement in a class-action lawsuit related to Siri and data privacy, most U.S. Apple users can receive up to $100. You just need to fill out an online form by July 2, 2025. (Spoiler alert: That’s today.) You’re eligible for a settlement if you live in the United States and used Siri between September 17, 2014, (when Apple released “Hey Siri” in iOS 8) and December 31, 2024. You can receive up to $20 per device, for up to five devices, if you’ve ever accidentally triggered Siri in the middle of a private conversation or meeting. Here’s how Apple got in this mess, how to find out if you’re eligible, and how to submit your claim. Apple class-action lawsuit: How to get your Siri settlement money Apple has settled numerous class-action lawsuits in recent years, including cases involving its infamous butterfly keyboards ($50 million); dodgy AppleCare replacements ($95 million); iOS 9-related slowdowns ($20 million); stock-pumping statements about iPhone demand in China ($490 million) and Batterygate, which Apple settled for $500 million after claims of planned obsolescence. In most cases, the payouts were minimal to to everyone but the lawyers, and this case will likely be the same. How much will I get from the Siri settlement? While you may get up to $100, the actual amount you receive will certainly be lower. Everyone who submits a valid claim will receive a share of the $95 million pool. It’ll only take 950,000 people submitting the form for that $100 payout to start shrinking. How to get money from Apple Siri lawsuit? To get started, go to www.LopezVoiceAssistantSettlement.com and tap Submit Claim. To get your Claimant ID Code and Confirmation Code, check the email associated with your Apple Account. (If you’re not sure what that is, go to Settings and tap on your name at the top; the email address under your name is the email you should check.) In your inbox, you should have an email titled “Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement” from [email protected]. Check your spam folder if you don’t see it. Fill out the Siri settlement form Make sure you’ve checked all these boxes. Copy the claimant identification code and the confirmation code into the web form, then click Login. Next, you need to fill in your name, address, email address and phone number. Select between one and five for the number of eligible devices you have used between 2014 and 2024 that accidentally triggered Siri at some point. You can count models of iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, HomePod, Apple TV or even iPod Touch. You will need to provide proof of purchase for each item. (You must upload a PDF, TIF, JPG, GIF or PNG.) You can choose to receive payment via direct deposit or by an e-check to your email address. For the former, you just need to look up your bank’s routing number and your account number. Then, you need to check the three checkboxes confirming that you used a device with Siri, live in the United States and accidentally triggered Siri at some point while having a private conversation. Finally, type in your name and click Submit. Does the Apple Siri class-action lawsuit mean Siri isn’t private? A contractor, paid to listen to Siri conversations for quality testing, broke the story. They reported to The Guardian that they often hear recordings of private conversations and confidential meetings. This can happen when your devices think they heard you say “Hey, Siri” when you haven’t. It can also happen if you accidentally click the Digital Crown on your Apple Watch. A Siri class-action lawsuit was filed less than a month later. While Apple was always open about manually reviewing Siri recordings for testing, the plaintiffs argued that it was not fully outlined in Apple’s privacy policy. Apple, before settling the lawsuit, published an article explaining how data is (and isn’t) used. It “never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose.” It doesn’t link requests to your Apple Account, either. Instead, the system uses “a random identifier — a long string of letters and numbers associated with a single device” to “track of data while it’s being processed,” which is “unique among digital assistants in use today.” Siri is still the most privacy-conscious voice assistant — even if it’s far from the best, most accurate and most useful.
