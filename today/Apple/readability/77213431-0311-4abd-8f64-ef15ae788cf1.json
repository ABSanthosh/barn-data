  "text": "Amazon Prime Day is happening, offering fantastic discounts on tons of products and goods. You will need an Amazon Prime membership (it’s free for 30 days, so if you just want to do some holiday shopping and not pay for membership you can do that too), which is handy anyway since it offers access to Amazon Video, prioritized shipping, and great discounts. While you can shop for just about anything on Amazon and get great Prime Day discounts, we’ll highlight some of the best deals on Apple products and related gear that’s available right now. Apple Watch SE 2nd gen – $170 (down from $249) Apple Watch SE 2nd gen is available at a whopper discount from Amazon, and is a great entry level Apple Watch if you just want a fitness tracker for your activities, along with the standard array of Apple Watch features. One thing to keep in mind is that Apple Watch SE 2nd gen doesn’t have ECG capabilities or an oxygen reader, but the latter was removed from later model Apple Watch anyway due to an ongoing patent dispute, but if you don’t care for those features, you can save some serious cash and get the SE 2.   Apple Watch SE 2 – $169.99 (down from $249, various colors) iPad 9th gen for $199! The iPad 9th gen is one of the best deals on Prime Day, at just $199, down from the original $329 retail price. The 9th gen iPad is the last iPad model with a Home button, which could make it preferable for those who are accustomed or prefer the Home Button, and making it a great gift for anyone who fits that bill too. iPad 10″ 9th generation – $199 (down from $329) M2 iPad Air Discounts Amazon is also offering nice discount on the 13″ and 11″ iPad Air M2 models, if you want the latest and greatest, a beefier processor, larger screens, and Apple Intelligence support: M2 iPad Air 13″ – $749 (down from $799) M2 iPad Air 11″ – $550 (down from $599) iPad Mini 6th gen for $350 If you prefer the smaller size of iPad Mini, the 6th gen model is available at a whopping $150 discount. One thing to keep in mind with iPad Mini is that it’s likely to be updated soon with a processor that supports Apple Intelligence, so while this is a great deal, if you want Apple Intelligence support you might want to hold off until the refresh happens at some point. iPad Mini 6th gen – $349 (down from $499) 15″ M3 MacBook Air 16GB / 512GB for $250 Off The M3 MacBook Air with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD is available at a $250 discount on Amazon in both the 13″ and 15″ display sizes. This is a great price for a really great laptop, one I use myself, and the one that I generally recommend to family and friends as well. 15″ MacBook Air M3 – 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD – $1424 (down $270 from $1699) 13″ MacBook Air M3 – 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD – $1249 (down $250 from $1499) 13″ M2 MacBook Air 8/256 for $749! If you want a nice portable Mac laptop and don’t have the need for more storage, RAM, or CPU power, the base model M2 is available at huge discount. For some of you who may be debating an iPad vs MacBook, this is a great laptop alternative to many iPad models since it comes with more storage than base model iPads plus you get a built-in keyboard, trackpad, and the much more powerful MacOS. 13″ MacBook Air M2 – 8GB / 256GB SSD – $749 (down from $999) AirPods from $129 Want some nice wireless AirPods 3rd gen or AirPods Pro 2nd gen? Why pay full price when Amazon discounts them? AirPods Pro 2nd gen with USB-C Charging for $169 (down from $249) AirPods 3rd gen at $129 (down from $169) AirTags 4-pack for $79 AirTag personal trackers are available in a pack of four at $80: AirTags – 4-pack – $79 (down from $99) FTC: OSXDaily is an affiliate partner with Amazon, meaning if you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment which goes towards keeping the site running.",
