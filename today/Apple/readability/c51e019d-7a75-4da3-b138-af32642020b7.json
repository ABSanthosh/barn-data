  "text": "Google is offering their Gemini Advanced AI model for free to students, along with 2TB of free storage. This is a limited time offer where students must sign up by June 30, 2025. Students will need a valid .edu email address to be able to signup for the deal. Google says you can use Gemini Advanced for help with your writing, homework, exam preparation, creation of videos, and more. Students will also get 2TB of free storage for using with Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Photos. According to Google, the free access for an additional year, you’ll have to re-verify your student status, presumably with the .edu email address, before the next school year starts. Head over to Gemini.google Students to get access How long Google will offer the free Gemini Advanced AI access for students is unclear, but if you’re a student and want access to Gemini Advanced, this is worth checking out. Google Gemini has features similar to ChatGPT. While ChatGPT may be the most popular AI chatbot and tool by a long shot, it’s not the only game in town. Another chatbot is Google’s Gemini, which takes content from sites like this one and then rewrites it to show across search results, a “feature” that is so unpopular it spawned an entire alternative Google front-end to avoid the AI regurgitation (or you can use a little URL trick, or you can just skip using Google entirely since research shows Google is prioritizing ads over good search results, an intriguing claim, but something many Google users have probably noticed over the last few years in particular. If you’re interested in that subject, you might be curious about the following article, The Men Who Killed Google, which says “This is the story of how Google Search died, and the people responsible for killing it.” Previously, Google Gemini has been criticized for being absurdly woke and inaccurate, a problem that impacts many AI generators because of the ideological biases of who creates the technology and the training data used, as SAP explains: “Models can sometimes reflect the assumptions of the developers coding them, which causes them to favor certain outcomes. Additionally, AI bias can develop due to the data used to train the AI.” The significant bias of AI and LLM’s is important to be aware of when using the technologies, and there are no shortage of examples and discussions on this subject. These biases are not limited to Gemini, and are also found in ChatGPT and basically every other AI model, which is perhaps not surprising given they’re all products of Silicon Valley, they will reflect the opinions and ideologies of the people in that region. With all that said, Google Gemini is a very advanced AI model that surely has a lot of value especially as a free offering for students, as long as you understand it’s limitations, controversies, and biases, but if you’re a student you very well might appreciate getting free access to the advanced models.",
