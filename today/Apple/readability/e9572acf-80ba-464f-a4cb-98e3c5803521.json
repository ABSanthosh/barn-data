Photo: Cult of Mac Deals We bet you never saw a keyboard like Mobile Pixels’ ergonomic Tetra Keyboard. You can put the two halves of this split keyboard anywhere you want to maximize comfort. Plus, it comes with an 8-inch, customizable touchscreen that lets you tap shortcuts to save time and effort. Designed to transform typing and working habits, this sleek, portable device is great for anyone who spends a lot of time on a keyboard. For a limited time, you can grab one for just $269.98 with code TAKE40. That’s a hefty discount off the $399 list price. Mobile Pixels Tetra Keyboard: Ergonomic, comfortable and customizable Some people can type all day on a QWERTY keyboard and never experience any discomfort or pain. Other people, not so much. Standard ergonomic keyboards offer slight variations that can help. But the Tetra Keyboard splits completely in half so you can arrange the keys in a position that works best for your personal anatomy. If you put in long hours working and playing on the same keyboard, it’s important to make sure it’s a comfortable fit. That’s why Tetra’s ergonomics are so nice. The split layout lets you keep your wrists in a natural position to help reduce strain during long sessions. Plus, clever magnetic connectivity makes it easy to switch between modes, whether you’re using Split mode for maximum ergonomic benefit or Splice mode for a more compact setup. Game mode repositions the right half of the keyboard to leave more room for a mouse. Aside from the split keyboard design, the Tetra also features customizable hotkeys. That makes it easy to streamline your workflow. You can set up macros to perform repetitive tasks, launch apps instantly or execute commands with a single click. These programmable hotkeys are real timesavers for anyone juggling multiple tasks, whether working on projects, gaming or doing both at once. An 8-inch touchscreen gives you even more options Perhaps you noticed that your standard keyboard generally doesn’t come with its own 8-inch touchscreen display. You also might not have thought about just how nice such a thing is until you see how this one works. The Tetra Keyboard’s display — which is about the size of an iPad mini — functions as a secondary screen for shortcuts, music controls and more. Whether you’re switching between apps, managing tasks or just want some extra screen real estate, the display gives you a little more room to breathe without sacrificing more of your desk to add a second monitor.  It’s simple to use and serves as a hub for quick access to essential tools. Save on a Mobile Pixels Tetra ergonomic keyboard This innovative ergonomic keyboard give you plenty of options for making your work more efficient — and more comfortable. Do yourself a favor and grab a Mobile Pixels Tetra Keyboard for just $269.98 with code TAKE40. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
