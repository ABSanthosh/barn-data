  "description": "Macworld Because of its small size, the Mac mini is a favorite computer to tinker with for unique setups and situations. One person shows some ingenuity with the device by demonstrating in a YouTube video how he was able to modify the Mac mini so that it can be powered through a USB-C port instead of its power supply. In the video, Saad Ouache shows an open Mac mini with a wired USB-connector that he added and says uses Power Delivery to run the computer. He then connects a 12-volt battery power bank and proceeds to switch the power connection from the power cable to USB-C. While the video has not been verified, it doesn’t seem impossible to power the Mac mini via USB-C. However, the power demands of the device make it impractical. Apple’s documentation states that the M4 Mac mini has a maximum power consumption of 65W, while the M4 Pro Mac mini is at 140W. Those numbers are with a Mac mini with no devices connected to it. The maximum continuous power rating for the Mac mini is 155W, which comes into play when a connected device is not using an external power source and is relying on the USB-C connection to the Mac mini. None of this is surprising, of course. The MacBook Air and Pro already deliver power over USB-C, with the MacBook Pro powering an M4 Max and a 16-inch mini-LED display over USB-C. But Apple hasn’t yet offered a way to run its desktop Macs with USB-C power. As AppleInsider points out, for Apple to make a Mac mini that runs on USB-C power, the proper cable needs to be used, which would be a 240W USB-C Charge Cable. Using lower-rated cables would be possible, but that increases the risk of failure. This restriction doesn’t seem like one Apple would want the hassle of dealing with. But if you have a creative idea for a Mac mini and are looking for alternative ways to power the device on the go, Ouache’s video seems to prove it’s possible.",
