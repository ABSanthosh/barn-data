Preliminary numbers from IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker show Apple shipped 46.4 million iPhones worldwide in Q2. That was up 1.5% from 45.7 million units in 2024. The overall smartphone market grew 1% year over year. In total, the market reached 295.2 million units despite economic pressures and weak consumer demand in China. Apple saw shipments in China decline by 1% for the quarter. IDC analysts said local subsidies failed to lift demand for new smartphones, and the large 618 e-commerce event mostly helped clear old inventory. Despite that, Apple remained the top-selling brand during the promotion. Strong double-digit growth in emerging markets offset the dip in China and drove the company's modest overall increase. Competition in the global marketSamsung led the market with 58.0 million shipments, up 7.9% from the previous year. Sales were driven by the new Galaxy A36 and A56 models, which brought AI features to more affordable mid-range devices. Xiaomi shipped 42.5 million units for third place, while vivo and Transsion rounded out the top five. Top 5 smartphone brands worldwide by Q2 2025 shipments, market share, and annual growth (preliminary, in millions). Image credit: IDCIDC analysts noted that vendors are raising prices and adding AI capabilities to lower-cost phones to make up for slower sales. The strategy is particularly aimed at price-sensitive segments. Economic uncertainty, tariffs, and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on consumer spending. Despite those challenges, the smartphone market achieved its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Apple's strategy and outlookApple's second-quarter results show it depends on emerging markets to balance weaker sales in China. IDC reported a 1% drop in shipments in China, where subsidies failed to boost demand. Large shopping events mostly helped clear old inventory. Despite those challenges, Apple saw 1.5% global growth, supported by strong double-digit gains in emerging regions. The company has focused on selling premium smartphones in markets with expanding middle classes and more first-time buyers. IDC analysts say this shift helped Apple maintain growth and will remain important as competition increases in established markets.",
