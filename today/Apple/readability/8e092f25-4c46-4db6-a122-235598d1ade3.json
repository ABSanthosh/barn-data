Apple will donate to relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Milton, according to a post on Thursday by the company's CEO Tim Cook. Just weeks after the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton has caused more widespread damage, large scale power outages, and catastrophic flooding across many parts of Florida. Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that Apple plans to donate an undisclosed amount to relief efforts. Cook made the announcement via the social media platform X, on Thursday. He made a similar donation announcement in the case of Hurricane Helene, as Apple often donates to relief efforts following natural disasters. In 2022, Apple donated to relief efforts for Hurricane Ian. Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the devastation of Hurricane Milton. To everyone still in harm's way, please stay safe. Apple will be making a donation to help with relief efforts on the ground.— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 10, 2024 At least 12 people lost their lives as a result of the hurricane as of this publication, though the total death toll is likely to rise in the near future as more casualties are uncovered by rescuers. On Wednesday, Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Siesta Key, Florida. Dangerous wind gusts of more than 120 mph were recorded in the area. This comes merely two weeks after the massive destruction caused by Hurricane Helene. Apple often donates to disaster relief, like in May of 2024, Tim Cook stated that the company would make a donation to relief efforts for those affected by floods in Brazil. In 2023, Apple donated to wildlife relief efforts in Maui.",
