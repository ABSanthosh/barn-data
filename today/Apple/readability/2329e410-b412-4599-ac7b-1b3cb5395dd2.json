  "text": "Father’s Day is around the corner, and if you’re looking to pick up an Apple gift for your dad this year – I’ve got a number of great recommendations that won’t quite break the bank. Despite not being Black Friday, there are still a number of noteworthy deals at this time of year – all of which offer Prime delivery and will arrive with plenty of time to spare. AirPods Pro 2 AirPods Pro 2 are, in short, a marvel. With 6 hours of battery life per listening session, incredible active noise cancellation and transparency mode, stellar sound quality, and intuitive iOS integration – they’re some of the best headphones you can buy. If your dad hasn’t quite made the switch to wireless earbuds, or is still utilizing an older pair of AirPods, I’d say AirPods Pro 2 are a worthy upgrade. Buy AirPods Pro 2 on Amazon – $169 ($80 off!) For a cheaper offering, you can also consider AirPods 4 for $99. Powerbeats Pro 2 If your dad is more of an athlete, you can consider picking up some Powerbeats Pro 2. Released earlier this year, these headphones come in four stunning colors, a ton of battery life, and a first-of-a-kind heart rate monitor. You’ll also have the same great iOS integration as AirPods, and thanks to the ear hook design – they won’t fall out very easily. Buy Powerbeats Pro 2 on Amazon – $199 ($50 off!) While not as athletic, you can also consider Beats Solo Buds or Beats Studio Buds+ for cheaper Beats options. AirTag Everyone loses things from time to time, and AirTags help you find things. A next generation model is rumored to be around the corner, which also means current-generation AirTags are on rather steep discounts. With AirTags, you can leverage Apple’s billions of active devices and its Find My network to have a great idea of where you lost something. Plus, with Precision Finding – you can have an exact pin point location of where something is once you’re in close distance of it. This comes in handy if you lose something indoors, for example. AirTags normally run $29 individually, but if you buy a 4-pack during this sale, you can scoop up AirTags for just under $19 each. Buy AirTag (individual) on Amazon – $22.98 ($7 off!) Buy AirTag (4-pack) on Amazon – $74.99 ($20 off!) To get some key rings to go with your AirTags, I’d highly recommend taking a look at Belkin’s offering. Also, if you want your AirTags to have a 10 year battery life – you can check out Elevation Lab’s custom AirTag battery. iPad 11 Many might not realize it, but Apple actually makes one of the most affordable tablets on the market. The iPad 11 packs at least 128GB of storage, an A16 chip, a crisp Liquid Retina display, and a unique 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage on the front. It also charges with USB-C and comes in four fun colors. While this is one of the more pricier offerings on the list, I still think it’s worth mentioning. This iPad normally comes in at $349, but it’s on sale for $299 currently. Buy iPad (A16, 128GB) on Amazon – $299 ($50 off!) Buy iPad (A16, 256GB) on Amazon – $399 ($50 off!) Apple Watch Series 10 Last but not least, Apple Watch. Whether you’re looking to have a greater grasp on your health, just want a nice way to manage notifications, or even want to partially replace your phone with a cellular model – Apple Watch is a great product and an easy gift. With the new Vitals app in watchOS 11, you can often even find out you’re sick before you can feel the symptoms. Series 10 introduced a new, thinner design – and comes in a sleek new Jet Black color. Plus, you get all of the great Apple Watch health offerings like the ECG scanner, heart rate monitoring, and so on. Apple Watch Series 10 models in the US currently don’t support blood oxygen detection due to a patent dispute. Buy Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS) on Amazon – $299 Buy Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, Cellular) on Amazon – $399 Buy Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS) on Amazon – $329 Buy Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, Cellular) on Amazon – $429 Apple also offers the Apple Watch SE at a more affordable price point with all of the Apple Watch essentials.
