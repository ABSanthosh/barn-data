  "text": "Today, we’re expanding our podcast AppStories to include video on YouTube. AppStories debuted in 2017, and with over 400 episodes recorded, it’s long past due for a video version. So beginning today, you can watch AppStories on the MacStories YouTube channel: Today’s episode was a great place to start because Federico and I discussed his iPad mini review, and in the video version, he was able to show off the hardware in a way that isn’t possible in the audio-only version. It’s safe to say that bringing AppStories to YouTube is a good sign that our YouTube channel has graduated from an experiment to a full-fledged component of MacStories. If you haven’t subscribed to the channel yet, you can check it out and subscribe here. It’s not a conventional YouTube channel by any stretch, and as I recently discussed with Robb on Ruminate, it’s not meant to be. The purpose of the channel is to reach podcast listeners we wouldn’t have otherwise, enhance the experience for listeners of our shows, and add a new dimension to what we do on MacStories.net – and soon, Club MacStories – which it has accomplished more and more with each passing week. If you’re curious about AppStories on YouTube, you can subscribe to just the show or the whole channel, which also includes the video versions of Comfort Zone and NPC: Next Portable Console; podcast bonus material for NPC; audio versions of Ruminate, Magic Rays of Light, and MacStories Unwind; playlists of classic AppStories episodes; and a growing collection of MacStories videos. It should go without saying that the audio versions of our podcasts aren’t going anywhere, but I always hear concerns that the video version of a show will wreck the audio-only version. It won’t. AppStories in particular has been an audio-first podcast for seven years, so that’s not changing; but if you want to watch AppStories, now you can. Thanks to everyone who has subscribed to the MacStories YouTube channel and tried our podcasts there. If you haven’t checked out the channel in a while, stop by sometime. It’s changed a lot since we launched it in June, and we’re not finished building it out yet. We have plenty of plans yet to come, including a little bonus for Club members later this week. Access Extra Content and PerksFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week for nearly a decade. What started with weekly and monthly email newsletters has blossomed into a family of memberships designed every MacStories fan. Learn more here and from our Club FAQs. Club MacStories: Weekly and monthly newsletters via email and the web that are brimming with apps, tips, automation workflows, longform writing, early access to the MacStories Unwind podcast, periodic giveaways, and more; Club MacStories+: Everything that Club MacStories offers, plus an active Discord community, advanced search and custom RSS features for exploring the Club’s entire back catalog, bonus columns, and dozens of app discounts; Club Premier: All of the above and AppStories+, an extended version of our flagship podcast that’s delivered early, ad-free, and in high-bitrate audio. John is MacStories’ Managing Editor, has been writing about Apple and apps since joining the team in 2015, and today, runs the site alongside Federico. John also co-hosts four MacStories podcasts: AppStories, which covers the world of apps, MacStories Unwind, which explores the fun differences between American and Italian culture and recommends media to listeners, Ruminate, a show about the weird web and unusual snacks, and NPC: Next Portable Console, a show about the games we take with us.",
