That’s where MagSafe hits home for me—simplifying charging without needing a bunch of cables in my travel bag. Since its release with the iPhone 12, it’s been my go-to way to charge everything. Whether heading out for a weekend getaway or a quick work trip, building a MagSafe “go-bag” travel kit guarantees your iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods are charged up and ready to go. Let’s look at what you need in your travel bag for MagSafe. MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging. Mobile MagSafe battery packs When you’re on the go, a great MagSafe battery pack is table-stakes for your travel kit. These snap-on chargers keep your iPhone powered up without the hassle of extra cables. The best ones have a slim profile (depending on how big you want it to be), fast charging, and bonus features like Qi2 support, LED displays, or kickstands. MagSafe battery pack ensures you’re always ready to snap photos, navigate, or stay connected. Here are some of my favorite MagSafe battery packs: UGREEN Magnetic Power Bank with Qi2 ESR for MagSafe Power Bank, Kickstand 10,000mAh MagSafe Portable Charge with Qi2 Anker 321 MagGo Battery Anker 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo), 5,000mAh Foldable Magnetic Wireless Portable Charger with Stand and USB-C Port Travel MagSafe nightstand chargers A good night’s sleep in a hotel should also result in a charged iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, and a travel-friendly MagSafe nightstand charger makes it easy. Compact, foldable designs are awesome for traveling, and MagSafe compatibility eliminates the need for a bunch of different cables and chargers. Here are some good options: Belkin MagSafe-Compatible iPhone Charger, 2-in-1 Magnetic Foldable Charger 15W – Qi2-Certified Foldable 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Station for Apple Compatible with Magsafe Charger Stand Fast Wireless Charger, Magnetic Foldable 3 in 1 Charging Station Twelve South Butterfly 2-in-1 Compact Foldable Wireless Charger with Travel Adapter MagSafe charging cables Sometimes, simple is what you need. A reliable MagSafe charging cable is the perfect solution when you all need a straightforward way to charge your iPhone and AirPods without any extra charge. They’re great when you want to keep your setup light and uncomplicated. Don’t forget the USB-C wall adapter! Of course, this won’t charge the Apple Watch, though. Apple MagSafe Charger 3 in 1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad Anker MagSafe Charger Pad ESR for Magsafe Charger, Wireless Charger Kickstand Wrap up Traveling shouldn’t bring the hassle of dead Apple devices. The Delta app and Uber app are pretty useless if your iPhone is dead. MagSafe is the perfect technology to keep it simple (not needing to carry around chargers for all of your devices) while making it easy to grab a quick charge in the car, at the airport, etc).
