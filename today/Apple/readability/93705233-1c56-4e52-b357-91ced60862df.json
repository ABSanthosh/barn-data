  "text": "Many people enjoy ambient background sounds of nature while working, studying, cooking, projects, meditating, focusing, amongst many other activities, and if you’re in that camp you’ll likely appreciate a fun little site called tree.fm. The tree.fm site allows you to listen to sounds of forests from around the world, and you can skip and shuffle around to different locations with just a click. People around the world have recorded these sounds, and in some cases included a picture themselves, allowing anyone to tune in and hear what a lovely forest in Germany, Borneo, Ecuador, Alberta, upstate New York, or just about anywhere else around the world. If you’re dreaming of nature but you’re at a desk, you’re sure to appreciate this fun little web app. As the project describes itself: “you can escape into nature, and unwind wherever you are. Take a breath and soak in the forest sounds as they breathe with life and beauty!” All you need is a web browser, so turn up your volume, check out the site, and explore, listen, and enjoy: Check out https://www.tree.fm/ Separately, you can also use a world map to investigate and listen to sounds of forests with a Sounds of the Forest Soundmap (https://timberfestival.org.uk/soundsoftheforest-soundmap/), if you’d prefer that method of browsing around global forests and jungles, which is a separate project but some of the audio from Sounds of the Forest also are utilized by tree.fm. Will this revolutionarize your life? Probably not, but it does provide for some lovely background ambient sounds that are very pleasing to listen to while you do other things. By the way, if you have a Homepod you can play background ambient sounds with that too, and the iPhone has some ambient music, as well as a neat background sounds feature that is available on Mac, iPhone, and iPad as well.",
