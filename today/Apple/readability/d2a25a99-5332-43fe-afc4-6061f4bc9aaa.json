  "text": "News The OWC Guardian encrypted portable SSD unlocks with its own color touchscreen. Photo: OWC The OWC Guardian stands out from the pack of SSDs with built-in hardware encryption unlocked with its own touchscreen. No special software is needed. The USB-C drive works with a variety of computers, offers fast data transfers and is available in up to 4 TB of capacity. OWC Guardian SSD added terabytes of secure storage Your computer’s storage is wonderful but not unlimited. And while iCloud and other online storage options are a popular alternative, they’re inherently less secure. A typical portable SSD adds convenient capacity; it might not be the best choice for storing files that you want kept private. The OWC Guardian portable SSD offers terabytes of additional storage capacity, and what’s held on it gets secured with 256-bit AES OPAL hardware encryption to automatically encrypt data during writing and decrypt it upon authorized access. Some rival encrypted drives require software to access the contents, limiting the types of devices that can use the SSD. With the OWC Guardian, encryption/decryption happens on the drive. And it’s unlocked by typing a PIN or passphrase on the drive’s color touchscreen. This means it’s possible to, for example, unlock the Guardian, then transfer files to a client without installing special software on their computer. Or use a standard TV to view images or video otherwise securely stored on the drive. Neither is an option with secure drives that require unlocking software to access. “We designed the OWC Guardian for anyone who needs simple, reliable data protection on the go, but without the typical hassles,” said Larry O’Connor, CEO and Founder, Other World Computing (OWC). “Whether you’re transferring a huge file in the boardroom, backing up data at the local coffee shop, or editing a 4K video for your latest content drop, you shouldn’t have to choose between security, speed, and ease of use. The OWC Guardian delivers all three, in a rugged, intuitive design built to travel.” Wide compatibility Because the SSD connects via USB-C and requires no special software, it works with Macs, iPads, even iPhones. Plus Windows, Android, etc. Which device is used has no effect on the encryption. It uses USB 3.2, and OWC promises up to 1000 MBps real-world read and write speeds for quickly moving large files. OWC Guardian price and availability The OWC Guardian can be ordered now. The price varies by storage capacity. It starts at $219.99 for 1.0TB, $329.99 for 2.0TB, and $529.99 for 4.0TB. Buy from: OWC An alternative encrypted SSD with built-in keypad is the Kingston Ironkey Keypad 200 or Ironkey Keypad 200C.",
