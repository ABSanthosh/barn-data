This year he paired up with Sam Perez to mount the new phone on a drone to include airborne shots – and, of course, included some extra-slo-mo footage to highlight the new 120fps 4K capture capabilities … Helms says that everything was shot on the iPhone 16 Pro in ProRes LOG 4K, then edited in Final Cut Pro X. As usual, he’ll follow-up with a behind-the-scenes video showing how it was shot. While consumer drones have built-in cameras, beefier models allow you to mount a separate camera to them. This can range from a small mirrorless camera to a professional DSLR or cinema camera. Or, in this case, an iPhone. For my tastes, the drone shots make up too much of the completed video. For me the joy of these videos is that they demonstrate what can be done with nothing more than the iPhone and an insane amount of talent. Very few iPhone owners have access to a drone of this calibre. But there’s certainly no question that the drone shots make for an even more spectacular result. We’ll have some thoughts on the new iPhone from the filmmaker in a subsequent piece, but for now sit back and enjoy … Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
