  "text": "As we’ve seen, iOS 18.2 adds a lot of new features, and there are more with the second beta released this week. Although most of them are related to Apple Intelligence, there are some other interesting changes too. One of them is the ability to trust a new computer with the iPhone and iPad using Face ID. Apple makes it easier to trust a new computer on iOS As noted by Aaron Perris on X, the latest beta of iOS 18.2 now lets users trust a new computer with Face ID when they plug their iPhone or iPad into an unknown computer. Previously, this was only possible by entering the device’s passcode. Apple added the “Trust This Computer” prompt in 2013 with iOS 7 as a way of preventing hackers from accessing device data via USB when they don’t have the user’s passcode. Since iOS 16, the alert also appears when the device is connected to trusted computers if local automatic backup is enabled. It’s worth noting that users can reset their trusted computer settings by going to Settings \u003e General \u003e Transfer or Reset and then tapping the Reset Location \u0026 Privacy option. More about iOS 18.2 Apple began testing iOS 18.2 even before releasing iOS 18.1 to the public. The update is a big one and brings many new features related to Apple Intelligence, including Genmoji, Image Playground, ChatGPT integration and Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 models. It also makes it easier to manage default apps and expands Apple Intelligence to more countries. According to Apple, iOS 18.2 will be released to the public in December. A beta version is available exclusively to developers for now. Spot any changes in this week’s release of iOS 18.2 beta 2 or iPadOS 18.2 beta 2?
