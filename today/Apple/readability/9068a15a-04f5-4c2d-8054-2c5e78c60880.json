Other people need a mechanical keyboard, while others find the clickiness distracting. I have even seen people consider just a laptop on the move as their ideal setup, while others need a dedicated office space. So I wanted to share some of my ideal desk setup accessories that I have recently added that have helped create my personal perfect M4 Mac mini and M4 iPad Pro desk setup. Be sure to leave links to your favorite accessories in the comments! In this article, I am going to highlight some of the newer accessories I added that I absolutely love, but if you want to see a rundown of every single aspect, then check out the video below! Ugmonk Gather Collection This group of accessories is what really inspired me to completely change the look and feel of my desk. Ugmonk is known for making premium, minimalistic, and highly functional desk and productivity accessories. The Gather collection was the perfect new base for what I wanted to do. Every product in the collection is aesthetically pleasing, extremely well-built, multifunctional, and modular, and my favorite part is using magnets! The centerpiece is the Large Monitor Stand Made of powder-coated steel and lined with wool felt Solid maple wood Holds up to 35lbs Toolless assembly Four different color combinations (White/Maple shown below) As I mentioned, this is the centerpiece, but I also included a few pieces from the collection to help complete the look. Below are some of the other items I went with. Keep in mind that all these have the same fit, feel and finish. Gather 1×4 Premium Organizer Set Gather Headphone Stand Gather Small Tray I cannot recommend this brand enough. I was a bit hesitant at first due to the price point of some of the products. But once you get the products and feel the material, you instantly realize why the price is what it is. It is also all made in the US. So, if you are looking to add some form and function to your desk setup, I recommend checking out Ugmonk, from their smaller productivity accessories to the entire collection. BlueAnt Soundblade I have my Sonos Ace headphones, which are currently $100 off, for when I need to lock in and block out noise, but if I wanted to play something out loud, I needed something. I wanted to avoid the usual stereo speaker setup. That is where the Soundblade comes in. The form factor is extremely unique. It was meant to be used with the iMac as a monitor riser and speaker combo, but for my setup, it fits perfectly on my Ugmonk monitor riser. Here are the specs: Power Output: 120 watts peak power Sound configuration: 2.1 channel sound Subwoofer: 1 x Built-in 80mm Neodymium subwoofer Drivers: 2 x Full range dual voice coil, dual Neodymium magnet drivers Connectivity Options: USB-C, Bluetooth 5.3 \u0026 AUX connectivity Switch between PC USB-C connectivity One-touch control on the unit comes with remote control It is so easy to just plug in and play. I use it connected to my Mac mini via USB-C but it can be used via Bluetooth or even AUX cable. Sotsu Elite 16 I recently made a video comparing this Sotsu Elite 16 vs the Espresso 17 Pro to see which was the best portable monitor out right now. Both are great options, but right now, I am actually using this Sotsu monitor as a vertically oriented secondary display. I am a big fan of the look, aesthetic, and overall build. Essentiall looks like a 16in iPad on a stand that Apple might have made. Since there are magnets on the monitor riser, the Sotsu display can be magnetically held down. 4k 16:10 display 450 nit brightness 1200:1 contrast ratio 100% of DCI-P3 color gamut 60Hz Single cable solution No external power is needed 925g in weight 2 USB-C ports, mini HDMI and SD card slot This is currently under pre-order, with shipments coming in March! Satechi M4 Mac mini hub This was a new and highly anticipated addition to the desk setup. Satechi recently released their M4 Mac mini hub that adds a few more ports that were removed from this new M4 Mac mini design. These are the added ports: Host cable – USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 SD Card Reader – up to 312 MB/s (4.0 UHS-II) 2 USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 – up to 10Gbps USB-A 2.0 – up to 480Mbps M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure – up to 10Gbps 2230/ 2242/ 2260/ 2280 SSDs It is well-built, fits the Apple aesthetic, and just fits flawlessly under the monitor stand. Orbit Key Desk Mat This desk mat is truly a game changer, offering multiple functions. First off, it features high-quality vegan leather that not only elevates your workspace but also provides a smooth surface for all your peripherals, making mouse movements easy. There is also this clever railing along the top of the mat, which includes a magnetic divot for securely holding your Apple pencils so they never get lost, plus a magnetic cable organizer. The design extends to its layered construction, with a felt bottom that protects your desk from smudges while giving you a handy spot to store loose-leaf items like brochures and printouts. It’s cool how companies continue to innovate with something as simple as a desk mat. It comes in multiple colors and sizes as well! Final thoughts As I stated in the beginning, desk setups are never really finished. There is always a new, faster hub, nicer mouse, or better lighting that will tempt you and eventually get added to your setup. The important thing is how you use these accessories and how it makes you feel to sit down and get your work done. Every morning, when I get to my desk, I am excited to get to work because everything is set up how I want it. So hopefully these accessories are something you can take a look at and maybe add just one to your current space. What is your favorite accessory on your desk? What is something you can live without? I would love to know what you have going on! Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",

So, if you are looking to add some form and function to your desk setup, I recommend checking out Ugmonk, from their smaller productivity accessories to the entire collection. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;imageId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;67b28c3295547\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4284\" height=\"5712\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-id=\"990413\" src=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?quality=82\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=768\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg 4284w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=98,130 98w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=525,700 525w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=263,350 263w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=140,187 140w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=750,1000 750w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=640,853 640w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8649.jpg?resize=150,200 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4284px) 100vw, 4284px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;imageId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;67b28c3295a5c\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"4284\" height=\"5712\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-id=\"990414\" src=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?quality=82\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=768\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg 4284w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=98,130 98w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=525,700 525w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=263,350 263w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=140,187 140w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=750,1000 750w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=640,853 640w, https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/02/IMG_8648.jpg?resize=150,200 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 4284px) 100vw, 4284px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"h-blueant-soundblade\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/4b0glxS\"\u003eBlueAnt Soundblade\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have my \u003ca href=\"https://amzn.to/4b0glxS\"\u003eSonos Ace headphones, which are currently $100 off,\u003c/a\u003e for when I need to lock in and block out noise, but if I wanted to play something out loud, I needed something.

There is also this clever railing along the top of the mat, which includes a magnetic divot for securely holding your Apple pencils so they never get lost, plus a magnetic cable organizer. The design extends to its layered construction, with a felt bottom that protects your desk from smudges while giving you a handy spot to store loose-leaf items like brochures and printouts.
