  "text": "Today, TikTok announced AI Alive, an AI filter that will allow users to animate static photos through prompts. ByteDance says that this new image-to-video feature undergoes multiple checks to avoid misuse, and its output will be labeled as AI-generated. Here’s how to use it. AI Alive is accessible through TikTok’s Story Camera. After the user selects a photo from the Story Album, they see a new “AI Alive” icon alongside the traditional editing tools. Once tapped, the interface displays a text box in which the user can prompt the model with a description of what they want to happen in the photo-turned-video. As described by TikTok: Imagine capturing a serene sunset photo and effortlessly turning it into a cinematic clip: the sky gradually shifts hues, clouds drift lazily, and ambient sounds of waves crashing in the distance bring the scene to life. Or take a group selfie and bring it to life as a lively, animated memory that highlights the subtle gestures and expressions of friends or family. AI Alive unlocks these creative possibilities, taking everyday content to the next level. Addressing possible trust and safety concerns, TikTok stressed the security steps it takes to curb abuse. It also said that all videos created by AI Alive will embed C2PA metadata, currently the closest thing to an industry standard for labeling AI-generated media. Oddly enough, TikTok didn’t share a video showcasing the feature in action, but it shouldn’t take long for users to see them in their TikTok feed.
