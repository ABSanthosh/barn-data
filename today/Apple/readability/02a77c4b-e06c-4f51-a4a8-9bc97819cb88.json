  "text": "Daily deals Wear your Apple Watch charger on your wrist with the PowerBand. Photo: Cult of Mac Deals The PowerBand is a sporty Apple Watch band that comes with a built-in magnetic Apple Watch charger. The clever design will help you deal with two of the smartwatch’s most annoying shortcomings: its so-so battery life and the fact that you can only top up the Apple Watch battery using a specific type of charger. Right now, you can snag a PowerBand for only $39.99 (regularly $49.99). That’s less than the cost of many Apple Watch bands that don’t come with a secret charger built in. PowerBand: A hidden Apple Watch charger on your wrist Compatible with any Apple Watch, the PowerBand is constructed from an elastic nylon weave with an ultra-thin feel. Designed to fit almost any size wrist, a simple tug on its straps will adjust it. That makes it easy to secure a comfortable fit. What’s most astonishing about the PowerBand is its built-in magnetic charger. Ingeniously integrated into the band itself, it boasts an ultra-thin, lightweight design. And it’s made of aluminum for extra durability. To charge your Apple Watch, just flip out the PowerBand’s hidden USB connector. (Don’t worry: It’s both rugged and flexible.) Then you simply connect the PowerBand’s charger to a power adapter or your MacBook. Put your Apple Watch on the charger, and you’re on your way to a full battery. Save on an Apple Watch band with a built-in charging pad The PowerBand stands out as an incredible solution for those who need to stay connected without feeling weighed down. Find out why wearing an Apple Watch charger on your wrist proves much more convenient than toting around yet another cable. Grab the PowerBand Apple Watch band with a built-in wireless charging pad for just $39.99 for a limited time. That’s 20% off the regular price of $49.99.
