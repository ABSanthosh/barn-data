  "text": "The latest versions of MacOS make it easier than ever to use Type to Siri, but many Mac users are finding themselves accidentally triggering the ‘Type to Siri’ feature on their Mac running the latest MacOS Sequoia releases. This can be frustrating, and if you don’t use Siri or Type To Siri you might not want this feature to activate at all, so as Mac user you might be wondering how to disable Type to Siri and prevent it from activating unintentionally. Curiously, MacOS Sequoia does not have a settings toggle available to directly turn off Type to Siri on the Mac. That doesn’t mean you can’t disable the feature though, so read on to learn more about how to handle this. How to Turn Off Type to Siri on Mac with MacOS Sequoia You have a few different options available to disable the Type To Siri feature on MacOS Sequoia. One option is to disable Siri in general, whether or not you disable Apple Intelligence (and yes you can disable Siri but keep Apple Intelligence enabled). With Siri disabled, the Type to Siri function will not turn on or activate at any time. Here’s how to do that: From the  Apple menu, go to “System Settings” Choose “Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri” Toggle off the setting for “Siri” This will disable Type to Siri on the Mac, as well as Siri in general. You’ll notice that there is not a direct toggle for simply disabling Type to Siri in MacOS Sequoia while keeping Siri enabled broadly, which seems like a strange oversight, so perhaps that will arrive in a future MacOS version. This is different from earlier versions of MacOS, which did have a direct toggle for the setting in Accessibility. But what if you want to disable Type to Siri and keep Siri enabled? That brings us to our next option. Option 2: Disabling Type to Siri on Mac by Obscurity The other option for disabling Type To Siri on Mac is to change the keyboard shortcut to activate the feature to something obscure that you will not accidentally trigger. If you want to keep Siri enabled in general but not use Type to Siri, this is the best approach currently in MacOS Seqouia. This does not actually disable the feature entirely, since that is not directly possible at the moment, but it does make it so the you won’t trigger the feature. From the  Apple menu, go to “System Settings” Choose “Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri” Click the menu next to “Keyboard Shortcut” and choose “Customize” Enter in the most obscure keyboard shortcut combination you can think of, using as many modifier keys as possible. The more complex the less likely it will be accidentally triggered This approach works because a complex keyboard shortcut is harder to unintentionally activate, unlike the default setting of pressing the Command key twice, or globe+S, both of which are very easy to activate accidentally. It is likely that a future version of MacOS will bring a direct settings toggle to disable Type to Siri while still allowing for broader Siri functionality, just like it used to have, but until that happens, use either of the above tricks to turn off the feature on the Mac. By the way, you can make similar adjustments to Type to Siri on iPhone or iPad if you’d like. Do you use Type to Siri on Mac? Did you turn the feature off using the tricks above, or did you find another method? What do you think? Let us know your experiences in the comments.",
