  "description": "Macworld Apple on Monday released iPadOS 17.7.8, an update for older iPads that cannot run iPadOS 18. The 17.7.8 update is for the first-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro, the second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the sixth-generation iPad. The update addresses an issue where iPads running iPadOS 17.7.7 did not allow users to log into an app. The release note states that the update includes “important security fixes,” but Apple’s security releases document states that iPadOS 17.7.8 has no published CVE entries–in other words, the update doesn’t address anything recorded in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database. To install the update, open the Settings app and go to Software Update. You will need an internet connection, and the iPad will need to restart. The current version of iPadOS is 18.5, which was released last week. However, Apple does release updates to older operating systems, such as iPadOS 17, when functionality is impaired, serious bugs have been addressed, or vital security patches are available.",
