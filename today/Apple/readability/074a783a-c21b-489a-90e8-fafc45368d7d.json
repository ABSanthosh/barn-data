Photo: Ugreen Ugreen hopes to make waves at CES 2025 with a lineup of cutting-edge products incorporating artificial intelligence and advanced connectivity — especially AI-powered NAS storage devices, the company said Sunday. Moving from a product lineup dominated by small chargers to a broader selection of tech wares, Ugreen unveils its latest products under the theme “Activate the Possibility of AI.” Ugreen will showcase its new NASync iDX6011 and iDX6011 Pro AI-powered network-attached storage (NAS) devices at CES. These systems integrate large language models (LLMs) for enhanced natural language processing and interactive capabilities. Powered by Intel Core Ultra Processors, the new NASync models build upon the success of their predecessors. The first wave of products raised more than $6.6 million in a Kickstarter campaign last year, Ugreen said. Thanks to a “powerful local AI model, the series supports a variety of new features including AI chat, smart meeting summarization, smart tags and AI search,” Ugreen noted. “These features enhance data management, streamline workflows and boost productivity, marking a new era of intelligent NAS solutions.” To delve deeper into the technology, Ugreen will host a panel discussion on January 8 at its booth (#30525) in the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The discussion will feature industry experts including Intel’s China Tech Ecosystem Sales Director Alan Bao, Ugreen NAS Product Manager Markus Xie, NASCompares founder Robert Andrews and Western Digital’s Director of HDD Marketing Brian Mallari. Super-powerful Nexode fast charger and Revdock TB5 dock The new Ugreen Nexode charger is a beast, with 500 watts of power.Photo: Ugreen Beyond storage solutions, Ugreen introduces its Nexode 500W 6-Port GaN Desktop Fast Charger. This powerful device — Ugreen said it’s the first 500-watt charger of its kind — can simultaneously charge multiple high-powered devices. Those could include e-bikes and power tools. And it delivers up to 240 watts through its single-port PD 3.1 protocol. The company will also showcase the Revodok Max 2131 Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station. It features an impressive 80Gbps bidirectional bandwidth and an enhanced mode supporting up to 120Gbps. This advancement enables faster data transfer rates and superior video output capabilities. Genshin Impact game integration A character named Kinich in game “Genshin Impact” will figure into future Ugreen products.Photo: Genshin Impact In a move it called “unexpected,” Ugreen announced a collaboration with the popular game Genshin Impact. The partnership will result in a new line of co-branded products inspired by the character Kinich. They’re scheduled for release in the first half of 2025. The company provided no other details. Ugreen’s showcase at CES 2025 marks a step in its evolution from a charging accessories manufacturer to a comprehensive technology solutions provider, with emphasis on AI-driven storage solutions and high-power charging capabilities.
