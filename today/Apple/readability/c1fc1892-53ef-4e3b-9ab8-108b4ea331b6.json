  "text": "News Apple's planning a big push into smart homes in 2025, and HomePods will be part of it. Image: Cult of Mac Apple’s significant expansion of its smart home lineup in 2025 should include new HomePod and HomePod mini models. The company plans to introduce both a display-equipped HomePod and a refreshed HomePod mini amid a renewed focus on the smart home market. As usual, you can expect Apple to emphasize quality audio as well as airtight security. Here’s what to expect from HomePod and HomePod mini in 2025. While questions remain about specific features and capabilities — particularly regarding Siri improvements and integration with Apple’s broader AI initiatives — the 2025 HomePod lineup represents Apple’s most significant push into the smart home market since the original HomePod’s debut. With a radically upgraded new HomePod model and a refined version of its popular HomePod mini variant, Apple looks poised to challenge competitors in the increasingly important smart home space. New display-equipped HomePod: A smart home hub reimagined A new HomePod with a display could serve as a smart-home hub.Image: Cult of Mac The most anticipated addition to the HomePod family is a new full-size model featuring a 6- to 7-inch display, reportedly scheduled for release after Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in the third quarter of 2025. According to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the device represents a strategic repositioning of the HomePod product line, with an increased emphasis on smart home functionalities. Apple’s A18 processor will power the new display-equipped HomePod and support Apple Intelligence features and advanced smart home capabilities. The device’s development has reportedly faced multiple delays. Initially planned for 2024, Apple pushed it back to early 2025 and finally to post-WWDC25, thanks to ongoing software development efforts. First update in 4 years for HomePod mini HomePod mini’s 2025 update will be its first in four years.Photo: Leander Kahney/Cult of Mac HomePod mini is also due for its first refresh since its November 2020 debut, according to reports in Bloomberg and elsewhere. The updated model reportedly will feature Apple’s custom-designed “Proxima” chip, combining Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. This marks a significant shift as Apple moves away from third-party vendors like Broadcom for key device components. The new HomePod mini will most likely support Wi-Fi 6E. That will offer faster wireless connectivity compared to the current model’s Wi-Fi 4. While Apple’s first-generation Wi-Fi chip may not initially match Broadcom’s solutions in terms of performance, reports suggest it will enable Apple’s smart home devices to work more closely together and synchronize data more quickly. Other anticipated HomePod mini improvements in 2025 include: A newer “S” series chip replacing the aging S5 processor. Enhanced sound quality. A second-generation Ultra Wideband chip for improved Handoff experience. Fresh color options to complement existing choices. Changes reflecting Apple’s broader smart home strategy. Apple updates its smart home strategy with new HomePods in 2025 and beyond The 2025 HomePod models are part of Apple’s larger strategy to strengthen its position in the smart home market. And the company is reportedly developing additional products. Those include a smart home IP camera expected in 2026 that will integrate tightly with the new HomePod lineup. The introduction of Apple’s custom Proxima chip across its device ecosystem, starting with the HomePod mini and Apple TV in 2025, suggests a long-term commitment to creating a more integrated and efficient smart home experience. This vertical integration could lead to better performance and more seamless interactions between Apple’s smart home products.",
