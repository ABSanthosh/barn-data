  "description": "Macworld Apple upgraded its MagSafe Charger from 15W to 25W at the iPhone 16 launch last fall, giving it an edge over third-party magnetic chargers and stands. That’s no longer the case with the latest release from Ugreen. Ugreen has announced that its MagFlow Magnetic Power Bank is the world’s first to receive official Qi 2.2 certification from the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) to hit the same 25W peak as Apple’s own charger. Of course, Apple’s charger is based on the company’s own MagSafe technology, which provided the foundation for Qi2. Until now, more-efficient magnetic wireless charging has largely been for iPhones only, but Qi 2.2 looks like it will extend into the Android world with both Samsung and Google getting behind it. The new Qi 2.2 standard ensures not only a broader compatibility of devices that support the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP), but also improves thermal control, power management, and charging stability. Thus, faster charging is made possible through easier magnetic alignment of charging coils, so less power is wasted in the transfer from charger to phone. Ugreen Ugreen expects its 25W magnetic power bank to start shipping in the “next three months”, alongside other Qi 2.2 wireless products in that range. The 10000mAh Qi 2.2 MagFlow magnetic power bank also boasts a built-in USB-C charger for when even 25W wireless charging isn’t fast enough. Apple’s MagSafe Charger has been 25W capable since September 2024.Apple Third parties may not be able to keep up with Apple for too long, as rumors already suggest that the upcoming iPhone 17 could boast wireless charging potential of up to 50W. Samsung has also developed a new wireless charging chip supporting the Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, enabling charging speeds of up to 50 watts. At any rate, you’ll finally be able to get at least 25W MagSafe charging without needing to buy one of Apple’s MagSafe Chargers.",
