  "description": "Macworld Apple on Tuesday announced several new Accessibility features coming to macOS later this year. The features will be part of macOS 16, which will be revealed at WWDC25 on June 9. The features are highlighted by a new Magnifier app with Continuity Camera functionality. Mac users are already familiar with Continuity Camera and its ability to use the iPhone’s camera as a webcam. Now, with the Magnifier app, a Mac can use the iPhone camera (or any other USB camera) to view the surroundings and zoom in. For example, users in a lecture hall can use the Magnifier app and iPhone camera to get a closer look at a whiteboard at the front of the room. The Magnifier will also be able to display multiple live session windows where a user can watch a presentation and follow along in a book at the same time using Desk View. Brightness, contrast, color filters, and perspective are adjustable, and views can be captured, grouped, and saved to add to at a later time. The new Accessibility Reader is a system-wide feature for making text easier to read. Text can be customized for color, font, and spacing, and users can also switch to Spoken Content. Since Accessibility Reader is system-wide, it can be used in any app, including the new Magnifier. Other new Accessibility features coming to macOS 16 include: Braille Access: Users can use a built-in app launcher to open any app by typing with Braille Screen Input or a connected Braille device. Braille Access lets users take notes in Braille and do calculations using Nemeth Braille. Braille Ready Format (BRF) files can be opened directly from Braille Access. Live Captions integration lets users transcribe conversations directly on braille displays. Background Sounds: Can be personalized with new EQ settings, playback duration times, and new actions for automations in Shortcuts. Personal Voice: Uses on-device machine learning and artificial intelligence for a smoother, more natural-sounding voice. Support for Mexican Spanish will also be available. Vehicle Motion Cues: Available in the iPhone and coming to the Mac, this feature can help reduce motion sickness when riding in a moving vehicle by displaying animated dots that correspond to a vehicle’s movements. Vehicle Motion Cues can help prevent motion sickness for those times you’re using your Mac as a passenger on a bus, train, or car.Apple Apple is also updating iOS 19 and iPadOS 19 with several new Accessibility features. Apple often takes the opportunity to showcase new Accessibility features about a month before the WWDC keynote. Last year, the company highlighted Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and other features in iOS 18.",
