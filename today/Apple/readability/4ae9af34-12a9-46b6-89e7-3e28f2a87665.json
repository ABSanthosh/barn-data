Save $300 on this popular M3 MacBook Pro configuration With a discounted price that's available exclusively to AppleInsider readers, Apple Authorized Reseller Adorama is knocking $300 off Apple's M3 14-inch MacBook Pro. This configuration has a bump up to 16GB unified memory, and it also comes equipped with 512GB SSD storage. Now $1,499 with the special promo code APINSIDER, this deal provides shoppers with the lowest price available on the Space Gray MacBook with double the amount of memory compared to the standard M3 spec. The $300 discount is in the form of a $250 instant rebate already in place stacked with the $50 promo code. Step-by-step activation instructions can be found below.
