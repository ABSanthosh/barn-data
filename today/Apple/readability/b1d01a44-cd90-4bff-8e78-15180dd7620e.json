Also check out CleanMyPhone for your iPhone! macOS 26 brings a major new user–interface to the Mac, as well as some powerful new functionality. Apple has also updated a lot of its own apps, in addition to bringing three apps to the Mac for the first time. Here’s what the company has to share … The all–new Games app Games is an all–new Apple app which is coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The company says it offers one–stop access to all the games you’ve ever downloaded, integrated with Apple Arcade. The Games app makes it easier than ever for players to enjoy all their games in one convenient place and see what’s happening across their games, including major events and updates, so they never miss a moment. It allows players to see all the games they have ever downloaded from the App Store for their iPhone and iPad, and brings together all the games they have on Mac. The app is also the best way to experience Apple Arcade, Apple’s subscription service with more than 200 award-winning and highly rated games for the whole family, including Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Sneaky Sasquatch, and Mini Motorways. Journal, on Mac for the first time When Apple first launched its Journal app, intended to help users reflect and practice gratitude by capturing and writing about special moments, many were surprised to find that it was iPhone–only. However, that changes in macOS 26, as it comes to Mac for the first time. Now on Mac for the most comfortable writing experience, Journal makes it easy to capture and write about everyday moments and special events using photos, videos, audio recordings, places, and more. Phone app Continuity has long allowed you to answer incoming calls on your Mac, but macOS 26 takes things to a whole new level with a full–featured Phone app. The Phone app on Mac has the familiar features of the Phone app on iPhone — including Recents, Favorites, and Voicemails — and the latest updates like Call Screening and Hold Assist. Call Screening automatically answers calls from unknown numbers and asks the caller for information so a user can decide whether or not to answer. And when a user is stuck on hold, Hold Assist allows them to keep their spot in line while they wait for a live agent, so users can continue working on their Mac. Apple is also bringing new features to a number of its existing Mac apps. Photos The Photos app gets much more personalized views. An updated design lets you quickly access filtering and sorting options and customize the size of Collections tiles so you can view your library just how you like. And with Pinned Collections, you can keep your most-visited ones right at your fingertips. Messages and FaceTime Messages gets a whole slew of new functionality, while FaceTime gets a more modest, er, face–lift. In Messages … Create polls and personalize conversations with backgrounds. Redesigned conversation details feature designated sections for contact info, photos, links, location, and more. Typing indicators in groups let you know exactly who is about to chime in. Screening tools detect spam and give you control. And the Add Contact button now appears next to an unknown number in a group. FaceTime lets you celebrate the people who matter most with a new tiled design that features beautiful and personalized Contact Posters. Reminders The Reminders app gets a number of new Apple Intelligence features to make life easier. With Apple Intelligence, Reminders can suggest tasks, grocery items, and follow-ups based on emails or other text on your device. It can also automatically categorize related reminders into sections within a list. Passwords The Passwords app was already a huge improvement on the Keychain of old, and now gets change–logs. Easily refer to changes you’ve made to your accounts. Find previous versions of passwords, along with when they were changed. Notes Finally, the Notes app also gets to benefit from Apple Intelligence to add powerful new functionality. Capture conversations in the Phone app as audio recordings with transcriptions. Markdown support has also been added. Which macOS 26 feature most excites you?
