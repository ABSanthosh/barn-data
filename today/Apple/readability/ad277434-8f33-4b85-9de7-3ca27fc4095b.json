  "description": "Macworld With about two months until the iPhone 17 arrives, leaker yeux1122 has posted photos of those little rings that go around the protective camera covers on the back of your iPhone. Since these rings match the rest of the iPhone enclosure, they show us exactly what the colors of Apple’s new phones will be. yeux1122 For the iPhone 17, the colors are: Blue Silver Black Green Purple yeux1122 For the iPhone 17 Air, the colors are: Silver Light gold Black Light Blue Unfortunately, yeux1122 doesn’t have photos of the rings for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, which are almost always different from the regular iPhone 17. The most interesting aspect of this leak is the “transparent” ring featured on both models. There has been no leak of Apple offering any sort of transparent/translucent case, and while some sort of frosted glass case would definitely fit in with the “Liquid Glass” interface update in iOS 26, it doesn’t seem to be a feasible material for an iPhone enclosure. Previous iPhone releases haven’t used a transparent ring either, so it’s unclear what it’s for. It’s speculation, but perhaps Apple is experimenting with whether colored rings that match the body or a transparent ring that matches the raised camera bump material look better? We’ll have to wait until September to find out. In the meantime, follow along with our iPhone 17 roundup for the latest leaks.",
