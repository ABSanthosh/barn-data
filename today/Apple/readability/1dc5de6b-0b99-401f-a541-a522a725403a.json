  "text": "Today, Apple released the trailer for Submerged, a short film from director Edward Berger (All Quiet on the Western Front) that the company is touting as the first scripted film created using its Immersive Video format. Available free this Thursday exclusively on Apple Vision Pro, the 17-minute thriller follows a WWII submarine crew combating a harrowing torpedo attack. With its 3D, 8K footage displayed in a 180-degree field of view combined with Spatial Audio, Apple Immersive Video is one of the highlights of the Vision Pro experience. Thus far, we’ve only seen it used in nonfictional contexts, including nature, travel, and sports. It will be intriguing to see how the format works for a fictional, scripted story. I’m glad the company is continuing to release immersive content for Vision Pro owners to enjoy at what seems to be a monthly pace, and I hope to see more storytellers given the opportunity to show what’s possible with this new format soon. It’s early days, and the potential is certainly there for finding creative new ways to engage audiences. I’m excited to see what happens when Immersive Video takes the plunge into fiction.",
