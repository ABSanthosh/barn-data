This week’s subscriber-only post-show is all about the contempt order entered against Apple last week. In a world or tech litigation where Google and Meta are at risk of being broken up, the contempt order entered against Apple may seem inconsequential. However, the reality is much different. In the post-show, I walk listeners through what this sort of high-stakes litigation is like and pinpoint the critical mistakes Apple made in complying with Judge Gonzalez Rodgers’ order. It’s a fascinating story of hubris, miscalculation, and the critical difference between assumptions and facts. It’s also a decision that will change the App Store in the U.S. and perhaps worldwide. Today also marks the beginning of our annual OS wish list episodes of AppStories, which we kick off with our iOS and iPadOS 19 wishes. Each week until WWDC, Federico and I will be detailing what we’ll be looking for at Apple’s annual developer conference. We hope AppStories listeners enjoy the extended bonus this week. As many readers and listeners are probably aware, the ad market for podcasts and websites is in an extended period of decline, and I don’t think it’s ever coming back to where it once was. As a result, we rely on listener support more than ever. AppStories has been around since 2017, and we want to continue producing the show long into the future. You can support the show by subscribing to AppStories+ for just $5/month or $50/year. In return, each week you’ll get: an extended version of the show with bonus topics, extended discussions, and first-looks at what we’re working on, that’s ad-free, published early, and in high-bitrate audio. To learn more about an AppStories+ subscription, visit our Plans page, or read the AppStories+ FAQ. AppStories+ is also available to Club Premier members. That’s the highest tier of a Club MacStories subscription that gets you everything the Club offers, including AppStories+.

Join Club Premier: We work hard to make every episode of AppStories the best episode, but some are naturally better than others. This is one of the better ones. We hope you enjoy it.
