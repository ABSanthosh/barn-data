Photo: Cult of Mac Deals The only thing standing between most people and their first MacBook Pro (or a much-needed upgrade) is the price.

Refurbished 2019 MacBook Pro features These days, Apple offers two main lines of MacBooks: the Air and the Pro. The Airs are for basic users, while the Pros are laptops for advanced users. This refurbished 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019 model) comes with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and an Intel Core i7 processor that reaches 2.6GHz. Check out some other notable specs: 16-inch Retina display with True Tone technology Six-speaker sound system Up to 11 hours of battery life Updates to current macOS Note: Because it runs on an Intel processor rather than Apple silicon, this refurbished MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does not support Apple Intelligence. Don’t forget the Touch Bar Some users loved the Touch Bar, and others hated it. This MacBook Pro features the small, customizable touchscreen strip that lives above the keyboard. It replaces the function keys you typically see on laptops, offering a variety of controls that change depending on which apps you have open. For example, you’ll see video playback buttons while streaming movies; typing suggestions when using Microsoft Word; and a color picker in creative design apps. The Touch Bar also offers Siri access and Touch ID for fingerprint log-ins.
