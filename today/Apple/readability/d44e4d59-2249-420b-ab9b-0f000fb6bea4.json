  "text": "The Verge’s Chris Welch has an in-depth look at Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features, which include hearing protection, a hearing test, and hearing aid features. On hearing protection, Welch notes: With iOS 18.1 and the soon-to-be-released AirPods firmware update, the AirPods Pro 2 will offer hearing protection at all times across noise cancellation, transparency, and adaptive audio modes. There’s no “concert mode” or a specific setting to toggle. You can think of this as an expansion of the loud sound reduction option that was already in place. Hearing protection is on by default, and Apple says “an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm” helps to preserve the natural sound of concerts and other live events. It sounds as though Apple has put a lot of thought into its hearing test, too: There are a few key things to know about Apple’s hearing test. For one, it’s designed so that you can’t predict or game it. The test can play any frequency at any time, so no two are the same. Finally, if you discover that your hearing isn’t what it once was, you can also use the AirPods Pro 2 as a clinical-grade hearing aid: For those 18 years and older with mild to moderate hearing loss, the AirPods Pro 2 can now serve as a clinical-grade hearing aid. Once enabled, you can also toggle on a “Media Assist” setting that uses your hearing test results to optimize the sound of music, phone calls, and video content. I highly recommend reading Welch’s entire story. There are a lot of little technical details he covers that add up to features that should make a meaningful difference in a lot of people’s lives.",
