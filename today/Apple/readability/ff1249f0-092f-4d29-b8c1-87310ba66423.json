  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Long Ago is an iPhone and iPad app with a unique design, that aims to help users track habits, medicines, habits, or anything you’d like to do more often. The app aims to help users establish routines, and start doing things more regularly. Key features It’s meant to be a self disciplining app, where users can stay on top of things going on in their day to day life. For example, every time you do your laundry, you can update the app. From that point, it’ll count how long it’s been, and you can also set reminders if you have trouble remembering. It also has a number of other features to help you keep track of things: Interactive widgets, so you can keep track of things from your home screen Shortcut support, so you can automate logging things Syncing across devices through iCloud Focus Filters, which allow you to group tasks and sort through the ones that matter at a particular time JSON import/export support. You own your data, and can use it within other apps Numerous customization features, allowing you to customize the clock, the theme, the colors, and the icons Personal highlights I’m quite a big fan of the design of the app. It feels fluid, has nice haptics all over, and overall just feels like a unique design while still feeling native. The flip clock is a really nice touch as well, as well as the varying colors. The app also offers a number of statistics in the app, showcasing how frequently you complete a certain task, chore, etc. If you need to take a certain medication daily, for example, the app will show if you miss a day in the graph. Shortcut support is also a nice touch. If one of your tasks is tied to a calendar invite, you could have the task automatically marked as completed. Interactive widgets also make it easy to track things from your home screen. Download the app Long Ago is available on the App Store for free, for iPhones and iPads running iOS 17 and later. It’s also available on Mac and Apple Vision Pro as an iPad app. For $9.99/year or $24.99 lifetime, you can unlock Long Ago Premium, which provides unlimited tracked activities and custom app icons.
