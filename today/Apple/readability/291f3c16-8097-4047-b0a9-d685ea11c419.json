  "description": "Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10, Watch Ultra 1/2). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods. Here, we round up some of the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying. There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks. We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorites here. Best simple Apple Watch chargers Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel chargers Best Apple Watch power banks Simple Apple Watch stands Best simple Apple Watch chargers Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable – Best Apple Watch charging cable Pros Fast charge Watch Simple Cons One use only Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: $29 at Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 1m cable Weight: 2.6oz (73g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10 and Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch SE (including the current model) and Series 6 and earlier Watch models shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function. Both cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck. The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking. Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our recommended best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger. While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Third-party Apple Watch Chargers – Beware cheap imitations Pros Affordable Cons Pot luck on quality Slow charging No name brands Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: $5.09 at Amazon Watch fast charge: No Size: 1m cable Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life. Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We are sure that the Satechi USB-C Magnetic Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy but it’s actually pricier than the Apple and doesn’t support fast charging—so why bother? There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. Satechi USB-C Magnetic Apple Watch Charging Dock – Portable Apple Watch charger Pros Portable Cons No Watch fast charge One use only Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Amazon$39.99 at Satechi Watch fast charge: No Size: 2 x 1.73 x 0.45 inches (5.1 x 4.4 x 1.1cm) Weight: 1.1oz (31g) Colors: Space Gray Requires USB-C charger: Any USB-C charging port Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad,a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank. When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger – Best simple Apple Watch charging stand Pros Fast charge Watch Nightstand Portable Cons Expensive for one use only Price When Reviewed: $59.95 Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Apple$59.99 at Best Buy$64.91 at Walmart Electronics Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches (9.7 x 9.7 x 1.6cm) Weight: 6.8oz (192g) Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) The Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s one of the few Apple Watch accessories that can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and, weighing just 6.8oz (192g), is portable, too. The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch. It is available from Apple. Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. 1. Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger – Best portable 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.95 at Apple$129.99 at Twelve South Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 2.8 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches (7.1 x 6.1 x 2.35cm) Weight: 4.2oz (119g) Colors: Aluminum Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included Twelve South makes our favorite 3-in-1 iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger, the HiRise 3 Deluxe reviewed below, and it has triumphed again with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously. Technically it can’t be beaten—it is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode. It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ. The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. You can buy a cheaper ($99.99) version in three different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger.

Native Union Voyage 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W Qi2 for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Native Union Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (Qi2) Size: 2.8 x 2.6 x 0.8 inches (7.1 x 6.6 x 2cm) Weight: 3.7oz (105g) Colors: Sandstone, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (27W minimum) Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyager is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a great travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s MagSafe but the same standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly. Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE. It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyager will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch. Take a look at the Voyager and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. 3. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock with MagSafe 15W – Designer 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Designer looks 15W MagSafe Fast Apple Watch charging Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.99 at Belkin Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 4.1 x 3.1 x 2.75 inches (10.5 x 7.8 x 7cm) Weight: 15.9oz (540g) Colors: Gray Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers. Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly. The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube.  It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone. Read our full Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock with MagSafe 15W review Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). 1. Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe – Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch charging stand Pros Charges Watch, iPhone, AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Small footprint and tilts Cons Only in black Price When Reviewed: $149.99 Best Prices Today: $149.95 at Apple$149.99 at Twelve South Watch fast charge: Yes (MagSafe) iPhone charge: 15W Size: 6.3 x 3.4 x 6 inches (15.9 x 8.5 x 15.4cm) Weight: 14oz (396g) Colors: Black Requires USB-C charger: 40W wall charger included If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables. The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15 but not SE, Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up. All the charging points are top-end—iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W—so all can be fast-charged. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees. It’s taller but much smaller than Belkin’s Belkin Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad, reviewed below, so will save space on your bedside table or desk.

Journey Trio Ultra 3-in-1 Fast Wireless Charging Station – Best white 3-in-1 Apple Watch charging stand Pros Charges Watch, iPhone, AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Small footprint Cons Only in white Price When Reviewed: $169.99 Best Prices Today: $169.99 at Journey Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 6.7 x 5.3 x 3.4 inches (17 x 13.4 x 8.6cm) Weight: 11.5oz (325g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem. This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case. Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Twelve South. There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1. 3.

Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top. Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home. We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging. If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews.

It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand. It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply. The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. 5.

Watch and AirPods charge at a more sedate 5W, so no Watch fast charge. The beauty of this compact charger is its portable 3-in-1 power options, all contained in one tiny-footprint device. The Watch charging part can be hidden away within the Anker Cube when not in use. 6.

The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South. We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Read our full OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station with MagSafe review Best Apple Watch travel chargers If you travel with a USB-C charger, then the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is all you need to pack in your hand luggage, but there are some far superior solutions available that charge the Apple Watch and more. 1.

It’s a little larger than the Evolved Foldable Charger but noticeably lighter. It measures 13.3-x-7.4-x-2.5cm when closed, and 2.1-x-7.4-x-1.3cm open. The Apple Watch charging module flips up so the Watch can be shown in Nightstand mode; it can also lie flat. It is also the only one to offer fast charging for the Apple Watch. None of them offer 15W certified MagSafe charging for the phone—for that you’ll need a less flexible 3-in-1, of which we have reviewed several here. Its design is neat because the MagSafe charging pad folds over and magnetically locks to the Watch module. if traveling with the SWIV, it’s just a matter of putting it in your bag, and you won’t notice it weighing down your luggage. It comes with a 1.5m USB-C cable. Read our full Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station review 3.

But you want to know about its Apple Watch charging credentials. In the battle of the foldable travel MagSafe iPhone and Watch chargers, we crown the Evolved 3-in-1 Foldable Charger as the best for Apple Watch users. It’s heavier and deeper than the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set, reviewed below, and doesn’t come with the smart case and USB-C charger, but it wins because its Watch charger is built-in rather than a separate module. Its also also an inch shorter and a little less wide, and can raise your iPhone higher and is more adjustable. The Twelve South Butterfly, reviewed above, might not be able to charge three devices at once but it is more compact and lighter than the Evolved charger, and can properly fast-charge two Apple devices at the same time. 4.

The Watch-charging module is separate and plugs into the charger via its integrated USB-C connector. It’s built with Apple’s first-generation charging module that doesn’t support Watch fast charging. It’s oddly white, which doesn’t quite fit with the rest of the black charger but this shouldn’t really matter. What impresses us is that this certified Made for Watch device can charge three Apple devices at the same time, and slip into your pocket when you’re done—obviously you need either the included 20W charger (and 5ft cable) or your own USB-C charger and cable. The iPhone charger is MagSafe compatible (7.5W). Handily, the whole package fits into an included smart travel case. 5.

There’s a cute hard-shell travel case so you can keep the included braided USB-C cable and the charger protected in transit. Its a great charger in its own right and doesn’t need to be reserved for just travel duties. Best Apple Watch power banks Many of us have discovered how handy it is having a portable power bank to carry around for when our phones need a charge when we’re away from a power socket. As the Apple Watch has such a short battery life, having a power bank that is built for the Watch is even more useful when your Watch gives you that dreaded 10% battery warning and you are an hour or more away from your USB charger. We’ve tested a bunch of Apple Watch power banks and battery packs and here are the best. 1.

The 5W Apple Watch charging module will fast-charge your Watch and is adjustable so allows for Nightstand mode. It’s not a wireless charger but with its own built-in USB-C cable you don’t need it and get 30W wired charging that is so much faster than 7.5W MagSafe compatible or even 15W MagSafe/Qi2 wireless. That cable can also be used to charge the power bank itself. In our tests, an Apple Watch Series 10 was charged by 65% within 30 minutes. The iPhone 15 also charged quickly; we measured a 50% increase in 30 minutes. We even gave our MacBook Air a boost using the power bank. The cute power display also showed that the Apple Watch Series 10 charged at times at 4W, the iPhone 15 at 23W and the MacBook at 29W. Rubber feet protect the power bank and your table from scratches. Read our full Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K, 35W, For Apple Watch) review 2.

It could comfortable recharge an Apple Watch over 10 times if that’s all you needed it for. At 2W, however, the OneGo can’t fast-charge a Watch in comparison to the Anker MagGo reviewed above that boasts a 5W Watch charger. That Anker power bank is cute but it doesn’t work as a stand or wireless iPhone charger. 3.

It’s a great portable solution when you are away from a power source, and it can charge not just your Apple Watch and iPhone simultaneously, but two more devices via its USB ports (one USB-C for fast 18W iPhone charging and one USB-A). The Watch charging module flips up from the back of the power bank’s pull-out stand. It chargers at 3W rather than 5W so doesn’t support Apple Watch Fast Charge but it will inject the juice that your Watch requires when you need it. If you’re carrying your Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, you can connect it here to achieve fast Watch charging. In our tests, using an iPhone 15 Pro, the power bank wirelessly charged close to 150%. The OtterBox Power Bank with Apple Watch Charger, reviewed below, can fast charge a Watch and can wired-charge an iPhone but not act as a wireless iPhone stand. 4.

Four LED battery indicator lights let you know when it’s time to recharge the power bank itself. In testing, we recharged a flat Apple Watch 8 nearly four times (3.8x). Its battery capacity is great if you’re going away on a five-day camping trip away from a wall power socket and only need to charge your Watch, but its relatively low in power if you also want to juice up your iPhone, too. Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro Apple Watch power bank has three times the capacity, but is bigger and heavier. The Otterbox Apple Watch Power Bank weighs 6.6oz (188g). Pass-through charging means you can wirelessly charge your Apple Watch when charging the power bankIt ships with a 20-inch (50cm) USB-C to USB-C cable. The Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Wireless 10000mAh Power Bank, reviewed above, is more functional, acting as a wireless iPhone/Watch charger and stand as well as a power bank. 5.

While it’s bigger and heavier than the OtterBox, its 3x battery capacity makes it a more sensible choice if you need to charge Watch and iPhone multiple times. It can charge a Watch eight times over, or up to twice for an iPhone. The likelihood is that you might need to charge both at least once, which this battery pack can handle easily. It ships with a 12-inch (30cm) USB-C to USB-C cable. Read our full BoostCharge Pro review Simple Apple Watch stands While not charging the Apple Watch by themselves, these simple and affordable Apple Watch stands connect with your Apple Watch charging cable to prop the Watch at a convenient nightstand angle while charging. 1.

Keep in mind that you will still need to use a separate charging cable as this is only a stand and won’t charge your Apple Watch on its own.  It’s a nifty little bedside stand if you don’t want to splurge more than you need to. 2.

Elago’s cute W3 Stand (a.k.a. the Apple Watch Vintage Stand) turns your Apple Watch into a tiny original Macintosh while it’s charging. It even sits at a slight angle to match the original Mac, and uses Nightstand mode to make sure the screen is aligned correctly. FAQ 1. How much time does Apple Watch take to fast charge? The Apple Watch battery life is notoriously short between charges so fast charging is a great way to keep your smart timepiece topped up and ready for action. Using a Fast Charger cable, such as the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, or stand, such as the Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, you can charge a Watch 33% faster than using an older cable or stand. Fast charging will get a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will power your Watch for eight hours of sleep tracking. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger. See How to fast charge Apple Watch for more information. 2. Which Apple Watch models can fast charge? The following Apple Watch models support Fast Charge: Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2. The Apple Watch SE does not support Fast Charge. 3. How can I see my Apple Watch battery percentage? To see how much power remains on your Apple Watch, hold the bottom of the screen and swipe up to open the Control Center. You can add the battery life percentage to the watch face by adding a battery complication, in this way: Hold the display, then tap Edit Swipe left to the end to see if the watch face includes a possible battery complication Tap the complication to select it, then turn the Digital Crown to choose the battery complication To save your changes, press the Digital Crown, then tap the face to switch to it. You can also add a battery widget to show the battery percentage of a connected Apple Watch on your iPhone. 4. How to save battery power on the Apple watch When you can’t get to your Apple Watch charger fast enough and the Watch battery is dangerously low, you can eke out the remaining battery charge by saving power. The easiest way save battery life is to turn on Low Power Mode. This turns off Always On Display, background heart rate and blood oxygen measurements, plus heart rate notifications. Cellular access is also turned off in Low Power Mode. If you’re just going for a walk, then maybe you don’t need the heart monitor on—although this may impact your Exercise score, it could keep your Watch going till you get back to base and a charging socket. To turn on Low Power Mode, tap the side button on your Apple Watch to open Control Center, and select the battery percentage. Then tap Low Power Mode. Apple states that “other notifications may be delayed, emergency alerts may not arrive, and certain cellular and Wi-Fi connections are limited” in Low Power Mode. When the Watch battery is charged to 80%, Low Power Mode turns off automatically. Other Apple Watch battery saving tips include: Don’t use an Exercise or other tracking. If you are exercising you can still save some battery by turning on Low Power Mode—open the Watch app on your iPhone, and scroll to Workout where you can turn Low Power Mode on by tapping the slider on the right. To further conserve battery life, turn on Fewer GPS and Heart Rate Readings by tapping the slider. Turn off Always On Display in the Settings app Turn off the Wake Screen so that when you raise the watch to your face the screen doesn’t automatically turn on. Tap the screen or press the Digital Crown to manually wake up the screen instead. Open Settings on your Apple Watch. Select General \u003e Display \u0026 Brightness. Turn off Wake on Wrist Raise by tapping the slider. Turn off background apps: push the side button (not the digital crown) and release it; then scroll through the running apps using the digital crown; close the apps by swiping from left to right and tapping on the “X” Turn off the heart rate monitor and advanced health tracking in the Watch app on your iPhone: Privacy Turn off voice assistant Siri—which is always listening for your commands—in Apple Watch Settings Turn on Theater mode, which prevents the Apple Watch display from turning on when you raise your wrist, and also turns on Silent Mode Turn on Silent Mode Use a darker watch face as black pixels use less power than bright ones such as Mickey Mouse or the Activity Face In extreme circumstances when you know you’ll need your Apple Watch later but not right now, turn off your Apple Watch by pressing and holding the side button until you see the Power Off slider Unpair AirPods from your Apple Watch in Settings. Always keep your Watch software up to date. Some Watch software updates are specifically to improve battery life, while others keep your Watch operating as efficiently as possible. In the Watch app on your iPhone, go to My Watch \u003e General \u003e Software Update. Optimized Battery Charging is turned on by default when you set up your Apple Watch, but check it’s on by opening Settings on the Apple Watch,a nd then selecting Battery \u003e Battery Health. Turn Optimized Battery Charging on via the slider. See more on Optimized Battery Charging below. See: How to improve Apple Watch battery life for more advice. 5. How to turn on Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch When its battery charge falls to 10% or lower, your Apple Watch alerts you and suggests that you enter Low Power Mode. Hold the bottom of the Watch screen, then swipe up to open Control Center. Tap the battery percentage icon, then turn on Low Power Mode. Scroll down, and tap Turn On Low Power Mode. 6. Optimize Apple Watch Charging The Apple Watch Optimized Battery Charging feature uses on-device machine learning to discover your charging habits over time along with your daily usage to either charge the Watch to an optimized level or charge it to full in order to improve the lifespan of your Watch battery. This will slow down the wear on your Watch battery to improve its lifespan by reducing the time your Apple Watch spends fully charged. When turned on, your watch delays charging past 80% in certain situations, so that the battery level remains between 75-80%. Optimised Battery Charging is only activated when your watch predicts it will be connected to a charger for an extended period of time, and still aims to ensure your Apple Watch is fully charged when removed from the charger. If, for example, you mostly leave your Watch on charge overnight, Optimised Battery Charging will slow down the charging to make it more efficient over the period you are usually asleep, while still making sure that the battery is full and ready for your daytime usage by the time you wake up.",

  "text": "Image: Foundry Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10, Watch Ultra 1/2). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods. Here, we round up some of the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying. There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks. We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorites here. Best simple Apple Watch chargers Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel chargers Best Apple Watch power banks Simple Apple Watch stands Best simple Apple Watch chargers Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable – Best Apple Watch charging cable Pros Fast charge Watch Simple Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 1m cable Weight: 2.6oz (73g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10 and Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch SE (including the current model) and Series 6 and earlier Watch models shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function. Both cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck. The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking. Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our recommended best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger. While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Third-party Apple Watch Chargers – Beware cheap imitations Cons Pot luck on quality Slow charging No name brands Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Watch fast charge: No Size: 1m cable Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life. Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We are sure that the Satechi USB-C Magnetic Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy but it’s actually pricier than the Apple and doesn’t support fast charging—so why bother? There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. Satechi USB-C Magnetic Apple Watch Charging Dock – Portable Apple Watch charger Cons No Watch fast charge One use only Price When Reviewed: $39.99 Watch fast charge: No Size: 2 x 1.73 x 0.45 inches (5.1 x 4.4 x 1.1cm) Weight: 1.1oz (31g) Colors: Space Gray Requires USB-C charger: Any USB-C charging port Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad,a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank. When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger – Best simple Apple Watch charging stand Pros Fast charge Watch Nightstand Portable Cons Expensive for one use only Price When Reviewed: $59.95 Watch fast charge: Yes Size: 3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches (9.7 x 9.7 x 1.6cm) Weight: 6.8oz (192g) Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) The Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s one of the few Apple Watch accessories that can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and, weighing just 6.8oz (192g), is portable, too. The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch. It is available from Apple. Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. 1. Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger – Best portable 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 2.8 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches (7.1 x 6.1 x 2.35cm) Weight: 4.2oz (119g) Colors: Aluminum Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included Twelve South makes our favorite 3-in-1 iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger, the HiRise 3 Deluxe reviewed below, and it has triumphed again with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously. Technically it can’t be beaten—it is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode. It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ. The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. You can buy a cheaper ($99.99) version in three different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Read our full Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger review 2. Native Union Voyage 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W Qi2 for iPhone Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (Qi2) Size: 2.8 x 2.6 x 0.8 inches (7.1 x 6.6 x 2cm) Weight: 3.7oz (105g) Colors: Sandstone, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (27W minimum) Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyager is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a great travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s MagSafe but the same standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly. Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE. It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyager will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch. Take a look at the Voyager and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. 3. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock with MagSafe 15W – Designer 2-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Designer looks 15W MagSafe Fast Apple Watch charging Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 4.1 x 3.1 x 2.75 inches (10.5 x 7.8 x 7cm) Weight: 15.9oz (540g) Colors: Gray Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers. Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly. The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube.  It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone. Read our full Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock with MagSafe 15W review Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). 1. Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe – Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch charging stand Pros Charges Watch, iPhone, AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Small footprint and tilts Price When Reviewed: $149.99 Watch fast charge: Yes (MagSafe) iPhone charge: 15W Size: 6.3 x 3.4 x 6 inches (15.9 x 8.5 x 15.4cm) Weight: 14oz (396g) Colors: Black Requires USB-C charger: 40W wall charger included If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables. The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15 but not SE, Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up. All the charging points are top-end—iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W—so all can be fast-charged. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees. It’s taller but much smaller than Belkin’s Belkin Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad, reviewed below, so will save space on your bedside table or desk. Read our full Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe review 2. Journey Trio Ultra 3-in-1 Fast Wireless Charging Station – Best white 3-in-1 Apple Watch charging stand Pros Charges Watch, iPhone, AirPods Fast charge Watch 15W MagSafe for iPhone Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $169.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 6.7 x 5.3 x 3.4 inches (17 x 13.4 x 8.6cm) Weight: 11.5oz (325g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem. This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case. Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Twelve South. There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1. 3. Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) – Best compact 3-in-1 Apple Watch charging stand Pros Charges Watch, iPhone, AirPods 15W Qi2 iPhone charging Fast charges Apple Watch Compact, light and portable Price When Reviewed: $109.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 15W (Qi2) Size: 3.5 x 2.4 x 1 inches (8.9 x 6 x 2.5cm) Weight: 6.9oz (195g) Colors: White, Black Requires USB-C charger: 40W wall charger included The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top. Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home. We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging. If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews.

It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand. It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation. The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply. The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. 5. Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe – Stunning compact 3-in-1 Apple Watch charger Pros Charges Watch, iPhone and AirPods 15W MagSafe for iPhone Portable Small footprint Cons No Watch fast charge Heavy Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 2.49 x 2.3 x 2.3 inches (6.3 x 6 x 6cm) Weight: 14.5oz (410g) Colors: Gray Requires USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included Charge your Apple Watch plus your other small Apple gadgets with this dinky (if weighty) designer 3-in-1 cube that is MagSafe certified so can wirelessly charge an iPhone 12/13/14 at 15W. Watch and AirPods charge at a more sedate 5W, so no Watch fast charge. The beauty of this compact charger is its portable 3-in-1 power options, all contained in one tiny-footprint device. The Watch charging part can be hidden away within the Anker Cube when not in use. 6.

The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South. We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Read our full OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station with MagSafe review Best Apple Watch travel chargers If you travel with a USB-C charger, then the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is all you need to pack in your hand luggage, but there are some far superior solutions available that charge the Apple Watch and more. 1.

It’s my personal go-to Apple Watch charger at home and on my travels. Read our full Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger review 2. Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station – Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel charger Pros 3-in-1 charging Foldable for travel Super compact design Price When Reviewed: $119.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 7.5W Size: 5.2-x-2.9-x-1 inches (13.3-x-7.4-x-2.5cm) closed Weight: 5.2oz (147g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) There are few foldable 3-in-1 iPhone/Watch/AirPods portable chargers on the market but we think this is one of the neatest. It’s a little larger than the Evolved Foldable Charger but noticeably lighter. It measures 13.3-x-7.4-x-2.5cm when closed, and 2.1-x-7.4-x-1.3cm open. The Apple Watch charging module flips up so the Watch can be shown in Nightstand mode; it can also lie flat. It is also the only one to offer fast charging for the Apple Watch. None of them offer 15W certified MagSafe charging for the phone—for that you’ll need a less flexible 3-in-1, of which we have reviewed several here. Its design is neat because the MagSafe charging pad folds over and magnetically locks to the Watch module. if traveling with the SWIV, it’s just a matter of putting it in your bag, and you won’t notice it weighing down your luggage. It comes with a 1.5m USB-C cable. Read our full Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station review 3. Evolved 3-in-1 Foldable Charger – Smallest 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel charger Pros 3-in-1 charging Foldable for travel Super compact design Cons No Watch fast charge No iPhone fast charge Price When Reviewed: $89.95 Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 7.5W Size: 3.5-x-2.4-x-0.9 inches (9-x-6.1-x-2.3cm) Weight: 6.9oz (195g) Colors: Metallic gray Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) You can use this charger as a fat wireless iPhone charging pad or height-adjustable and tilting phone stand. But you want to know about its Apple Watch charging credentials. In the battle of the foldable travel MagSafe iPhone and Watch chargers, we crown the Evolved 3-in-1 Foldable Charger as the best for Apple Watch users. It’s heavier and deeper than the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set, reviewed below, and doesn’t come with the smart case and USB-C charger, but it wins because its Watch charger is built-in rather than a separate module. Its also also an inch shorter and a little less wide, and can raise your iPhone higher and is more adjustable. The Twelve South Butterfly, reviewed above, might not be able to charge three devices at once but it is more compact and lighter than the Evolved charger, and can properly fast-charge two Apple devices at the same time. 4. ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set – 3-in-1 travel charger with detachable Watch charger Pros Charges Watch, iPhone \u0026 AirPods Foldable \u0026 portable Cons No Watch fast charge No iPhone fast charge Price When Reviewed: $89.99 Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 7.5W Size: 4.3 x 2.6 x 0.67 inches (11 x 6.5 x 1.7cm) Weight: 5.2oz (148g) Colors: Black (Watch module is white) Requires USB-C charger: 20W wall charger included iPhone charging stands are usually quite bulky given that they need to hold a vertical-oriented iPhone, but this 3-in-1 Watch/iPhone/AirPods charger folds to a very compact and lightweight form factor. The Watch-charging module is separate and plugs into the charger via its integrated USB-C connector. It’s built with Apple’s first-generation charging module that doesn’t support Watch fast charging. It’s oddly white, which doesn’t quite fit with the rest of the black charger but this shouldn’t really matter. What impresses us is that this certified Made for Watch device can charge three Apple devices at the same time, and slip into your pocket when you’re done—obviously you need either the included 20W charger (and 5ft cable) or your own USB-C charger and cable. The iPhone charger is MagSafe compatible (7.5W). Handily, the whole package fits into an included smart travel case. 5. Zens 2-in-1 MagSafe + Watch travel charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone 15W MagSafe for iPhone Portable Cons No Watch fast charge Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe) Size: 2.36 x 2.36 x 0.79 inches (6 x 6 x 2cm) Weight: 6.4oz (182g) Colors: White Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) This pocketable 2-in-1 Apple Watch and iPhone charger from Zens is a quality travel accessory for Apple users. The foldout Watch arm works as a kickstand for the iPhone in either landscape or portrait orientation. It doesn’t support Apple Watch fast charging but is MagSafe-certified for full 15W MagSafe charging for iPhones 12 and later. There’s a cute hard-shell travel case so you can keep the included braided USB-C cable and the charger protected in transit. Its a great charger in its own right and doesn’t need to be reserved for just travel duties. Best Apple Watch power banks Many of us have discovered how handy it is having a portable power bank to carry around for when our phones need a charge when we’re away from a power socket. As the Apple Watch has such a short battery life, having a power bank that is built for the Watch is even more useful when your Watch gives you that dreaded 10% battery warning and you are an hour or more away from your USB charger. We’ve tested a bunch of Apple Watch power banks and battery packs and here are the best. 1. Anker MagGo Power Bank 10K for Apple Watch – Best Apple Watch power bank Pros High 10K battery power bank Built-in USB-C cable (30W) Compact Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Watch fast charge: Yes iPhone charge: 30W Wired Colors: White Dimensions: 3.7-x-2-x-1.3 inches (9.4-x-5.1-x-3.3cm) Weight: 8.6oz (245g) Requires USB-C charger: 30W to recharge the power bank If you don’t need your power bank to double up an iPhone stand, this highly pocketable iPhone and Apple Watch battery pack is a great option to keep in your bag for those recharging emergencies. The 5W Apple Watch charging module will fast-charge your Watch and is adjustable so allows for Nightstand mode. It’s not a wireless charger but with its own built-in USB-C cable you don’t need it and get 30W wired charging that is so much faster than 7.5W MagSafe compatible or even 15W MagSafe/Qi2 wireless. That cable can also be used to charge the power bank itself. In our tests, an Apple Watch Series 10 was charged by 65% within 30 minutes. The iPhone 15 also charged quickly; we measured a 50% increase in 30 minutes. We even gave our MacBook Air a boost using the power bank. The cute power display also showed that the Apple Watch Series 10 charged at times at 4W, the iPhone 15 at 23W and the MacBook at 29W. Rubber feet protect the power bank and your table from scratches. Read our full Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K, 35W, For Apple Watch) review 2. OneAdaptr OneGo – Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch travel power bank Pros High 10K battery power bank Compact iPhone, Watch, AirPods charging stand Can charge 4 devices simultaneously Foldable for travel Cons No Watch fast charge Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 7.5W (18W Wired) Colors: White, Gray Dimensions: 2.8 x 0.94 x H 4.7 inches (7 x 2.4 x 12cm) Weight: 7.8oz (220g) Requires USB-C charger: 30W to recharge the power bank This power bank is built for travel. It is compact like a standard wireless power bank, but from the back fold out an Apple Watch charging module and a Qi wireless base that can charge your AirPods and act as a kick stand if you want to see your iPhone while it’s in the charging saddle. The 10K battery pack performed superbly: giving an iPhone 15 Pro nearly two full recharges – either at 7.5W wireless charging or 18W using a separate USB-C cable. It could comfortable recharge an Apple Watch over 10 times if that’s all you needed it for. At 2W, however, the OneGo can’t fast-charge a Watch in comparison to the Anker MagGo reviewed above that boasts a 5W Watch charger. That Anker power bank is cute but it doesn’t work as a stand or wireless iPhone charger. 3. Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Wireless 10000mAh Power Bank – Best multi-device Apple Watch power bank iPhone stand Pros High 10K battery power bank Can charge 4 devices at once 2x USB ports Built-in stand Cons No Watch fast charge Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Watch fast charge: No iPhone charge: 7.5W Colors: White Dimensions: 4.25-x-2.7-x-0.95 inches (10.8-x-6.8-x-2.4cm) Weight: 8oz (228g) Requires USB-C charger: 20W to recharge the power bank This is the smallest iPhone and Apple Watch charging stand that doubles up as a power bank. It’s a great portable solution when you are away from a power source, and it can charge not just your Apple Watch and iPhone simultaneously, but two more devices via its USB ports (one USB-C for fast 18W iPhone charging and one USB-A). The Watch charging module flips up from the back of the power bank’s pull-out stand. It chargers at 3W rather than 5W so doesn’t support Apple Watch Fast Charge but it will inject the juice that your Watch requires when you need it. If you’re carrying your Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, you can connect it here to achieve fast Watch charging. In our tests, using an iPhone 15 Pro, the power bank wirelessly charged close to 150%. The OtterBox Power Bank with Apple Watch Charger, reviewed below, can fast charge a Watch and can wired-charge an iPhone but not act as a wireless iPhone stand. 4. OtterBox Power Bank with Apple Watch Charger – Simple Apple Watch power bank Pros Fast charge Watch Portable Cons Battery capacity low compared to others Price When Reviewed: $49.95 Watch fast charge: Yes Colors: Silver Dimensions: 3.2 x 1.3 x 1.6 inches (8 x 3.4 x 4cm) Weight: 6.6oz (188g) Requires USB-C charger: 20W to recharge the power bank This portable 3000mAh power bank can fast-charge an Apple Watch at 7.5W, and also wirelessly charge AirPods Pro (2nd generation) and wired-charge an iPhone (or any other device) at 15W. Four LED battery indicator lights let you know when it’s time to recharge the power bank itself. In testing, we recharged a flat Apple Watch 8 nearly four times (3.8x). Its battery capacity is great if you’re going away on a five-day camping trip away from a wall power socket and only need to charge your Watch, but its relatively low in power if you also want to juice up your iPhone, too. Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro Apple Watch power bank has three times the capacity, but is bigger and heavier. The Otterbox Apple Watch Power Bank weighs 6.6oz (188g). Pass-through charging means you can wirelessly charge your Apple Watch when charging the power bankIt ships with a 20-inch (50cm) USB-C to USB-C cable. The Alogic Lift 4-in-1 MagSafe Wireless 10000mAh Power Bank, reviewed above, is more functional, acting as a wireless iPhone/Watch charger and stand as well as a power bank. 5. BoostCharge Pro Pros Fast charge Watch Portable Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Watch fast charge: Yes Colors: Black Dimensions: 5.3 x 2.2 x 1.1 inches (13.5 x 5.6 x 2.9cm) Requires USB-C charger: 20W to recharge the power bank Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for Apple Watch + Power Bank 10K might be pricier and heavier than the OtterBox Apple Watch Power Bank, but it packs a mighty 10000mAh capacity that can fast-charge an Apple Watch at 7.5W or wirelessly charge AirPods Pro (2nd generation), as well as wired-charge an iPhone (or any other device) at 20W. While it’s bigger and heavier than the OtterBox, its 3x battery capacity makes it a more sensible choice if you need to charge Watch and iPhone multiple times. It can charge a Watch eight times over, or up to twice for an iPhone. The likelihood is that you might need to charge both at least once, which this battery pack can handle easily. It ships with a 12-inch (30cm) USB-C to USB-C cable. Read our full BoostCharge Pro review While not charging the Apple Watch by themselves, these simple and affordable Apple Watch stands connect with your Apple Watch charging cable to prop the Watch at a convenient nightstand angle while charging. 1.

Keep in mind that you will still need to use a separate charging cable as this is only a stand and won’t charge your Apple Watch on its own.  It’s a nifty little bedside stand if you don’t want to splurge more than you need to. 2. Spigen S350 Apple Watch Stand Cons Requires Apple charging cable Price When Reviewed: $14.95 Watch fast charge: Yes, with Apple fast-charge cable Size: 2.2 x 2 x 1.8 inches (5.6 x 5.1 x 4.6cm) Weight: 11oz (312g) Colors: White, Black, Blue, Pink Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) This is a simple, secure stand that you slip your Apple charging cable into so that you can set your Watch in Nightstand mode by your bedside or at your desk if you prefer to charge during the day so that you can track your sleep at night. Note that it’s just a stand so you still need the Apple charging cable. From Spigen. 3. Elago Apple Watch Vintage Stand Pros Affordable stand Looks like a tiny Mac Cons Requires charging cable Price When Reviewed: $24.99 Watch fast charge: Yes, with Apple fast-charge cable Colors: Beige, Black Requires USB-C charger: Yes (20W minimum) Here’s one for the Apple enthusiasts that have been following the company since long before all this fancy touch-screen malarkey started, and when a watch told the time and nothing else. Elago’s cute W3 Stand (a.k.a. the Apple Watch Vintage Stand) turns your Apple Watch into a tiny original Macintosh while it’s charging. It even sits at a slight angle to match the original Mac, and uses Nightstand mode to make sure the screen is aligned correctly. FAQ 1.How much time does Apple Watch take to fast charge? The Apple Watch battery life is notoriously short between charges so fast charging is a great way to keep your smart timepiece topped up and ready for action. Using a Fast Charger cable, such as the Apple Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable, or stand, such as the Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, you can charge a Watch 33% faster than using an older cable or stand. Fast charging will get a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will power your Watch for eight hours of sleep tracking. Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger. See How to fast charge Apple Watch for more information. 2.Which Apple Watch models can fast charge? The following Apple Watch models support Fast Charge: Apple Watch Series 7, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2. The Apple Watch SE does not support Fast Charge. 3.How can I see my Apple Watch battery percentage? To see how much power remains on your Apple Watch, hold the bottom of the screen and swipe up to open the Control Center. You can add the battery life percentage to the watch face by adding a battery complication, in this way: Hold the display, then tap Edit Swipe left to the end to see if the watch face includes a possible battery complication Tap the complication to select it, then turn the Digital Crown to choose the battery complication To save your changes, press the Digital Crown, then tap the face to switch to it. You can also add a battery widget to show the battery percentage of a connected Apple Watch on your iPhone. 4.How to save battery power on the Apple watch When you can’t get to your Apple Watch charger fast enough and the Watch battery is dangerously low, you can eke out the remaining battery charge by saving power. The easiest way save battery life is to turn on Low Power Mode. This turns off Always On Display, background heart rate and blood oxygen measurements, plus heart rate notifications. Cellular access is also turned off in Low Power Mode. If you’re just going for a walk, then maybe you don’t need the heart monitor on—although this may impact your Exercise score, it could keep your Watch going till you get back to base and a charging socket. To turn on Low Power Mode, tap the side button on your Apple Watch to open Control Center, and select the battery percentage. Then tap Low Power Mode. Apple states that “other notifications may be delayed, emergency alerts may not arrive, and certain cellular and Wi-Fi connections are limited” in Low Power Mode. When the Watch battery is charged to 80%, Low Power Mode turns off automatically. Other Apple Watch battery saving tips include: Don’t use an Exercise or other tracking. If you are exercising you can still save some battery by turning on Low Power Mode—open the Watch app on your iPhone, and scroll to Workout where you can turn Low Power Mode on by tapping the slider on the right. To further conserve battery life, turn on Fewer GPS and Heart Rate Readings by tapping the slider. Turn off Always On Display in the Settings app Turn off the Wake Screen so that when you raise the watch to your face the screen doesn’t automatically turn on. Tap the screen or press the Digital Crown to manually wake up the screen instead. Open Settings on your Apple Watch. Select General \u003e Display \u0026 Brightness. Turn off Wake on Wrist Raise by tapping the slider. Turn off background apps: push the side button (not the digital crown) and release it; then scroll through the running apps using the digital crown; close the apps by swiping from left to right and tapping on the “X” Turn off the heart rate monitor and advanced health tracking in the Watch app on your iPhone: Privacy Turn off voice assistant Siri—which is always listening for your commands—in Apple Watch Settings Turn on Theater mode, which prevents the Apple Watch display from turning on when you raise your wrist, and also turns on Silent Mode Turn on Silent Mode Use a darker watch face as black pixels use less power than bright ones such as Mickey Mouse or the Activity Face In extreme circumstances when you know you’ll need your Apple Watch later but not right now, turn off your Apple Watch by pressing and holding the side button until you see the Power Off slider Unpair AirPods from your Apple Watch in Settings. Always keep your Watch software up to date. Some Watch software updates are specifically to improve battery life, while others keep your Watch operating as efficiently as possible. In the Watch app on your iPhone, go to My Watch \u003e General \u003e Software Update. Optimized Battery Charging is turned on by default when you set up your Apple Watch, but check it’s on by opening Settings on the Apple Watch,a nd then selecting Battery \u003e Battery Health. Turn Optimized Battery Charging on via the slider. See more on Optimized Battery Charging below. See: How to improve Apple Watch battery life for more advice. 5.How to turn on Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch When its battery charge falls to 10% or lower, your Apple Watch alerts you and suggests that you enter Low Power Mode. Hold the bottom of the Watch screen, then swipe up to open Control Center. Tap the battery percentage icon, then turn on Low Power Mode. Scroll down, and tap Turn On Low Power Mode. 6.Optimize Apple Watch Charging The Apple Watch Optimized Battery Charging feature uses on-device machine learning to discover your charging habits over time along with your daily usage to either charge the Watch to an optimized level or charge it to full in order to improve the lifespan of your Watch battery. This will slow down the wear on your Watch battery to improve its lifespan by reducing the time your Apple Watch spends fully charged. When turned on, your watch delays charging past 80% in certain situations, so that the battery level remains between 75-80%. Optimised Battery Charging is only activated when your watch predicts it will be connected to a charger for an extended period of time, and still aims to ensure your Apple Watch is fully charged when removed from the charger. If, for example, you mostly leave your Watch on charge overnight, Optimised Battery Charging will slow down the charging to make it more efficient over the period you are usually asleep, while still making sure that the battery is full and ready for your daytime usage by the time you wake up.

It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s MagSafe but the same standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyager will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake a look at the Voyager and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice.
