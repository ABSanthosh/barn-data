  "text": "Auto-clickers are sort of niche software, typically associated with repetitive tasks with data entry, gaming, or software testing, but have gained some broader popularity with many people working from home. If you need an auto clicker for Mac, there are a variety of free autoclicker options built for MacOS, and we’ll point you to a few of those options here. What’s the purpose of an auto-clicker? First, it might be helpful to understand what an auto-clicker does or is intended to do… as the name implies an auto clicker simulates mouse clicks, helping you to automate repetitive tasks or actions by clicking on specific locations on the screen. This lets you automate clicks without manually clicking, mimicking the action of a user clicking on a mouse button or trackpad. A good autoclicker also has some helpful features that you can set, like click interval, the number of clicks, location of clicks, and similar features. For gamers, auto clickers can be useful to perform actions like use a weapon or shoot, which some people think improves their gameplay. For data entry, auto clicking can reduce the repetitiveness of some tasks and maybe even enhance your productivity a bit. For software testing and macro automation, auto clickers can perform reptile tasks like checking on UI elements or testing the functionality of certain behaviors, which might help your efficiency. For remote working slackers, auto clickers can click your mouse for you which can make it seem like you’re working when you’re not, or make it appear as if you’re at the computer when you’re really in Yoga at the park, like the entire city of Austin seems to do. And to be clear, it’s not that we would recommend doing this sort of thing, but if you are looking to deceive or sabotage your Work From Home experience, an autoclicker is effective, but a very amusing and effective tool is Zoom Escaper, which will sabotage a Zoom Meeting connection in various funny ways to get you out of that pesky meeting. What are some free auto-clicker options for Mac? Now that we know what auto clickers are, let’s point out a few free autoclicker options for Mac: MaClicker – a free simple auto clicker for Mac that can click up to 100 clicks per second. This requires MacOS High Sierra 10.13 or later, making it broadly compatible AutoClick – another free Mac autoclicker option, it’s simple and easy to use. This one hasn’t been updated in a while so it may not be as compatible as the others MacOS Auto Clicker – yet another free Mac autoclicker program, simple to use and open source on Github Each of these free autoclicker options are hosted on Github, so if you’re not familiar with how to download apps from Github, you might want to review that here first since it’s not immediately obvious (or just go to the “Releases” section of a Github page, if you can squint and find that in the sidebar). You’ll find the auto-clickers let you use both left click and right click, as well as a variety of other options which you may or may not find useful. Try them out. Whatever your intended usage of auto clickers for Mac, now you have multiple options to try out. Let us know which one you like and if you have a preference, or if there’s another better option we should know about too, share that in the comments.",
