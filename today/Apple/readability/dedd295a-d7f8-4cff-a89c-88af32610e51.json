  "description": "Macworld While the new iPad mini looks exactly like the old model right down to the marketing wallpaper, there are some notable differences, including the new A17 Pro processor and Apple Intelligence support. You’ll also find something new in the box—a modern charging cable. Apple introduced a braided USB-C charging cable with the iPad Pro in 2022, so the mini, which was updated in late 2021, missed out. And since it hadn’t received a refresh until this week, it was the only iPad that still had the old cable that’s not as nice nor as durable. With the new mini, Apple has fixed that issue and now provides a woven cable in the box. Apple sells the 1m cable for $19, which supports charging up to 60 watts and transfers data at USB 2 rates (480Mbps). The iPad mini’s USB 3 Gen 2 port can transfer data at speeds up to 10Gbps for the first time, so if you want to take advantage of the faster transfers, you’ll need a different cable. Also, if you’re in Europe, you won’t get a charger in the box. Apple previously removed the charger from the iPad Air and Pro boxes when they arrived in May and this week removed the charger from the 10th-gen iPad’s box. That’s likely in response to a wave of EU regulations targeting electronic waste. Apple still supplies a 20W charger for iPads sold in the U.S. and other regions. The iPad mini is available for preorder now and will arrive on shelves on Wednesday, October 23. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) Price When Reviewed: $499 (128GB); $599 (256GB); $799 (512GB) Best Prices Today: $499 at Apple",
