  "text": "News The iPhone 17 Pro's design changes may or may not impress you. Concept image: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro lineup might not ship with as many design changes as rumors initially suggested. Instead, a new report says the iPhone 17 Pro could look much like the iPhone 16 Pro. Despite this, Apple reportedly will introduce the biggest design changes to the iPhone lineup this year since the iPhone 12 in 2020. iPhone 17 Pro’s design may not blow you away Rumors circulating since last year indicate the iPhone 17 Pro will feature major design changes, with Apple moving from titanium edges to aluminum. Those rumors say the iPhone Pro will switch to a part-aluminum, part-glass design. The bottom half would use a glass panel to ensure wireless charging support. However, Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, said iPhone fans should not expect a “particularly bold new look.” The upcoming iPhone will look a lot like the iPhone 16 Pro, with the back camera module sporting the biggest design changes. But it won’t look like all the iPhone 17 Pro renders floating around on the internet, with a two-tone back and a Pixel-like camera bar at the top. According to Gurman’s sources, the iPhone 17 Pro will not adopt a two-tone back. Instead, it will stick to a uniform color that matches the rest of the device. Even so, Gurman notes it will mark the most significant design overhaul since the iPhone 12 in 2020. Bigger design changes to arrive in 2027 Apple is seemingly reserving the bigger design changes for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary in 2027. If the iPhone X was anything to go by, we could see the company introduce a completely redesigned iPhone. As per Gurman’s report, it will make “more extensive use of glass.” The long-delayed foldable iPhone also apparently will launch in 2027 to celebrate the iPhone’s 20th anniversary.",
