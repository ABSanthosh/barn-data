  "text": "We’ve been talking a lot about iOS 19 over the last few days, as rumors suggest that the next version of the iPhone’s operating system will receive a new interface inspired by visionOS. Although we don’t know exactly what it will look like, someone has created a live mockup of iOS 19 and made it interactive via an App Clip. App Clip brings iOS 19 mockup to life A user known as “Shane” shared the mockup via an App Clip created with Play. The concept takes visual elements from visionOS such as frosted glass-inspired backgrounds combined with more depth and shadows to imagine what iOS 19 will look like. It also has rounded icons, just like the Vision Pro operating system. To make the concept more realistic, you can interact with parts of it. For instance, it lets you access the Settings, Music, and Camera apps – this one with a live preview (if you give permission to the App Clip). Of course, the mockup is based on the latest iOS 19 rumors and is not an accurate representation made of a leak. Even so, it gives us an idea of what to expect for the next iOS update. YouTuber Jon Prosser was the first to suggest that Apple has been working on a new interface for iOS 19. He shared a mockup of what could be a brand new Camera app for the iPhone with buttons floating on the screen. The rumor was corroborated by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said earlier this month that iOS 19 and macOS 16 will mark the “most significant upgrade” to the interface in years. Yesterday, Prosser shared more iOS 19 mockups based on what his sources showed him. To back up the rumors, the WWDC 2025 artwork unveiled yesterday is heavily inspired by visionOS. Apple will unveil iOS 19 at WWDC 2025, which begins on June 9 with an opening keynote. Until then, you can try out the iOS 19 mockup on your iPhone using this App Clip.
