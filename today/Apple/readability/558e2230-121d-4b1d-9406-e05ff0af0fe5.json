Apple is believed to be working on multiple future revisions to the Apple Vision Pro, with the expectation of an updated model arriving before a full-blown sequel. The current rumor mill belief is for something lighter and more consumer friendly to be the next release in the range. In Sunday's \"Power On\" newsletter for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman writes about two successors to the Apple Vision Pro. One is a mode that is lighter and cheaper than the current model. The other is a tethered model that connects to a Mac. The intention of that model is to offer maximum responsiveness to users, with the Mac handling all of the processing. According to Gurman, it seems the lighter model will be the one out the gate next, and will arrive between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026. He adds that there is some uncertainty about the model, namely whether it should be considered a replacement for the Apple Vision Pro, or as a cheaper non-Pro model. Titanium switchRumors of a lighter Apple Vision headset have been around for a while, with it recently resurfacing on April 16. At that time, it was proposed that the new lighter model could be called the Apple Vision or the Apple Vision Air. To make the headset lighter, and therefore easier to wear for longer periods, a leaker said that Apple would switch from aluminum to titanium for the internal structures for strength. However, the outside would still use aluminum. The leaker also said at the time that the lighter model could end up with a color scheme akin to the iPhone 5-era black. This could be to allow for a clearer visual distinction between the Pro and non-Pro headsets.",
