  "description": "Macworld Sure, the AirPods Pro 2 might be a couple of years old, but Apple keeps making them better through firmware features. The latest turns them into a bonafide hearing aid with iOS 18.1, but what’s even better, however, is the fact that you can get these $249 earbuds for just $179 right now. When we reviewed the AirPods Pro 2, we gave these earbuds a near-perfect 4.5-star rating, appreciating the audio quality, the excellent noise canceling, and the superb transparency mode. “On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par. There’s not a lot here you can’t find on other models, but Apple makes it easy and has caught up to its fierce competition,” our review reads. Featuring the H2 chip, these earbuds promise a deep and immersive sound with crisp, high notes and a rich bass. They come with four pairs of silicone tips in multiple sizes so you can obtain that perfect noise cancellation level. Since our review, the AirPods Pro 2 has gained a USB-C case, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume, and can even act as a hearing aid with a built-in clinical-grade test. And since they’re available for nearly 30 percent off their regular price, it would be a shame not to take advantage of this Amazon deal. So go grab the AirPods Pro 2 for $179 and treat your ears to great sound and good health. Get the best earbuds for $70 offBuy it now at Amazon",
