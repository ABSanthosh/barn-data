Neva follows the protagonist, Alba, and Neva, her wolf cub companion, after a traumatic encounter with dark forces. The pair must do whatever it takes to survive and find a new home. Players will guide Alba and Neva through a delicate, beautiful environment. The game combines action-adventure with a 2D platformer and is deeply narrative-driven. Neva will be available via Steam for macOS and Windows on October 15. It will also be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series, and Switch. Those interested in playing will need to meet the minimum requirements of macOS Catalina (10.15) and an Intel Core i5 processor. However, the developers recommend that players have an Apple M1 machine updated to macOS Ventura (13.3) or newer.",
