There were no highly produced skits, no jabs at the competition, no speculative non-existent products designed to make the media and influencers lose their shit, and no media.The event, titled \"Envision the Future: Build Great Apps for visionOS,\" was held at the Apple Developer Center in Cupertino on October 2nd.It focused solely on visionOS and spanned just one day.The presenters were live. Many wrote code and showed the results live. Sometimes demos didn’t work the first time.There was a Q\u0026A session in the theater at the end of the presentations, followed by hors d’oeuvres in the lobby, where we could ask questions directly to a bunch of Apple designers, developers and evangelists.Because the event centered on one topic and visionOS is a very new platform, all of us developers were in the same boat. “How do I do this?” “Have you tried that?” Though I’m socially awkward, I enjoyed every interaction with my fellow developers.It was a fantastic experience, and I hope Apple holds many more like it.",
