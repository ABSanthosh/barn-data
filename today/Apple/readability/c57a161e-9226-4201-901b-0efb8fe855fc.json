  "text": "Filmmaking for the Apple Vision Pro is taking a big step forward today. Submerged, a new short film that’s the first scripted project in Immersive Video, is available now in the Apple TV app. You can catch its trailer here. Alongside Submerged’s launch, Apple has also shared a new making of video. Where to watch Submerged Vision Pro owners can watch Submerged right now inside the Apple TV app on visionOS. It is available free for users. Submerged is exclusive to the Vision Pro, and available for viewing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. The new 17-minute short film was written and directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Edward Berger. Here’s the premise: Submerged invites viewers onto a WWII-era submarine and follows its crew as they wrestle to combat a harrowing torpedo attack. This adrenaline-pumping thrill ride showcases the unique storytelling experiences made possible by Apple Immersive Video, a remarkable media format that leverages ultra-high resolution 3D video and Spatial Audio to put viewers in the center of the action. Making of video highlights the unique process of an immersive film In coordination with Submerged’s launch, Apple has released a new making of video on YouTube. It provides a glimpse into the unique challenges and opportunities afforded by Immersive Video. Berger guides most of the 5-minute video, and is clearly very bullish on Vision Pro’s potential to transform the film industry. He says of Immersive Video, “It’s going to change the future of filmmaking.” Have you watched Submerged? Let us know what you thought in the comments.
