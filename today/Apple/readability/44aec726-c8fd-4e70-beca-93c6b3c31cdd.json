  "text": "A known Apple leaker has shared a series of veiled hints about Apple's rumored smart doorbell, and it may be further evidence for reverse charging coming to iPhones. Investment in the future of Apple Home has increased since the Apple Car project was canceled. Rumors suggest one of Apple's first smart home devices will be a doorbell, expected in 2026. HomeKit Secure Video, facial recognition, and Face ID are all obvious features of a possible Apple doorbell, but a new rumor suggests MagSafe could be included. Leaker Kosutami shared a series of posts on X hinting at an Apple doorbell, ending with \"MagSafe on your door, it rings.\" MagSafe on a doorbell doesn't make much sense at first glance. It would be too easy to steal if that's how it attached to a surface, and it would be an inefficient way to power it. Many smart doorbells offer an emergency power option via a USB port, so that could be an option, but users aren't exactly walking around with a MagSafe Charger and battery pack. However, Apple doorbell users likely have an iPhone. Apple could start including reverse wireless charging with the iPhone 17 Pro. That means owners of the iPhone 17 Pro could magnetically attach their iPhone to the doorbell for emergency power. That said, the use case is still odd. Unless the doorbell is critical to accessing the home via Face ID, there isn't much reason to provide emergency power to the doorbell in this manner. Instead of powering on the doorbell to get a Face ID scan that unlocks the door, users could just use Home Key. Unless Apple is shipping a feature that prevents access without a face scan. This is all speculation around a rumor from a vague set of social media posts. Kosutami has a good track record for uncovering information from supply chain sources, so there's a solid chance MagSafe could be a feature of the Apple doorbell. At the least, it's probably a feature in a leaked EVT model, which is what Kosutami usually gets ahold of. The product isn't expected to release until late 2026, so feature sets will likely change dramatically in that time. The leaker also shared a feature that would come to \"next generation\" AirPods Pro. The Apple doorbell would ring the AirPods in addition to the HomePods. HomeKit-connected doorbells already can play a chime over HomePods. AirPods Pro would be a natural next step for chime playback, though it isn't clear why this would need a newer model. Kosutami doesn't have a perfect track record. While they've shared legitimate-looking pre-production photos, they've also shared incredibly inaccurate rumors like that the Apple Watch Series \"X\" would have a new connector. This rumor is rated possible, even if MagSafe integration can't be easily explained.",
