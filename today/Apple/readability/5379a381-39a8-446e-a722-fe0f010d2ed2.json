  "text": "News Apple COO Jeff Williams announced his retirement on Tuesday. Photo: Apple Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer in charge of the company’s global operations since 2010, will retire later this year. Even before then, though, his position will be filled by Sabih Khan, who currently serves as senior vice president of operations. Apple described the move as “a long-planned succession” in a press release on Tuesday. The move certainly ends years of speculation that Williams would someday take Tim Cook’s place as Apple CEO. Apple CEO Tim Cook pays tribute to retiring COO “Jeff and I have worked alongside each other for as long as I can remember, and Apple wouldn’t be what it is without him,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in the press release. “He’s helped to create one of the most respected global supply chains in the world; launched Apple Watch and overseen its development; architected Apple’s health strategy; and led our world-class team of designers with great wisdom, heart, and dedication. I am and will always be beyond grateful for his numerous contributions to Apple over the years and his loyal friendship. Jeff’s true legacy can be seen in the amazing team he’s created and, while he’ll be greatly missed, he leaves the work of the future in incredible hands.” Jeff Williams joined Apple in 1998 as head of worldwide procurement, and led the company’s worldwide operations since 2010. He played a key role in the launch of the iPhone, and led the engineering development of the Apple Watch. He’ll step down as COO later in July, but continue overseeing Apple’s design team and Apple Watch, as well as the company’s health initiatives. He’ll fully retire “late in the year” — probably after Apple finds executives to take on all the many roles he currently plays at the company. Sabih Khan steps up As senior vice president of operations, Sabih Khan is in charge of Apple’s global supply chain. “Sabih is a brilliant strategist who has been one of the central architects of Apple’s supply chain,” said Cook in the press release. “While overseeing Apple’s supply chain, he has helped pioneer new technologies in advanced manufacturing, overseen the expansion of Apple’s manufacturing footprint in the United States, and helped ensure that Apple can be nimble in response to global challenges. He has advanced our ambitious efforts in environmental sustainability, helping reduce Apple’s carbon footprint by more than 60 percent. Above all, Sabih leads with his heart and his values, and I know he will make an exceptional Chief Operating Officer.” Khan joined Apple in 1995.",
