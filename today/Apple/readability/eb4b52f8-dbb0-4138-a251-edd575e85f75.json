GameSir fixed the controller layout problem by letting you change the Tarantula Pro's on the fly. There are tons of controllers that you can use with your iPhone, Mac, iPad, and even your Apple TV. GameSir makes some of my favorites, including the Xbox-like Cyclone 2 that I reviewed previously. But the Tarantula Pro is a different beast, not least because it's built more like a PS4 controller than an Xbox one. That means the joysticks are in the middle, laid out symmetrically. Some people like that more, though I admit I'm indifferent. But this controller seeks to appease everyone in a different, key way. Choosing a controller normally means picking one that has X,Y/A,B buttons like an Xbox, or Y,X/B,A like a Nintendo Switch. But this controller can do both, and you can choose which one you want anytime. It's a handy addition, and the buttons change thanks to a gear mechanism inside the controller. Whether that's a truly useful feature or more of a gimmick, only you can decide. But it's just the start. Because the $70 GameSir Tarantula Pro has a lot of features. And I think you're going to enjoy them a lot. GameSir Tarantula Pro review: DesignAs mentioned, this controller closely resembles the Sony DualShock 4 layout, which is no bad thing. It feels familiar, solid, and like it will stand more than a few rage-quid-fueled throws. Tarantula Pro review: The Cyclone 2 and Tarantula Pro have different layoutsLike a lot of controllers, the Tarantula has more than its fair share of RGB lighting. I confess that I don't need my controller to light up, but those who do can customize the lights via the GameSir app. In terms of materials, the controller is plastic with a textured finish in the areas that you touch most. That means you won't find the controller squirming around, which I like. It's a good job, too, because the built-in \"HD rumble\" motors pack a punch. I reckon a more slippery customer might be a problem during the more vibration-heavy battles. In total, there are nine programmable buttons, including two back buttons, on offer. And then there are the face buttons that I mentioned at the top of this review — there's a lot going on. Those face buttons use a cushioned membrane design and are nice and clicky. On the other side, we find a tactile micro switch D-pad, which is even clickier and quite the fidget toy. Between those things, we have the two sticks, and they feel great. That's thanks to the Mag-Res TMR tech that should improve durability and longevity. TMR stands for Tunneling Magnetoresistance, the tech used to detect stick movement. That eliminates the wear problems that cause stick drift, a problem for many a controller. Around the back, there are Hall Effect analog triggers with support for a hair trigger if you want it. A simple micro switch controls each trigger's mode, allowing each to be set up differently. Other tidbits include a six-axis gyroscope and a 1,200mAh battery that lasts plenty long enough between charges. NFC support is included for Switch users, too. GameSir Tarantula Pro review: FeaturesThe GameSir Tarantula Pro is compatible with Apple's Mac, iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV. It'll also work with a Windows PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, and the Steam Deck. Tarantula Pro review: The optional stand is a no-brainer if you choose this controller.Connecting to those devices means using one of three different options. Those include a USB-C cable, a Bluetooth connection, or a 2.4GHz wireless connection to the included USB-C dongle. I've been primarily using the controller with my Mac, via Bluetooth. I've used the Xbox controller layout while playing games via Nvidia GeForce Now, and it's been solid throughout. As for features, there are two that a lot of people might not use, but it's good that they're there. The first is the option to configure a macro by holding the M button and one of the macro buttons together. Then you can press a combination of buttons to map to that macro button for quick access. The second is a turbo mode with slow, medium, and fast options for the face buttons as well as LB, RB, LT, and RT. You can cancel the turbo by holding M and pressing the Home button. Other options include the ability to calibrate the triggers and the gyroscope when things go awry. I haven't had to do either, but it's good to know the options are there. The final feature is an optional one that costs an extra $10 — a charging dock. It's a place to keep and charge your controller, and I heartily recommend it. The dock houses your Tarantula Pro and the USB dongle, so you don't lose them. Even better, the controller turns itself on when it's picked up — it's the little things, right? My experience with the Tarantula ProAs I said, I've mainly been putting the Tarantula Pro through its paces using GeForce Now on my Mac. I'm one of the few people who seem to have no problems, possibly thanks to the Netgear Wi-Fi 7 mesh setup that I've been using. Tarantula Pro review: The controller has two back buttons for extra flexibility.I've played a variety of games, including Avowed and Atomfall (PC versions via Xbox Game Pass) and Hades (PC version via Steam). The controller has been flawless throughout. I do think that I prefer the asymmetrical layout of something like the Cyclone 2, but only slightly. I've never used the Tarantula Pro and wish its sticks were in different places. One thing I do want to call out is the controller's heft, because it's got some weight to it. I don't have anything to measure it, but it does feel heavier than it looks. That's likely down to the materials used and the mechanism for the switchable buttons, and I quite like it. It feels solid, like a quality bit of kit, although some might find it too heavy after a while. Beyond that, the sticks feel great, and I've enjoyed using the triggers in Hall Effect mode. I did test the hair trigger setup, and it worked fine — it just isn't for me. A Pro controller with all the bells and whistlesUltimately, I'm a fan of the Tarantula Pro. Sure, it comes with some features I won't make the most of. But those that I do all work as expected, and they feel great while they do it. Tarantula Pro review: You can change the face button layout if that's the way you roll.It isn't the cheapest controller on the market, nor should it be. At $70, it's $20 more than the Cyclone 2, which is also a pretty solid controller. But if you want features like a switchable face button layout, multi-platform connectivity, and HD rumble, you'll get what you pay for. Just make sure to spring the extra $10 and get the version with the charging dock in the box. GameSir Tarantula Pro review: Pros A controller with real \"pro\" features A solid construction that oozes quality Non-slip design Stick drift-busting tech Non-slip design Customizable buttons and layout GameSir Tarantula Pro review: Cons There are much cheaper controllers You might not need all those features Rating: 4 out of 5If you don't need all of the features on offer, save yourself some money and get a Cyclone 2 instead — assuming you like the layout. Otherwise, pick up the Tarantula Pro. You won't regret your purchase. Where to buy the GameSir Tarantula ProYou can buy the Tarantula Pro direct from GameSir or Amazon for $69.99. The version with the charging dock is only available directly, priced at $79.99.",
