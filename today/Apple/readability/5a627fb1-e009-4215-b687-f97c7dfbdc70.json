  "text": "News The series could be a lot of fun, but it might help if you're French or a Francophile. Photo: Apple TV+ As someone who lived in the French-speaking part of Switzerland for a few years, I’m no stranger to poking fun when I catch a whiff of the sometimes-preposterously self-important and pretentious side of the French persona. And the new Apple TV+ trailer for Carême reeks of it. While the premise of the streamer’s upcoming French-language series sounds interesting — a rags-to-riches story of the world’s first celebrity chef, who also worked as a spy — the series looks overwhelmingly French. “Chef. Spy. Lover,” reads the tagline for the historical drama. Apple TV+ calls it “daring” and “provocative.” Ooh la la. Carême premieres April 30 for those with a taste for that sort of thing. New trailer for Carême looks like an overly French feast for the senses From its pretentious opening voiceover about food — and amid the intrigue and sexual innuendo throughout — the Carême trailer makes the show look like a sumptuous feast for the senses. So you better come hungry. However, a massive meal of Frenchness doesn’t always sit well. The show stars a bunch of French-award-winning French people, naturally: César Award winner Benjamin Voisin (Lost Illusions), César Award nominee Jérémie Renier (My Way), César Award winner Lyna Khoudri (Papicha) and Alice Da Luz (Hanami). Martin Bourboulon (Les Trois Mousquetaires: D’Artagnan) directs it. Apple TV+ describes the show like this: “Carême follows the thrilling story of the world’s first celebrity chef, Antonin Carême (Voisin), who rose from humble beginnings in Paris to the height of culinary stardom in Napoleon’s Europe. While he dreams only of becoming the most famous chef in the world, his talent and ambitions attract the attention of renowned and powerful politicians, who use him as a spy for France. Determined to escape poverty and fulfill his dream, Carême can choose revenge or he can have it all — women, wealth, fame — but at what cost? His love? His soul? His life?” Such drama! Based on a book about the real guy Carême is based on the book Cooking for Kings: The Life of Antonin Carême, the First Celebrity Chef by multi-award-winning historian and playwright Ian Kelly (The King’s Man). Kelly and Davide Serino (The Bad Guy) created the series, executive produced by Vanessa van Zuylen with VVZ Production and Dominique Farrugia with Banijay’s Shine Fiction. The series was shot on location in emblematic sites in and around Paris, including Opéra Garnier, Palais des Tuileries and Palais-Royal, Apple TV+ said. The series isn’t the first show on Apple TV+ to set off my French alarm. That dubious distinction goes to La Maison. That’s “where high fashion meets high drama in a behind-the-curtain look at an iconic French haute couture house,” according to the streamer. Then there’s the stuff I got into, somewhat. Like Liaison, a high-stakes, contemporary thriller with Vincent Cassel and Eva Green. And the wine-soaked, manga-inspired, French-Japanese collaboration Drops of God. And coming soon we can expect A l’ombre des forêts, starring Benoît Magimel and Mélanie Laurent. Watch the Carême trailer Watch dramas on Apple TV+ If you like what you see in the Carême trailer, you’ll be thrilled to know it debuts April 30 on Apple TV+ with its first two episodes, followed by one episode weekly on Wednesdays through June 11.
