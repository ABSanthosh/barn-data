When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.
