  "text": "When Apple Watch Series 10 was announced in September, the company also unveiled a new Gold Link Bracelet made of stainless steel. However, while the Natural and Slate versions were available from day one, the gold version was unavailable – but that has just changed. Apple Watch Gold Link Bracelet now available Two months after it was announced, the gold version of the Link Bracelet for the Apple Watch is now available to order from Apple’s online store. However, there’s a catch. As noted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple says that the first orders will be shipped in 5 to 6 weeks, which is around Christmas. Although the website gives the option for users to search for pickup availability at a nearby Apple Retail Store, it seems that the accessory is not available anywhere for now. The Link Bracelet was one of the first watch bands created for the Apple Watch. It’s made of 316L stainless steel and has more than 100 components in its composition. With the launch of the Series 10, Apple has updated the Link Bracelet with new colors to match the finishes of the latest Apple Watch. It’s worth noting that the 42mm version also works with previous smaller Apple Watch models, while the 46mm version also works with previous versions of the larger Apple Watch – including the Ultra. You can now order the new Apple Watch Gold Link Bracelet for $349. Don’t forget to take a look at some of the deals on Apple Watch bands at Amazon.
