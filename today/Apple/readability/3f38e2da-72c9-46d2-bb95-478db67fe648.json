Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Normally, you pay a lot for a jumbo iPad Pro, but sometimes a sale comes along and you can get that big-screen tablet at a steep discount. Like, for instance, this near-mint refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro for just $399.99. It’s a third-gen model from 2018, but it’s still great for a wide variety of uses. And it doesn’t cost $1,299 like the latest model does. Refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd-gen model) Right from the start, the iPad Pro appealed to people who like a large screen. So let’s take a closer look at the 12.9-inch Liquid Retina display in this refurbished model. With a resolution of 2,732 by 2,048, everything looks sharp and vibrant — perfect for those moments when you want your artwork to shine or need to read fine text without straining your eyes. Apple’s ProMotion technology really enhances the experience, offering a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. This means drawing with an Apple Pencil or scrolling through your feed feels incredibly smooth. Plus, True Tone adjusts the display’s color temperature based on your surroundings, ensuring it always looks just right. Under the hood, this iPad Pro packs an A12X Bionic chip that handles demanding apps and multitasking with ease. (Note: It does not support the upcoming Apple Intelligence features.) This chip also includes a Neural Engine, which is great for creative tools and photo editing. With 64GB of storage, you should have more than enough space for all your favorite apps, files and media. And here’s a nice perk: This refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro features a 12-megapixel rear camera that captures stunning photos and can even record in 4K. Thanks to Smart HDR, your pictures will boast rich details and vibrant colors, allowing you to snap great shots. An Apple tablet that’s big, thin and light In terms of design, this iPad is sleek and lightweight, so it’s easy to slip into your bag and take with you. It also supports the Apple Pencil (2nd generation), which is perfect for drawing, jotting down notes or giving a polished presentation. Worried about battery life? You shouldn’t. This refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro can last up to 10 hours on a single charge for web browsing or binge-watching your favorite Apple TV+ series. With iPadOS running the show, you’ll enjoy handy features that boost productivity, like Split View for multitasking and a redesigned Home screen for easy app access. Plus, with regular updates, your device will stay fresh and functional for a long time. Save on a refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pro So why the low price? As mentioned, this is an older tablet and it’s also refurbished. However, it’s in near-mint condition with a grade “A” rating. That’s how you can get a 12.9-inch iPad Pro for only $399.99.
