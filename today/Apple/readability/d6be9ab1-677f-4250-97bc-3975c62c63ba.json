At the time, the company didn’t give many details except to say that it would prioritize its efforts on other products. Now we know what’s coming next: realistic AI-based filters. Instagram to let users edit their videos with AI-generated content Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri shared a video this week teasing the new AI-based filters. Called “Movie Gen,” the feature will let users apply realistic filters to Instagram videos. According to the executive, Movie Gen can change “nearly any aspect of your videos” with a “simple text prompt.” In the video, Mosseri also shows him with different outfits, backgrounds and accessories – all generated by AI. “I’m super excited about Movie Gen, our early AI research model that will let you change nearly any aspect of your videos with a simple text prompt,” Mosseri said in a post on Instagram. Although he didn’t give an exact date for launching Movie Gen, the executive said that Meta wants to bring the feature to Instagram sometime next year. In the comments section, many users expressed concern about the feature, as it could be used to trick people with fake content. Instagram currently shows a label for AI-generated content (such as photos edited with Apple’s Clean Up feature), but it’s super easy to bypass it. Some people argued that “no one wants this” and asked for an option not to see AI-generated content on their timeline. Earlier this month, OpenAI launched Sora, a tool for generating entire videos with AI. The feature is also seen by some people as controversial as it lets people easily create realistic videos of situations that never happened. As for Instagram’s AR filters, they will be removed from the app on January 14, 2025. More details can be found on the Meta website.
