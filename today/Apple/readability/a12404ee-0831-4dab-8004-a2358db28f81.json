Image: Apple/Cult of Mac Apple Watch SE is already the most affordable wearable Apple makes, and a deal knocks up to 32% off the second-generation of this budget smartwatch. That means even the larger version is below $200. If you’re trying to get ready for summer beach season, an Apple Watch can help motivate you to exercise and track your progress.

Why you want an Apple Watch Recently, a friend wanted her first smartwatch and asked me which she should choose. The answer was undoubtedly Apple Watch SE 2. There’s no reason to put down $400 or more on a product category she’d never used before and didn’t yet know whether she’d get much benefit from. Still, I wasn’t surprised that she loves it. Even the most basic of Apple’s wrist computers comes packed with features. At the top of the list is activity tracking, including detailed metrics for various workouts. Plus, there are health monitoring features such as heart rate notifications and fall detection. Not just for exercise tracking Beyond health and fitness, the Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) provides convenient access to notifications, calls and messages directly on your wrist, allowing you to stay connected without constantly reaching for your iPhone. It also supports Apple Pay for quick and secure contactless payments. And thanks to this Apple Watch SE deal, you get all the benefits without breaking the bank. Apple Watch SE deal makes it an even better bargain The second-generation Apple Watch SE is always a bargain. Its starting price of $249 launched the wearable at $30 below the original version. And thanks to a sale going on now, so you don’t even have to pay that much. Amazon cut the price of the version with a 40mm screen by 32%, reducing it to $169.97. You can choose the wearable in either the midnight or starlight casing colors at that price, though the deal isn’t available for every Watch band option. Take note: some bands raise the total to $239.17, so choose carefully. Buy it from: Amazon Most affordable Apple Watch Those who want a larger screen can get a deal on the second-gen Apple Watch SE with a 44mm screen. It ordinarily sells for $279, but an Amazon sale lowers that to $188.74 for the model with a midnight case and midnight sport band. That’s a 32% savings. Most other color options are available at $199.97. You can get it for that price in either a midnight or starlight case and several band options, but the deal doesn’t cover the starlight sport band at all. Buy it from: Amazon Affordable smartwatch Get yourself a fast and modern smartwatch with a budget-friendly price.",
