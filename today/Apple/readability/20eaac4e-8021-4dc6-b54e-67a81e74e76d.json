  "description": "Macworld Other than the chip, the new iPad Air is identical to the old model, so there’s no reason not to jump on a clearance sale. And we’ve got an incredible one: Amazon is selling the 11-inch M2 iPad Air with 512GB of storage and 5G for $799, a massive savings of $250 on its $1,049 MSRP and the best price we’ve ever seen by far. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display is the same gorgeous 2360x1640p screen that we’ve come to love over the years. With 500 nits of brightness, you can use this tablet pretty much anywhere you are, no matter how brightly lit the area is. On top of the fact that this is a cellular model so you can take it anywhere (with service from your wireless company), the tablet has a hefty 512GB capacity, which is quite a bit of space for apps, games, photos, and anything else you want to fill it up with. When we reviewed the M2 Apple iPad Air last year, we gave it a four-star rating, appreciating the processor and the upgraded performance, as well as the landscape front camera with Center Stage, so you’ll never be out of the frame during video calls. So forget about the M3 and go grab this incredible deal on the 11-inch cellular version of the M2 iPad Air with 512GB for $799. The M2 iPad Air has never been this cheapBuy now at Amazon",
