  "text": "Apple has released the third beta version of MacOS Sequoia 15.4, iOS 18.4, and iPadOS 18.4, for users who are participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. These beta builds are working on a variety of new features and capabilities, including refinements to Apple Intelligence, the controversial and frustrating sorted Mail Categories feature from iPhone is coming to iPad and Mac, a new ambient music feature in Control Center, new Emoji icons, and more smaller features and changes. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.4 Beta 3 Installing the latest beta is simple, if your device is already enrolled in the beta programs: Open “Settings” app Go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Select to update to iOS 18.4 beta 3 or iPadOS 18.4 beta 3 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 3 Assuming your Mac is enrolled in the beta programs, getting the latest version is easy: Go to the  Apple menu, choose “System Settings” Choose “General” and then choose “Software Update” Choose to “Update Now” for MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 3 The Mac, iPhone, or iPad must restart to finish installation. What is the release date for iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4? Apple usually goes through several beta versions before issuing a final release to the general public, and with this being beta 3, we might reasonably expect the final versions of iOS 18.4, MacOS Sequoia 15.4, and iPadOS 18.4 to be released towards the end of the month. Of course nobody outside of Apple knows the release schedule for software updates, so this could happen sooner, or later, as well.",
