  "text": "Apple on Tuesday introduced a new generation of the Mac mini, and it’s impressively mini – much more compact than its predecessor. But the new Mac mini isn’t just about a new design, it’s also about incredible engineering. It shows how Apple still excels at building the best computers. I’ve been a Mac user for a long time, and the Mac mini has always seemed remarkable to me. Something ahead of its time. I was always amazed at how Apple managed to fit a full computer into a small package, given the limitations at the time. For a while, the Mac family had troubled times (I’m looking at you, Butterfly keyboard). But things seem to be back on track, especially after the transition to Apple Silicon Macs. The company promised that the move to its own chips would open up a new world of possibilities for the Mac, and we’re seeing it now. The M4 Mac mini is one of the most impressive computers Apple has ever built The new M4 Mac mini is the culmination of many of the technologies that Apple has introduced in recent years. I remember dreaming for years of a Mac mini that was the size of an Apple TV. Now we kind of have it. And the best part is: it comes with no compromises. In the past, having a super-portable machine usually meant that you were giving up something in exchange. But the M4 Mac mini is not only the most compact desktop computer Apple has ever introduced, it’s also a pretty powerful one. For instance, the base M4 chip has a faster CPU than the M2 Max in the latest Mac Studio. And the M4 Pro is even more powerful. We’re talking about a computer almost the size of an Apple TV that is capable of rendering 8K videos and running console-level games with ray-tracing. But I’m also glad to see Apple adding more value to the Mac and also giving users what they want. The Mac mini now comes with 16GB of RAM as standard, and it also has a bunch of ports, including USB-C, Thunderbolt, Ethernet, and HDMI. But here’s what really makes the Mac mini an easy choice, perhaps one of the best: the price. With all these upgrades, Apple is still selling it for the same $599 as the previous generation. It’s hard not to recommend the Mac mini to anyone who already has a desktop setup at home. It’s powerful, sleek, compact, and it’s at a great price. For me, the new Mac mini shows the essence of Apple at its best. And I really hope that the company continues to follow this path for its future products. What about you?
