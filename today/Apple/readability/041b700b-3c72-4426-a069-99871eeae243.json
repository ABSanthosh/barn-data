  "text": "With Apple Intelligence and Genmoji, users can now create their own emoji. Even so, the classic emoji are still available and will certainly never go out of style. The emoji are so popular that one artist has now turned Apple‚Äôs running shoe emoji into a real product. You can now buy shoes that look like an emoji designed by Apple As reported by The Verge, artist and designer Jose Wong decided to create real running shoes based on the design of the Apple-made emoji, known to many iPhone, iPad and Mac users. Called ‚ÄúThe Shoe 1,‚Äù it will be available in sizes ranging from 5 to 12 and will be sold online for $219.90 a pair. If The Shoe 1 or Apple‚Äôs running shoe emoji looks familiar to you, that‚Äôs because the emoji was inspired by the classic New Balance 574, which was often worn by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. However, the emoji replaces the New Balance logo with two parallel strokes. Wong used elements from both New Balance 574 and Apple products to create The Shoe 1. For instance, the packaging is very minimalist with an envelope that reads ‚ÄúDesigned by Josewong in China. The insoles, on the other hand, feature an impression of an iPhone‚Äôs internal components. The shoes feature an upper section made of full-grain nubuck leather combined with mesh for breathability, while the midsole and heel are made from lightweight EVA foam paired with a polyurethane rim to deliver a mix of comfort and ‚Äúall-day support.‚Äù Those interested in The Shoe 1 can order them now. Wong says that the shoes will start shipping next week and that all sales will be ‚Äúfinal‚Äù with no refunds. Units will most likely be limited. You can find more details here.
