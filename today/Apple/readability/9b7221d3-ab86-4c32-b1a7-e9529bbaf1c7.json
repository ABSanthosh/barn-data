Just jot your notes on the system’s reusable notebook, and the smartpen automatically digitizes your handwritten notes and drawings in real time. It also translates your notes, captures audio and performs other neat tricks. This unique smartpen set is on sale for $129.99 (regularly $139), but supply is limited. SyncPen 4 smartpen: Digitize your notes, drawings and more Let’s be honest — keeping track of notes can get messy. You could use an iPad, but sometimes you might prefer the feel of an old-school notebook. Whether you’re scribbling ideas in a meeting or jotting down reminders at home, finding a balance between the simplicity of handwriting and the convenience of digitization can feel impossible. That’s where the SyncPen 4 steps in to change the game. At its heart, this smartpen combines the timeless feel of writing by hand with the perks of modern technology. Using an infrared camera and a unique micro-dot pattern, the pen captures every stroke you make when you write or draw on the included smart notebook. Those handwritten notes then sync directly to the Newyes app and go straight to the cloud for secure storage. Whether you’re reviewing your notes on your phone or sharing them from your tablet, the app makes sure your ideas are always within reach. The included smart notebook is no ordinary notebook. You can wipe its polyurethane pages clean with an eraser, wet wipes or even a hot air dryer. This means you can use the same pages over and over, cutting down on paper waste and giving you a cost-effective way to keep writing. It’s an eco-friendly solution that doesn’t skimp on convenience. Transcribe notes in 73 languages and record audio, too The SyncPen smartpen doesn’t just record your handwriting, either. It can transcribe your notes into 73 different languages, including mathematical symbols. This feature is powered by MyScript technology and is perfect for translating ideas into polished text. Once your notes are ready, you can export them in formats like PDF, DOCX, JPEG or even MP4. Sharing is seamless, whether you’re sending a quick file to a colleague or uploading it to social media. And the SyncPen 4 doesn’t stop at handwriting. It also records audio to accompany your notes. This is a lifesaver for students, journalists or anyone who wants to capture every detail of a lecture or meeting. Need to revisit your thought process? The app’s playback feature lets you watch your writing come to life stroke by stroke. It even works when you go offline. The smartpen stores your notes until go back online, so you don’t need to worry about losing anything important. The package comes with everything you need, including refills, a USB-C charging cable and the handy PU notebook. Save on a SyncPen 4 smartpen set Enjoy the best of both worlds: the comfort of handwriting and the convenience of digital backups.
