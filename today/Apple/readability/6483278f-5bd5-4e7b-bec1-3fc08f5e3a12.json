Insightful Sleep Apnea Notifications Sleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops momentarily during sleep. The condition, which is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, goes undiagnosed in most cases, and if left untreated, can have important consequences on health. Building on the intelligent health features already available, Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.3 Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea by tracking and analyzing breathing disturbance data. To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data so Apple Watch can notify the user if the data indicates signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred, educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, and a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider. While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can lead to less restful sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. The sleep apnea notification feature was developed with advanced machine learning methods, validated in a clinical study, and is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan. Audio Playback Through Speakers For the first time, audio can play back through the two built-in speakers on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch. Audio from a range of apps can now play back through the two built-in speakers on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Additional watchOS 11 Features Apple Watch Ultra 2 also features many other enhancements with watchOS 11: Activity rings are more customizable than ever, with the ability to specify Activity ring goals by the day of the week so the rings provide the right amount of motivation at the right moments. Users can also pause their rings for a day, week, month, or more without affecting their award streaks, allowing users to plan a rest day, care for an injury, or just take a day off. The Workout app offers even more workout types that can track distance using enhancements in GPS positioning, including various field sports, Downhill Skiing, Cross Country Skiing, Snowboarding, Golf, Outdoor Rowing, and more. Users can also see their route maps for more workout types. watchOS 11 also features a more intelligent Smart Stack to help users quickly access important information; a new Photos watch face that uses machine learning to help users select and compose their best photo options; the Translate app and Check In on Apple Watch; the ability to scroll through any app with the double tap gesture; summarized notifications powered by Apple Intelligence;4 and more.

While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data so Apple Watch can notify the user if the data indicates signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred, educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, and a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cfigure aria-label=\"Media, Breathing Disturbances graph displayed on iPhone 16 Pro.\"\u003e\n                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                         \n                            \n                            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can lead to less restful sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea.\n                            \u003c/div\u003e\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2024/09/apple-watch-ultra-2-now-available-in-black-titanium/article/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-breathing-disturbances-Health-app-240909.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image - Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-breathing-disturbances-Health-app-240909_inline\" aria-label=\"Download media, Breathing Disturbances graph displayed on iPhone 16 Pro.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                    \u003c/div\u003e\n            \u003c/figure\u003e\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eThe sleep apnea notification feature was developed with advanced machine learning methods, validated in a clinical study, and is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon.
