CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today previewed iOS 26, a major update that brings a beautiful new design, intelligent experiences, and improvements to the apps users rely on every day. The new design provides a more expressive and delightful experience across the system while maintaining the instant familiarity of iOS. Integrated throughout the system and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence gets even more capable. Updates to the Phone and Messages apps help users stay connected while eliminating distractions like unwanted calls. iOS 26 also introduces new features in CarPlay, Apple Music, Maps, and Wallet, as well as Apple Games, a brand-new app that gives players a single destination for all their games. “iOS 26 shines with the gorgeous new design and meaningful improvements to the features users rely on every day, making iPhone even more helpful,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Experiences are more expressive and personal, from the Lock Screen and Home Screen, to new capabilities across Phone and Messages that help users focus on the connections that matter most. And with powerful new Apple Intelligence capabilities integrated across the system, users can get things done easier than ever.” A Beautiful New Look The new design makes apps and system experiences more expressive and delightful, while keeping iOS instantly familiar. It’s crafted with Liquid Glass — a new translucent material that reflects and refracts its surroundings, bringing greater focus to content, and delivering a new level of vitality across controls, navigation, app icons, widgets, and more. The new design extends to the Home Screen and Lock Screen, making them more personal and expressive than ever. Liquid Glass also brings new customization options to app icons and widgets, including a stunning clear look.

Liquid Glass also brings new customization options to app icons and widgets, including a stunning clear look. On the Lock Screen, the time fluidly adapts to the available space in an image, and spatial scenes bring wallpapers to life with a 3D effect when users move iPhone. Updated design elements also deliver fresh experiences in apps. A simplified, streamlined Camera layout helps users keep their attention on the moment they’re capturing, and the Photos app is updated to feature separate tabs for Library and Collections views. In Safari, web pages flow from the top edge to the bottom of the screen, enabling users to see more of the page while maintaining access to frequently used actions like refresh and search. In Apple Music, News, and Podcasts, the tab bar is redesigned to float above users’ content, dynamically shrink when users are browsing to put content front and center, and then expand when they scroll back up. An updated set of APIs provides developers with access to Liquid Glass materials and components so they can make their apps appear just as dynamic and delightful. New Capabilities Powered by Apple Intelligence Apple Intelligence elevates the iPhone experience and helps users get things done easier than ever, while unlocking new ways to communicate and do more with what’s on their screen. Live Translation is integrated into Messages, FaceTime, and Phone to help users communicate across languages, translating text and audio on the fly.1 Live Translation is enabled by Apple-built models that run entirely on device, so users’ personal conversations stay personal.

Building on Apple Intelligence, visual intelligence extends to a user’s iPhone screen so they can search and take action on anything they’re viewing across apps. Users can ask ChatGPT questions about what they’re looking at onscreen to learn more, as well as search Google, Etsy, or other supported apps to find similar images and products. Visual intelligence also recognizes when a user is looking at an event and suggests adding it to their calendar, repopulating key details like date, time, and location.2 Building on Apple Intelligence, visual intelligence now extends to a user’s iPhone screen, making it easy to search and take action across apps with anything they’re viewing. Genmoji and Image Playground provide users with even more ways to express themselves, including mixing their favorite emoji, Genmoji, and descriptions together to create something new.3 Genmoji and Image Playground provide users with even more opportunities for self-expression, including mixing their favorite emoji, Genmoji, and descriptions together to create brand-new images.

Apple Intelligence can now automatically identify and summarize order tracking details from emails sent from merchants and delivery carriers, giving users the ability to see their full order details and progress notifications all in one place — even for purchases not made with Apple Pay. Additionally, a new Foundation Models framework opens up access for any app to tap directly into the on-device foundation model at the core of Apple Intelligence, giving developers direct access to powerful intelligence that’s fast, built with privacy at its core, and available offline, using AI inference that is free of cost. Features for Staying Connected and Eliminating Interruptions Fundamental to the iPhone experience, the Phone app now offers a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails all in one place. Call Screening builds on Live Voicemail and helps eliminate interruptions by gathering information from the caller and giving users the details they need to decide if they want to pick up or ignore the call.4 And for the times when a user is stuck on hold, Hold Assist notifies the user when a live agent is available.5 The new Call Screening feature is shown on iPhone 16 Pro.

In Apple Music, News, and Podcasts, the tab bar is redesigned to float above users’ content, dynamically shrink when users are browsing to put content front and center, and then expand when they scroll back up.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eAn updated set of APIs provides developers with access to Liquid Glass materials and components so they can make their apps appear just as dynamic and delightful.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Capabilities Powered by Apple Intelligence\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eApple Intelligence elevates the iPhone experience and helps users get things done easier than ever, while unlocking new ways to communicate and do more with what’s on their screen.

Additionally, iPhone can now use on-device intelligence to better understand a user’s daily route, presenting them with their preferred route when they’re headed home or to the office, along with notifying them of delays and offering alternate routes.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"ios-26-apple-maps-updates\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-0e14697616563aa921e47ede8f4f2be4\" href=\"#gallery-0e14697616563aa921e47ede8f4f2be4\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-0e14697616563aa921e47ede8f4f2be4\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA user’s Visits are shown in Apple Maps on iPhone 16 Pro.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-adb543ddc5353b51eb837ac6b4d6e655\" href=\"#gallery-adb543ddc5353b51eb837ac6b4d6e655\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-adb543ddc5353b51eb837ac6b4d6e655\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA user’s preferred route to work is shown in Apple Maps on iPhone 16 Pro.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-0e14697616563aa921e47ede8f4f2be4\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-0e14697616563aa921e47ede8f4f2be4\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:visits\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eIn iOS 26, users can choose to have iPhone detect when they’re at a place like a restaurant or shop, and view all of their Visited Places in Maps.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/article/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-Maps-Visited-Places-250609.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -
