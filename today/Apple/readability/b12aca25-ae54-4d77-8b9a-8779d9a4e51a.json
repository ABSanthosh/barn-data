  "text": "As we previously reviewed here on 9to5Mac, SongCapsule Quiz is a game inspired by iPod’s Music Quiz in which the player has to guess the name of the song, album or artist playing. With its latest update, SongCapsule Quiz now has new rules aimed at making the game more fun, as well as more artist playlists and a few other changes. What’s new in SongCapsule Quiz One of the biggest changes coming with version 1.2 of the game is that players now need to complete all the levels in a playlist before they can replay the previous ones. According to the developers, this should encourage players to keep progressing to earn more points, rather than replaying easier levels. Once you’ve unlocked all the levels, you can replay any you want. In addition, points are now only valid for each specific level and are not carried over to the next. And to ensure fairer competition, only the most difficult levels will count for points in Game Center. “Now, you can be sure that everyone is playing at the highest difficulty available when competing on the leaderboards.” There are also four new artist playlists to choose from: Britney Spears, Lana Del Rey, Sabrina Carpenter, and The Weeknd. SongCapsule Quiz now shows all playlists curated by Sorcererhat Playlists by default, even if you don’t have them in your music library. But you can hide the playlists you don’t want in the settings. Another important change relates to the app’s requirements. Whereas previously it relied on an Apple Music subscription, the game now works for anyone. And if you want to subscribe to Apple Music, you can do so right in the SongCapsule Quiz. You can download SongCapsule Quiz on the App Store. Although the game is free, it has a paid premium tier that unlocks more features such as challenging your friends in Apple’s Game Center.
