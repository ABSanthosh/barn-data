  "text": "For me, one of the biggest issues with making the switch from a MacBook to a Mac mini was the display aspect of it. MacBooks all have fairly great displays, especially on the MacBook Pro. However, finding a good display that pairs nicely with a Mac desktop always feels like a little bit of a challenge. You either have to go with Apple’s expensive options, or compromise significantly on the experience with a third party. Some common compromises include poor brightness, a lack of USB-C, or a lack of macOS integration. While the BenQ MA270U certainly isn’t a Studio Display replacement, it performs excellently in all of the qualities that matter to me. What stands out to me First things first, this display comes in at $459. That’s cheaper than the Mac mini, even if you’re buying one from the education store. At that price point, it packs an aluminum stand, 400 nits of brightness, USB-C connectivity, and a built in USB hub. It’s a 4K 27″ display, and also offers 2 HDMI ports for plugging in a game console or anything else you might want on your desk. The built in USB hub is a great perk. The monitor offers two USB-A ports and an additional USB-C port, allowing you to connect up to 3 USB connections to your Mac through one cable. It also provides 90W of power via USB-C, which’ll recharge your MacBook quickly – if you’re using one. The USB-A ports come in clutch as well, since the M4 Mac mini doesn’t include them. Some will point out that 400 nits of brightness is a little sub-par, which is certainly true compared to Apple’s displays. However, this isn’t a super big deal for indoor usage. Many monitors in this class only have 250-350 nits, so I’m more than happy to have 400 at this price tag. The aluminum stand is also a nice touch, making the MA270U feel a decent bit premium. Lastly, there’s Display Pilot 2. This companion app allows you to control the brightness and volume of the display from within macOS. This is a rare feature on non-Apple displays, and normally you have to regularly fidget with physical buttons on the display. You won’t have to do that on the MA270U, and I’m happy to say that. You also don’t need to use the companion app necessarily, keyboard controls also work for brightness and volume control. Spec rundown 27-inch 4K panel (3840×2160) with up to 400 nits of brightness, 60Hz 95% DCI-P3 and 99% sRGB color gamut VESA DisplayHDR 400 support Dual 3W treVolo speakers Nano Matte Panel TUV certification Adjustable stand with 115mm of height adjust, 15 degrees of tilt/swivel, and 90 degrees of pivot Wrap up Overall, the MA270U a great balance of everything important to me: decent brightness, USB-C connectivity, and a decent price point. At $459, it’s hard to go wrong with this display. There’s also a 32-inch variant available for $599. If you’re a fellow Mac mini user searching for a nice external display to pair with it, I’d highly recommend this monitor. The aforementioned companion app also has a feature to match its color profile with Apple’s, allowing for a close-to-stock appearance.
