Image: Apple/Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac Apple on Monday seeded to developers the release candidates for iOS 18.6, macOS Sequoia 15.6, iPadOS 18.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6 and visionOS 2.6. This is usually the final step before new versions launch. The general public should get access to these RCs soon. iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6 beta testing almost over Release candidates are the last step in beta testing, giving third-party software developers and other beta testers one more opportunity to look over the final versions of operating systems before they’re introduced to average users. Another way of looking at these is that they are fourth round of betas. And just because Apple is already looking ahead to the OS versions it’ll release this fall, that doesn’t mean it’s given up on the current ones. So while Apple used WWDC25 to give the world its first look at iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, work continues on the versions that initially launched in September 2024. That means the company’s developers are coding two versions of them at the same time. Hence the periodic rounds of betas for iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6, along with betas of iPadOS 18.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6 and visionOS 2.6.  That process started on June 16, but Monday’s release candidates mean it’s almost over. The non-beta versions are almost certainly coming a week from Monday, on July 28. These patches focus on bug fixes, not new additions. While Apple keeps working on these soon-to-be obsolete versions, this late in the cycle, the company saves important new features for the next major upgrades coming in autumn. Just for devs Currently, this most recent round of updates for the current software for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are available only for those in Apple’s developer program. Public versions of the RCs should be out soon, though. Alternatively, the third betas of iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, etc., are also available for developers to test.",
