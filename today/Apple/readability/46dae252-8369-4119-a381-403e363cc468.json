Apple News+ offers subscribers in the United States and Canada a selection of puzzles that update daily. In the first developer beta of iOS 18.2, the collection has grown with another challenge. The new inclusion is sudoku, a regular numbers-based logic puzzle that quickly became a staple alongside crosswords in newspapers around the world. The discovery was first made by Chris Carley, spotted by 9to5Mac Just like the paper version, Sudoku requires players to include every digit from 1 to 9 to appear in each horizontal and vertical line of the nine-by-nine grid. Each three-by-three box in the grid also must include the digits 1 through 9 as well, which forces players to deduce which number should go into which empty space while also following the rules. The version included in the News app provides puzzles in three difficulty levels and also keeps track of how often you manage to solve them. Sudoku appears alongside the Quartiles, Crossword, and Crossword mini puzzles, found by opening the News app, then selecting Following, then Puzzles. Aside from being only for U.S. and Canada-based Apple News+ subscribers, Sudoku will only be viewable on devices running iOS 18.2. For the moment, that means the iPhone 15 Pro and all iPhone 16 models, until Apple offers a beta available across all compatible devices in the future.",
