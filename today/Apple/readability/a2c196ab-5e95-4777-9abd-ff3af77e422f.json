  "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook is being pressed for information on his collaboration with the Trump administration surrounding tariffs. In a letter sent today, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Cook’s work with Trump “creates the appearance of impropriety.” This comes after Warren and other senators questioned $1 million donations made by Cook and others to Trump’s inauguration fund in January. “The circumstances surrounding Apple’s exemptions raise fresh concerns about influence-peddling by huge well-connected corporations, and their ability to gain special favors from President Trump,” Warren wrote. As we’ve covered extensively, Trump announced massive tariffs on China and the rest of the world, impacting almost every facet of Apple’s supply chain. Trump then enacted a 90-day pause on tariffs for most countries, while simultaneously increasing the tariff on imports from China. Apple raced to fly planes full of iPhones into the United States before those tariffs were enacted. Trump then announced wide-ranging exemptions covering smartphones, laptops, and other product categories. A report from The Washington Post last week offered a glimpse at Cook’s communication with the Trump administration in seeking these tariff exemptions for Apple. Cook is said to have spoken with multiple senior members of the Trump administration “about the potential impact of the tariffs on iPhone prices.” In the letter sent to Cook this week, spotted by Bloomberg, Warren wants details on these talks between Cook and the Trump administration: At best, your work to eliminate the tariffs on Apple products, and President Trump’s subsequent decision to exempt certain Apple products, creates the appearance of impropriety. However, recent reporting also raises serious questions about the extent to which it is possible for massive corporate special interests to use their money and influence to secure tariff exemptions that are unavailable to Main Street small businesses. Senator Warren specifically lays out four questions: What was the nature of your discussions with Trump Administration officials with regard to proposed tariffs? Please provide information on any meetings or conversations (including via telephone or email) that you or anyone acting as an agent of you or Apple had with Trump Administration officials about tariffs prior to the April 12 announcement. When did Apple find out about the tariff exemptions announced by President Trump on April 12? What is the value of the additional profits that Apple will obtain as a result of President Trump’s tariff exemption? Please explain your process for determining this estimate. The Trump administration is expected to announce a broader plan for tariffs on products like smartphones and laptops within the next month or two.
