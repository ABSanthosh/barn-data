This base model comes with a tilt-adjustable stand and standard (instead of nano-texture) glass. But there are also savings to be had on many other configurations of the Apple Studio Display. For instance, you get the same 19% off for buying the version with a VESA mount adapter. If you go for the tilt and height adjustable stand, you can have the Apple Studio Display for $300 off at $1,699.99.",
