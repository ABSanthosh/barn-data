  "text": "While there are plenty of paid options to get a business plan, from business plan software, to books, to working with a consultant, or even outsourcing the entire thing, another option is available for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, and it uses the magic of Apple Intelligence features and ChatGPT to instantly create a business plan for literally any business, industry, or location. Whether you need a business plan to start a business, help flesh out ideas for a new or existing business, are trying to get a small business loan and need a business plan for the bank or lender, or even as an academic exercise or class, you’ll get a great business plan in literally seconds, generated from the brilliance of artificial intelligence and large language models. How to Create a Business Plan on Mac, iPhone, or iPad, Instantly This is by far the fastest way to create a business plan for any business at all, here’s all you need to do: Open the Notes app on Mac, iPhone, or iPad Create a new Note, then choose the Apple Intelligence button Select “Compose” from the list of options Type out something like “business plan for trendy coffee shop in Venice beach”, or your business and location of choice, then submit (or hit return) to instantly generate a business plan Your business plan will generate in a moment, filling out the new note with details When finished it will look something like this: The screenshots here are demonstrating this excellent feature in Notes app on Mac, but the process is the same on Notes app for iPhone and iPad too. Since the business plan is in the Notes app, you can refine it and customize the business plan to any specific needs, but the created business plan is immediately high quality and a perfect starting point to develop or refine further. Below is the full example business plan that Apple Intelligence generated instantly for me for this article, the business plan is for a “trendy coffee shop in Oakland”: Business Plan for Oakland Coffee Shop 1.

Give it a try yourself, start a business, become an entrepreneur, chase your dreams. Don’t let the idea of writing a business plan be an obstacle, because Apple Intelligence can now create one for you. If you don’t have Apple Intelligence, or a device that does not support Apple Intelligence, you can always use the ChatGPT app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac, or even the web, to get the same results. ChatGPT is the backend to many Apple Intelligence features, and is more than capable of creating business plans amongst many other things, making it an incredibly powerful tool for productivity and work. Have you ever used Apple Intelligence, AI, or ChatGPT for creating a business plan, or for similar purposes? How did it go, and what did you think of the experience? Share with us in the comments!",
