  "text": "Meta has been working on a lot of new features for Threads, its microblogging platform, and there’s another one coming soon. The company has now teased a long-awaited option that will let users schedule posts for a later time. As announced by the official Threads account on the social network, the feature for scheduling posts is now being tested with a small group of users. According to Meta, it will be available to all Threads users “soon,” although no date has been set. With this option, Threads users can create a post and then schedule it to be posted at a later time or date. Once available, the feature can be found by tapping the three-dot button in the post composer. Scheduled posts will appear in the draft folder along with a label to indicate the time the post was scheduled. Scheduled posts can be edited or deleted before they’re published. Meta seems to have been ramping up the development of new features for Threads recently, coincidentally when its competing platform Bluesky has been growing significantly. Earlier this month, the company started allowing users to follow accounts from other users, albeit with limitations. Threads also now lets users watch videos in landscape and choose a Custom Feed to view by default. The Threads app is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version of the Threads app installed in order to get access to the new features like the new option to schedule posts.
