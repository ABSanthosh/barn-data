Graphic: Twelve South/Cult of Mac I recently returned from the beach where I was reminded how much I love the ButterFly foldable wireless charger. It’s small, rugged enough to take everywhere, but is always ready to juice up your iPhone, Apple Watch or AirPods. Really, it’s simply the best. Even so, when it launched, the travel charger was a bit expensive. Happily, its developer, Twelve South, recently cut the price by 23%. This isn’t a short-term sale — the deal on the ButterFly charger is permanent.This post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. Twelve South ButterFly charger deal lowers the forever price No one wants to carry too much bulky gear on the road, but you must bring a charger for your iPhone, and probably a way to power up your Apple Watch and AirPods, also. Twelve South’s ButterFly travel adapter is about the size of an AirPods charging case but opens to reveal charging mats that let you wirelessly juice up an iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time. It’s a brilliant design — simple but highly functional. The aluminum exterior is both rugged and matches the look of Apple devices. And the ButterFly even does double duty as an iPhone stand. Plus, it comes with the necessary wall charger and international power adapters. I tested and reviewed this travel adapter, too. And now it goes with me on every trip. While on holiday a few weeks ago, I set it up on the nightstand in the beach house, then put my iPhone 16 on it every night, along with my Apple Watch. During the day, I powered up my AirPods 4. It’s the best travel charger I’ve ever tried, but it used to be kind of pricey: $129.95. On June 1, Twelve South knocked the price down to $99.99. That’s a permanent 23% reduction. Buy it from: Amazon Unique design Butterfly 2-in-1 foldable wireless travel charger 5.0 The ButterFly 2 in 1 charging station is the size of an AirPods Pro case, but unfold it to charge your iPhone and Apple Watch or AirPods. Crafted with an anodized aluminum shell and vegan leather, the ButterFly charger matches the color and curvature of your MacBook.The charger doubles as a hands-free display stand for your iPhone, and the magnetic Watch charger can be tilted vertically for Nightstand Mode.The accessory comes with a USB-C cable, USB-C power adapter, four international plug adapters and a travel bag. Pros:Brilliant design is both portable and elegantCharges iPhone, Apple watch and AirPods If that’s still too rich for you, Twelve South offers a version in a plastic casing, the ButterFly SE. It’s not as rugged as the aluminum one, but comes in a range of colors. And it costs $69.99, or 30% less than the regular version. Buy it from: Amazon",
