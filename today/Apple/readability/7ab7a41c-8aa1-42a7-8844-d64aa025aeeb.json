  "description": "Macworld Apple’s iOS 26 plans, in brief The new iOS update is called iOS 26, not iOS 19 Redesign features translucent Liquid Glass effect Phone to get Call Screening, Hold Assist, and Live Translations Apple revealed its plans for its next iOS update at the WWDC keynote on June 9, 2025. iOS 26, coming to iPhones later this year, will bring a brand new look and lots of new features that will simplify and enhance the way we use existing apps. In this article we cover everything you need to know about iOS 26, including when iOS 26 will launch, which iPhones it will be compatible with, and all the new features and apps that are coming with the iPhone update. We also have the latest information about the iOS beta, for those who are keen to get iOS 26 on their iPhones now. It’s iOS 26, not iOS 19 The upcoming iOS is known as iOS 26, rather than iOS 19. In 2025 Apple is breaking with tradition and switching to a simpler naming convention that relates to the year, rather than a sequential number: it is 26 because iOS 26 will not launch until late 2025, and will be the operating system until late in 2026. Apple is using 26 for all of the operating system updates across the board, including the next iPadOS update, macOS Tahoe, the new watchOS and more, all of which were announced at WWDC.  iOS 26 Release date: When is the new iOS coming out? Date TBC: 15 September, 2025 predicted iOS 26 isn’t out yet, at least not for the general public. It will likely be available to install on compatible iPhones in September. This will likely happen shortly after the September event and the launch of the iPhone 17 and new Apple Watches.  iOS 26 Beta release date: Where is the public beta? Latest Developer Beta: Version 4 (second build), July 24, 2025 Latest Public Beta: July 24, 2025 You don’t have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple runs a developer beta and a public beta for those who want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer. The first version of the iOS developer beta was released following the WWDC keynote, so developers could immediately begin testing it with their products. This beta is not stable and there were reports of issues from those who installed it straight away. Apple updated the first developer beta a few days after the launch. As of July 24, the developer beta is in version 4. Apple released the first Public Beta on July 24. It corresponds with the the second release of Developer Beta 4 (build 23A5297m). Between WWDC and the official release in the fall, Apple will release a string of beta releases, typically eight or so in total. We have a separate article that details how to join Apple’s beta software program so you can test the new software as soon as the beta arrives. Anyone using the beta is encouraged to file bug reports using the included Apple’s Feedback Assistant app so that the company can address them. If you want to learn more about the beta read: What’s in the latest iOS beta and how to get it. And make sure you read why we advise against installing the iOS beta. iOS 26 supported devices: Which iPhones get iOS 26 iOS 26 is a free software update for iPhone 11 and later The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max will miss out on iOS 26 Apple Apple has confirmed the following iPhones will get iOS 26, we’ve included the year that phone launched. iPhone 16e (2025) iPhone 16/16 Plus/16 Pro/16 Pro Max (2024) iPhone 15/15 Plus/15 Pro/15 Pro Max (2023) iPhone 14/14 Plus/14 Pro/14 Pro Max (2022) iPhone SE (3rd gen) (2022) iPhone 13/13 mini/13 Pro/13 Pro Max (2021) iPhone 12/12 mini/12 Pro/12 Pro Max (2020) iPhone SE (2nd gen) (2020) iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max (2019) When Apple updates the operating system for its devices it often means that certain models are not compatible with the update. The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, which were supported by iOS 18 and launched in 2018, will miss out on iOS 26.  This doesn’t mean that those 2018 iPhones are unsupported by Apple. Apple will continue to issue security-related software updates to iOS 18 for a few more years. Read about how long iPhones are supported to find out which iPhones are no longer supported with security updates.  Nor does this mean that all the supported iPhones get all the new features. As was the case in 2024, only certain iPhones can support Apple Intelligence powered features. That’s the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and the whole of the  iPhone 16 range. This means that if your phone isn’t one of those mentioned you miss out on features such as the Visual Intelligence and Genmoji updates, as well as the Phone app ability to manage your unwanted calls.  Find out how the new iOS compares with the current version in our comparison of iOS 26 vs iOS 18: What’s different, what’s new, and should you update? iOS 26 design: Liquid Glass and other design changes Apple During the WWDC keynote Apple previewed the new iPhone features coming later in 2025. The biggest change is a visual one: a bold new redesign called Liquid Glass. What is Liquid Glass? The new design features a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass, which creates a translucent effect that mimics the qualities of glass. The new Liquid Glass theme represents the biggest change to iOS since iOS 7 was introduced in 2013. Back then Apple dropped the skeuomorphic design in favor of flat symbolic icons. This time everything is more curved, less flat, with translucent elements reflecting or refracting the content in the background, and resizing to fit around what is onscreen. The Liquid Glass elements will also change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and it will be possible to see blurred and refracted elements of the background through the top layer. Apple says that it will feel more like interacting with the physical world, with elements dynamically reacting to your touch. The company also says the changes “blur the lines between hardware and software”. This new Liquid Glass design extends to all of Apple’s products and to all of Apple’s apps. You’ll see the effect on the Dock, widgets and icons. Panes, windows, buttons and menus will be presented as translucent layers with specular highlights. Apple says that it will also make design changes that will simplify app interfaces to make the controls more visible. Initial feedback to the new Liquid Glass design was negative with some beta testers complaining that content wasn’t visible due to the overlaying of menus over background images, later versions of the beta have dialled this back to make the menus more visible. Interface changes  Apple Apple is adapting the interface to focus more on what is on the screen rather than cover things with tools and menu bars. Menus will shrink as you scroll to reveal the content below. Apple is also removing some of the clutter from menus to simplify things and emphasise the more frequently used options. For example, rather than occupying a rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen, groups of controls will appear on floating elements that pop out additional controls, change as you move between views, and are tucked away when you scroll. These changes to the menus are designed to make it easier to access the features you use most often, and discover others. Apple is trying to make iOS and its apps more intuitive.  A good example of how these design changes will be applied is the Lock Screen, which will be more adaptive. The image you choose as your wallpaper will be scaled to fit the height and width of the Lock Screen and positioned to fill the available space around elements like the time. Additionally, the wallpaper image will slide up as notifications come in. We’ll discuss the changes coming to individual apps below, but essentially Apple is making it easier to find the tools you usually use, without the clutter of all the other features you don’t need. iOS 26 and Apple Intelligence Apple has been having trouble with some of it’s AI efforts, especially the Siri features that were touted at WWDC 2024. Apple had promised that iOS 18.4 would bring a major update to Siri, where it would be better at natural conversations with the user, using personal context, awareness of what is on screen, and the ability to perform in-app actions. Apple has since confirmed that these Siri-related features have been pushed back until 2026, which means they should come as an update to iOS 26, perhaps in March, but we could be waiting even longer. Apple still had a number of impressive Apple Intelligence powered features to show off at WWDC though. In fact, some of the new features coming to Spotlight on the Mac look like some of the features promised for Siri. Some of these new Apple Intelligence features will make a big impact in apps, especially the Phone app, which we will discuss below. Another beneficiary of Apple Intelligence is Visual Intelligence, which was introduced in iOS 18 and gains a very useful ability in iOS 26. Visual Intelligence in iOS 26 Visual Intelligence in iOS 26.IDG In iOS 18 you can use Visual Intelligence by holding up the iPhone to view something you are curious about, triggering Visual Intelligence (via the Camera Control button if you have one, or via the Control Centre if not) and viewing information about what you were pointing the camera at. It could identify a building, or offer to add the date from a poster to your calendar, for example. That’s all very well when you are out and about, but what about when you are just browsing the web and want to know where something someone is wearing is from or where a video is being filmed? In iOS 26 it will be possible take a screenshot and look up information about that image and products in it using Visual Intelligence. You can also ask ChatGPT for information about the screenshot.  Genmoji and Image Playground in iOS 26 Apple Also benefitting from Apple Intelligence is Genmoji, another feature that arrived with iOS 18. Genmoji lets you create custom emoji using AI. To create a Genmoji you type a description in the Describe an Emoji field and tap on Create New Emoji. You can use photos of people you know as a basis and refine the emoji until it represents what you are looking for. The emoji will then be available in your emoji keyboard to use. In iOS 26 the Genmoji interface is getting a redesign. Users will be able to mix two emoji together, or alter an existing emoji to create something new, or even combine an emoji and a Sticker (which can be created from a photo). Users will be able to further customise emoji inside Image Playground, changing expressions. Image Playground, which is Apple’s app for making AI-generated images, arrived in iOS 18 and is getting an update in iOS 26. In iOS 26 it will be possible to use ChatGTP styles and prompts, such as an oil painting as well as those provided by Apple to create images in Image Playground. iOS 26 new apps and updated apps  Phone: Call Screening and Hold Assist Translations Camera app overhaul With each iteration of iOS the set of apps Apple provides grows and evolves, and many of the changes coming to the apps on the iPhone are shared by those same apps on Apple’s other devices. iOS 26 is no different. This time some of the upcoming changes are going to be quite transformative to how you use the phone – and by which we mean the telephone aspect to the iPhone.   Phone app The phone app might not be the one we use the most, but as Apple says, it is fundamental to the iPhone. With iOS 26 the phone app is getting a big update that essentially turns it into a PA and a spam filtering tool.  Apple is tapping into Apple Intelligence to bring new Voice Mail summaries to surface the most important information, but even more exciting, it is aiming to eliminate unwanted calls with a new Call Screening option that can answer the call in the background, ask the caller to explain their reason for calling, and then provide a text summary of those details to you before you decide whether or not to take the call. Of course this may make it harder to ignore calls from people you ought to actually speak to, but it will be a good way to siphon off spam and hoax calls from unknown numbers. That’s not all. Another new feature is Hold Assist, which will automatically detect hold music and mute the call until it is connected to an agent. As a result you can get things done without having to keep your phone speaker playing irritating hold music until someone answers. When an agent becomes free they will be informed that you are there and your phone will ring alerting you to the connection and you can take the call. It’s going to be like having your own receptionist.  Another change in the Phone app should make it impossible to accidentally tap on contact in the Recents list and call them. Currently, if you tap on a name in your Recents list it will automatically call that person. A new setting will allow you to turn off “Tap Recents to Call”. @macworld.com iOS 26 makes the iPhone a better…phone? #wwdc #iphone #fyp ♬ original sound – Macworld – Macworld Live Translations Also coming to the Phone app, but also present as a features in Messages and FaceTime, is Live Translations, which will help you communicate with someone who speaks another language. With this feature you will be able to have a conversation with some who speaks a different language to you. If you are familiar with the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy this is almost at the level of having a Bable Fish. If you are speaking to some via the phone app the iPhone will translate what it being said, with a spoken voice translating what has been said into your language. The recipient will also hear translations in their own language. Apparently they don’t need to have an iPhone. The main restriction right now is that Live Translation for Phone is available only for one-on-one calls in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. As we said above, it’s not only the Phone app that will get the Live Translation features. FaceTime and Messages will as well. And Translation is also finding its way into the Music app. FaceTime  When speaking to someone via FaceTime you will see real-time captions in your own language. Live Captions aren’t entirely new to FaceTime, you can already turn on that functionality in Accessibility \u003e Live Captions – although this only works if your language is set to English U.S. As well as the new Live Translation feature, FaceTime also gets changes to the interface designed to surface the controls you need while keeping the caller visible. For example, controls float to the bottom right and recede when you don’t need them.  The FaceTime call list also gets a new look, with video messages autoplaying as you scroll.  Messages Apple If you are using Messages to communicate with someone who speaks a different language what you type is translated into their language and vice versa. As with the phone, Messages is getting a screening tool to combat spam. On-device spam detection will give you “total control over who appears in your conversation list,” according to Apple. It is already possible to filter out spam by using the Unknown Senders list in Messages, but in iOS 26 Messages will have a greater ability to screen for spam, and it will make sure you still receive verification codes and other critical or time sensitive messages. Also in Messages you will be able to add a background image to Group Chats and a new option to create a poll will be available. Messages will even suggest a poll if a situation calls for one. Anyone can add options to the poll, as well.  Those who have access to Apple Cash (still U.S. only) can also access this from group chats.  Apple Music In Apple Music you will be able to follow the lyrics alongside the translation into your own language. For some languages you will even see a pronunciation guide. Also coming to the Music app is a new auto-mix option that uses AI to fade between songs and match beats like a DJ would. There is also a new animated Apple Music artwork option for the Lock Screen.  Interface changes should also mean it is faster and easier to get to the music you are in to. For example, you can pin your favourite album or playlist to the top of your library.  Apple Camera \u0026 Photos In iOS 26, Apple is redesigned camera app, hiding most of the lesser used camera shooting modes and options to simplify the increasingly cramped layout and giving users quick access to settings. In the Photos app there will be the ability to add 3D effects to photos. Games Apple is finally tidying up the gaming experience on the iPhone with a brand new Games app. With half a billion people playing games on iPad, according to Apple, it’s about time.  Apple says it is creating a new destination to help its gamers get more out of their games. The Games app will offer various tabs to make finding the games you are playing or have played easier. The Home tab reveals what’s most relevant to you. The Library tab shows all the games you have ever downloaded.  There is also a Play Together tab where you can see what your friends are playing, play games with them, compare scores, and invite them to play games. You can also challenge them to beat your highest score in single player games. Turning single player games into fun competitions with friends, with scores in real time. This will be Apple’s second attempt to get users to connect socially: remember iTunes Ping? (Apple would probably rather you forgot). Apple Another change coming to gaming on iPhone (and iPad) is a new consistency to hoe touch controls are applied in games. Developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have always had to design their own touch controls, and this can be inconsistent. In iOS 26, Apple will provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads. Apple Wallet Like Apple Cash many of the new Apple Wallet features are U.S. only, such as the ability to add Drivers Licenses to Apple Wallet.  Apple says there will be more ways to pay with Apple Pay in iOS 26, for example you can redeem points or choose to pay in instalments. That feature is currently available in nine states. From the fall Apple says it will be possible to add a U.S. passport, but only for use for flights inside the U.S.  There will be a new API for developers to take advantage of, enabling them to provide customers with more information within the Wallet app, such as details of the services included with the fare and upgrade options that can be accessed from within the Wallet app. You can also track Apple Pay orders, with Apple Intelligence finding the order details and tracking information and keeping them together for you.  Passwords \u0026 Autofill The Passwords app, introduced in iOS 18, is also getting an update. You can check changes that you’ve made to accounts logged in the Passwords app, view previous passwords that were used for these accounts and see when they were altered. In addition, iOS 26, Apple is introducing improvements that will make using passkeys easier. Passkeys is an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with the iOS 26 update, it will be possible for iPhone and iPad apps to enable users to create a passkey with just a tap. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials will be synchronized between your Apple devices via iCloud. It will also be possible to pre-fill personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Even better, iOS 26 will be able to autofill verification codes from Gmail and WhatsApp. Verification code autofill may also work in Google Chrome, currently verification codes only work with Apple’s Safari browser. Apple Maps  Apple The Maps app also gets an update, using Apple Intelligence to understand your regular commutes and learn your favourites. With this information it will be able to warn you if you should take a different route due to traffic.  Another change to Maps is that if you want it to it can log (with encryption) Visited Places, which will make it easier to find and recall places you have been to in the past. It’s easy to delete this history too.  Reminders In iOS 26, Reminders will suggest things such as tasks and grocery items, plus follow-ups based on your emails or other text on your iPhone, Mac, and more. Notes Notes will gain Markdown. Weather Satellite-based weather. Clock You will finally be able to set a snooze duration of between one and 15 minutes, rather than being stuck with set eight minute snoozes! You will also gain the ability to set alarms from inside other apps. For example, you could set an alarm from within a recipe app without you needing to open the Clock. AirPods related features: Pause Media When Falling Asleep Existing AirPods should get some new features due to the iOS 26 update. These include a new feature that will enable AirPods to pause when they sense the wearer has fallen asleep. Code in the iOS 26 beta indicates that this feature is tied to iOS 26, rather than the AirPods line specifically – it may even work on Apple’s Beats headphones. In addition it will be possible to easily switch between different audio input devices – so you could switch from AirPods as dedicated microphones to another device, for example. Other new features in iOS 26 There are lots of other changes coming to iOS itself, many of which will improve the overall experience. Running tasks in the background iOS 26 will have a new API for running tasks in the background. So you won’t have to keep an app open when they’re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task. Adaptive Power Mode This feature aims to extend battery life by adjusting performance based on usage patterns. Where Low Power Mode throttles your iPhone’s performance and kills certain background activities to save energy, Adaptive Power Mode makes smaller adjustments to your iPhone’s performance based on how you use it. As a result the impact should be subtler, and potentially something users could keep on at all times. Battery Intelligence: AI-powered battery management iOS 26 will introduce a feature dubbed Battery Intelligence. This presents the estimated charging duration to reach 80% (then 100%) when connected to a charger – so you know how long you will need to change your iPhone before you can leave the house. A new adaptive low power mode has been spotted in the iOS 26 developer beta. This doesn’t replace the regular low power mode (that’s still around) but instead uses machine learning to make adjustments that could help eke out a little more juice from your battery. In addition, the Lock Screen will now display estimated charging times to hit 80 percent and 100 percent battery power. RCS Universal Profile 3.0 and other Android ‘friendly’ features Support for RCS Universal Profile 3.0 may come in an update to iOS 26. RCS 3.0 will encrypt iPhone-to-Android messages, and offer other features to make communicating between iPhones and Android phones more seamless. Currently, Android users can edit a message within 15 minutes of it being sent – this works in iOS 18.5 and the iOS 26 developer beta but the iPhone displays the edited message as a new one with an asterisk rather than replacing the message with the edited message. iPhone users are able to edit messages sent to other iPhones, but they are not yet able to edit RCS messages sent to an Android phone. RCS 3.0 should also make this available to iPhone users. There also be simplified eSIM transfer from Android.",

You can also ask ChatGPT for information about the screenshot.  Genmoji and Image Playground in iOS 26 Apple Also benefitting from Apple Intelligence is Genmoji, another feature that arrived with iOS 18. Genmoji lets you create custom emoji using AI. To create a Genmoji you type a description in the Describe an Emoji field and tap on Create New Emoji. You can use photos of people you know as a basis and refine the emoji until it represents what you are looking for. The emoji will then be available in your emoji keyboard to use. In iOS 26 the Genmoji interface is getting a redesign. Users will be able to mix two emoji together, or alter an existing emoji to create something new, or even combine an emoji and a Sticker (which can be created from a photo). Users will be able to further customise emoji inside Image Playground, changing expressions. Image Playground, which is Apple’s app for making AI-generated images, arrived in iOS 18 and is getting an update in iOS 26. In iOS 26 it will be possible to use ChatGTP styles and prompts, such as an oil painting as well as those provided by Apple to create images in Image Playground. iOS 26 new apps and updated apps  Phone: Call Screening and Hold Assist Translations Camera app overhaul With each iteration of iOS the set of apps Apple provides grows and evolves, and many of the changes coming to the apps on the iPhone are shared by those same apps on Apple’s other devices. iOS 26 is no different. This time some of the upcoming changes are going to be quite transformative to how you use the phone – and by which we mean the telephone aspect to the iPhone.   Phone app The phone app might not be the one we use the most, but as Apple says, it is fundamental to the iPhone. With iOS 26 the phone app is getting a big update that essentially turns it into a PA and a spam filtering tool.  Apple is tapping into Apple Intelligence to bring new Voice Mail summaries to surface the most important information, but even more exciting, it is aiming to eliminate unwanted calls with a new Call Screening option that can answer the call in the background, ask the caller to explain their reason for calling, and then provide a text summary of those details to you before you decide whether or not to take the call. Of course this may make it harder to ignore calls from people you ought to actually speak to, but it will be a good way to siphon off spam and hoax calls from unknown numbers. That’s not all. Another new feature is Hold Assist, which will automatically detect hold music and mute the call until it is connected to an agent. As a result you can get things done without having to keep your phone speaker playing irritating hold music until someone answers. When an agent becomes free they will be informed that you are there and your phone will ring alerting you to the connection and you can take the call. It’s going to be like having your own receptionist.  Another change in the Phone app should make it impossible to accidentally tap on contact in the Recents list and call them. Currently, if you tap on a name in your Recents list it will automatically call that person. A new setting will allow you to turn off “Tap Recents to Call”. Live Translations Also coming to the Phone app, but also present as a features in Messages and FaceTime, is Live Translations, which will help you communicate with someone who speaks another language. With this feature you will be able to have a conversation with some who speaks a different language to you. If you are familiar with the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy this is almost at the level of having a Bable Fish. If you are speaking to some via the phone app the iPhone will translate what it being said, with a spoken voice translating what has been said into your language. The recipient will also hear translations in their own language. Apparently they don’t need to have an iPhone. The main restriction right now is that Live Translation for Phone is available only for one-on-one calls in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. As we said above, it’s not only the Phone app that will get the Live Translation features. FaceTime and Messages will as well. And Translation is also finding its way into the Music app. FaceTime  When speaking to someone via FaceTime you will see real-time captions in your own language. Live Captions aren’t entirely new to FaceTime, you can already turn on that functionality in Accessibility \u003e Live Captions – although this only works if your language is set to English U.S. As well as the new Live Translation feature, FaceTime also gets changes to the interface designed to surface the controls you need while keeping the caller visible. For example, controls float to the bottom right and recede when you don’t need them.  The FaceTime call list also gets a new look, with video messages autoplaying as you scroll.  Messages Apple If you are using Messages to communicate with someone who speaks a different language what you type is translated into their language and vice versa. As with the phone, Messages is getting a screening tool to combat spam. On-device spam detection will give you “total control over who appears in your conversation list,” according to Apple. It is already possible to filter out spam by using the Unknown Senders list in Messages, but in iOS 26 Messages will have a greater ability to screen for spam, and it will make sure you still receive verification codes and other critical or time sensitive messages. Also in Messages you will be able to add a background image to Group Chats and a new option to create a poll will be available. Messages will even suggest a poll if a situation calls for one. Anyone can add options to the poll, as well.  Those who have access to Apple Cash (still U.S. only) can also access this from group chats.  Apple Music In Apple Music you will be able to follow the lyrics alongside the translation into your own language. For some languages you will even see a pronunciation guide. Also coming to the Music app is a new auto-mix option that uses AI to fade between songs and match beats like a DJ would. There is also a new animated Apple Music artwork option for the Lock Screen.  Interface changes should also mean it is faster and easier to get to the music you are in to. For example, you can pin your favourite album or playlist to the top of your library.  Apple Camera \u0026 Photos In iOS 26, Apple is redesigned camera app, hiding most of the lesser used camera shooting modes and options to simplify the increasingly cramped layout and giving users quick access to settings. In the Photos app there will be the ability to add 3D effects to photos. Games Apple is finally tidying up the gaming experience on the iPhone with a brand new Games app. With half a billion people playing games on iPad, according to Apple, it’s about time.  Apple says it is creating a new destination to help its gamers get more out of their games. The Games app will offer various tabs to make finding the games you are playing or have played easier. The Home tab reveals what’s most relevant to you. The Library tab shows all the games you have ever downloaded.  There is also a Play Together tab where you can see what your friends are playing, play games with them, compare scores, and invite them to play games. You can also challenge them to beat your highest score in single player games. Turning single player games into fun competitions with friends, with scores in real time. This will be Apple’s second attempt to get users to connect socially: remember iTunes Ping? (Apple would probably rather you forgot). Apple Another change coming to gaming on iPhone (and iPad) is a new consistency to hoe touch controls are applied in games. Developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have always had to design their own touch controls, and this can be inconsistent. In iOS 26, Apple will provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads. Apple Wallet Like Apple Cash many of the new Apple Wallet features are U.S. only, such as the ability to add Drivers Licenses to Apple Wallet.  Apple says there will be more ways to pay with Apple Pay in iOS 26, for example you can redeem points or choose to pay in instalments. That feature is currently available in nine states. From the fall Apple says it will be possible to add a U.S. passport, but only for use for flights inside the U.S.  There will be a new API for developers to take advantage of, enabling them to provide customers with more information within the Wallet app, such as details of the services included with the fare and upgrade options that can be accessed from within the Wallet app. You can also track Apple Pay orders, with Apple Intelligence finding the order details and tracking information and keeping them together for you.  Passwords \u0026 Autofill The Passwords app, introduced in iOS 18, is also getting an update. You can check changes that you’ve made to accounts logged in the Passwords app, view previous passwords that were used for these accounts and see when they were altered. In addition, iOS 26, Apple is introducing improvements that will make using passkeys easier. Passkeys is an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with the iOS 26 update, it will be possible for iPhone and iPad apps to enable users to create a passkey with just a tap. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials will be synchronized between your Apple devices via iCloud. It will also be possible to pre-fill personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Even better, iOS 26 will be able to autofill verification codes from Gmail and WhatsApp. Verification code autofill may also work in Google Chrome, currently verification codes only work with Apple’s Safari browser. Apple Maps  Apple The Maps app also gets an update, using Apple Intelligence to understand your regular commutes and learn your favourites. With this information it will be able to warn you if you should take a different route due to traffic.  Another change to Maps is that if you want it to it can log (with encryption) Visited Places, which will make it easier to find and recall places you have been to in the past. It’s easy to delete this history too.  Reminders In iOS 26, Reminders will suggest things such as tasks and grocery items, plus follow-ups based on your emails or other text on your iPhone, Mac, and more. Notes Notes will gain Markdown. Weather Satellite-based weather. Clock You will finally be able to set a snooze duration of between one and 15 minutes, rather than being stuck with set eight minute snoozes! You will also gain the ability to set alarms from inside other apps. For example, you could set an alarm from within a recipe app without you needing to open the Clock. Existing AirPods should get some new features due to the iOS 26 update. These include a new feature that will enable AirPods to pause when they sense the wearer has fallen asleep. Code in the iOS 26 beta indicates that this feature is tied to iOS 26, rather than the AirPods line specifically – it may even work on Apple’s Beats headphones. In addition it will be possible to easily switch between different audio input devices – so you could switch from AirPods as dedicated microphones to another device, for example. Other new features in iOS 26 There are lots of other changes coming to iOS itself, many of which will improve the overall experience. Running tasks in the background iOS 26 will have a new API for running tasks in the background. So you won’t have to keep an app open when they’re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task. Adaptive Power Mode This feature aims to extend battery life by adjusting performance based on usage patterns. Where Low Power Mode throttles your iPhone’s performance and kills certain background activities to save energy, Adaptive Power Mode makes smaller adjustments to your iPhone’s performance based on how you use it. As a result the impact should be subtler, and potentially something users could keep on at all times. Battery Intelligence: AI-powered battery management iOS 26 will introduce a feature dubbed Battery Intelligence. This presents the estimated charging duration to reach 80% (then 100%) when connected to a charger – so you know how long you will need to change your iPhone before you can leave the house. A new adaptive low power mode has been spotted in the iOS 26 developer beta. This doesn’t replace the regular low power mode (that’s still around) but instead uses machine learning to make adjustments that could help eke out a little more juice from your battery. In addition, the Lock Screen will now display estimated charging times to hit 80 percent and 100 percent battery power. RCS Universal Profile 3.0 and other Android ‘friendly’ features Support for RCS Universal Profile 3.0 may come in an update to iOS 26. RCS 3.0 will encrypt iPhone-to-Android messages, and offer other features to make communicating between iPhones and Android phones more seamless. Currently, Android users can edit a message within 15 minutes of it being sent – this works in iOS 18.5 and the iOS 26 developer beta but the iPhone displays the edited message as a new one with an asterisk rather than replacing the message with the edited message. iPhone users are able to edit messages sent to other iPhones, but they are not yet able to edit RCS messages sent to an Android phone. RCS 3.0 should also make this available to iPhone users. There also be simplified eSIM transfer from Android.",

The biggest change is a visual one: a bold new redesign called Liquid Glass. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-liquid-glass\"\u003eWhat is Liquid Glass?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new design features a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass, which creates a translucent effect that mimics the qualities of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new Liquid Glass theme represents the biggest change to iOS since iOS 7 was introduced in 2013. Back then Apple dropped the skeuomorphic design in favor of flat symbolic icons. This time everything is more curved, less flat, with translucent elements reflecting or refracting the content in the background, and resizing to fit around what is onscreen. The Liquid Glass elements will also change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and it will be possible to see blurred and refracted elements of the background through the top layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple says that it will feel more like interacting with the physical world, with elements dynamically reacting to your touch. The company also says the changes “blur the lines between hardware and software”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis new Liquid Glass design extends to all of Apple’s products and to all of Apple’s apps. You’ll see the effect on the Dock, widgets and icons. Panes, windows, buttons and menus will be presented as translucent layers with specular highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple says that it will also make design changes that will simplify app interfaces to make the controls more visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInitial feedback to the new Liquid Glass design was negative with some beta testers complaining that content wasn’t visible due to the overlaying of menus over background images, later versions of the beta have dialled this back to make the menus more visible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"interface-changes\"\u003eInterface changes \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;imageId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;6882da576009e\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-class--hide=\"state.isContentHidden\" data-wp-class--show=\"state.isContentVisible\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 26 wallpapers\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=300%2C168\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=768%2C432\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=1200%2C675\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=1536%2C864\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=1240%2C697\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ios26-wallpaper.jpg?resize=150%2C84\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eApple\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple is adapting the interface to focus more on what is on the screen rather than cover things with tools and menu bars. Menus will shrink as you scroll to reveal the content below. Apple is also removing some of the clutter from menus to simplify things and emphasise the more frequently used options. For example, rather than occupying a rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen, groups of controls will appear on floating elements that pop out additional controls, change as you move between views, and are tucked away when you scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese changes to the menus are designed to make it easier to access the features you use most often, and discover others. Apple is trying to make iOS and its apps more intuitive. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA good example of how these design changes will be applied is the Lock Screen, which will be more adaptive. The image you choose as your wallpaper will be scaled to fit the height and width of the Lock Screen and positioned to fill the available space around elements like the time. Additionally, the wallpaper image will slide up as notifications come in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ll discuss the changes coming to individual apps below, but essentially Apple is making it easier to find the tools you usually use, without the clutter of all the other features you don’t need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ios-26-and-apple-intelligence\"\u003eiOS 26 and Apple Intelligence\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple has been having trouble with some of it’s AI efforts, especially the Siri features that were touted at WWDC 2024. Apple had promised that iOS 18.4 would bring a major update to Siri, where it would be better at natural conversations with the user, using personal context, awareness of what is on screen, and the ability to perform in-app actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple has since confirmed that these \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631137/apple-is-delaying-the-only-apple-intelligence-feature-everyone-wanted.html\"\u003eSiri-related features have been pushed back\u003c/a\u003e until 2026, which means they should come as an update to iOS 26, perhaps in March, but we could be waiting even longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple still had a number of impressive Apple Intelligence powered features to show off at WWDC though. In fact, some of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2809682/macos-26-tahoe-5-features-coming-this-fall-that-power-users-will-love.html\"\u003enew features coming to Spotlight on the Mac\u003c/a\u003e look like some of the features promised for Siri.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these new Apple Intelligence features will make a big impact in apps, especially the Phone app, which we will discuss below.

Of course this may make it harder to ignore calls from people you ought to actually speak to, but it will be a good way to siphon off spam and hoax calls from unknown numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not all. Another new feature is \u003cstrong\u003eHold Assist\u003c/strong\u003e, which will automatically detect hold music and mute the call until it is connected to an agent. As a result you can get things done without having to keep  your phone speaker playing irritating hold music until someone answers.
