  "text": "It’s been two weeks since the iPhone 16e arrived in stores and in the hands of early adopters. Unfortunately, some of them have been experiencing issues with Bluetooth audio, especially when using wireless headphones. At least based on multiple reports from iPhone 16e owners. iPhone 16e users complain about Bluetooth audio issues As noted by MacRumors, multiple reports shared on the Apple Support Community, Reddit, and X suggest that there’s a widespread issue affecting Bluetooth audio on the iPhone 16e. More specifically, users mention that the audio being played back via Bluetooth cuts out periodically. According to these users, the problem doesn’t seem to affect other iPhone models connected to the same headphone or Bluetooth speaker. “I just upgraded to the 16e from the 13 mini and any Bluetooth device keeps hitching. The sound pauses for a second then picks back up,” a user said on the web. “I bought a 16e two days ago and was having I guess stuttering issues on Bluetooth? It’s brief, with music stoping and starting up again very quickly,” another user wrote. One of the affected users returned their iPhone to Apple, and it was replaced without question – but according to the person, the replacement unit has the same problem. Apple is yet to acknowledge the issue and whether it’s working on a fix. In addition to the A18 chip and 48-megapixel camera, the iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, and a USB-C port. The new iPhone also features Apple’s first custom 5G modem for better energy efficiency. iPhone 16e starts at $599 for the 128GB version. Alternatively, you can buy other iPhone models at a discount.
