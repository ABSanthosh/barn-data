  "description": "Macworld We love the Apple Watch Ultra 2, so we were rather happy to see it on sale for $739 at Amazon. That’s a $60 discount for one of the best-featured smartwatches around. At $739, this isn’t the best price we’ve seen for the Ultra 2, but then again, it’s only $20 away. Unless you want to wait a few months to get it at its all-time low of $719, now’s a good time to add it to your cart. In our review of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, we gave it a four-star rating, appreciating the bright screen and the slick operating system, as well as how great it is for tracking sports and random workouts. “Ultimately, the Watch Ultra 2 is the best smartwatch Apple has made yet,” we wrote. The rugged build will survive any of your outdoorsy activities, even withstanding long swimming sessions and dives. The watch will keep track of your location, help you get to your destination, and tell you how your workout went, whether you’re at the gym, cycling, or hiking. It also comes with advanced sensors that can detect irregular heart rhythms, know when you take a fall, and more. Thankfully, the battery life on this model is vastly better than on the first model, which is obviously something you’ll need when you’re off the grid. So go ahead and order your very own Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $739 while you still can. Go on adventures with the Ultra 2Buy now at Amazon",
