  "text": "The Jackery Explorer 2000 provides an emergency power option that's extremely handy during a power cut. It's also portable enough for off-grid trips, if you can manage the weight. We live in an age where electronics, peripherals, and a connection to the internet are the lifeblood for work, careers, and day-to-day life. From computers to phones to routers and smart appliances, we as people are more connected than we ever have been before. While entire industries and academics can (and do) debate on the effect of being this plugged in, there is one universal truth that we all accept: We need reliable sources of electricity to stay plugged in and online. If that power source is portable, quiet, and effective without breaking the bank, then all the more reason to consider bringing one into your life. If you're like me and live in an area where stormy weather can turn on a dime several months out of the year, and losing power isn't a question of \"if\" but rather \"when\", you are a prime candidate for a portable power station. A power source to keep your life and connectivity online, outside of the versatility of power-on-the-go for camping, events, and worksites. In an industry with many name brands and options to choose from, consumers are spoiled for choice when it comes to reliability, options, and cost. Jackery stands out as a well-established name in the business of power stations and portable power, and it sent over the Jackery Explorer 2000. What is the Jackery Explorer 2000?The Jackery Explorer 2000 is a portable power station the size of an average Igloo cooler. One that Jackery touts as \"Small but Mighty\" and one of the lightest, smallest lithium-ion phosphate power stations on the market with multiple outlet options, quick charging, and portability. Jackery Explorer 2000 Specifications39.5 lbs. 13.2in height x 11.5in length x 10.4in width Capacity: 45.6Ah/44.8V DC (2042Wh) Output: 2200W Cycle Life: 4000 cycles to 70%+ capacity Ports: Car port, USB-C1 (100W) output, USB-C2 (100W) output, USB-A (18W) output, AC output x 3Jackery Explorer 2000 review: Inside the boxThe Jackery Explorer 2000 arrived at my apartment in a single large box that is incredibly well packed and padded for protection during shipping. Inside the box, the deliverables were straight to the point with just the Jackery Explorer 2000 and the AC charge cable. No extra accessories, just the unit and a way to hook it up to feed it power. Jackery Explorer 2000 review: Quality and FeaturesStraight out of the box, I could tell that the Jackery Explorer 2000 is not a cheaply made or junk product. Everything about it is excellent quality, and even though I would not be using the station on a busy worksite, the sturdiness and downright chunkiness of it is reassuring. It's great to take a camping trip with, or on-site for a home improvement project. In my testing, the Jackery Explorer 2000 weathered every environment like a champ. Speaking of its build, and in case you just glanced over the tech specs, I will remind you that the Jackery Explorer 2000 weighs in at just under 40 pounds. If you are someone who has difficulty lifting and walking with that much weight, moving the Jackery Explorer 2000 around could be an issue. The front of the Jackery Explorer 2000The Jackery Explorer 2000 does include a sturdy flip handle to make transport easier. Unlike the Explorer 5000 plus model, this power station does not include built-in wheels for transport. Aside from the charging cable, all the outlets are right on the front of the unit or ease of use. It also has a large and bright display, with text that is easy to read and understand when checking out the battery level and power output. A close-up of the Jackery Explorer 2000 display and connectionsThe Jackery Explorer 2000 also includes a powerful built-in light on the front panell that offers three settings: Standard, bright, and strobe (for emergency signaling). I love this feature made for campers or moments where all the power is out and you're navigating in the dark. At least until you can set up your appliances and additional lights. Jackery Explorer 2000 review: Charging OptionsThe versatility of the Jackery Explorer 2000 carries through to the charging options as well, with four options available: Wall Charging Emergency Super Charge: 1.7 hours Wall Charging: 2 hours Solar Charging (200Wx2): 7.5 hours Car Charging: 24 hoursIn my testing, I allowed the Jackery to run to nearly empty before testing the wall charging methods. The difference between the emergency super charging and the standard wall charging methods felt nominal. Both methods work well, but I was not blown away by one over the other. Jackery offers separate solar panels for $479 (or as part of a bundle with the Explorer) for outdoor charging. I did not have access to these panels for my review, but I have heard a handful of positive reviews for the Jackery solar panels. Specifically for handling large charge loads from large power tools and for keeping a charged Jackery Explorer 2000 topped off over the course of a workday. There is also a car charging option. While this wasn't tested, I verymuch appreciate that it is available for situations where there is no other option. Jackery Explorer 2000 review: UsageA common trend with power station manufacturers is the availability of brand-specific apps to control features and monitor levels. The Jackery app is basic and solid, allowing you to sync up the Jackery Explorer 2000 over your Wi-Fi network. In my environment, I wanted to test the versatility and ease of use of the Jackery Explorer 2000 in my apartment and work life in the event of completely losing power. To simulate this, I fully charged the Jackery Explorer 2000 with the wall charging option, and took a few days to run various appliances directly from the station. The side of the Jackery Explorer 2000I ran my refrigerator for over 10 hours on just the Jackery Explorer 2000 alone. Running such a large appliance did drain the station to near empty, but with the addition of solar panels this time could be extended. Jackery states that the Explorer 2000 will charge mobile devices like phones and notebooks dozens of times on a single charge. I ran my router, Mac Studio, and Xencelabs drawing tablet for seven hours with enough power remaining to charge my iPhone and iPad. While I doubt that I would be using my Mac Studio and tablet if I was in a blackout situation, it is nice to know that I could boot up and get online if I needed to. Being able to run vital medical equipment in a blackout would also bring peace of mind. If you're curious about the running times for various appliances in your life on the Jackery Explorer 2000, Jackery offers a simulator on their website that allows you to enter the total watts and view the expected run time on a full station charge. My testing was about in line with Jackery's calculator, give or take a bit. The Jackery Explorer 2000 runs very, very quiet. I only noticed the faint sound of the station while it was active and even then, only when I was in a quiet room with it. This is a great feature. Jackery Explorer 2000 review: Portable piece of mindNow it is time to address the elephant in the room: The retail price. The Jackery Explorer 2000 retails for $1,499 US for just the power station and nothing else. The addition of a single set of Jackery solar panels retails for $479.00 US and other accessories (like a Jackery carrying bag) must be purchased separately. At this price level, some accessories would be nice, if not necessarily the solar panel option. The Jackery Explorer 2000 is portable, but quite heavy. The Jackery Explorer 2000 is a worthwhile purchase for those who need it. It is the best portable power station I have used to date, and the versatility of the Jackery Explorer 2000 makes it a multitasker that can travel, work, and play. I already have the station set up in my home office as an uninterruptible power supply unit that I can put into use for power outages. I love the peace of mind of not losing hours of work when the power flickers. If you have the budget, I recommend opting for one of the bundle packages from Jackery that includes the solar panels as well, just for the added value. If I find myself using the Jackery outside of my apartment regularly, I will purchase the panels myself for trips and blackouts. If you're in need of a portable power station, the Jackery Explorer 2000 will serve you well. Jackery Explorer 2000 ProsExcellent storage capacity and power output Excellent array of outlets for a variety of appliances and tech Sturdy, high-quality build Quiet operation Highly portable if 40 lbs. isn't an issue Solid (optional) app integrationJackery Explorer 2000 ConsHigher cost for entry Solar panels are not includedRating: 4 out of 5Where to buy the Jackery Explorer 2000 The Jackery Explorer 2000 and all the Jackery accessories are available on Jackery.com",

If I find myself using the Jackery outside of my apartment regularly, I will purchase the panels myself for trips and blackouts.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re in need of a portable power station, the Jackery Explorer 2000 will serve you well.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"jackery-explorer-2000-pros\" id=\"jackery-explorer-2000-pros\"\u003eJackery Explorer 2000 Pros\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eExcellent storage capacity and power output\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExcellent array of outlets for a variety of appliances and tech\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSturdy, high-quality build\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eQuiet operation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHighly portable if 40 lbs. isn\u0026#39;t an issue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolid (optional) app integration\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"jackery-explorer-2000-cons\" id=\"jackery-explorer-2000-cons\"\u003eJackery Explorer 2000 Cons\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigher cost for entry\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSolar panels are not included\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"rating-4-out-of-5\" id=\"rating-4-out-of-5\"\u003eRating: 4 out of 5\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2 data-anchor=\"where-to-buy-the-jackery-explorer-2000-\" id=\"where-to-buy-the-jackery-explorer-2000-\"\u003eWhere to buy the Jackery Explorer 2000 \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Jackery Explorer 2000 and all the Jackery accessories are available on \u003ca href=\"https://jackery.sjv.io/c/81003/1610717/18694?subId1=rv-othr--\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jackery.com%2Fproducts%2Fjackery-explorer-2000-v2-portable-power-station\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJackery.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n          \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
