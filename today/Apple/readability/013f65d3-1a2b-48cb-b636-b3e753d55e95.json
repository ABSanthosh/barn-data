Rumors surrounding the alleged fourth season of Apple's hit sports comedy continue to emerge. Following claims that filming entered pre-production in January 2025, we now have even more details about the show's fourth season, from the same source. According to a social media post by Sigmund Judge, the fourth season of Ted Lasso will focus on the formation of AFC Richmond's women's team rather than the men's team featured in previous seasons. Judge also explains that filming for the fourth season will begin in May or June 2025 in London. The third season of the hit show ended back in 2022, but rumors of an upcoming fourth season give fans continued hope that it will soon return. Apple CEO Tim Cook was among the first to express interest in a fourth season of the show. In August 2024, a report suggested that Warner Bros. had picked options for actors playing key roles in Ted Lasso. The list included Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift, with Jason Sudeikis and Brendan Hunt expected to be reached out to at a later time. It's still unclear whether Jason Sudeikis' character will make a return, as the actor was reported to have been satisfied with the original ending of the show. He has expressed no interest in revisiting his role, however, cameos are always possible. A few months later, in October 2024, \"Season 4\" of Ted Lasso appeared in a production database maintained by the Film \u0026 Television Industry Alliance, further corroborating rumors of a fourth season. A women's team was hinted at at the end of the original 'Ted Lasso' runSpin offs have always been a possibility. One featuring the character Roy Kent was heavily rumored, and the idea of a women's team was teased in the final moments of the last episode of Ted Lasso, so it's an obvious direction. Actor and repeat \"accidental\" leaker of Ted Lasso news, Nick Mohammad, shared a short video in January 2025 that strongly suggested a new season would be filming soon. There are currently no details as to when this supposed fourth season will make its debut, though. Filming is expected to begin in May or June, so Ted Lasso may ultimately return sometime later in 2025 or 2026.",
