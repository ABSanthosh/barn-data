The Pixelmator team had this to say about the news: We’ve been inspired by Apple since day one, crafting our products with the same razor-sharp focus on design, ease of use, and performance. And looking back, it’s crazy what a small group of dedicated people have been able to achieve over the years from all the way in Vilnius, Lithuania. Now, we’ll have the ability to reach an even wider audience and make an even bigger impact on the lives of creative people around the world. Pixelmator also says: There will be no material changes to the Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps at this time. The Pixelmator Team’s apps have always been among our favorites at MacStories. In 2022 we awarded Pixelmator Photo (now, Photomator), the MacStories Selects Best Design Award, and in 2023, Pixelmator received our MacStories Selects Lifetime Achievement Award. Congratulations to everyone at Pixelmator. We can’t wait to see what this exciting new chapter means for them and their fantastic suite of apps.",
