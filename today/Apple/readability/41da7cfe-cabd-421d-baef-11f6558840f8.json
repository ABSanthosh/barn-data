  "text": "If you’re not yet interested in installing MacOS Sequoia for whatever reason – perhaps due to compatibility issues, waiting for specific features, or just holding off until Sequoia is more refined – you almost certainly still want to install other system software updates as they become available to your Mac, including installing any available security updates and system software updates to macOS Sonoma or macOS Ventura. We’re going to cover how to install system updates to macOS Sonoma or MacOS Ventura, without upgrading the Mac to MacOS Sequoia. How to Install the Latest macOS Sonoma Updates Without Upgrading to MacOS Sequoia Here’s how you can update a Mac running MacOS Sonoma or MacOS Ventura to the latest versions of MacOS Sonoma, without installing MacOS Sequoia: Go to the  Apple menu and choose ‘System Settings’ Go to “General” Choose “Software Update” Ignore the large MacOS Sequoia upgrade banner, and instead look under the small “Also available” section with microscopic sized text, then click on the faint tiny blue “More Info…” text to access the other available updates Select the updates you wish to install for MacOS Sonoma, including updates to Safari if applicable, and then click on “Update Now” This allows you to install system software updates, Safari updates, and other updates available for MacOS Sonoma, without installing the major new MacOS Sequoia 15 system software version. If you’re looking to install system software updates to Sonoma (or Ventura) but NOT install MacOS Sequoia, the key thing to remember is to not click on the large prominent “Upgrade Now” button alongside the MacOS. Instead, look for the tiny nearly microscopic “More Info” button that Apple makes a little too difficult to find in a borderline UI dark pattern. MacOS Sequoia is a great release of system software for Mac with some really compelling features, most notably being iPhone Mirroring, but not everyone wants to jump onboard the latest and greatest system software version the moment it comes out. Many Mac users wait a while to install major new versions of system software, whether they’re waiting for the release to be stabilized with additional bug fixes (Perhaps to address wi-fi and network issues, for example), waiting for specific features (like Apple Intelligence), app compatibility reasons, or simply because they like Sonoma or Ventura, or just don’t feel like installing a significant new update. For what it’s worth, you can also download full MacOS installers here whether for existing MacOS versions or ones you aren’t running (including for Sequoia, Sonoma, Ventura, etc), and install or update MacOS using those as well. Are you holding off on upgrading to MacOS Sequoia, or did you jump right in? Do you prefer Sonoma or Ventura, and if so, why? Share your experiences and thoughts in the comments!",
