Here's how he gets work done at AppleInsider. If there's one thing I like writing about, it's my setup and workflows. There's a lot going on here, and unless you're new here, you might already know I'm all in on iPad and a little obsessed with Apple Vision Pro. My setup and workflows don't reflect the rest of my colleagues, and that's fine. I'm happy that I get to figure out new and interesting ways to tackle problems that might otherwise be solved by simply using a Mac. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster of tech these past few years, but regardless of my experiments, I always landed back at the iPad. Even as Apple Vision Pro attempts to prove its place in the lineup, the iPad has solidified as the future of computing, at least for me. A quick recapWhen I joined AppleInsider in 2019, I was already deeply involved in the \"iPad as a computer replacement\" mentality. Despite being incredibly into the idea, I fell in love with the Mac again after Apple Silicon took off, so I switched to a 14-inch MacBook Pro, at least until Stage Manager debuted. Things have come a long way since December 2019If you're keeping score, that's two years of iPad followed by a year of Mac, and now another two years of iPad. Apple Vision Pro swung in but couldn't make a significant mark on my workflows, especially after the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Today, I've got several pieces of technology in my lineup, and each serves a specific purpose in my work and life. So, let's discuss each. M4 iPad Pro with Nano Texture and an iPad mini 7The king of my setup is the M4 iPad Pro (check best prices), Apple's best take on the naked robotic core to date. Meaning, it can take on any form it needs based on what it is paired with. iPads all the way downThe iPad Pro is an excellent tablet with its thin and lightweight design, large 13-inch display, and Apple Pencil Pro. I don't often use the iPad Pro as just a tablet, but being able to pull it close and manipulate work with a finger or stylus is excellent. Attach the Magic Keyboard (on sale at Amazon), and the iPad Pro becomes a laptop. That's when I get to take the iPad with me to the living room, my favorite brewery, a hotel room, or a picnic table and get work done with a trackpad and keyboard. Slap the iPad into one of many magnetic stands, and the iPad can become a floating display. I can pair it with a gamepad and use it as a little TV, or have it by my bedside for reading or watching media. iPad Pro can be a tablet, laptop, or desktop depending on contextSet iPad Pro into a magnetic stand and connect a Thunderbolt cable, and it becomes a desktop computer with a second 27-inch 5K monitor. I use a StarTech Thunderbolt 4 dock to connect the iPad Pro to a Studio Display, Magic Trackpad, ASUS TUF capture card, Keychron Q3 Pro SE mechanical keyboard, and a Samsung 1TB SSD. The capture card was purchased as part of a greater experiment that didn't quite make it all the way to fruition. I wanted to see how streaming would work with iPad Pro as the managing computer, and it worked for the most part, but capturing audio, video, and microphone proved challenging, but possible with some workarounds. Perhaps I'll write about it one day. For now, it still works as an excellent way to get a game console like Nintendo Switch or PlayStation 5 onto the Studio Display through the attached iPad. I can use the setup to capture incoming video and audio too, which would be great if I ever wanted to get into making videos of gameplay. iPad Pro can even be a monitor for Nintendo SwitchThe great thing about having a single cable connect to my entire desk setup was being able to easily swap the iPad Pro for the 14-inch MacBook Pro and record the AppleInsider Podcast. I traded that MacBook in for an M4 Mac mini, which I'll get into later. I love working from the iPad Pro despite Apple's continued insistence on kneecapping the operating system and software with arbitrary limits. Every year, Apple manages to address one or two pro user complaints, but it's not guaranteed. Since the 13-inch iPad Pro represents my workplace, I have taken to using a second iPad that's smaller, but still can do most of what I need. That tablet is the iPad mini 7, Apple's best iPad-as-a-tablet in its lineup thanks to its power and form factor. iPad mini 7 is a great pocket companionThe iPad mini is my personal computer that goes with me everywhere. Its display is bigger and more square than the iPhone, so it's perfect for viewing media, reading text, or playing games. When I'm working, the iPad mini is with me at the desk, but it is often turned off. When I need a second display for whatever reason, that's when the iPad mini is pulled in. My iPhone acts as a data viewer, like showing battery levels, rain, or now playing music on the office HomePods thanks to StandBy, so no, the iPad mini isn't doing that either. I'll admit, the iPad mini is a bit redundant at the desk, but I'm happy it's there when I need it. Plus, if I want to take a video I'm watching with me or something similar, I can grab it from its stand and walk away. iPad mini would be great for handwritten Journal entries, hint hint AppleThat's four active displays at my desk in front of my eyes at any time. Honestly, that style of setup is a remnant of the pre-Apple Vision Pro that could change in the future. Having two iPads becomes much more useful when I'm away from the desk. Since I don't have the Studio Display with me, I like having my primary work on the 13-inch iPad Pro and have the iPad mini as a secondary display. A desk-filled officeThe desk setup is meant to be somewhat modular. I work from an L-shaped desk by Uplift that has proven to be a favorite. I turn to the right side of the desk to podcast, that way I'm facing a wall of foam. My main desk offers plenty of space for spatial computingBehind me is a standing desk by Flexispot. I also use the C7 chair. That second desk is my photography station. I place different mats and backdrops to provide different styles for my product photography that you've undoubtedly seen across AppleInsider. You'll usually notice it's mine because of my tendency to use darker color palettes and moody lighting. A third table, that I think is technically also a desk, is used to hold extra equipment, upcoming review products, and my printer. Below the desk is a bunch of storage containers filled with cables, HomeKit items, keyboard parts, and more. The rolling cart covered with stickers is more of the same. A bookshelf in the opposite corner of my office contains various Apple and video game memorabilia. But most importantly, it's where my Mac mini lives. M4 Mac miniFunny enough, there's not much to say about the M4 Mac mini (on sale now). It exists solely to record podcasts without hassle. My M4 Mac mini exists almost solely for podcastingThe job was previously held by my 14-inch MacBook Pro, but I figured that display was being wasted in clamshell mode on a bookshelf. When I need to access the Mac mini, I wake it using a Magic Mouse that's on the far right side of my desk. My Apple Watch wakes it, provided it hasn't been too long since its last wake. Then, if I need to do anything with the Mac mini, I put on the Apple Vision Pro and interface from there. It's basically just for podcasts and testing functions for articles. A portable monitor sits at the base of the bookshelf behind closed doors so the Mac mini has some kind of display if needed. Although, even if it is awake, I almost never look at it. Making Mac mini portable is simple with an external batteryI'm happy to have the M4 Mac mini. It'll serve as a good access point to macOS, and at least it can run a Gamecube emulator if I want it to. One thing I am experimenting with and will revisit in 2025 is the Mac mini and making it portable. It makes for a neat way to access the Mac through a Virtual Display without a need for an outlet. Apple Vision ProI've been dancing around Apple Vision Pro so far because it sits at an interesting spot in my workflow. It constantly competes for my favorite piece of technology versus the iPad Pro, but falls just short. Apple Vision Pro is still a bit early for prime timeWhen Apple Vision Pro was released in February, it quickly became my primary computer because it could do everything my M1 iPad Pro could. However, the M4 iPad Pro stole the spotlight after that through review needs, then Apple Intelligence sealed the deal. See, Apple Intelligence still isn't available on Apple Vision Pro, and I need it for my workflow. I dumped Grammarly after Apple's Proofread function in Writing Tools got good enough and haven't looked back. If I really want to, I could open Drafts in the Mac mini Virtual Display and run Proofread, but it's just not the same. The bit of friction there has brought me back to my favorite setup with iPad Pro. When I need to get something done as rapidly as possible, I still rely on the iPad for that. However, Apple Vision Pro is still my go-to device for long-form content. This story was written mostly in Apple Vision Pro. iPad Pro is a bit more practical in public spaces and more portableI'm one of the few that can claim zero discomfort from using Apple Vision Pro and the Solo Knit Band. If more of my workflow could be accomplished via native apps in visionOS, I'd be there more often. Until then, Apple Vision Pro has taken a back seat to iPad Pro. I use it a few times a week, sometimes for hours at a time, but it certainly isn't the primary machine. One use you can count on is me wearing it while recording the AppleInsider Podcast. It lets me view my Mac display, Safari, and show notes without having a large piece of glass in front of my face, thus causing echoes. I think Apple has something special with Apple Vision Pro, and I can't wait to see more apps and experiences on the platform. We'll see what 2025 has to offer — perhaps I'll be writing about it overtaking the iPad before year's end. An office in fluxI'm never happy with my spaces. I'll continuously seek ways to tweak and optimize workflows as new products emerge and technologies improve. The office is constantly changing, either for reviews or personal preferenceI believed and hoped Apple Vision Pro would have a larger impact on my office. In fact, I thought I might even clear off the desk to have a kind of empty platform for virtual objects and windows. Don't get me wrong, I'm still tempted to do that if and when the time comes, but Apple Vision Pro still needs to do everything without compromise, and that includes Apple Intelligence. I'm in a constant battle between my love of the iPad Pro and Apple Vision Pro, so for now, my office is a place that supports both. This home is a rental, and if you haven't heard before, I'll tell you here — I'm getting married in October 2025. We plan to buy a home in 2026 if everything lines up, so that prospect sits constantly on the edge of my thoughts. Sometimes it's nice just to get out of the office tooI know my time in this space is limited, so I'm likely not to change too much over 2025. My setup has come a long way since my little corner desk in a Virginia Beach apartment. Perhaps my new home and new office will be built around the increased prominence of spatial computing. Only time will tell. TravelPart of what I love about my job is its portability. So, I wanted to talk a little about how I get work done outside of the office. iPad Pro makes a great compact laptopI've got a bit of a weekly ritual, provided the weather holds. I like to hop on my e-bike and ride into town on Fridays so I can get work done somewhere other than my office. My go-to bag for these outings is the Nomatic Navigator 10L. It carries my iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard, a bike lock, iPad mini, game controller, and a battery pack with a kickstand. When I'm set up at a local place, it's usually just the iPad Pro, but I do like using the battery pack to hold the iPhone up so I can view StandBy. The iPad mini is more for playing games on the go than anything. More serious outings require bigger bags. If I'm going to carry what's basically my entire office, I go for the AirPorter Backpack by Waterfield, which is a perfect companion for the Shield Case. The Shield Case and Air Porter Backpack are great for long term travelThis big bag holds my iPads, Apple Vision Pro, Mac mini, batteries, controllers, chargers, and still leaves space after. It's an excellent option for my annual out-of-state trip. It still scares me a bit carrying my Apple Vision Pro out of my home, not to mention using it in public. But I do have a cool solution for that when the Shield Case and Air Porter Backpack are overkill. The Backpack for Apple Vision Pro by Waterfield is a great in-between. So far, I find it's best when I'm visiting a local friend and want to show them the headset. Backpack for Apple Vision Pro has a hammock for the headsetThe coolest part of the Backpack are these two zipper bags included with it. They've become my travel companions regardless of what bag I'm carrying since they hold my cables and folding 3-in-1 iPhone charger. iPhone 16 Pro Max and the restI've mentioned my iPhone 16 Pro Max throughout this write-up, but I wanted to carve out a little spot for it here. It's the core of Apple's business, but funny enough, not really a big work tool for me. Beyond acting as a StandBy machine at my desk and abroad, my iPhone serves two specific purposes in my work. It's an amazing camera for product photography and a good video camera for recording the HomeKit Insider Podcast. Sony a7II shooting the iPad mini with iPad Pro acting as a backdropIf you see a photo taken in my office, in a light booth, or otherwise in my home, chances are those photos were taken with my trusty Sony a7II. Everything outside the house, like photos for my bike reviews or the outdoor shots of Apple Vision Pro in Virginia Beach, are taken with the iPhone. I've always loved iPhone photography, but it is incredible how powerful the camera has become. I mentioned in the iPhone 16 Pro Max review how important I believed Camera Control and reversible Photographic Styles were for a reason. While iPad mini 7 (check sale prices) is my go-to personal computer for entertainment or reading while I'm at home, the iPhone is my computer everywhere else. And of course, if I want to write in Apple Journal, I still have to do so from the iPhone only. Apple's iPhone remains my go-to camera since it's always on meThe iPhone goes well beyond just entertainment too. It's how I log my calories, view health data, manage my home with Reminders, communicate with my friends and family, and so much more. Apple Watch Series 10 is an extension of the iPhone, acting as a window into my activity and life. AirPods Pro 2 are always on my person, in my pocket or looped through my belt, and let me hide from the noise or enhance what I hear. The iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch I keep with me all day every day ended up at the end of this list because it's honestly difficult to remember they are there. I didn't even get into Apple Home, HomePods, Apple TV, and the other tech that surrounds me and is part of my work. For better or worse, technology surrounds us. It's why I'm in this profession, so I can explain it, criticize it, and be a part of the discussion about these life-changing products.",
