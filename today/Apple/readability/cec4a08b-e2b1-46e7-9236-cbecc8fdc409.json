Photo: Cult of Mac Deals If you ever endured a long lecture or an hours-long all-hands meeting, you know this to be true: There’s no way you can jot down every single word your professor or colleague utters. Rather than scramble and stress about missing certain parts of a presentation, you could add an AI note taker like My Notes AI to your productivity tool kit. This AI-powered note transcription and summarization app works with your iPhone, iPad and Mac to help you catch every single word. Think of it as your very own personal assistant! You can snag a lifetime subscription to My Notes AI for just $39.99 (regularly $299). That’s the best price you’ll find online. My Notes AI: An AI note taker that captures every single word Imagine never having to frantically scribble down everything your professor or manager is saying. That’s in your future when you have My Notes AI. The AI note taker lets you focus on the actual presentation and look over your notes later. This intuitive app is perfect for everyone, from students to professionals. It doesn’t matter if you need to transcribe a live recording or an audio file — this app works with both and offers unlimited transcriptions. But this app doesn’t just transcribe. Its AI can also produce instantaneous summaries from lengthy transcriptions, allowing you to take the big ideas of any lecture or presentation and apply them more practically. This might prove beneficial for students dealing with complicated coursework or professionals who need to brainstorm for multiple projects. Unlimited transcriptions for one low price Granted, Apple’s Notes app offers similar features — if you own a device capable of running Apple Intelligence. (That means an iPhone 15 Pro or better or a Mac or iPad with at least an M1 chip.) Other great transcription apps, like Otter.ai, charge a monthly fee for the sort of unlimited subscription capabilities My Notes AI offers. After taking notes from the transcriptions or summaries, you can use My Notes AI’s advanced organizational tools to mark your notes based on their subject matter, dates, etc. This could prevent you from losing vital information for schoolwork or professional initiatives. If you’re collaborating with a co-worker or team, you can easily share your notes as well. For iPhones and iPads, the cross-platform AI note taker requires iOS/iPadOS 16 or later. For Macs, My Notes AI requires macOS Ventura or later and a computer running on an M1 or better chip.
