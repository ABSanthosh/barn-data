  "text": "Photomator, a popular photo editor for iOS and macOS, announced on Tuesday an update that will make it easier for users to organize their photo library using flags and star ratings. Read on as we detail all the new features coming with Photomator 3.4. What’s new with Photomator 3.4 As detailed on the Pixelmator blog (which owns Photomator), the new Photomator 3.4 introduces a new photo culling system. Users will be able to better organize their photo library with features such as flags and star ratings. For example, a professional working on a large-scale photoshoot can now quickly mark their favorite or rejected photos. On the Mac version of Photomator, the new flag and star rating options will be available via the Info window, in the Image menu, and also by Control-clicking on a photo. On iPhone and iPad, flags and star ratings can be accessed via the Photos browser. Users will then be able to filter their photos using these criteria. “These features make it incredibly easy to organize photos and even large-scale photoshoots by letting you quickly mark favorites, reject unwanted shots, or add star ratings to photos. You can rate and flag photos directly in the browser or in the filmstrip – whatever your photo culling workflow may be,” the company says. Flags and star ratings can be synchronized with other photo editing apps such as Adobe Lightroom. In addition, Photomator for the Mac is also getting advanced filtering, so users can now filter photos by file type, flag, stars, name, date and location. Try it now Photomator is available on the App Store – and you can try it out for free. Users can opt for a subscription model or buy a lifetime license, which typically costs $119.99. The app is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
