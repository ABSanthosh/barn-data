If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Many people want to do a better job monitoring their diet and eating habits, but don’t exactly know where to start. Nunch is a fantastic new app to make the process a lot more seamless. Top features Nunch‘s top feature is certainly its interface. It’s very clean, and gets straight to the point. On the dashboard, you can easily view your calories, macros, and weight progress. Nunch offers great visuals and charts, and makes it very easy to input all of your nutrient data. If you don’t have the exact numbers on a meal, Nunch also has a list of thousands of nutrient-verified food, so you can have a strong idea for the sake of logging. Nunch also lets you create your own meal library, so you can easily reuse a recipe later, while logging those macros. These meals can also easily be shared to friends and family. On top of the clean interface, Nunch also offers iCloud Sync – keeping your data up to date between your iPhone and iPad, free of tracking. It also offers customizable themes and icons to add some flair to your experience. Download the app Nunch is available on the App Store for iPhone and iPad users running iOS 18.2 and later. It’s available with a 7-day free trial, and will cost $4.99/month or $34.99/year afterwards. It’s completely ad-free.
