Apple has released a new firmware update for AirPods Pro 2, which ushers in support for an all-new set of Hearing Health features. Thursday's firmware increases the build number to 7B19, from the previous 7A305. The company's latest firmware update for AirPods 2 was deployed on October 24, following the release of firmware updates intended for developer testing. In June, at WWDC 2024, Apple announced that the AirPods Pro 2 would receive an assortment of Hearing Health features, which includes Hearing Test, Hearing Aid, and Hearing Protection. Of these three, the clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature is intended for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. Following the FDA approval of Apple's Hearing Health features in September, settings for them appeared in developer betas of iOS 18.1. On October 21, the first reviews of Hearing Health came out, confirming the release date of the features. iOS 18.1 is scheduled for release on October 28, alongside iPadOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1, and more. While the main focus of the iOS 18.1 update is Apple Intelligence, a suite of generative AI features, the software also ensures compatibility with the Hearing Health features of the AirPods Pro 2. IOS 18.1 is nearing the end of beta testing, as release candidate versions of the operating system were issued on October 21. Thursday's new firmware update is installed automatically for users when the AirPods are plugged into their charging case and connected to an iOS device. There is no manual installation method for this firmware update. How to check your AirPods firmware version AirPods users can check the current firmware for their audio accessories by accessing the Settings app on their iPhone or iPad.
