The 2025 rankings are as follows: Apple, worth $1.29 trillion Google, worth $944.1 billion Microsoft, worth $884.8 billion Amazon, worth $866.1 billion Nvidia, worth $509.4 billionKantar values the Global Top 100 brands at $10.7 trillion. This figure would mean that Apple makes up a full 12% of the total value It's not entirely clear how Kantar calculates these values. According to Kantar, it's a three-step process that uses the financial value and brand contribution to determine the brand value.

Intangible assets include things like software licenses, patents, and \"the brand\". Finally, they filter out any earnings that can't be directly attributed to the brand. Essentially, it's a whole lot of speculation. That being said, the methodology is the same for all companies, so there may be something to be gleaned from it.",
