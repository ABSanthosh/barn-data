  "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a new Bluetooth speaker, the newest Beats Pill speaker is a great option, especially when it’s on sale. As part of Prime Day, Amazon has cut the price of the Beats Pill down to $100, a booming 33 percent ($50) off, which is an impressive discount. In our review of the Beats Pill, our expert gave it a 4-star rating, praising the decent volume and sound for its size and the fantastic battery life. “The weatherproofing, relatively loud volume, and fantastic battery life all make this a really great affordable speaker for hanging out by the pool, listening to some tunes while grilling, or improving the vibe inside your tent the next time you go camping,” we wrote. Indeed, this speaker is great to take by the pool or to the beach because it comes with an IP67 rating for dust and water. Since you can slip it on a lanyard, you can carry it with you a lot easier, while the soft-grip silicone allows you to get a good hold of it. This is a speaker that works with both Android and iOS devices, so you won’t have any problems if you’re not in the Apple universe. So grab yourself one of these Beats Pill speakers for $100 at Amazon and enjoy a marvelous Prime Day deal. Snatch the Beats Pill for its best price everBuy it now at Amazon",
