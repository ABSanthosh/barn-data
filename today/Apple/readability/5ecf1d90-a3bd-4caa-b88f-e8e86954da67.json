  "text": "With WWDC just around the corner, upcoming macOS features are likely to rekindle interest in Apple’s Mac lineup. Whether you’re shopping for your first Mac or upgrading an aging one, here’s the latest on what’s coming next. Apple recently launched M4 MacBook Air, along with refreshed Mac Studio models that are now configurable with M3 Ultra or M4 Max chips. These joined last year’s M4-powered MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini updates. Over the next several months, Apple is expected to continue its Apple Silicon rollout across the rest of the lineup, including the debut of the M5 chip. Here’s what to expect until the end of the year, according to the latest rumors: MacBook Pro According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will likely kick off the M5 generation with new MacBook Pro models this fall, followed by M5 iPad Pros sometime in the first half of 2026. The M5 chip is expected to use TSMC’s third-generation 3nm manufacturing, rather than the previously rumored 2nm. A major hardware redesign isn’t expected this year either, as that appears to be in the cards for 2026. The current MacBook Pro lineup was last updated in October 2024, so it feels pretty safe to assume they might be released around the same time this year. iMac iMac updates have never followed a predictable pattern, so timing here is trickier. Apple refreshed the 24-inch iMac last year, and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said that a larger 32-inch mini-LED model could arrive in 2025. To be precise, he said it might arrive between late 2024 and 2025, so we’re still in that window. However, unless you’re specifically holding out for a bigger screen, now may be a good time to buy. A redesigned or M5-powered version likely won’t show up until much later in the cycle, if at all, since Apple has skipped chip generations with the iMac before. Mac Pro While other models in the lineup have moved to M3 or M4, the Mac Pro is in limbo, still stuck on the mid-2023 M2 Ultra. A Mac Pro refresh has been rumored for mid- 025, but what chip it will use is anyone’s guess. When the company updated the Mac Studio with the M4 Max and a surprise M3 Ultra, it told reviewers that not every chip generation will include an Ultra-tier option. Whether that means the Mac Studio won’t get an M4 Ultra, or if there won’t be an M4 Ultra at all, remains to be seen. It would make sense for the Mac Pro to get an M4 Ultra, but when has anything about the Mac Pro ever made sense? If you’ve been holding out until now to get a Mac Pro, it might pay off to wait a bit longer, as we’re on the verge of mid-2025 territory. But don’t be surprised if, in a few weeks, that rumor becomes late-2025 or beyond. It wouldn’t be the first time.
