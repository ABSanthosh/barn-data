Only 1Password® Extended Access Management (XAM) checks every box.You need more than what today’s access management tools offerToday’s security tools only secure access to some applications, some devices, and some people. With remote work, bring-your-own device, and shadow IT apps becoming commonplace, the number of unsanctioned apps and untrusted devices is rapidly climbing. Businesses are stuck relying on traditional identity and access management solutions, which were built for a way of work that no longer exists.Modern IT and Security teams need Extended Access ManagementExtended Access Management ensures that every identity is authentic, every application sign-on is secure, and every device is healthy. It’s the only solution that helps companies secure access to all applications from any device in today’s SaaS-centric hybrid work environment.Secure access for the way businesses work today1Password Extended Access Management secures user access across every identity, device, application, and location. Here’s how it works.Secure your workforceUser IdentityExtend single sign-on to every application, including unsanctioned apps, providing secure access to every website and app to mitigate vulnerabilities. Manage the user lifecycle from end to end to reduce risk and secure every authentication, no matter how users sign in. Now in beta.Secure your devicesDevice Trust (Kolide by 1Password)Keep unknown and wounded devices away from your sensitive data. 1Password Extended Access Management checks the health of every device – even for bring-your-own devices and contractors. Block access to apps until end users have completed important security tasks, like addressing a Watchtower alert, updating their applications and browsers, or fixing serious device compliance issues.Secure all applicationsApplication InsightsEmployees use tools that make them more productive, often without IT approval. 1Password Extended Access Management gives businesses visibility into the applications their employees are actually using. When unsanctioned apps are discovered, admins can guide users towards company-approved applications, or manage access to unmanaged applications. Now in beta.Secure your credentialsEnterprise Password Manager1Password Extended Access Management includes the most used enterprise password manager, which is trusted by over 150,000 businesses and millions of consumers. Since 2007, 1Password has made the secure way to work the easy way to work.\"1Password makes complex processes easier and integrates them seamlessly into practice.
