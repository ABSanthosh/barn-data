  "text": "News Say, what‚Äôs that \"hairy creature\"? Photo: Emojipedia/Cult of Mac The list of additions to the official collection of emoji we can use in text message includes an orca, a trombone and, wait, is that Bigfoot?! The industry group responsible for choosing new emoji proposed nine major additions and dozens of tweaks. If approved, they‚Äôll be added to iPhone, Mac and iPad as well as many social media applications. The process takes a while, though. New emoji suggestions include Bigfoot Emoji are fun and help us express emotions in our texts. Adding üòú to one lets your friend know you don‚Äôt really want salami on datenut bread for lunch, and üòÜ shows you appreciate their sense of humor. Of course, some are just confusing. Hopefully, the additions proposed this month by the Emoji Standard \u0026 Research Working Group won‚Äôt bewilder anyone. On the list are a treasure chest, a ballet dancer, a fight, an avalanche and a trombone, according to Emojipedia. The apple core will likely find use among Apple fans and detractors. But the standout is the ‚Äúhairy creature‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt actually get called Bigfoot but is clearly inspired by the subject of the infamous 1967 Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film. Probably coming in 2025 Don‚Äôt expect to report a Bigfoot sighting via emoji any time soon. The approval process takes months. The Emoji Standard \u0026 Research Working Group proposes additions to the list, but these must be approved by the Unicode Consortium. Then, Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and other companies design the versions their software will use. The process of proposing and approving emoji is complex but necessary because iPhones, Androids, etc., don‚Äôt send pictures to each other ‚Äî they send Unicode numbers. It‚Äôs up to each device to turn the number into a picture. So, the sender and receiver must agree on what those Unicode numbers represent. Once the Unicode Consortium makes the final decision, Apple can design its versions and then add them to iPhone, iPad, etc. Given the timing and the generally slow approval process, the proposed Emoji additions might ¬†go into iOS and macOS in winter 2025 or perhaps next spring.",
