A good magnetic charger can save your phone from certain death, but sometimes leaving it attached in your pocket results in a heat warning. The Icemag offers a solution by attaching a heatsink and fan to the bottom, complete with RGB lighting. Sharge was founded in 2020, specializing in consumer electronics like batteries, wires, and SSD enclosures. The Icemag features a modern white and grey color scheme, with a transparent front panel that reveals its internal circuitry and an RGB fan. To me, the Icemag 2 looked a lot like a shrunk-down gaming PC. It also has a pretty useful stand that's reliable for portrait and landscape use for your iPhone. Icemag 2 Power Bank review: The RGB cycles between colors automatically.Its 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging is standard for current batteries, but the lower rear portion on the back has an exposed aluminum backplate for heat dissipation. If you need faster charging, you can use the two-way USB-C port for up to 30W of power. Strangely enough, the fan seems to also turn on if you use cable-only charging. The Icemag 2 has a 10,000 mAh battery, offering enough capacity to nearly recharge an iPhone 16 around one-and-a-half times. Icemag 2 Power Bank - Specs Product Detail Spec Ports USB-C, Wireless Supported Protocols QC3.0, PD2.0, PD3.0, Apple5V/2.4A, BC1.2, AFC, FCP, PPS, SCP Input USB-C: 30W Max Output USB-C: 30W Max Wireless: 5W, 7.5W, 15W Battery Capacity 10,000mAh / 3.6V / 36Wh Rated Capacity 6,000mAh Dimensions 4.25 in x 2.78 in x 0.78 in Weight 220g / 0.49lb Icemag 2 Power Bank review: The backside of the battery, showing the heatsink.Icemag 2 Power Bank - Use and TestingOnce turned on, the RGB and fan spin up to start cooling your phone. The fan makes a bit of noise, which is expected. However, this impacts the convenience of the product since you have to consider the appropriateness of using a slightly noisy charger in public. I avoided using the Icemag 2 in libraries but had no problem using it while walking. Icemag 2 Power Bank review: The fan activates regardless of whether the heatsink is used.I tested the effectiveness of the heatsink and fan by running a GPU benchmark on Geekbench to compare effectiveness. I also used CPU-x to check on the internal temperature of my iPhone 16 Pro. The results for the Icemag 2 were relatively normal, with a Metal score of 32482 for GPU, and 2790 and 8496 for single and multicore CPU scores, respectively. Results with the Icemag 2 showed a small difference, a Metal score of 32869 for GPU results and 3342 and 8257 for single and multicore scores. These results are not scientifically conclusive that the Icemag will enhance your iPhone's performance in gaming or computationally intensive tasks. Still, these one-off tests indicate a small positive difference when using the Icemag. The temperature also didn't change noticeably between these tests. It's also worth noting I've never gotten a thermal warning when using the Icemag 2 in my pocket, which has occurred with other magnetic chargers. Icemag 2 Power Bank review: The Icemag is around the standard size for a 10,000mAh battery.Icemag 2 Power Bank - A charger for summer outings or gaming sessionsSharge has iterated on a very unique product idea to create a flashy and fun magnetic charger. Considerable thought has been put into the needs of mobile gamers, offering a device that charges efficiently and also helps in managing device temperature during extended use. The Icemag 2 stands out in its features and color choices compared to the horde of grey and black magnetic chargers I've reviewed in the past. Still, this is not the most discreet method of charging, since it draws attention through noise and light. If you don't like that, the Icemag 2 may not be for you. It's not for everyone, but it's a good buy for people who do lots of mobile gaming or want to keep their phones cool in the upcoming summer weather.
