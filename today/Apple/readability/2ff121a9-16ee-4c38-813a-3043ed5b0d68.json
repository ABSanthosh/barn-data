When President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, one of the first executive orders he signed changed the names of multiple locations in and out of the United States. The most controversial was the change from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America. Politicians were quick to question Apple and Google on when the change would be reflected in their respective mapping apps. Google responded by stating Google Maps would be updated when the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) was updated — it still shows the Gulf of Mexico. Apple has remained silent about the issue, but a change has been made, even if it is a small one. If users navigate to the Gulf of Mexico, it still shows the 400-year-old name plain as day. However, if a user searches \"Gulf of America,\" the text over the Gulf changes to reflect the search result, but the information sheet shows data and photos about the Gulf of Mexico. This seems to be a working solution that could stick, but there isn't any word from Apple if that is the plan. Google will change the name for United States users to Gulf of America. Users outside of the United States will see both names with one in parentheses, while people in Mexico will see only Gulf of Mexico. Apple Maps could still arrive at a similar solution. For now, the search term at least results in the expected location — something Google still doesn't do. It seems unlikely that this would be enough to satisfy some politicians, but it may be enough to stave off unwanted attention. It walks a fine line between showing the true name of the location and satisfying users that search for the term, and it may be enough.",
