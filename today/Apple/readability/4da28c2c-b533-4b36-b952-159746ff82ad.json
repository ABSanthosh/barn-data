  "text": "Daily deals These earbuds trump AirPods on two features: price and charging case capability. Photo: Cult of Mac Deals If you’ve been holding out on buying AirPods because the price tag felt too steep, you aren’t alone. The good news? Your waiting paid off because this pair of wireless earbuds isn’t just more affordable. These AirPods alternatives come with a touchscreen case. While the cheapest pair of AirPods will run you $129, the Twin Sound Ultra Bluetooth earbuds cost just $29.99. Sure, they have their own limitations, but they’re a solid option for anyone looking to save some cash. An affordable AirPods alternative: Twin Sound Ultra earbuds Apple basically reinvented the wireless earbud when it introduced the original AirPods in 2016. Now, nearly a decade later, AirPods remain tough to beat — especially if you’re in the Apple ecosystem. However, this $30 price tag is also tough to beat. And these AirPods alternatives The Twin Sound Ultra earbuds pump out deep, strong bass, but we all know you usually get what you pay for regarding sound quality. Still, not everyone cares enough to pay for the very best — or can tell the difference. Another thing to consider: battery life. With the Twin Sound Ultra earbuds, you get around 18 hours of battery life with their charging case. The current entry-level AirPods 4 (without active noise cancellation) offer nearly double that. However, the AirPods cost more than quadruple the price of these alternative earbuds, so you might not mind charging the Twin Sound Ultras a little more often. You’ll love the handy touchscreen With the Twin Sound Ultra earbuds, you also get that touchscreen case, which AirPods lack. With this touchscreen, you can easily skip songs, see who’s calling before answering, and adjust the earbuds’ volume.  Will Apple ever make this upgrade to its earbuds? We have no idea. These AirPods alternatives also top Apple’s earbuds when it comes to color options. The Twin Sound Ultras come in white, like AirPods, but also in black. With Apple gear, you need to bump up to AirPods Max headphones for color options. And they list for $549! Save on an AirPods alternative with a touchscreen charging case The Twin Sound Ultra earbuds might not be for everyone, but some Apple users looking for more cost-effective options might want to grab these instead of splurging on AirPods. Plus, if you happen to lose an earbud, or misplace the whole kit and caboodle, you won’t be out nearly as much. Order your affordable AirPods alternative for just $29.99 (regularly $69.99).
