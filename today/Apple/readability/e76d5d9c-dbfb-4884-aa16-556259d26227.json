CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today introduced Apple Invites, a new app for iPhone that helps users create custom invitations to gather friends and family for any occasion. With Apple Invites, users can create and easily share invitations, RSVP, contribute to Shared Albums, and engage with Apple Music playlists. Starting today, users can download Apple Invites from the App Store, or access it on the web through icloud.com/invites. iCloud+ subscribers can create invitations, and anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device. “With Apple Invites, an event comes to life from the moment the invitation is created, and users can share lasting memories even after they get together,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Worldwide Product Marketing for Apps and iCloud. “Apple Invites brings together capabilities our users already know and love across iPhone, iCloud, and Apple Music, making it easy to plan special events.” Beautiful Invitations That Create and Capture Shared Moments To get started with Apple Invites, users can choose an image from their photo library or from the app’s gallery of backgrounds — a curated collection of images representing different occasions and event themes. Integrations with Maps and Weather give guests directions to the event and the forecast for that day. Additionally, participants can easily contribute photos and videos to a dedicated Shared Album within each invite to help preserve memories and relive the event. And collaborative playlists allow Apple Music subscribers to create a curated event soundtrack that guests can access right from Apple Invites. On iPhone 16 Pro, a screen in the Apple Invites app prompts a user to give their event a name and choose a photo. On iPhone 16 Pro in the Apple Invites app, an event invite titled Housewarming Party is shown. On iPhone 16 Pro in the Apple Invites app, an event’s guest list and shared photo album are shown. On iPhone 16 Pro in the Apple Invites app, a shared photo album for an event titled Housewarming Party is shown. With Apple Invites, bringing events to life is easy and fun. Users can create, share, and RSVP to invitations through the Apple Invites app, or on the web from any device. iCloud+ subscribers can create invitations, and anyone can RSVP, regardless of whether they have an Apple Account or Apple device. Integrations with Maps and Weather give guests directions to the event and the forecast for that day. With Shared Albums, participants can easily contribute photos and videos to help preserve memories. Apple Intelligence Makes Invites Even More Fun With Apple Intelligence, creating unique event invitations is easy. Users can tap in to the built-in Image Playground experience to produce original images using concepts, descriptions, and people from their photo library. And when composing invitations, users can use Writing Tools to help find just the right turn of phrase to meet the moment.1 Image Playground is built right into Apple Invites, giving users an easy way to generate original images that make their invitation even more unique. Simple Ways to Manage and Join Events Hosts get full control of their invite experience: They can easily view and manage their events, share invitations with a link, review RSVPs, and choose the details they want included in the preview, like the event background or a home address. Guests can view and respond to an invitation using the new iPhone app or on the web without needing an iCloud+ subscription or an Apple Account. Attendees control how their details show up to others, and have the ability to leave or report an event at any time. Hosts can easily view and manage their events, share invitations with a link, review RSVPs, and choose the details they want included in the preview, like the event background or a home address. Additional iCloud+ Premium Features In addition to event creation in Apple Invites, iCloud+ subscribers have access to many more premium features: Expanded storage allows users to keep large libraries of original, high-resolution photos, videos, and files safe in iCloud, and easily accessible across all of their devices and the web. Private Relay keeps browsing in Safari entirely private from network providers, websites, and even Apple. Hide My Email generates unique, random email addresses whenever needed. HomeKit Secure Video allows users to capture and review home security footage in an end-to-end encrypted format. Custom email domains enable users to personalize their iCloud email address. Family Sharing allows users to share their iCloud+ subscription with up to five people at no extra cost. Users can learn more about subscribing to iCloud+ at apple.com/icloud, with plans starting at just $0.99. Apple Invites is available today as a free download from the App Store for all iPhone models running iOS 18 or later, and can be accessed on the web at icloud.com/invites. Some features are not available in all regions or in all languages. For more information, visit apple.com/ios/feature-availability. Apple Intelligence is available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max running iOS 18.2 and later, and can be accessed in most regions around the world when the device and Siri language are set to localized English for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., or the U.S.",
