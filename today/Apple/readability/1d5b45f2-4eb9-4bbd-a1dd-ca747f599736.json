Photo: Cult of Mac Deals While the AirTag is a handy tool to keep track of things like your car keys or luggage, there are things that Apple’s tracking tag isn’t designed to keep tabs on, such as a wallet or your office card key. That’s precisely why the KeySmart SmartCard wallet tracker makes a terrific addition to your tech arsenal. Like the AirTag, the SmartCard works seamlessly with Apple’s Find My app. Unlike the bulkier AirTag, the SmartCard’s discreet form factor ensures it can be tucked away easily. The tracker’s ultra-slim, credit-card-like design makes it incredibly easy to fit into tight wallet slots, small compartments or the narrowest of pockets. And for a limited time, you can get a KeySmart SmartCard for just $29.97. A wallet tracker that works with Apple’s Find My network Although it isn’t an Apple product, the KeySmart SmartCard integrates with your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Whether you use the tracker with your wallet, bag or any other valuable item, the SmartCard leverages Apple’s extensive Find My network to help you find it if it becomes lost. If you lose your wallet nearby, the SmartCard will play a sound to alert you, just like an AirTag. And if you accidentally leave it behind somewhere, Apple’s Find My app can send a notification. If the worst happens and you lose the wallet tracker, Lost Mode will show you its last known location on a map to make it easier to find. This mode also displays a message on the card so anyone who finds it will know how to return it to you. This tracker is not just for wallets, either. A lanyard slot lets you keep it securely with your ID badge. Finally, this super-slim smart card lasts up to five months on a charge. And when it runs out, you can easily use a wireless charger to top it off. Save on the KeySmart SmartCard tracker The KeySmart SmartCard is more than just a wallet tracker. It’s a thoughtful addition to any Apple user’s collection. Whether you’re a frequent traveler or simply someone who often misplaces valuable items, the SmartCard is an innovative, affordable investment. Grab a KeySmart SmartCard wallet tracker and integrate it into your Apple ecosystem for just $29.97 (regularly $39.99). Free shipping to the contiguous United States.
