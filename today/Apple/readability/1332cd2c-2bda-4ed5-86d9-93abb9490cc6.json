  "text": "The popular AirTags trackers can be shared with others, and if someone has shared an AirTag with you then you’ll likely want to accept the invitation to track that object, belonging, pets, luggage, package, or whatever else is being tracked. While you will receive a notification about a shared AirTag, you might have dismissed it or not seen it, in which case you’ll need to manually accept the invitation and add the AirTag to your Find My app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. This is super easy, as we’ll walk you through. How to Add a Shared AirTag to Your Find My App on iPhone, Mac, iPad If someone has shared an AirTag with you, here is how you can add it to your Find My app on your device: Open the “Find My” app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac Go to the “Items” tab Tap on the AirTag shared with you and then tap on “Add” Repeat with other shared AirTags as necessary Now you can locate the AirTag or shared item at any time by opening the Find My app, tapping on the “Items” tab, and then tapping on the AirTag or item that was shared with you. Obviously we’re assuming that whoever shared the AirTag with you had already setup an AirTag with their device and then shared it with you specifically, as this is not simply just handing you a physical AirTag. Sharing AirTags is done through software, not by simply giving someone the hardware (though you can certainly do that too, and if you got a deal on a 4-pack of AirTags you might as well share your extras with family or friends). Remember that AirTags are not as precise as tracking devices as, say, an iPhone, but they’re still pretty good. The difference is really that an iPhone has GPS and cellular signal, allowing for precise location tracking, whereas an AirTag uses the Find My network and other iPhones, wi-fi, and Apple devices to keep track of something. And yes, AirTag Find My tracking will even work internationally, so if someone shared luggage or a package with you, you will still be able to keep an eye on it no matter where it is, as long as it can ping off of other Apple devices in the Find My network. Do you use AirTag sharing with other people? What’s your favorite use case? Feel free to chime in with the comments below.",
