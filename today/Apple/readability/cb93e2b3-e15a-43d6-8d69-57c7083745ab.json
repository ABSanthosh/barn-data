  "description": "Macworld Apple’s newest AirPods 4 are already an affordable way to get active noise cancellation without springing for AirPods Pro but this deal makes them a downright steal: The AirPods 4 with ANC are down to $149 at Amazon, a savings of $30 off its $179 MSRP and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. These are some earbuds we absolutely love, as the 4.5-star rating we gave them during our review stands testament. We found they deliver killer audio quality, are actually efficient at canceling noise, and come with a wirelessly charging case with a built-in speaker that can make a sound if you lose track of it. “They sound great, the active noise cancelation is extremely useful and works surprisingly well, they fit better than previous AirPods, and the wireless charging and Find My speaker on the case are much-welcomed conveniences. In short, the AirPods 4 are a great, all-around set of earphones, we wrote. If you don’t need ANC, the AirPods 4 also come in a regular model that’s a bit cheaper. You can get a pair for $117 right now, a small savings off its $129 MSRP. But whichever one you decide to buy, grab your very own AirPods 4 on sale today while they’re still on sale at Amazon.
