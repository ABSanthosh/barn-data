  "text": "News Charlotte Nicdao and Rob McElhenney starred in \"Mythic Quest,\" now canceled. But season 4 will get a new ending. Photo: Apple TV+ In a shock to dedicated fans, Apple TV+ cancelled Mythic Quest after the workplace comedy’s fourth season. It concluded March 26 with an intended season finale, not a series finale. So Apple green-lighted a re-do of the last episode’s cliffhanger ending so it actually ends the whole show. And that new ending, which will provide some closure for fans but probably won’t cheer them up, should stream in mid April. In an unusual development for a canceled show, Apple will allow the creators of Mythic Quest to update the final episode of season four with a new ending to provide closure for viewers. The updated finale is expected to be available as soon as next week. “Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, Mythic Quest is coming to a close,” said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby and Rob McElhenney in a joint statement. “We’re so proud of the show and the world we got to build — and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it.” “To all our fans, thank you for playing with us,” they added. “To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple’s blessing we made one final update to our last episode — so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.” The news is particularly surprising given that Mythic Quest recently spawned a spin-off titled Side Quest, a four-episode anthology series that explores the lives of employees, players and fans impacted by the fictional game. The four-episode spinoff came out March 26 and features McElhenney alongside Anna Konkle, Derek Waters and other notable actors. Early success and critical acclaim Mythic Quest became one of Apple TV+’s first original series when it launched in 2020. It received positive reviews and developed a dedicated fanbase over its four-season run. The show starred McElhenney (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Welcome to Wrexham) as Ian Grimm, a parody of a visionary tech founder. Charlotte Nicdao played Poppy Li, a brilliant but socially awkward engineer who serves as Grimm’s co-creative director. The cast also included David Hornsby, Danny Pudi, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Jessie Ennis and Naomi Ekperigin. F. Murray Abraham appeared in earlier seasons as video game writer C.W. Longbottom before departing the series. Throughout its run, Mythic Quest tackled issues within the gaming and tech industries, from startup culture to ethical questions in game development, while maintaining its comedic core. The series also produced two special pandemic-themed episodes: “Quarantine” in 2020 and “Everlight” in 2021. Fan reaction APPLE WHY WOULD YOU CANCEL MYTHIC QUEST AFTER THAT SEASON FINALE!!!!!!!???? pic.twitter.com/K0kiqjqY0E — mackenzie (@mackenzieGNF) April 12, 2025 The cancellation announcement sparked backlash from the show’s devoted audience. “APPLE WHY WOULD YOU CANCEL MYTHIC QUEST AFTER THAT SEASON FINALE!!!!!!!????” wrote one fan on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Another viewer expressed confusion about the decision: “Particularly puzzling considering the good reviews + the fact that they released a spinoff just last month…” One particularly disappointed fan wrote: “Heartbroken after ages that a TV network (or whatever you f***ers are called these days) canceled a show I really, really, really dig. Goodbye, Mythic Quest. You were simply incredible. Dumbass Apple.” Another viewer echoed the sentiment: “To say this decision is shortsighted would be an understatement. Mythic Quest was a phenomenal show that balanced its comedic nature so well with its more dramatically paced moments, while tackling the games industry. I am sad, but I am thankful for the seasons we’ve gotten.” Many fans questioned whether Apple adequately promoted the series. One wrote: “Latest victim of the frustrating trend of streaming services not promoting a show at all and then cancelling it. What happened to building and nurturing an audience?” Not all viewers were disappointed, however. At least one critic of the show supported the cancellation. “Good. Mythic Quest played on cheap stereotypes about gamers and [game development],” they wrote. “It also praised and promoted highly toxic behaviors of people in power, which in reality costs people in the industry their health and life. It was a huge disappointment.” The updated final episode with its new ending could stream next week. That will give fans a proper conclusion to the beloved series.",
