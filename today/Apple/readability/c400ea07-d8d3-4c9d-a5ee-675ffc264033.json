  "description": "Macworld Two days after the release of iOS 18.4, Apple has begun the iOS 18.5 beta testing cycle. The first developer release landed on April 2, and we expect a wide release in May (or possibly late April). The last few iOS versions had their x.5 releases in May, with only minor features and changes, and we expect the same this year, especially now that the anticipated new Siri has been delayed. Updated April 28: Apple has released the fourth beta of iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5, but we still don’t see any major new features. iOS 18.5: New features With the big Siri enhancements pushed back out of the iOS 18 update cycle and the iOS 19 beta starting at WWDC in June, we don’t expect much in the way of major new features—just a few touch-ups, bug fixes, and security enhancements. Contact Photos in Mail – In the three-dot menu (…) you can quickly enable or disable contact photos in Mail. AppleCare Info – In Settings \u003e General \u003e AppleCare \u0026 Warranty you’ll see a new AppleCare banner you can tap to learn about your coverage. iOS 18.5: How to install the public beta If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.5, you can sign up for the public beta test. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now: Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 18.5: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 18.5, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 18 superguide.",
