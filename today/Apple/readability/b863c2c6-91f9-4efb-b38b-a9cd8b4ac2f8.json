Apple today introduced new Logic Pro updates for Mac and iPad, supercharging beat making and producing. The innovative Stem Splitter feature now offers even greater audio fidelity, and can separate guitar and piano into stems. With Flashback Capture, users can retrieve and restore inspiring performances they may have forgotten to record. And with energetic new sound packs like Dancefloor Rush, beat makers have fresh loops and kits to fuel their next track. Upgrades to innovative features in Logic Pro take hip-hop and electronic music production to a new level. Stem Splitter Delivers Enhanced Audio Fidelity and New Stems The updated Stem Splitter extracts greater detail from old recordings and demos, and now offers added support for guitar and piano stems.1 Producers can easily select common stem variations, such as acapella, instrumental, or instrumental with vocals using presets. Additionally, a new submix feature makes it easy for users to export just the parts of audio they want — for example, removing vocals to create an instrumental track, or pulling out the drums and bass for a custom remix. The enhanced Stem Splitter extracts greater detail from old recordings and demos, and now offers added support for guitar and piano stems. Recall Every Moment with Flashback Capture Flashback Capture allows artists to recover unforgettable performances, even if they forgot to hit record.2 Users can quickly restore MIDI and audio performances using a key command or a custom control bar button. By enabling Cycle mode, musicians can improvise multiple takes, and Flashback Capture will automatically organize each pass into a take folder. With Flashback Capture, artists can recover unforgettable performances, even if they forgot to hit record. New Sound Packs to Amplify Music Production Logic Pro adds new sound packs to amplify music production. Dancefloor Rush — the latest sound pack for Mac and iPad — features a world of expertly crafted drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops, punchy drum kits, and a custom Live Loops grid. Today’s update also introduces two new sound packs to Logic Pro for Mac: Magnetic Imperfections and Tosin Abasi. Magnetic Imperfections brings an original texture that captures the raw, unpolished essence of analog tape, while the Tosin Abasi sound pack showcases progressive metal guitar with boutique amps, unique effects, distinctive picking techniques, and the artist’s signature riffs. The new Dancefloor Rush sound pack features expertly crafted drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops, punchy drum kits, and a custom Live Loops grid. Learn MIDI Comes to iPad for Seamless Logic Pro Integration Learn MIDI is now available on iPad, allowing users to get hands-on control by easily assigning their favorite knobs, faders, and buttons on MIDI devices to control plug-ins, instruments, and other automatable parameters within Logic Pro.3 With Learn MIDI’s intuitive interface and real-time visual feedback, users can quickly create custom assignments, view available controls, and stay in their creative flow. Now available on iPad, Learn MIDI allows users to get hands-on control by easily assigning their favorite knobs, faders, and buttons on MIDI devices to control plug-ins, instruments, and other automatable parameters. Additional features to enhance creativity on Mac: Notepad now features integrated support for Writing Tools, powered by Apple Intelligence, giving users more flexibility and control when they’d like to make their writing more expressive, get help with a rewrite, or even collaborate on song lyrics and more right inline.4 Users can manage large projects with the new search and select feature, which makes it easy to find and choose tracks by their name or track number.

Dancefloor Rush — the latest sound pack for Mac and iPad — features a world of expertly crafted drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops, punchy drum kits, and a custom Live Loops grid. Today’s update also introduces two new sound packs to Logic Pro for Mac: Magnetic Imperfections and Tosin Abasi. Magnetic Imperfections brings an original texture that captures the raw, unpolished essence of analog tape, while the Tosin Abasi sound pack showcases progressive metal guitar with boutique amps, unique effects, distinctive picking techniques, and the artist’s signature riffs.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cfigure aria-label=\"Media, The new Dancefloor Rush sound pack is shown in Logic Pro on iPad.\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n              \n              \u003cdiv\u003e\n                The new Dancefloor Rush sound pack features expertly crafted drum-and-bass sounds with over 400 dynamic loops, punchy drum kits, and a custom Live Loops grid.\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2025/05/logic-pro-amplifies-beat-making-on-mac-and-ipad-with-advanced-new-capabilities/article/Apple-Logic-Pro-Dancefloor-Rush-sound-pack.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image - Apple-Logic-Pro-Dancefloor-Rush-sound-pack_big\" aria-label=\"Download media, The new Dancefloor Rush sound pack is shown in Logic Pro on iPad.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/figure\u003e\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearn MIDI Comes to iPad for Seamless Logic Pro Integration\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eLearn MIDI is now available on iPad, allowing users to get hands-on control by easily assigning their favorite knobs, faders, and buttons on MIDI devices to control plug-ins, instruments, and other automatable parameters within Logic Pro.\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e With Learn MIDI’s intuitive interface and real-time visual feedback, users can quickly create custom assignments, view available controls, and stay in their creative flow.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \u003cfigure aria-label=\"Media, The Learn MIDI feature is shown on Logic Pro on iPad.\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n              \n              \u003cdiv\u003e\n                Now available on iPad, Learn MIDI allows users to get hands-on control by easily assigning their favorite knobs, faders, and buttons on MIDI devices to control plug-ins, instruments, and other automatable parameters.\n              \u003c/div\u003e\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2025/05/logic-pro-amplifies-beat-making-on-mac-and-ipad-with-advanced-new-capabilities/article/Apple-Logic-Pro-Learn-MIDI.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image - Apple-Logic-Pro-Learn-MIDI_big\" aria-label=\"Download media, The Learn MIDI feature is shown on Logic Pro on iPad.\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n          \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/figure\u003e\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional features to enhance creativity on Mac:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNotepad now features integrated support for Writing Tools, powered by Apple Intelligence, giving users more flexibility and control when they’d like to make their writing more expressive, get help with a rewrite, or even collaborate on song lyrics and more right inline.\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsers can manage large projects with the new search and select feature, which makes it easy to find and choose tracks by their name or track number.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLogic Pro for Mac 11.2 is available May 28 as a free update for existing users and for \u003cstrong\u003e$199.99\u003c/strong\u003e (U.S.) for new users on the Mac App Store.
