  "text": "Apple today published another round of App Store changes for developers operating in the European Union, this time focused on how apps can communicate and promote alternative payment options under the Digital Markets Act. But from the looks of it, the new rules didn’t impress Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Sweeney says new terms are ‘blatantly unlawful’ and ‘a mockery of fair competition’ In a post on X, Sweeney said Apple’s latest DMA update is “blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States,” calling it a “malicious compliance scheme” that “makes a mockery of fair competition.” According to Sweeney, developers who use alternative payment methods are “not only taxed but commercially crippled in the App Store.” Here’s his full statement: Apple’s new Digital Markets Act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets. Apps with competing payments are not only taxed but commercially crippled in the App Store.…— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 26, 2025 His comments came immediately after Apple announced a sweeping set of changes to its App Store guidelines in the European Union as part of its ongoing efforts to comply with the Digital Markets Act. As reported by 9to5Mac, the updates include a new Core Technology Commission (CTC), new rules for apps that want to link out or promote external offers, and revised Store Services Fees split into tiers. You can read a full breakdown of Apple’s latest changes here. 9to5Mac’s Take Sweeney’s post adds to the ongoing tension between Apple and Epic, and comes on the heels of an injunction that barred Apple from taking any cut of purchases completed outside the U.S. App Store. Apple is now appealing that decision, arguing it goes too far and unfairly rewrites the rules of earlier decisions in the Epic Games, Inc. v. Apple Inc. case. Between the courtroom pressure in California and regulatory heat in Europe, Apple’s grip on its app ecosystem is being squeezed from both sides. In the end, today’s update is the company’s latest attempt to thread the needle, but it remains to be seen whether this one will finally appease EU regulators. Epic, for its part, is clearly not impressed.
