  "text": "This holiday season, XGIMI is offering an array of cutting-edge projectors that promise to transform your festive gatherings into unforgettable experiences. With limited-time discounts and special bundle deals, there’s never been a better time to upgrade your home entertainment system or find the perfect gift for the tech enthusiast in your life. XGIMI’s projectors are designed to bring families and friends together, creating a cinematic atmosphere for holiday movie marathons, sports events, and celebrations. The high-quality visuals and immersive sound will make every viewing experience magical, whether you’re watching classic Christmas films or streaming the latest blockbusters. XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro Christmas collection The MoGo 3 Pro is XGIMI’s newest portable projector. With the size of a large cup, it’s ideal for taking with you wherever you go, whether indoors or outdoors. The 1080p resolution with 450 lumens of brightness is enough to provide a fun movie night with your family at Christmas. Even if you don’t have a dedicated space for a large projector. MoGo 3 Pro has two 5W speakers from Harman/Kardon, and the best part is that the projector also works as a Bluetooth speaker. This means you can play songs with it from your phone without having to turn on the projector lens. The MoGo 3 Pro’s design features a built-in stand with 130º adjustment, and just like other XGIMI projectors, it also has easy setup with autofocus and auto keystone to intelligently adjust the image. For this holiday season, XGIMI has created something special: the MoGo 3 Pro Christmas collection. You can buy a kit with a MoGo 3 Pro projector combined with a Creative Optical Filter, the PowerBase Stand to use the projector unplugged, and an exclusive Christmas case. It’s the perfect gift for tech enthusiasts or someone who loves home entertainment. You can buy the XGIMI MoGo 3 Pro Christmas collection for just $549. More XGIMI deals for this holiday season XGIMI has also prepared many other special offers for this holiday season. The new Elfin Flip is a beautiful 1080p projector with a built-in 150º angle stand, perfect for smaller rooms. It also supports image auto-adjustment and has two built-in 3W speakers. From $399, you can buy it for just $299 during the Christmas sale.

Perfect for watching Christmas movies and shows in high resolution with your family. XGIMI Horizon Ultra review: 4K projector for those serious about image quality With the XGIMI Horizon Ultra, you don’t have to worry about connecting external speakers to it, because the projector has two 12W speakers from Harman Kardon with DTS Sound technology for a surround experience.
