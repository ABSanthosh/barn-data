  "description": "Macworld The 10th-gen iPad is already a good bargain at its full $349 MSRP. But right now you can get one for a real steal for Black Friday at $250, the very best price we’ve ever seen. That’s $100 off when you click the coupon box on the page and an insane deal for a great tablet. With an A14 Bionic chip, this tablet is ready to help you tackle games, streaming, and even some of your workload since you can easily use it with a Magic Keyboard. This 10.9-inch tablet features a Liquid Retina Display with vibrant colors and deep contrasts for a great visual experience. You’ll also get excellent battery life and years of upgrades. For FaceTime calls, this iPad features a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage, keeping the focus on you even if you move around. There’s also a 12MP Wide back camera if you want to snap some pics or videos. The only thing it doesn’t have is Apple Intelligence, but with a slow roll-out, you’re not going to be missing out on too much. So go ahead and add the 10th-gen iPad to your cart for just $250 because once Black Friday is over this deal will be too. Buy now at Amazon",
