Super Bowl Sunday is rapidly approaching, and that means you're probably figuring out how and where to watch the Big Game. While cable subscribers can still tune in on FOX, cord-cutters might need alternatives. We've compiled a list of places you can watch Super Bowl LIX for all your favorite Apple devices — including Mac and Apple Vision Pro. We even offer an alternative for those who can't watch the game for one reason or another. Super Bowl LIX will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Kick-off is at 6:30 PM on February 9. The Philadelphia Eagles will take on the Kansas City Chiefs for the second time in three years. This year also marks the third year in a row that the Chiefs are headed to the Super Bowl. And don't forget — this is Apple Music's third year running the Half-Time Show. This year will feature Kendrick Lamar, and Apple Music is celebrating with bonus content, special offers, and more. How to watch Super Bowl LIX on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Apple Vision ProChances are, if you're reading this, you're probably trying to figure out how to watch the Super Bowl on an iOS, tvOS, or visionOS device. Fortunately, there are numerous solutions — some free, and some you may already have — that can help you achieve this. Regardless of what device you use, you're going to wind up downloading an app. So, here's the list of apps that are offering access to Super Bowl LIX. Free - TubiPerhaps the easiest way to watch Super Bowl LIX this year, Tubi is a FOX-owned, ad-supported service. All it takes is downloading the free Tubi app, which is available for the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and the Apple Vision Pro. Image Credit: TubiThis is likely the best choice for cord-cutters who don't also have a streaming service bundle with optional add-on television features. You can snag Tubi from the App Store. Paid - NFL App with NFL+ subscriptionIt's somewhat peculiar that you can't watch the Super Bowl for free via the NFL app. However, if you already pay for an NFL+ subscription, you can watch without paying any extra money. If you're interested in a subscription to NFL+, you can purchase a one-month subscription starting at $6.99. If you'd like bonus features, including on-demand content, highlights, and full replays, you can sign up for NFL+ Premium, priced at $14.99. It's worth noting that the NFL app is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, but it is not compatible with the Apple Vision Pro. Paid - YouTube TVAs expected, YouTube TV subscribers will have access to the Big Game, too. If you've already got a YouTube TV subscription, you don't need to do anything special — just head to the FOX channel. However, if you're interested in trying out YouTube TV, you'll need to fork over $82.99. You do, however, get access to over 100 channels and unlimited DVR space. The YouTube TV app is available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Like the NFL app, YouTube TV is incompatible with the Apple Vision Pro. Paid - Hulu + Live TVAgain, if you're already paying for the Hulu + Live TV bundle, you already have access to the 2025 Super Bowl. You'll just tune in to the FOX channel when the game starts. If you don't have Hulu yet, Hulu offers a Live TV only subscription that costs $81.99 a month, making it a slightly cheaper option than YouTube TV. The downside is that it's only Live TV, and doesn't include access to any of Hulu's library of content. Image credit: HuluHowever, for $82.99, a mere dollar more, you can get Live TV, plus access to ad-supported versions of Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+. That alone makes this the smarter buy. The Hulu app is available for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. Unfortunately, Apple Vision Pro owners don't have this option. How to watch the Super Bowl on MacUnsurprisingly, there are far fewer options to watch Super Bowl LIX on your Mac. Not only are the apps listed above incompatible with macOS, but there are not a lot of places to watch it in-browser, either. Fortunately, there is one place you can watch it from your Mac: Tubi. You can head to Tubitv.com, and with a free Tubi account, stream it on your browser of choice. Alternatives to watching the 2025 Super Bowl Not everyone is going to be able to keep their eyes glued to their favorite device this Sunday, but they might still want to keep up with the Big Game. Don't worry, we've got you. If you work the kind of job where you're allowed to listen to podcasts and music, or someone who will be stuck behind the wheel during game time, you still have a great option. Image Credit: SiriusXMSiriusXM is offering live audio coverage of Super Bowl LIX. If you've already got SiriusXM, here are the following channels that will be covering the Big Game live. Super Bowl LIX Radio channel 106 Eagles announcers: Sirius 83/XM 225 Chiefs announcers: 81/XM 226 Spanish language announcers: Sirius 137/XM 227 The National Westwood One Broadcast on NFL Radio: channel 88 You can also search Super Bowl on the SiriusXM App, too. Right now, SiriusXM is offering three months for one dollar for both their App Only and In Car + App plans. After three months, the App Only plan jumps to $9.99 per month, while the In Car + App jumps to $24.98 per month. And, you can always keep an eye on the score in real-time by following the Big Game on the Apple Sports app, which is perfect for those who only need to check in occasionally.",
