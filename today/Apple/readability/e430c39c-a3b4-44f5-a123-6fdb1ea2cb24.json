  "text": "News Apple demoed how AI is giving Siri a hefty upgrade at WWDC24. Screenshot: Apple Apple might be forced to push back the launch of a new version of Apple’s Siri voice assistant with artificial intelligence features. Development is reportedly running into unexpected problems. Rather than premiere in April, the smarter Siri could be delayed several months or more. Making Siri smarter New AI features dubbed Apple Intelligence were the focus of much of the company’s WWDC24 developers conference last June. A highlight was “the start of a new era for Siri” with the digital assistant getting a range of improvements. These were always scheduled to debut in 2025, and had been expected to be part of iOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 when they launch in April. But maybe not. “Apple Inc.’s long-promised overhaul for the Siri digital assistant is facing engineering problems and software bugs, threatening to postpone or limit its release,” Bloomberg reported late on Friday, citing unnamed sources inside the company. WWDC24 attendees were wowed at a demonstration that the AI-enhanced Siri could pull information from multiple applications to answer questions. Previously, the voice assistant was up to “Turn on the kitchen light,” but last June Apple showed that the future version of Siri could handle “Send the photos from the cookout on Saturday to Malia.” However, advanced features like these are allegedly proving more challenging than expected and don’t yet work consistently. AI-infused Siri might be pushed to iOS 18.5 “Apple is considering delaying or limiting at least some of the overhaul until iOS 18.5, which will be released as early as May,” Bloomberg reported. Just so there’s no confusion, Apple never promised that the AI-enhanced Siri would be part of iOS 18.4, but information leaking from the company indicated that’s the plan. Publicly, the company was much more vague, just saying the new features will be out in 2025. But it’s already been criticized for at least a year for its slow adoption of artificial intelligence features. It needs the smarter version of Siri out as soon as possible… as long as it works, of course. The first beta of iOS 18.4 is expected soon. Maybe even next week. That might be the first look at the AI-enhanced Siri. Or not.",
