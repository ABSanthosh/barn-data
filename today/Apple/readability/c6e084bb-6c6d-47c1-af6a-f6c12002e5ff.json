  "text": "Instagram is working on an iPad app, according to a new report from The Information. Yes, you read that right: after 15 years, Instagram is finally making a dedicated app for iPad. The most deserved ‘finally’ headline ever From the report: Instagram is also working on a version of the Instagram app designed for iPads, the current employee said, which could further drive usage of Instagram. Currently, iPad users can download a version of the Instagram app designed for iPhones, which appears zoomed-in on iPads—not a good experience! The report highlights other ways Meta is looking to grow usage of Instagram as it looks to capitalize on the continued uncertainty of TikTok. Instagram has made various excuses over the years as to why it’s never made an iPad app. In 2021, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri remarked that an iPad app “would be nice to do,” but it wasn’t a priority because “there’s a lot to do and only so many people.” The following year, Mosseri doubled down and said: It’s still just not a big enough group of people to be a priority. Hoping to get to it at some point, but right now we’re very heads down on other things. I call these “finally features.” Things like supporting dark mode, scheduled posts, an iPad app, deleting one photo from a carousel, etc. Good things come to those who wait, I suppose? There’s no timeline on when Instagram will ship its iPad app, and it’s always possible it could get scrapped. It’s truly a failure of leadership that Instagram hasn’t been available on the iPad for all this time. No word on whether we’ll have to wait until 2037 to get a Threads app for iPad.
