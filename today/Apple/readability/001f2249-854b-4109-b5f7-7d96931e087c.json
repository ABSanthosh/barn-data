  "text": "According to Mark Gurman from Bloomberg, Apple has reportedly postponed a high number of iOS 19 features for a later iOS 19.4 release, meaning we potentially won’t get our hands on them until spring 2026. This isn’t out of the ordinary, and we’re already seeing Apple run this playbook with Apple Intelligence and iOS 18, with the revamped Siri not being available until iOS 18.4 next spring, despite being announced at WWDC24 alongside all of the other iOS 18 features. Gurman did not clarify what features have necessarily been delayed, but he did clarify that the features delayed are beyond just the new LLM Siri that he reported on last week: I’m told that a larger-than-usual number of features scheduled for iOS 19 (beyond the new Siri) are already postponed until spring 2026 (when iOS 19.4 debuts). As a refresher, Apple is reportedly working on a new ‘LLM Siri’ for iOS 19, which will “handle tasks in a way that’s closer to ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.” However, it won’t be out until a couple months before the unveiling of iOS 20. (Feel old yet?) Apple is expected to unveil iOS 19 at their annual developers conference, WWDC, in early June 2025. Afterwards, the first public version will ship to customers in September alongside the new release of the iPhone 17 models, which is expected to include an all new form factor – the iPhone 17 Air. What are you most looking forward to in iOS 19? Let us know in the comments.
