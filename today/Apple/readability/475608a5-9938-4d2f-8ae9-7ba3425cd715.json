  "text": "Craft is constantly adding new features to its notes and documents experience on the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Vision Pro, and web. The latest addition is integration with Readwise, a service that groups highlights from Kindle, Apple Books, and more. As part of the feature introduction, Craft is taking 50% off the lifetime price of Craft Plus plans for subscribers. If you havenâ€™t used Craft before, thereâ€™s never been a better time to give the apps a try. Craft makes first-class productivity apps with rich features like AI integration, offline support, and instant sync. Craft is free to use with reasonable limits. Serious users can unlock more features like 30-day revision history, unlimited documents, storage, and media uploads, and 10x more AI requests using higher-powered models. Perhaps the best endorsement of Craft is our favorite supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who recently turned to publishing his reports on the web using Craft. For a limited time, Craft is offering 50% off Craft Plus for as long as your subscription remains active. Just use promo code READWISE50 at checkout on any plan. Readwise is a separate service that can now instantly sync with Craft. Readwise connects to accounts including Kindle, Goodreads, Instapaper, Kobo, and many more. Once connected, Readwise syncs your book highlights and notes from these services in a single, organized catalog so your digital highlights and notes arenâ€™t scattered across different books and services. For Mac users, thereâ€™s even a tool for importing notes and highlights from Apple Books. Newly added Craft sync goes further by taking your highlights and notes captured through Readwise and bringing them into the Craft experience. From there, youâ€™re able to organize everything you capture in a single library that syncs between devices, can be viewed offline, and interfaces with AI chatbots without ever leaving the app. Check out Craft and the newly added Readwise integration today, and donâ€™t forget to use promo code READWISE50 to save 50% for life on any continuous Craft Plus membership.
