Industry rumblings of a return for the series have been floating around since shortly after the original series ended in 2022. A new report from industry site Deadline quotes Waddingham, saying the writing staff has been re-assembled. \"Our writers are literally Jedi Knights. They're just incredible,\" she said. \"And we've got like a full room of real feminist men. So we've got all the fabulous women there, and the men that are in there, and I think you really see it in the scripts ... it's just so beautifully drawn.\" Rumors began in August of 2024 when it was revealed that options on the actors' contracts had been picked up for a number of cast members by Warner Brothers. This is a standard \"in case\" move by production companies that raises the possibility of a return, but isn't considered confirmation of a continuation. Reports and rumors from October 2024 suggested that filming would begin in the first half of 2025. At the time of those reports, it was unclear if star Jason Sudeikis was going to be involved, but he has since confirmed his presence. The return was officially listed by industry site The Production List in October 2024 as a new series. Reports of re-signings of stars began in January 2025, starting with hints dropped by actor Nick Mohammed, who played assistant coach Nate Shelley in the original series. In March 2025, Sudeikis finally confirmed his involvement in an interview with the podcast New Heights. He noted that the storyline would revolve around Lasso coaching a women's soccer team, which had been hinted at in the finale of the original run. Following the podcast interview, Apple officially announced a fourth season for the show. Other series stars, including Brett Goldstein, Juno Temple and Jeremy Swift have also been confirmed to reprise their roles in Season 4. No projected debut date has yet been revealed, but the show could potentially return sometime in late 2025 or early 2026.",
