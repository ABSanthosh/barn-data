It's Friday, which means the iPhone 16e is starting to land in the hands of owners across the globe. Unsurprisingly, it didn't take too long for the first teardown video to hit YouTube. Rewa Technology has taken a crack at cracking open Apple's newest addition to its lineup. The video is short and sweet, clocking in at just under five-and-a-half minutes long, but it still gives us our first look at what makes the iPhone 16e tick. The teardown reveals that the iPhone 16e does, in fact, have a larger battery. While the iPhone 16 features a 3,561 mAh battery, the iPhone 16e's battery comes in at a notably larger 4,005 mAh. While Apple says it's redesigned the iPhone 16e boasts a new internal design that allows for a larger battery. While true, Rewa Technology points out that it's largely because of the smaller camera. Like its predecessors, the iPhone 16e features an electro-chemical adhesive that can be loosened with low-voltage electrical current. This means that when replacing the battery, users can utilize a 9-volt battery or USB-C charger to help facilitate the removal of the battery. Going deeper, we get a look at the other anticipated parts. This includes the iPhone 16e logic board, A18 chip, and Apple's brand new, in-house C1 cellular modem. Rewa notes that the A18 chip seems to be harder to remove. This isn't a issue for service providers, as the processor and motherboard are replaced as a single unit — but it could make depot-level repair more difficult. And, of course, Rewa Technology points out the iPhone 16e's lack of MagSafe, one of the more controversial moves Apple has made regarding the device.",
