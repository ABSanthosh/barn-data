Graphic: Cult of Mac iPhones are, by definition, wireless devices, but a connection via Ethernet adapter brings speed, security and reliability. Fortunately, adding a wired internet connection to your iPhone is very easy. Here’s how. This post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. Why Ethernet for iPhone An iPhone can connect to cellular networks around the world, but sometimes these are weak inside buildings. Wi-Fi usually comes to the rescue, but it’s also is prone to slowdowns and dead spots. In contrast, Ethernet is reliable and fast. And it’s more secure. Encryption can do a lot, but wireless networks are inherently less secure than wired ones. It’s more hassle, though. You might consider only turning to an Ethernet adapter for your iPhone when you’re downloading something huge. Or when doing online banking. It’s a nice option to fall back on. I go with Ethernet whenever I’m setting up a new iPhone. That’s a process that involves transferring gigabytes of data onto the handset, and goes noticeably quicker with a wired connection.  The same goes when I’m stockpiling video on my iPhone before a vacation. What equipment you need depends on whether you use a newer iPhone with a USB-C port or an older one with Lightning. There are options for both, though. For USB-C iPhones For Lightning iPhones Note that these suggestions also work for iPads and MacBooks, too. You might think about getting an Ethernet adapter to use for all your computers. Get a USB-C Ethernet adapter for your iPhone, iPad and MacBook Apple’s switch away from the Lightning port to USB-C makes adding Ethernet to your iPhone a breeze. All you need is something like the very affordable Plugable USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter. It plugs into your iPhone’s data port, then run an Ethernet cable between it and your router and you’re connected. That’s literally all it takes. It’ll even take precedence over all your other connections. You can specify network settings in the iOS Settings application, but these are optional. It’s truly plug-and-play. That product tops out at 1Gbps, or you can choose the Plugable USBC-E5000 5Gbps USB-C Ethernet Adapter. It costs more, but is potentially 5X as fast… as long as you have a very fast network to connect it to. Affordable wired internet adapter Plugable USB-C to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter 5.0 This USB-C to Ethernet adapter adds a wired Gigabit Ethernet port to your USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 systems. It offers faster and more reliable than Wi-Fi connections up to 1Gbps (10/100/1000Mbps).Its RJ45 port and USB-C connector means automatic plug-and-play installation with no additional download needed on macOS, iPadOS, iPhone 15 / Pro / Pro Max, Windows 11, Windows 10, and ChromeOS. Powered by the Realtek RTL8153 chipset for proven, best-in-class compatibilityPlus it’s small, lightweight and so perfect for travel.  Pros:Plug-and-play wired internet accessVery affordable and portable Lightning iPhones need two Apple adapters Those with a iPhone with a Lightning port can assemble their own iPhone Ethernet adapter from a couple of Apple accessories. The Apple USB Ethernet Adapter can’t be used directly with an iPhone because it connects to a USB-A port. But the Apple Lightning to USB 3 Adapter includes just the USB-A port needed. Attach one to the other, than plug them into your handset and you have an Ethernet connection. Many people already have Apple’s USB adapter because it can be used to connect external drives to the iPhone. But you might not realize it works with the Ethernet adapter too. This setup functions much the same as either of the Plugable USB-C adapters, but maxes out at 100 Mbps. And because it comes in two pieces it’s a bit more clumsy. Plus, you have to run power to the USB adapter’s Lightning port for this combination to work with the iPhone. Still, it’s a reliable, secure connection. The Apple USB Ethernet Adapter is $29. The Apple Lightning to USB 3 Adapter is $39, but is currently on sale for less!",
