  "description": "Macworld Wondering if AirPods will be on sale for Amazon’s October Prime Big Deal Days? Whether you’re buying your first pair of AirPods or upgrading the trusty ‘buds you have used every day for years, Amazon’s twice-yearly Prime Day sales are a great time to look for a discount. Many Apple products are rarely on sale, and when they do go on sale they’re barely at a discount at all. AirPods are an exception: As long as they’re not a just-released model, they’re almost always available at a discount from the official retail price. And when big sales events come around, like Prime Day or Black Friday, you can often save 25 percent or more. Amazon is one of the best places to look for AirPods deals, and we are already seeing some excellent discounts during the Prime Day event which runs from October 8 to midnight on October 9. We’ll keep this article updated throughout Prime Day so you can quickly find the best deal. The AirPods picked here are all chosen by our editors, who have decades of experience with Apple devices. We’ve reviewed everything we recommend and we won’t tell you to buy something that’s not an actual deal. The products below are all at or near all-time lows, and we’ve selected what we think is the best configuration for each product type. We know Apple is expensive, so we’ve chosen products at prices we would be willing to pay, so you can trust that our recommendations will steer you in the right direction—and save you big bucks. For all the best Prime Day deals on Apple products see our round-up of the best Prime Day Apple deals.
