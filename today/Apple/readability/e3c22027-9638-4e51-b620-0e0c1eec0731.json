  "text": "MacOS Tahoe 26 is here, and right from the start you can see the difference with the all new Liquid Glass interface appearance and styling, with it’s heavy use of translucency, shiny icons and buttons, and all around revamped appearance. Of course MacOS Tahoe is much more than skin deep though, and there’s many new features and even some new apps coming to the Mac too, including actions in Spotlight, the Phone app comes to the Mac with access to voicemail and more, the Journal app for Mac, enhancements to Apple Intelligence, Live Translation, backgrounds in Messages, polls in Messages group chat, the new Games app, and much more. With all of these new improvements, visual changes, and new features, it’s no wonder why Mac users are intrigued by MacOS Tahoe 26, which leaves the next obvious question; can your Mac run MacOS Tahoe 26? Let’s dive into that and review system requirements and the list of compatible Macs. MacOS Tahoe 26 Compatible Macs List MacOS Tahoe 26 is compatible with every Apple Silicon Mac, and a few Intel Macs too. Here’s the complete list of supported Macs for Tahoe, courtesy of Apple: MacBook Air with Apple silicon (2020 and later) MacBook Pro with Apple silicon (2020 and later) MacBook Pro (Intel, 16‑inch, 2019) MacBook Pro (Intel, 13‑inch, 2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports) iMac (All models from 2020 and later) Mac mini (All models from 2020 and later) Mac Studio (All models from 2022 and later) Mac Pro (All models from 2019 and later) This list comes directly from Apple via their MacOS Tahoe preview page, so you can be sure it’s accurate. As you can see, the majority of Macs supported are modern Mac hardware with Apple Silicon chips, including the M1, M2, M3, M4 series. There are a few Intel Macs that are supported, but they’re dwindling, and there’s a reason for that, which we’ll touch on more in a moment. MacOS Tahoe 26 System Requirements Aside from having a compatible Mac, of which every Apple Silicon Mac fits the bill, and a few late-model Intel Macs too, you will need to meet a few basic system requirements. You will need at least 50 GB of free disk space available to be able to install MacOS Tahoe 26. That might seem like a lot, but that’s not because Tahoe itself will consume that much disk capacity. Instead, the storage requirement is partially because of temporary files, including the installer itself, which is around 17 GB alone. You will also need an active internet connection, so that you can download Tahoe and install it onto the Mac. You can also download MacOS Tahoe 26 full installers and IPSW files from here, if need be. MacOS Tahoe 26 is the last major MacOS release to support Intel Macs This is worth pointing out specifically, but MacOS Tahoe 26 is the last major new MacOS release that will support Intel Macs. This means that there’s basically 2-3 more years of software updates for Intel Macs after the release of MacOS Tahoe 26, and then the Intel Mac hardware will become deprecated. Fortunately, Apple Silicon Macs are incredibly powerful with excellent features and battery life, and are available at some pretty impressive price points (notably the speedy MacBook Air series), so upgrading from an Intel Mac to an Apple Silicon Mac is a worthwhile endeavor when the time comes for those with Intel hardware.",
