Let customers speak for us from 77 reviews Great Subscription Service Makes my coffee routine really easy these days! Great coffee when I need it and very fast shipping. Delicious! I’ve made some really awesome lattes with this blend and it’s been soo perfect as my afternoon cup! Mellow! I found that this coffee lends itself towards a sweeter profile, or maybe that’s just a result of my brewing (I do French press daily) but I haven’t had any complaints about that. Either way, it’s a very tasty coffee! I enjoy very much the Roaster’s Choice subscription Every week, I receive different coffee and it is always surprise but a good one! This time, I got coffee from Ethiopia. Very fruity and clean taste. I didn’t choose, but roast master chose very well. I feel I can trust his selection. He understands good coffee. I look forward to next week already. Thank you very much! - Onoda Fukui Lovely Light Roast As a coffee drinker who’s looking to cut back on caffeine…but always running into the problem of decaf that just doesn’t taste so great, Dekaf has been a gem. I ordered a few origins that seemed to fit my coffee taste and while all are delicious, this Ethiopia is a true standout. Well-Balanced and Smooth I enjoyed this coffee very much. It’s a great offering, and if you like it, you’ll love their Ethiopia. Happy Dekaf Customer/Light-Medium Roast Reviewing my third coffee from my order and I’m giving all five stars because they’re well-deserved. I tried two single origins (Ethiopia and Costa Rica) and this blend here. I highly recommend these options for anyone looking for a light or medium that leans to light roast. These are splendid. Get your decaf fix without compromising the flavor I was pleasantly surprised at how well the flavor held up. With all the different types of decaf coffees I’ve tried in the past, I’d basically just come to terms that a mediocre taste is just part of what comes with the tradeoff but Dekaf has given me a bit of hope with a near-identical taste to a normal [caffeinated] cup of coffee. Definitely a great idea if you’re like me and like to put on a pot of coffee to nurse throughout the morning/early afternoon. You can drink a bunch of it up, get the full taste of a wonderful roast, and don’t have to worry about feeling like your heart is going to launch out of orbit. Nice Bold Coffee (Again) I ordered two coffee origins to try. The other is the dark roast from Dekaf and I’m happy with both of my picks. In comparison, this is a nice balance for when I still want a bold cup but lighter on the roast. Nice Bold Coffee This is a wonderful dark roast decaf. Sometimes when I’ve had dark roasted decaf from other roasters, the flavor gets a little lost…not here though. Very pleased with my purchase. Second Purchase I tried the Dekaf Brazil early on and loved it. This Colombia is just as good. Super Duper Decaf The coffee is as the title says and I’ll be back for more! Great Start The coffees I’ve received in my subscription have so far all been spectacular. This is a fun option for those looking to explore different kinds of coffees without being burdened by making decisions between so many choices. I’m really looking forward to my next order. Wow! It’s hard enough to find good decaf…but a good decaf Papua??? Almost unheard of. This has been a great find for me. The coffee is VERY flavorful. Nothing short of the Papua I used to drink when the body could handle the caffeine. An Excellent Experience If you had coffee questions like I did, know that the team behind Dekaf is dedicated to great service. There's a lot to choose from and that's uncommon in my decaf experience...not a complaint! The staff kindly guided me based on my preferences to their Mexico offering and I couldn't be happier. All around great experience. These guys are going above and beyond...both in coffee and in customer service! Some might say the latter is a make or break in business, but I don't think they're gonna have to worry about that. Thanks again! DEKÁF'S BEST SELLERS",
