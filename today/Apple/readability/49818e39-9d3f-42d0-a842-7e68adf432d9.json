  "text": "More than a year ago, WhatsApp began testing a new feature for transcribing audio messages into text. The feature was only available to beta users, but starting today, everyone can benefit from voice message transcripts on WhatsApp. WhatsApp can now transcribe voice messages With this feature, the app identifies what is said in voice messages and turns it into text, so that users can read the content of the messages without having to play the audio – which is useful in situations where you can’t listen to audio messages. According to Meta, all transcriptions are processed on-device after the audio message is downloaded. “Sending a voice message makes connecting with friends and family even more personal. There’s something special about hearing your loved one’s voice even when you’re far away. Though sometimes, you’re on the move, in a loud place, or you receive a long voice message that you just can’t stop and listen,” the company said in a blog post. It’s worth noting that only a small number of languages are currently supported. Audio transcripts on WhatsApp are only available in English, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian. Meta says the feature is being rolled out globally and should be available to everyone “over the coming weeks.” When it comes to Apple, the company added a similar feature to iMessage last year with iOS 17. However, Apple’s messaging platform is capable of transcribing audio in dozens of languages. WhatsApp for iPhone and Mac is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed in order to get access to the new features.
