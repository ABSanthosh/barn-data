  "description": "Macworld When Apple unveiled the four new iPhone models last fall, it quickly became apparent that there were fewer differences between the standard and Pro models than had been the case in previous years. Some Pro fans, indeed, were so impressed by the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus that they decided to save money and pick the cheaper option. There are benefits to going Pro, of course, and one of these concerns the display. The 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have slightly larger screens than their non-Pro equivalents with slightly narrower bezels around the edge, but more importantly, they are better specced: As has been the case since the iPhone 13, they are equipped with ProMotion and can dynamically increase their refresh rate up to 120Hz, whereas the standard screens are capped at 60Hz. (The Pro handsets also come with always-on displays, which is a related benefit: ProMotion enables the phone to conserve battery life by dramatically lowering the refresh rate when performing operations that don’t require a high refresh rate.) If the latest report is accurate, however, the Pro phones may soon lose this perk–not in the sense of having it taken away, but in it being given to the cheaper handsets as well. A new rumor claims all four iPhone 17 models will get screens with higher refresh rates, which almost certainly refers to a ProMotion upgrade. The leak (via MacRumors) comes originally from Digital Chat Station on the Chinese social media site Weibo, and while Weibo can sometimes be a dubious source of intel this particular user has a track record; as MacRumors notes, they made accurate predictions about a few features and design elements of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 15 ahead of those launches. What’s more, the claim both makes sense and fits what we’ve heard so far about the late-2025 iPhones. As early as February 2024 we were hearing tips that the entire iPhone 17 range would be fitted with LTPO displays; that’s the screen tech, in contrast to LTPS on the non-Pro iPhones, which enables ProMotion, and likely means we can also expect always-on displays across the board next fall. But this does leave Apple in a tricky position. How will it differentiate the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max from their more affordable siblings? Early signs hint at a new part-aluminum, part-glass design (the top half will be aluminum and the bottom glass, apparently) and a redesigned camera bump, but customers will need to see more than that if they’re to spring for those models’ premium price tags. For all the latest news and rumors, check our regularly updated iPhone 17 superguide. But if you can’t wait that long for a new handset, pick up a bargain on the current range with our roundup of the best iPhone deals.",
