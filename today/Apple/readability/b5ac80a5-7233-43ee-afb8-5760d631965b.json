  "description": "Macworld Kids love iPads. The simplicity of tapping on the screen when they want things to happen means they can learn to use them in seconds, but there’s plenty that Apple’s tablets can do. Whether it’s educational games, entertainment apps, using them to create art with an Apple Pencil or just something to stop them getting bored on car journeys, iPads can be a godsend. Choosing the right one can feel a bit daunting. After all, don’t they all do the same things? What’s the difference between the normal iPad and the iPad Air? Well, we’re here to simplify things so you can be sure you’re buying the right one. You can also read our best iPhone and iPad apps for kids guide to get them off to a good start. Plus, we have a roundup of the best iPhones for kids if you want to immerse them fully in the Apple world as they grow up. Should I get an iPad for my child? There’s been lots of research published about how much screen time our kids should be allowed. Some parents might argue that kids shouldn’t be exposed to screens at such a young age, but frankly, in a world where everything is dominated by technology we think that we owe it to our kids to make sure they are comfortable in that environment, hence the introduction of an iPad is good for their education. That said, just sticking them in front of an iPad rather than interacting with them probably isn’t great: Disney+ shouldn’t really be babysitting your kids for hours on end, but if it allows you a few minutes of peace to make dinner then fair enough. With that out of the way, there are many reasons why you should be confident about getting an iPad for your kids to use. There are, after all, many other tablets on the market, most of which are cheaper than the iPad. So, if you are looking for some reassurance on is whether the iPad is the best option for your child, here are a few compelling reasons: The App Store is full of great apps designed specifically for kids. Many of those apps will be ideal for school children of various ages, or even toddlers. There is an ecosystem of great accessories designed to work with the iPad. iPadOS is easy to use, especially if your child has used your iPhone. The bonus is your iPhone apps will be available on your iPad too and vice versa. If you have older children, then take a look at our guide to the best iPads for students. What iPads are there to choose from? At the time of writing, Apple offers four categories of iPad, which are as follows. iPad iPad mini iPad Air iPad Pro In all honesty, we wouldn’t recommend the iPad Pros for children, as you’d just be paying quite sizeable amounts for performance and compatibility features that they just won’t need. The standard iPad and iPad mini range offer plenty of scope and power for younger users, and the iPad Air will satisfy the more demanding teen. Our advice is to stick with those and ignore the Pros. When it comes to older students though, it’s a potentially different argument, but the good news is you can put that off for a few years and save up for the more expensive iPad in the meantime.  Speaking of savings, check out our round-up of the best iPad deals you can get on the whole range of iPads here: The best iPad deals. Is 64GB enough? This depends on how you want to use the iPad. For long trips, you might want to download lots of movies, TV shows, or games to entertain the kids in the car or on the plane. In that case, more storage is better. Otherwise, any apps you purchase can always be deleted and then downloaded again, plus public Wi-Fi can often be available as an easy solution for the little ones streaming a few episodes of their favorite shows. Our advice would be to get more than 64GB storage if you can. The iPad mini (A17 Pro) that launched in October 2024 starts at 128GB storage now, rather than 64GB as it did before, and as the standard iPad still does. If you compare the standard iPad with 64GB for $349/£329 to the 128GB iPad mini which costs $499/£499, it’s well worth spending $150/£150 more to get the extra storage and everything else the mini offers. And if you want even more storage, the iPad mini with 256GB costs $599/£599 compared to $499/£479 for the 256GB iPad. If you are buying a refurbished or used iPad, then we’d strongly advise against a 32GB or lower, it simply isn’t enough storage and you will regret it. For more advice regarding buying a used or refurbished iPad read: Why a refurbished iPad could be the best tablet for you. Do I need cellular? Probably not. It adds $150/£150 to the price of the iPad and we’d suggest that money was better spent on upgrading the storage, or getting a better model. If you want to add cellular capabilities to your kids’ iPad, we recommend that when you are outside the house you hotspot from your own iPhone rather than spend money on a contract for your child. That said, most apps will work offline and you can download movies to the device when heading on a long trip.

The only negative is the price, which is a little higher than the bigger iPad, so it’s not quite as much of a bargain for kids. The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display is gorgeous. Like all the modern iPads, there is no Home button – Apple ditched that a generation ago and instead put a Touch ID sensor in the Power button on the side.  Under the hood, there’s an A17 Pro driving things, this processor is the lowest spec required to run Apple Intelligence features. If you are choosing between the iPad mini and cheaper iPad and are curious about Apple Intelligence, only the iPad mini, iPad Air and Pro will support it). Even if Apple Intelligence doesn’t peek your interest, the A17 Pro chip means there is no lack of power in this smaller iPad, ensuring the latest games and apps will absolutely fly on this device. It also has support for the Apple Pencil (USB C) or the Apple Pencil Pro, meaning your child can use if for doodling, creating art or note-taking at school when they get a bit older.  The compact dimensions of 195.4mm x 134.8mm x 6.3mm at 297g make it small and lightweight, which can be easier for little ones to hold. There are also four different colors to choose from, including soft shades of Purple and Blue.  Oh, and there are 5G versions if you want to add a fast data connection for streaming and messaging on the go.  The iPad mini is available in these configurations: iPad mini (A17 Pro) 128GB – $499/£499 iPad mini (A17 Pro) 256GB – $599/£599 iPad mini (A17 Pro) 512GB – $799/£799 iPad mini (A17 Pro, cellular) costs $150/£150 more than the non-cellular versions.

For some there will be a lot of appear in the 11-inch iPad Air (M2), with its 11-inch display, modern design, low weight (462g), great cameras, and hugely powerful processor, and as we recommend in our round up of the Best iPads for Students – it is a great choice for students. Unfortunately, it’s a bit on the pricey side, starting at $599/£599 (higher education students get a discount but not school aged children). That’s still only $100/£100 more than the iPad mini though, and it has a lot more to offer. Not least the M2 chip than makes it the perfect combination of power, storage and features. The M2 processor is the same chip that powered the previous generation of iPad Pro models, not to mention several Macs. If your kid enjoys gaming on their iPad then the iPad Air will likely meet their needs (for anyone else then there’s always the iPad Pro, which has an M4 and the addition of ProMotion for faster screen refreshes, but that really is overkill for kids!) The camera is a 12MP Wide lens (also like on the iPad Pro) and the front-facing camera is a 12MP Ultra-Wide that is positioned on the longer side of the chassis to allow landscape views during FaceTime calls. There are some nice colors to choose from including pale Purple and Blue shades (that are similar to those on the iPad mini). There’s also the standard Starlight and Space Grey. You can use the Apple Pencil Pro ($129/£129) and Apple Pencil USB-C ($79/£79) with the iPad Air. See: Apple Pencils compared: Which Apple Pencil works with your iPad? The iPad Air (M2) is available in these configurations: 11-inch iPad Air (M2) 128GB – $599/£599 11-inch iPad Air (M2) 256GB – $699/£699 11-inch iPad Air (M2) 512GB – $899/£899 11-inch iPad Air (M2) 1TB – $1,099/£1,099 11-inch iPad Air (M2), cellular) costs $150/£150 more than the non-cellular versions.

There is still Touch ID available, but now you’ll find the sensor embedded in the power button on the top edge. This means there’s more space for the display, which increases from the 10.2-inch panel in the 9th generation iPad to 10.9-inch in this 10th generation model. As with the previous standard iPad models, the display isn’t laminated, meaning there is a slight air gap between the glass and the display beneath. This is a minor thing and probably won’t even be something you notice, unless you use an Apple Pencil often, in which case you’ll probably experience a slight lag as you write. It’s all good though, and after no time at all, you’ll be able to incorporate that into your technique and scribble away with the best of them. This model supports the 1st generation Apple Pencil or the Apple Pencil (USB C). Apple fits the 10th-gen iPad with an A14 Bionic processor, which is the same tech that powered the iPhone 12 range (including the Pros). That processor is a little on the old side now, and doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, of which Apple is making a big deal right now. Apple Intelligence has some features that might appeal to students, so it could be a benefit, then again it might lead your child to cheat on their homework… That said, the A14 chip will still provide adequate performance for playing basic games, streaming content, and running educational apps. Another notable feature is the inclusion of a USB-C port rather than Lightning. This opens up a world of peripherals that you can use with the iPad, and you can even connect it to a compatible monitor if your child needs a desktop-style experience. Of course, you can always pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to create the perfect, compact laptop for homework and any creative endeavors your child wants to try. The iPad comes in four bright, bold colors (Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Silver), so your child can pick one that reflects their personality or just the one with the hues they like the most. One of the best features of the 10th generation iPad is its low price. You can pick them up for the following prices: iPad (10th gen) 64GB – $349/£329 iPad (10th gen) 256GB – $499/£479 iPad (10th gen, cellular) costs $150/£150 more than the non-cellular versions. We recommend opting for the 256GB storage variant, as 64GB can fill up pretty quickly if you’re downloading games, large apps, or TV/movie content. At this point you might be better served by the iPad mini (A17 Pro) 128GB at $499/£499 though, which is why this iPad isn’t our top choice right now, but that may change when Apple gets around to updating it in 2025.

The simplicity of tapping on the screen when they want things to happen means they can learn to use them in seconds, but there’s plenty that Apple’s tablets can do. Whether it’s educational games, entertainment apps, using them to create art with an Apple Pencil or just something to stop them getting bored on car journeys, iPads can be a godsend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eChoosing the right one can feel a bit daunting. After all, don’t they all do the same things? What’s the difference between the normal iPad and the iPad Air?

Some parents might argue that kids shouldn’t be exposed to screens at such a young age, but frankly, in a world where everything is dominated by technology we think that we owe it to our kids to make sure they are comfortable in that environment, hence the introduction of an iPad is good for their education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, just sticking them in front of an iPad rather than interacting with them probably isn’t great: Disney+ shouldn’t really be babysitting your kids for hours on end, but if it allows you a few minutes of peace to make dinner then fair enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that out of the way, there are many reasons why you should be confident about getting an iPad for your kids to use. There are, after all, many other tablets on the market, most of which are cheaper than the iPad.

The standard iPad and iPad mini range offer plenty of scope and power for younger users, and the iPad Air will satisfy the more demanding teen. Our advice is to stick with those and ignore the Pros. When it comes to older students though, it’s a potentially different argument, but the good news is you can put that off for a few years and save up for the more expensive iPad in the meantime. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of savings, check out our round-up of the best iPad deals you can get on the whole range of iPads here:  \u003ca title=\"The best iPad deals\" rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672807/crazy-ipad-deals-for-april-2022.html\"\u003eThe best iPad deals\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"is-64gb-enough\"\u003eIs 64GB enough? \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis depends on how you want to use the iPad. For long trips, you might want to download lots of movies, TV shows, or games to entertain the kids in the car or on the plane. In that case, more storage is better. Otherwise, any apps you purchase can always be deleted and then downloaded again, plus public Wi-Fi can often be available as an easy solution for the little ones streaming a few episodes of their favorite shows.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur advice would be to get more than 64GB storage if you can. The iPad mini (A17 Pro) that launched in October 2024 starts at 128GB storage now, rather than 64GB as it did before, and as the standard iPad still does. If you compare the standard iPad with 64GB for $349/£329 to the 128GB iPad mini which costs $499/£499, it’s well worth spending $150/£150 more to get the extra storage and everything else the mini offers. And if you want even more storage, the iPad mini with 256GB costs $599/£599 compared to $499/£479 for the 256GB iPad. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are buying a refurbished or used iPad, then we’d strongly advise against a 32GB or lower, it simply isn’t enough storage and you will regret it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor more advice regarding buying a used or refurbished iPad read: \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670633/where-buy-refurbished-ipad.html\"\u003eWhy a refurbished iPad could be the best tablet for you.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"do-i-need-cellular\"\u003eDo I need cellular?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not.

There is still Touch ID available, but now you’ll find the sensor embedded in the power button on the top edge. This means there’s more space for the display, which increases from the 10.2-inch panel in the 9th generation iPad to 10.9-inch in this 10th generation model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs with the previous standard iPad models, the display isn’t laminated, meaning there is a slight air gap between the glass and the display beneath. This is a minor thing and probably won’t even be something you notice, unless you use an Apple Pencil often, in which case you’ll probably experience a slight lag as you write. It’s all good though, and after no time at all, you’ll be able to incorporate that into your technique and scribble away with the best of them. This model supports the 1st generation Apple Pencil or the Apple Pencil (USB C).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple fits the 10th-gen iPad with an A14 Bionic processor, which is the same tech that powered the iPhone 12 range (including the Pros). That processor is a little on the old side now, and doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, of which Apple is making a big deal right now. \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2542840/5-apple-intelligence-features-every-student-should-know-about.html\"\u003eApple Intelligence has some features that might appeal to students\u003c/a\u003e, so it could be a benefit, then again it might lead your child to cheat on their homework… \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, the A14 chip will still provide adequate performance for playing basic games, streaming content, and running educational apps. Another notable feature is the inclusion of a USB-C port rather than Lightning. This opens up a world of peripherals that you can use with the iPad, and you can even connect it to a compatible monitor if your child needs a desktop-style experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, you can always pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to create the perfect, compact laptop for homework and any creative endeavors your child wants to try. The iPad comes in four bright, bold colors (Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Silver), so your child can pick one that reflects their personality or just the one with the hues they like the most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best features of the 10th generation iPad is its low price.

At this point you might be better served by the iPad mini (A17 Pro) 128GB at $499/£499 though, which is why this iPad isn’t our top choice right now, but that may change when Apple gets around to updating it in 2025.
