The latter app premiered in June with a live Apple exec interview in 3D to mark the occasion. Today Theater 2 has landed, and with it comes the best new thing I‚Äôve experienced on Apple Vision Pro. Both Theater and Television are products of Sandwich Vision, which includes Adam Lisagor, Andy Roth, Jose Marquez, and Dan Sturm. Theater 2 arrives with an awesome introduction by Adam: Proudly launching Theater 2.0 today. Brand new theaters, lots of content, a Planetarium, Plex Media Server, new design and this launch video I made for zero dollars.Install it today on your Apple Vision Pro and escape to an oasis of pure cinema enjoyment. pic.twitter.com/BycgkYSm7R‚Äî Adam Lisagor (@adamlisagor) December 23, 2024 So there you have it. Theater 2 already streamed YouTube. Now it can stream content from your personal Plex Media Server. Sure beats the visionOS Plex app that doesn‚Äôt exist yet. And my favorite new experience: the planetarium theater. Talk about a transportive experience. My home office instantly became the same theater I enjoyed in school field trips two decades ago. Earlier this month, Sandwich Vision announced an exclusive partnership with Reef Distribution to bring exactly the kind of video a planetarium deserves on Apple Vision Pro: Starting December 20, 2024, users of Sandwich Vision‚Äôs Theater app, available on the Apple App Store, will have access to a curated selection of the best fulldome films distributed by Reef Distribution. This partnership marks a significant step forward in delivering ‚Äúemotional edutainment‚Äù experiences directly to the public, transforming how audiences engage with big-screen storytelling through the advanced Vision Pro platform. Reef Distribution, with over 20 years of experience, has been a pioneer in supplying innovative content to planetariums, fulldome theaters, IMAX¬Æ \u0026 Giant Screen theaters, museums, entertainment parks, zoos, and aquariums. ‚ÄúOur mission is to contribute to a better world through education,‚Äù says Dr. Peter Popp, CEO of Reef Distribution. ‚ÄúWe love shows that share a compelling message and make a positive impact on the audience while also being entertaining.‚Äù Theater was already a must-have app for Apple Vision Pro. Theater 2.0 gives movie watchers and virtual concert attendees even more reason to love it. Learn more and check it out at sandwich.vision today.
