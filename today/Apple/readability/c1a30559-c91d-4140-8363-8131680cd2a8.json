With iPadOS 18, Calculator comes to iPad with Math Notes, along with new Smart Script handwriting tools in Notes — all designed for Apple Pencil. Additionally, iPad users now have more ways to customize the Home Screen and Control Center, and users receive the biggest redesign of the Photos app ever, new ways to express themselves in Messages, and so much more. Starting next month, iPadOS 18 running on iPad with M1 and later will mark the introduction of Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant for iPad users, unlocking new ways for users to enhance their writing, communicate more effectively, and express themselves.1 Calculator on iPad Delivers a New Way to Solve with Math Notes Designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, Calculator delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions, as well as basic and scientific calculators with a new history function and unit conversions. With Math Notes, users are now able to type mathematical expressions or write them out to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. They can also create and use variables, and add an equation to insert a graph. Users can access their Math Notes in the Notes app, and use all of the math functionality in any of their other notes. With Math Notes, users are now able to type mathematical expressions or write them out to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. More Flexible Handwritten Notes with Smart Script Handwritten notes become more fluid, flexible, and easy to read with Smart Script and the power of Apple Pencil. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting — making editing handwritten text just as simple and flexible as editing typed text. Users can even scratch out handwritten text to delete it. Smart Script also maintains the look and feel of a user’s personal handwriting, automatically refining it in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting. More Ways to Customize iPad In iPadOS 18, users can customize their Home Screen in exciting new ways by placing app icons and widgets in any open position to frame the wallpaper or create the ideal layout on each page. App icons can be customized to appear light, dark, with a tint, and larger for a new streamlined look that removes the name underneath. And Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, with new levels of customization, delivering quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls. Additionally, users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center, and developers can take advantage of the new Controls API to let their users accomplish even more tasks, like quickly starting a virtual meeting or kicking off a livestream for their followers. iPad Pro (11-inch) shows app icons on the Home Screen arranged around a photo and customized with a blue tint. iPad Pro (11-inch) shows customization in Control Center. App icons can now be customized to appear light, dark, with a tint, and larger for a new streamlined look that removes the name underneath. Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day. A Redesigned Photos App to Relive Special Moments The Photos app receives its biggest update ever, bringing users powerful new tools that make it easier to find what they are looking for. A simplified and customizable app layout takes advantage of the larger display on iPad and helps users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Photos uses on-device machine learning to automatically organize a library by helpful topics, like people and pets, recent days, trips, and even documents and receipts. In the redesigned Photos app, a simplified and customizable app layout takes advantage of the larger display on iPad, and helps users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. New Ways to Stay Connected in Messages iPadOS 18 brings users new ways to stay connected and expressive in Messages, with all-new animated text effects, redesigned Tapbacks that expand to include any emoji or sticker, and new text formatting options, including bold, underline, and italics. Messages also introduces the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time, helping users stay fully in control of when and how they are communicating with their contacts. Messages introduces the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time. New Privacy Controls With new privacy controls, iPadOS 18 gives users even more ways to control who can see their apps, how they share their contacts, and how their iPad connects to accessories. Users can now lock an app; and for additional privacy, they can hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system. A New Tab Bar Brings Easier Navigation A redesigned tab bar floats above app content, making it easier to navigate and keeping content edge to edge. The tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar when users want to dive deeper into an app’s full functionality, seen with apps including Apple TV, News, Books, and Fitness. Users will also enjoy refined animations that make apps feel even more fluid and responsive, as well as an updated document browser that gives apps a distinct look and feel when accessing documents in apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Swift Playgrounds. The redesigned tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar when users want to dive deeper into an app’s full functionality, seen with apps including Apple TV, News, Books, and Fitness. Apple Intelligence Makes iPad Even More Useful and Delightful Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iPadOS 18 on iPad with M1 and later, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security. Apple Intelligence powers experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them. With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPad. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description; and with the new Clean Up tool, they can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject. iPad Pro (11-inch) shows a summary of handwritten notes about teaching holistic health. iPad Pro (11-inch) shows Siri searching for a book recommendation in Messages and Mail, with a glowing light wrapping around the edge of the screen. With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. Apple Intelligence is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. Private Cloud Compute marks a fundamental breakthrough in server-based intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts have access to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in beta for iPad users next month as part of iPadOS 18.1, with more features rolling out later this year and in the months following. Apple Intelligence first launches in U.S. English, and will quickly expand to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December, with additional language support — such as Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish — coming next year. New Hearing Health Features Come to iPadOS 18 and iOS 18 Later this fall, AirPods Pro 2 add a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Based on results from an intuitive, clinically validated Hearing Test that users can take from the comfort of their own home using AirPods Pro 2 and a compatible iPhone or iPad, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a personalized Hearing Aid set to meet the specific needs of the user, making access to hearing assistance easier than ever as a free software update.2 iPadOS 18 is available for iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later), iPad Air (M2), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (7th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).

Additionally, users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center, and developers can take advantage of the new Controls API to let their users accomplish even more tasks, like quickly starting a virtual meeting or kicking off a livestream for their followers.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"ipad-customization\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-eaabe9087fccc2e02f27e4a3e8aef5e2\" href=\"#gallery-eaabe9087fccc2e02f27e4a3e8aef5e2\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-eaabe9087fccc2e02f27e4a3e8aef5e2\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eiPad Pro (11-inch) shows app icons on the Home Screen arranged around a photo and customized with a blue tint.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-cacbb5d5c5e480583a60c4b6c6fa3cce\" href=\"#gallery-cacbb5d5c5e480583a60c4b6c6fa3cce\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-cacbb5d5c5e480583a60c4b6c6fa3cce\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eiPad Pro (11-inch) shows customization in Control Center.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-eaabe9087fccc2e02f27e4a3e8aef5e2\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-eaabe9087fccc2e02f27e4a3e8aef5e2\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:home-screen\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eApp icons can now be customized to appear light, dark, with a tint, and larger for a new streamlined look that removes the name underneath.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2024/09/ipados-18-is-now-available-taking-ipad-to-the-next-level/article/Apple-iPadOS-18-customize-Home-Screen.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -

With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPad. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description; and with the new Clean Up tool, they can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"apple-intelligence-features\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-0551543c92282adae0d4cfae6a24a06c\" href=\"#gallery-0551543c92282adae0d4cfae6a24a06c\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-0551543c92282adae0d4cfae6a24a06c\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eiPad Pro (11-inch) shows a summary of handwritten notes about teaching holistic health.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-7a66ae1ee2b3189a17564a708e721a95\" href=\"#gallery-7a66ae1ee2b3189a17564a708e721a95\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-7a66ae1ee2b3189a17564a708e721a95\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eiPad Pro (11-inch) shows Siri searching for a book recommendation in Messages and Mail, with a glowing light wrapping around the edge of the screen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-0551543c92282adae0d4cfae6a24a06c\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-0551543c92282adae0d4cfae6a24a06c\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:writing-tools\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eWith Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2024/09/ipados-18-is-now-available-taking-ipad-to-the-next-level/article/Apple-iPadOS-18-summarize-notes.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -

A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. Private Cloud Compute marks a fundamental breakthrough in server-based intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts have access to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eThe first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in beta for iPad users next month as part of iPadOS 18.1, with more features rolling out later this year and in the months following.
