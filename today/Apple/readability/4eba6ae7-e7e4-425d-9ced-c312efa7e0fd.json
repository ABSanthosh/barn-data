  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Focus is a unique pomodoro timer app for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro that makes it easy to stay focused and develop productive working habits. If you have a procrastination problem, this could be an excellent tool for keeping you on pace. It recently got a new update with a redesign, deeper customization, and additional data with new charts/graphs – making it even more useful. Top features For one, Focus breaks down larger tasks into segments called “Focus Sessions.” This keeps you stay focused for a shorter period of time, and encourages breaks in between. This reduces stress and maintains overall energy. On top of that, the app features a clean to do list, making it easy to keep track of all of your tasks. To bring everything together, the app also monitors your progress and shows you how you’ve been doing. It’s a little nudge to keep you motivated. The app also features widgets, lock screen controls, live activities, and more. Staying productive is hard, but Focus wants to make it easier for you. Download Focus Focus is available for free on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro on devices running iOS 17 or later. For the full experience, you can purchase Focus Pro for $4.99/month or $39.99/year. The annual option offers a 1 week free trial.
