  "text": "A week after releasing iOS 18.3 to the public, Apple has now stopped signing iOS 18.2.1. For users, this means that they can no longer downgrade to this version of the operating system if their iPhone or iPad is already running a newer version. Apple blocks downgrade from iOS 18.3 to iOS 18.2.1 iOS 18.2.1 was released on January 6 with “important bug fixes” – but Apple didn’t detail what exactly was fixed. As for iOS 18.3, which was released on January 27, the update brings some improvements to Apple Intelligence features, as well as multiple security patches. For instance, iOS 18.3 fixes a security breach in AirPlay that allowed attackers to cause an “unexpected system termination or corrupt process memory” over the local network. Another exploit could lead attackers to unexpectedly terminate apps. It’s important to keep your devices updated so that they always have the latest security patches. Unfortunately, if you’re experiencing any issues after updating to iOS 18.3, there’s no longer an option to go back to iOS 18.2.1. When Apple stops signing a specific version of iOS, it can no longer be installed on iPhones and iPads. The company does this to prevent users from reverting to older versions of the operating system, which are exposed to security breaches that have already been fixed by the company. The downgrade process is also often used for jailbreak purposes – another reason for Apple to stop signing old iOS builds. Of course, if you haven’t yet updated your device to iOS 18.3, you can do so by going to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update.
