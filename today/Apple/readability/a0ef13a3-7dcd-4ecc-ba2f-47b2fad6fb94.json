  "text": "Credit: Majin Bu Many details of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max have already leaked, but little has been shared about Apple’s expected color options. Today, leaker Majin Bu has posted that Sky Blue may be on its way. iPhone 17 Pro in Sky Blue could follow M4 MacBook Air debut Majin Bu writes on his website: sources close to the supply chain confirm that several iPhone 17 Pro prototypes have been made in various colors, with Sky Blue currently the frontrunner. In prototypes, it reportedly looks even more stunning than the much-loved Sierra Blue of the iPhone 13 Pro, with a brightness and refinement that make it irresistible. Unless Apple changes course at the last minute, this will be the star of the September 2025 launch event. Bu has reported several Apple leaks reliably, especially recently—though his track record isn’t perfect. Sky Blue coming to the iPhone 17 Pro would be especially interesting in the same year it debuted on the M4 MacBook Air. I can’t recall Apple launching a special color on the Mac then the iPhone in the same year. That said, if Sky Blue has proven a hit on the MacBook Air, new iPhones could provide the perfect opportunity to capitalize on that popularity. Apple typically offers the same few standard variants of gray with its iPhone Pro line, with a single color that changes out each year. Last year that color was Desert Titanium. I’d love to see the iPhone 17 Pro come in Sky Blue. But as Bu notes, it’s still perhaps too early to know with much certainty what Apple’s special color of the year will be.
