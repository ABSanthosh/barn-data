  "text": "Alex Heath is a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He has been reporting on the tech industry for more than a decade.Moments after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s all-hands comments to employees were widely leaked, a company executive warned in an internal memo that leakers will be fired.“We take leaks seriously and will take action,” Meta’s chief information security officer, Guy Rosen, said in an internal memo I’ve seen. “When information is stolen or leaked, there are repercussions beyond the immediate security impact. Our teams become demoralized and we all waste time that is better spent working on our products and toward our goals and mission.”Rosen goes on to say that Meta “will take appropriate action, including termination” if it identifies leakers and that “we recently terminated relationships with employees who leaked confidential company information inappropriately and exfiltrated sensitive documents.”During today’s all-hands meeting, Zuckerberg told employees he would no longer be as transparent due to leaks. “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks,” he said. “It sucks.”In a separate post on Meta’s internal version of Facebook for employees, CTO Andrew Bosworth posted a link to my story about Zuckerberg’s all-hands meeting to an internal group called “Let’s Fix Meta.” He said he “saw all the angry/sad reaccs about the change to the format and I share a sense of loss about it, but I think this makes it clear it was the right call.”",
