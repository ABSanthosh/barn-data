  "text": "News iOS 18.2 beta 1 lets iPhone users change additional default apps. Photo: Apple/Cult of Mac iOS 18.2 beta 1, which went to developers on Wednesday, includes a new section in Settings that lets users specify which applications to set as their defaults for handling email, messages, phone calls and more. In some cases, setting this simply gets easier. In others, changing the default app previously wasn’t possible at all. We already knew this change would happen in Europe, but Apple made it clear Wednesday that it’ll be available worldwide. Change more default iPhone apps iOS already lets everyone change the web browser and the default email app on their iPhone. It’s been that way for years. So, for example, if someone makes Chrome their default browser and then taps on a web link in a text message, Google’s app opens rather than Apple’s. The process isn’t perhaps as easy as it could be. It’s necessary to go into Settings and open the Chrome section to make it the default, for example. Then move to another section to change the default email app. iOS 18.2 beta 1 modifies and builds on this foundation considerably. It adds a new section in Settings -\u003e Apps -\u003e Default Apps. And from here, users can easily set a list of applications as the default ones. And what really stands out about the new section is that it lets users replace Apple’s Phone and Messages applications as the defaults. It’s not possible to change these defaults with iOS 18.1 or earlier. In addition, the same change is included in iPadOS 18.2 beta 1 for tablet users. Not just for Europe Apple announced in August that the European Union’s Digital Markets Act would require it to give those who live in that region more options for setting default iPhone applications. It seems the company decided to expand availability, and that’s why the new settings appear in iOS 18.2 beta 1 for those living anywhere. Cupertino told developers on Wednesday that ”All users worldwide will be able to manage their default apps via a Default Apps section at the top of the Apps area. New calling and messaging defaults are also now available for all users worldwide.”",
