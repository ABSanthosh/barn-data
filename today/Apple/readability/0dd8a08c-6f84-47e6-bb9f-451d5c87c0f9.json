  "text": "Motion sensors have long been one of my favorite HomeKit devices for many years. However, the durability and speed of alerts are incredibly important when it comes to outdoor motion sensors. The Onvis outdoor motion sensor, built with Thread technology and an IP66 rating, is made to work great in both areas. If you want to trigger HomeKit devices based on motion outside, read on to learn more. HomeKit Weekly is a series focused on smart home accessories, automation tips and tricks, and everything to do with Apple’s smart home framework. Why HomeKit motion sensors are underrated HomeKit motion sensors bring a layer of intelligence to your home, acting as the invisible trigger behind many automations that make smart home tech seem like magic. They can turn on lamps as you walk into a room, send notifications if motion is detected when you’re away, or change your thermostat when no one is on a certain floor of the home. With HomeKit, you can connect devices from different manufacturers to work together. Outdoor motion sensors, in particular, add these benefits to areas like patios, driveways, and other outdoor spots. What’s unique about this motion sensor The Onvis Smart Motion Sensor Outdoor is great for this use case. First, it uses Thread technology, making it incredibly responsive and reliable. Thread creates a fast, self-healing mesh network, meaning your automation triggers quickly. It also has an IP66 water resistance rating and a 4-year battery life to handle the outdoors like a champ. However, the Onvis outdoor motion sensor is not just a HomeKit motion sensor. It also acts as a weather monitor, working as a thermometer, hygrometer, and light sensor, updating readings every 15 minutes. These additional features add some nice environmental information to your HomeKit automation. For example, you can create automation that dims your lights when it gets dark or adjusts your indoor thermostat based on outdoor temperature. All your data stays private and stored locally on your devices, with no third-party cloud service being used. Setting up and installing the Onvis outdoor motion sensor Setting up the Onvis motion sensor is super easy if you’re familiar with HomeKit. Once unboxed, pull the tab batteries so they fall into place (AA), which provides up to four years of operation. Add the device to the Home app by scanning the HomeKit QR code. You’ll then place it in a room (outdoors can be a room) Once installed and working, you can add it to any HomeKit automation. Mounting the sensor outdoors is just as easy. Its small form factor allows it to fit easily in most locations, and the wide 120° field of view with a 5-10m detection range means it can cover a significant area of your yard. The Onvis iPhone app allows you to customize notification preferences and set specific schedules that are unavailable in HomeKit. This is an optional step, though. It includes pre-attached adhesive, so it’s easy to install without damaging your home. Wrap up on Onvis outdoor motion sensor The Onvis Smart Motion Sensor Outdoor is a motion sensor and a weather monitor – in a single package. Its strong build quality, Thread technology, and bonus features like temperature and humidity monitoring make it a fantastic addition to any smart home. Whether automating outdoor lights, monitoring your yard, or adding environmental sensors to your setup for weather tracking, it delivers on all fronts in my experience. There aren’t many outdoor rated HomeKit motion sensors on the market, so it’s awesome to see Onvis building one. You can buy the Onvis outdoor motion sensor from Amazon or directly from Onvis.
