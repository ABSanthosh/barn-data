  "text": "It’s long been rumored that Apple will be partnering with other AI chatbot companies in the future, to support Apple Intelligence features. Apple already partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to iOS, and that integration is now here in the iOS 18.2 beta, which is expected to release in December. We haven’t yet heard any announcements about other integrations, such as Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, which Bloomberg previously reported would be coming. Apple software exec Craig Federighi even stated in an interview that he’d like to see Gemini integration within Apple Intelligence, all the way back in June. However, according to a recent tidbit from Mark Gurman’s Power On newsletter, we may now have a better idea of Apple’s timeline: Other future improvements include an integration with Google Gemini. But Apple will probably give OpenAI a nice window of exclusivity, especially since it isn’t exactly paying for the technology. So I wouldn’t expect the Gemini chatbot to arrive in iOS until next year. So, at least according to Gurman, we likely won’t see Google Gemini integration until next year – though it isn’t quite clear whether that means sometime in the spring (like iOS 18.4), or later in the year, sometime during the iOS 19 release cycle. Either way, we probably won’t be seeing Gemini integration this year like some had hoped. If you still really want to use Gemini on your iPhone though, you’re in luck! Google released a standalone Gemini app on the App Store earlier this week, allowing iOS users to tap into Google’s latest AI developments from their pocket.
