  "description": "Macworld Gorgeous, light, powerful, and even more affordable, the M4 MacBook Air is on sale over at Amazon right now for one of the best prices we’ve ever seen. You can get the version with all the bells and whistles—24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—for just $1,245 right now, a savings of $154 off its $1,399 MSRP. If you frequently visit MacWorld, you know that we absolutely love this laptop. In fact, when we reviewed the 15-inch version, we gave it a perfect five-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, with our main complaint being that we can no longer get it in Space Gray. We appreciated that you could hook up two external 6K displays at 60hz, the fantastic performance boost brought on by the upgrade to the M4 chip, and we even appreciated the new 12MP Center Stage camera. And of course, we loved the gorgeous Liquid Retina Display that will make working on the device great in any lighting conditions, allowing you to view crisp images with vivid colors anywhere, and speedy M4 chip. This specific configuration also features 24GB memory and 512GB, which is the recipe for the most decked-out version you can purchase right now. “This is the laptop for everyone,” we wrote at the time, and considering everything it has to offer, including the 18-hour battery life, it’s hard to argue—especially at this price. So snag your very own M4 MacBook Air for $1,245.26 at Amazon sooner rather than later because this deal may not stick around for long. Save 11% on this MacBook Air M4Buy now at Amazon",
