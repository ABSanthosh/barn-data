  "text": "Apple TV+ is home to a growing number of beloved and critically acclaimed shows. One such series, Bad Monkey, just wrapped its first season. And the most popular TV+ series ever, Ted Lasso, is ramping for a long-awaited fourth season. If you enjoyed those shows, you should absolutely give Shrinking a try. Here’s why. It completes Bill Lawrence’s TV+ trifecta Believe it or not, Ted Lasso, Bad Monkey, and Shrinking all have one very big thing in common: Bill Lawrence is one of the instrumental minds behind them all. Lawrence is the co-creator of all three series and has been showrunner to some degree too. While the series each have their own distinct flavor, they all fit the “comedy with emotional undercurrent” vibe Lawrence is known for. Chances are if you’ve enjoyed Lasso and Monkey, Shrinking will be your jam too. Harrison Ford’s comedy Shrinking is about a therapist, played by Jason Segel, who goes a little rogue in the way he counsels his clients. Segel’s missteps tee up comedic gold for Harrison Ford, who is a standout star in the series. Ford plays Paul, Segel’s boss and reluctant mentor. And just about every scene he’s in, Ford makes me think he’s been a comedic actor his whole life. If you love Ford’s work as an action star, you owe it to yourself to see a different side of his acting. Season 2 is almost here That’s right, there’s a new season of Shrinking almost here. Season 2 debuts next Wednesday, October 16. That makes now the perfect time to dive in and watch the first season. It’s 10 episodes, all roughly a half hour each, so there’s not too much catching up to do. Bonus: Roy Kent Brett Goldstein, the man otherwise known as Roy Kent, is a major creative force behind Shrinking. He’s co-creator alongside Lawrence, a role that blossomed out of the two’s work on Ted Lasso. It turns out, Goldstein will also be guest starring in the new season of Shrinking in a role that’s very different from anything we’ve seen him do before. Shrinking: wrap-up and next steps I haven’t said much about what Shrinking is actually about, but trust me, if you’ve enjoyed Ted Lasso and Bad Monkey, Shrinking is a safe bet. Though I’ll warn you the first episode is a little depressing, it quickly turns around and brings a healthy dose of heart and humor. If you want all the actual details, though, you can watch the trailer here, and Apple’s summary of the series is outlined here. Shrinking is available to watch on Apple TV+. Have you seen Shrinking? Are you looking forward to season 2? Let us know in the comments. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
