Outside of Apple, fans of musician Taylor Swift will want to keep an eye out for the pop superstar in the stadium and possibly elsewhere, as her beau Travis Kelce will be playing tight end during the game. Cook was also spotted having a meal with former Miami Dolphins player Odell Beckham Jr. at Domilise's, reports 9to5Mac. Apple users can watch the game for free in 4K on any recent Apple computer, phone, iPad, or Apple Vision Pro, as well as through the Apple TV device.",
