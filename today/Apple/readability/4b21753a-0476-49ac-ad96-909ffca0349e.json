  "text": "Apple's long-rumored launch of the homeOS platform to run smart-home devices and services has had its debut pushed back to the spring of 2026, alongside the launch of new home hardware. Apple is said to have delayed the rollout of both its smart home hub and supporting products due to delays with upgrades to Siri. While it may be something you would consider to be launched during WWDC, it may arrive earlier than the 2026 event. According to Bloomberg, the rollout of the planned upgrades will likely arrive in March of next year, at an event focused on consumers. Apple's ambitions for early 2026 include two big updates, including an upgraded Siri experience, featuring contextual understanding, chatbot capabilities. It's also anticipated to be coming out with a conversational, always-on copilot that could announce tasks. The company has been planning an iPad-like \"home hub\" device that would control in-home systems such as climate control, home security, and other functions. Other rumored home products include a tabletop robotic arm that might also include a swivelable iPad-like display. A convergence of Apple technologiesThe rollout of Apple's smart-home push is dependent on several different factors coming together. Built on the upgraded Siri for voice-based commands and requests, new hardware would likely be unveiled at the March event, ahead of the company's annual developer conference. It will rely on Thread control to create a mesh network among the smart-home devices. Existing Apple products such as the iPhone, Apple TV, and HomePod already have the necessary radios for the future HomeOS built-in. The continuing development of Apple Intelligence will also play a key role in the evolution of Apple's home technologes. Alongside the upgrade to Siri's capabilities, Apple has recently opened up the technology to developers with its Foundation Models Framework, announced during WWDC. Other manufacturers have slowly started to adopt compatibility with Apple's Thread home technology into their own products, such as Ikea's Timmerflotte temperature and humidity sensor. A unified push by Apple to promote homeOS and products supporting it will allow Apple to offer unified home control that works across different brands and technologies. This would, if adopted by users, give Apple an advantage in the smart-home accessory market.",
