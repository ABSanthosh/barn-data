  "text": "Apple has a number of exciting products in the pipeline for 2027, per Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Despite recent Apple releases feeling somewhat stagnant, Apple has a plan to freshen things up. Gurman describes this product road map as a “product renaissance,” and it’s set to take place around two years from now. All-new iPhones First things first, this ‘product renaissance’ will start off with a big one: Apple’s first foldable iPhone. This product is set to launch at the tail end of 2026, alongside the iPhone 18 lineup. It’ll have a number of unique features to set it apart from the rest of the foldable phone industry, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 6, though Apple’s foldable will be priced at a premium. Apple plans to go all out with this phone, including a crease-free display and a durable titanium frame. You can learn more about the foldable iPhone in our latest roundup. After the foldable, Apple is going to launch a new 20th anniversary iPhone. We don’t know a ton about this model, though we do know it’s set to be a relatively massive redesign. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman describes the phone as “a mostly glass, curved iPhone – without any cutouts in the display.” New AI products Apple is also planning a plethora of new hardware product categories that utilize some of its Apple Intelligence developments. First things first, the company aims to a ship a product to compete with Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses by 2027. Apple is working on all-new silicon to set this product up to succeed. The glasses will have cameras, speakers, and microphones, allowing it to be aware of your environment. Features like iPhone’s Visual Intelligence will come into play here, per Gurman. On the subject of AI, Apple is also planning new AirPods models and Apple Watch models with cameras, allowing the company to push Visual Intelligence tech into more places. Siri will improve… hopefully By 2027, Siri should finally live up to all of the AI hype, according to Gurman. There’ll be two key developments that make that possible: new Apple Silicon-based AI server chips, and a freshly-rewritten Siri that uses LLMs as its basis. Siri’s conversational user interface will also arrive in iOS 20, after reportedly being delayed from the initial launch of iOS 19. Final products Last but not least, Apple has been working on developing all-new robotics products. Those will finally take the stage by 2027, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This product relies on the launch of the much smaller Apple smart home hub, which was supposed to take place this year but has faced numerous delays. Gurman describes the first robotics product as a “tabletop machine with a robotic arm”, and says it’ll feature an “AI assistant with its own personality.” Wrap up After 2027, Apple aims to ship a new product category that crosses “a foldable iPad with a touch-screen Mac”, though Gurman notes that’s a 2028 thing at the earliest. And, as always, timelines for all of these products can change. Gurman describes the timing as “fluid.” What do you think of Apple’s product revamp set to take place in 2027?
