It's perfect for those who want to get in on the \"Severance\" hype, as the series is having a bit of a moment right now. A month after \"Severance\" aired its second season premiere, it toppled \"Ted Lasso\" as the most watched Apple TV+ series. Of course, there are plenty of other things to watch on Apple TV+, too. After all, the streamer just rolled out Seth Rogen's \"The Studio,\" which has received very positive reviews from viewers and critics alike. And Apple TV+ features select Major League Soccer matches from MLS Season Pass and is the home of \"Friday Night Baseball,\" a weekly Major League Baseball double-header with no local broadcast restrictions. Apple does not clarify what a \"qualifying returning subscriber\" is, but you can check your eligibility at the Apple TV+ webpage or via the Apple TV app. This offer is set to expire on April 24, 2025. Those who are eligible will get the deal for three months, then the plan will automatically renew at $9.99 per month until canceled. Apple points out that there are a few ineligible parties. Those who are eligible for a free three months can't snag it. Neither can anyone who gets Apple TV+ through a third party or mobile wireless provider.",
