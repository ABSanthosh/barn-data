  "text": "News Rhea Seehorn stars in Pluribus, coming to Apple TV+ in November. Photo: Apple TV+ It’s hard to tell from the weird little teaser trailer Apple TV+ dropped Friday, but subscribers may get their next must-watch series when Pluribus — the highly anticipated sci-fi drama from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan — debuts on the streaming platform November 7. The nine-episode series stars Emmy-nominated actress Rhea Seehorn, best known for her critically acclaimed role as Kim Wexler in Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul. Pluribus season 1: A genre-bending premise from the mind behind Breaking Bad Pluribus presents an intriguing high-concept storyline where “the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness,” according to Apple TV+. This genre-bending, sci-fi-meets-drama approach represents another creative departure for Gilligan. He consistently pushed boundaries throughout his career, from The X-Files to Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. The series has already been renewed for a second season before its premiere, demonstrating Apple TV+’s confidence in the project. This early renewal follows Apple’s strategy of backing prestige content from proven creators, similar to their approach with other original series. And all this despite a teaser trailer about 20 seconds in length that tells us almost nothing about the show. In it we see a bored-looking woman in an empty, dark workplace licking the bottom of each donut before putting them back in a box. The camera pans from her down to a hand-written sign that says “Help yourself!” with a smiley face. And that’s it, aside from the somewhat ominous music. The accompanying dark and red-hued photograph is a bit more helpful. It shows a fraught-looking Seehorn on the phone. And make what you will of the show title, as well. “Pluribus” is Latin for “many” or “more.” It’s well-known in the U.S. motto “E pluribus unum” (“out of many, one”) that appears on the country’s seal and coins. Star-studded cast and creative team Seehorn leads the show’s cast alongside Karolina Wydra (Sneaky Pete) and Carlos Manuel Vesga (The Hijacking of Flight 601). Guest stars include Miriam Shor (American Fiction) and Samba Schutte (Our Flag Means Death), adding depth to the supporting roster. Behind the camera, Emmy winner Gilligan serves as executive producer alongside WGA Award winner Gordon Smith, with additional executive producers Alison Tatlock, Diane Mercer, Allyce Ozarski and Jeff Frost. Sony Pictures Television produces the series. Watch the teaser trailer for Pluribus Watch sci-fi on Apple TV+ Apple TV+ will release the first two episodes of Pluribus on Friday, November 7, 2025, followed by new episodes every Friday through December 26.

After launching in November 2019, “Apple TV+ became the first all-original streaming service to launch around the world, and has premiered more original hits and received more award recognitions faster than any other streaming service.
