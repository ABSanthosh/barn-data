  "text": "News Apple TV+ sci-fi mystery Silo stars Rebecca Ferguson. Photo: Apple TV+ The Apple TV+ sci-fi series Silo remains one of the most watched shows on streaming, just as it has since season two debuted in November. It’s once again on the most recent lists of the top 10 most popular streaming series maintained by two ratings companies. And the feel-good comedy Shrinking season two drew an audience last week, too. As did Severance. Silo remains popular week after week Not surprising for a streaming service run by a computer-maker, Apple TV+ has a reputation for top-quality sci-fi. It’s the home of phenomenal successes like Severance (returning soon!), plus popular series like Dark Matter, Foundation and For All Mankind. Silo is is one of its bigger hits, and is based on the bestselling books by Hugh Howey. That name recognition gave the series a boost when it launched in 2023, and the audience stayed and grew as season one went along. Now viewers came back in droves for season two, which premiered on November 15. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch releases a weekly list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Silo sits at No. 4 for the week of December 30 through January 5. And rival service Reelgood put the show at No. 5 on its equivalent list for Jan. 2 to Jan. 8. A pair of Apple TV+ series did well with audiences last week: Silo and Shrinking. And Severance is coming on strong.Charts: JustWatch/Reelgood Estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Apple’s official description of its sci-fi series says: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on Earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built, and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. The first nine episodes of Silo season two can be enjoyed now, while the season finale is coming on Friday. Watch to catch up? Season one is ready to be binge-watched. And there’ll be plenty more to enjoy in the future. Apple recently committed to seasons 3 and 4 so the complete story arc will be finished. Shrinking is also a hit for Apple TV+ Shrinking season one found real success for Apple TV+, and when season two premiered on the streaming service in October, its audience from the previous year came back. The comedy/drama starring Jason Segel and Harrison Ford as psychotherapists holds the No. 8 on JustWatch list of Top 10 TV shows last week, and it’s at No. 9 on Reelgood’s equivalent list. Apple’s official description of the series says: “Shrinking follows a grieving therapist (played by Segel) who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he makes huge, tumultuous changes to people’s lives … including his own.” That could be the description for a drama, but the show generally plays with the premise for laughs. It’s a feel-good comedy with a dose of drama. All episodes of Shrinking season two can be enjoyed now, so it’s ready to be binge-watched. Severance season 2 is coming up! There haven’t been any new episodes of Severance since 2022 but the weird workplace drama still made it into the No. 10 slot on Reelgood’s most popular streaming series last week. That’s because season 2 starts on Apple TV+ on January 17, and fans need to catch up after a three-year hiatus. In the series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. Binge season one of Severance to be ready for the new episodes. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming Silo, Shrinking, Severance plus many other series and films comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
