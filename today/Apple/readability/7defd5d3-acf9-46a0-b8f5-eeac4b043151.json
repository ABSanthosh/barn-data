At the same time the company announced that hearing aid features would be coming to the 2nd generation AirPods Pro and the AirPods Max got a minor update (Lightning switched for USB-C and a color refresh). Those hoping that the AirPods Pro 3 and the AirPods Max 2 would launch were disappointed. It is now almost three years since the AirPods Pro 2 were introduced in September 2022, and more than four years since the AirPods Max introduction in December 2020. Updates are long overdue. In this article we are tracking all the rumors about the launch date, new features and specs and any other changes coming to the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Read on for the latest news about the 2025 AirPods. We’ll look first at the rumours and leaks relating to the AirPods Pro 3 before moving on to the AirPods Max 2 below (click here to jump to the AirPods Max section).  AirPods Pro 3 release date: When will the AirPods Pro 3 be released? In summary September 2025 launch of AirPods Pro 3 likely… …But launch could be delayed until 2026 Production delays indicated It would be typical to expect a September launch for AirPods Pro, alongside iPhone 17. The original AirPods Pro were introduced in October 2019, the AirPods 2nd-gen launched in September 2022, and those were updated with USB-C in September 2023. In a February 2025, Bloomberg report Mark Gurman suggested that the AirPods Pro 3 were “Still many months away”. That could still line up with a September (or October) launch though. Also in February an unverified leaker claimed in a tweet that there would be an AirPods Pro launch in May or June. Twitter However, in May 2025 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that we might not see an update to the AirPods until 2026. This could relate to production delays due to a new infra-red camera Apple is said to be equipping the AirPods with (more on that below). Twitter AirPods Pro 3 price: How much will the AirPods Pro 3 cost? In summary Price hike not expected… …But prices may rise due to economic factors We don’t expect the price to change, although it may increase in certain parts of the world and remain the same in others.  For example, when Apple launched the AirPods Pro in the U.K. the price was £249, that price was later reduced to £229, so it might go back up to £249. The price in the U.S. hasn’t changed since launch. Other factors may affect pricing. Pricing for the AirPods range starts at $129/£129 for the AirPods 4, and rises to $499/£549 for the AirPods Max:  Apple Earbuds: $19/£19 AirPods 4: $129/£129 AirPoids 4 with ANC: $179/£179 AirPods Pro 2nd-gen $249/£229 AirPods Max $549/£499 Ignoring the $300 premium for the AirPods Max, that’s an extra $70 between the AirPods 4 with ANC and the AirPods Pro. It would be feasible for Apple to increase the price of the AirPods Pro if the new features made the upgrade worthwhile.  We have a round-up of the Best wireless earbuds for iPhones and the best wired headphones if you’d like to consider alternatives to AirPods. Also read AirPods Pro vs AirPods to find out how the models compare. AirPods Pro 3 features: What specs and features will the AirPods Pro 3 have? In summary Heart rate monitoring Temperature monitoring Translation Better active noise cancellation It’s fairly easy to make predictions about the new features coming to AirPods Pro 3 just by looking at the AirPods 4 and the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 (Beats is an Apple-owned subsidiary). For example, Powerbeats Pro 2, which launched in February 2025, includes heart rate monitoring. Read our review of the Powerbeats Pro 2 and our AirPods 4 review. As for the features rumored to be coming to the AirPods Pro 3, here’s what we’ve heard: Heart Rate monitoring: In December 2024, Gurman said Apple is working on in-ear heart rate monitoring. This will enable users to track heart rate while exercising without having to wear an Apple Watch.  The inclusion of heart rate monitoring in the Powerbeats Pro 2 certainly indicates that the same feature will be available on the AirPods Pro 3, but you can expect it to be superior. One issue with the Powerbeats Pro 2 is that they can’t steam music and capture heart data simultaneously. Another issue is with the interplay between the heart rate monitoring on the Apple Watch and the Powerbeats.  Temperature monitoring: Mark Gurman has also said Apple was researching in-ear temperature sensors, and Apple has a patent on such technology. In-ear temperature sensing could also be faster and more reliable than those via the Apple Watch. Translation: As part of the iOS 19 update Apple is said to be adding a live translation feature to AirPods. It’s unknown which AirPods will be compatible, but the AirPods Pro 3 are sure to be. We expect to hear more at WWDC. Better active noise cancellation: According to Mark Gurman (in October 2023) the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a new H3 chip, which could lead to better active noise cancellation. Crash detection: An Apple patent describes a way that motion sensors inside AirPods could aid Crash Detection. AirPods Pro 3 design: Will Apple update the AirPods Pro design? In summary Changes to the charging case possible Slimmer design suggested Touch controls may work with gloves Mahmoud Itani / Foundry As mentioned above, we can look to the AirPods 4 for some clues about changes that may come to the AirPods Pro. One such change related to the charging case. The AirPod 4 charging case lacks a physical setup button, instead featuring a sensor under the status light on the front that lights up when active. There may be more changes coming. According to Mark Gurman (back in October 2023) the AirPods Pro will get a new design. We don’t expect new colors, but the buds may slim down further. The changes may be less visible, more tactile: A number of Apple patents indicate that Apple is looking to improve the way that the touch controls work on the earbuds work when the user is wearing gloves. For example in February 2025 a patent was granted to Apple that could enable this. AirPods Max 2 release date: When will the AirPods Max be updated? In summary Update long overdue Could be waiting until 2027 Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote of the AirPods Max in a December 2023 newsletter, saying that “The cans don’t sell well enough for the company to invest in entirely new hardware or software features”. However, it’s now more than four years since the AirPods Max were introduced and with such a premium price Apple owes it to customers to bring the AirPods Max into line with their competition and other AirPods Apple sells.  In 2024 Mark Gurman predicted that the AirPods Max would get an updated at the iPhone event. Sadly, the update included only a color change and a switch from Lightning for USB-C connectivity.  I expect Apple to launch new AirPods Max headphones tomorrow with better noise cancellation, adaptive audio \u0026 USB-C. They’ll launch with the low-end AirPods 4. This is line with my reporting for months but runs counter to lack of low inventory in stores. https://t.co/KIJQEwywcp— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) September 9, 2024 Even worse, the change meant that the AirPods Max could no longer be used as wired headphones (a feature of the Lightning-based model). This was the case until a software update in March 2025 added this ability along with lossless and ultra low latency audio. As a result of that software update, users are now able to play lossless audio and ultra-low-latency audio through a wired connection. Lossless audio is a key feature for audio producers, while ultra‑low latency audio is key for gaming and live streams. Both very important features for the AirPods Mac. Despite these ‘updates’ the over four year old headphones are lagging behind the competition and an update is long over due. The bad news is that, if analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct, we could be waiting until 2027 for the second generation of AirPods Max. Twitter AirPods Max 2 price: How much will the AirPods Max 2 cost? In summary Price unlikely to change… …Although Apple could unify the U.S. and U.K. prices At $549/£499 the AirPods Max are an expensive purchase. The fact that they are now more than four years old makes that price look incredibly inflated. It’s no wonder they are frequently discounted at Amazon and elsewhere. When the new models launch we don’t expect a price change though. These are designed to fit at the premium headphones end of the market, and their competition has solar prices. That said, the price in the U.S. and U.K. may come in to line, with Apple choosing to ‘match’ the price as it usually does (many Apple products share an, e.g. $499/£499 price point) which Apple calculated based on exchange rates and local taxes. AirPods Max 2 specs: What specs and features will the AirPods Max 2 have In summary Necessary updates to bring into line with rest of the AirPods lineup New chip  Removal of ‘audio howl’ There is so much lacking from he AirPods Max compared to the AirPods Pro that it is easy to assume that the following will be included:  H1 chip upgraded to H2 (or H3)  Adaptive Audio (which combines transparency mode and ANC) Conversation Awareness  Conversation Boost Voice Isolation  Personalized Volume Option to activate with ‘Siri’ voice command (not just ‘Hey Siri’) Custom high dynamic range amplifier Bluetooth 5.3 (up from Bluetooth 5.0)  Find My  Also expect better battery life.  One patent identified in 2022 indicates Apple is looking at detecting “audio howl”, which is described as distracting audio feedback. AirPods Max 2 design: Will Apple update the AirPods Max design? In summary More protective carry case Removable ear cushions  Waterproofing  Jason Cross/IDG Improvements to gesture controls which are currently via the Digital Crown. Could Apple forgo the Digital Crown in favor of touch controls on the ear cups?  We could see changes to the carry case. Ideally it should cover the whole product and be more protective. A patent from 2022 suggested that Apple was developing a better case with magnetic clasps. The Audio Howl patent mentioned above also refers to removable ear cushions which could be reattached using magnets.  We’d also like to see a foldable design and better waterproofing. If you’re keen to hear the latest rumors about Apple’s plans, the best place to start is our roundup of New Apple products. Those interested in the current range should take a look at our roundup of the best AirPods deals for the latest bargains.",
