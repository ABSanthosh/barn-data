Photo: Apple TV+ Severance is the among the most-watched streaming series, according to two companies that track ratings. The Apple TV+ weird workplace drama beat out almost everything else on any streaming service as season two gets into the swing of things. In addition, Silo, another Apple TV+ series, continued to do well even after wrapping up its own season two. And the new conspiracy thriller Prime Target found an audience, too. Severance shoots to the top of the ratings charts Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season. Enough to make it a No. 1 most-streamed series. But that was 2022. Fans had to wait years for new episodes, but their interest didn’t dim. When season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. Enough to push the show to near the top of the ratings charts and keep it there. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Severance sits at No. 2 for the week of January 27 through February 2. And rival service Reelgood also put the show in the No. 2 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of  Jan. 30 to Feb. 5. Ratings show three Apple TV+ shows are among the popular streaming series in early February 2025.Photo: JustWatch/Reelgood Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. Season two of Severance is here, so start watching new episodes. Episode four of the new season debuted this week, with the fifth coming on Friday. In the mean time, be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two,  episode three and episode four. Silo just keeps holding on The Apple TV+ sci-fi series Silo season two wrapped up weeks ago but nevertheless did not drop in the ratings. The last episode (for now) aired on January 17, and enough people tuned in to put the show in the No. 4 slot on JustWatch’s list of most popular streaming series last week. And it was in the No. 6 slot on Reelgood’s equivalent list. Apple’s official description says: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on Earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built, and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. All ten episodes of Silo season two can be binge-watched now. And there’ll be plenty more to enjoy in the future. Apple already committed to seasons 3 and 4, so the complete story arc will be finished. Apple TV+ makes math exciting with Prime Target A brilliant math postgrad finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy in the thriller series Prime Target, which launched January 22 on Apple TV+. The premise is interesting enough to draw an immediate crowd. The show held the No. 5 position on JustWatch’s ratings list last week. And it came in at No. 8 on Reelgood’s list. It stars SAG Award winner Leo Woodall (The White Lotus, One Day) and Quintessa Swindell (Black Adam, In Treatment). Apple TV+ describes the series with: Prime Target features a brilliant young math postgraduate, Edward Brooks (played by Woodall), who is on the verge of a major breakthrough. If he succeeds in finding a pattern in prime numbers, he will hold the key to every computer in the world. Soon, he begins to realize an unseen enemy is trying to destroy his idea before it’s even born, which throws him into the orbit of Taylah Sanders, an NSA agent (played by Swindell) who’s been tasked with watching and reporting on mathematicians’ behavior. Together, they start to unravel the troubling conspiracy Edward is at the heart of. The first four episodes can be streamed now. The fifth is scheduled for Wednesday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming series like Severance, Silo, Prime Target, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle.
