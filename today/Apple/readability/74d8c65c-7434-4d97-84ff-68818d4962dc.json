  "text": "The rollout of Apple Intelligence promises a wealth of new and useful features. Image credit: Apple While some employees believe Apple is currently lagging behind rivals its Apple Intelligence development, the company expects to gain ground in 2025 by introducing new chips and new models. Apple has been promoting the arrival of Apple Intelligence in its latest devices, which will roll out slowly across the next few months via software updates. Users will notice some new features and changes starting with Siri as early as iOS 18.1, which is expected to arrive by the end of October. However, a Bloomberg newsletter claims that some employees feel Apple is significantly behind its rivals, who won't be sitting still on AI development either. For example, internal reports at Apple are claimed to show that ChatGPT's responses to queries are currently about 25 percent more accurate than Siri. ChatGPT can also answer some 30 percent more questions. Until that gap can be closed, Apple will emphasize features such as the promotion of timely notifications, summaries of longer emails and messages, and the partnership with ChatGPT for advanced queries. A more advanced Siri, generative emoji creation, and Image Playground are expected to arrive starting early in 2025. Apple playing catch-up Google and other competitors are already offering some features Apple will put into future Apple Intelligence releases, such as email summaries. Apple's promotional focus for its AI thus far has been an emphasis on being able to do much of the work on-device, for greater privacy and security. For example, users are made aware when outside resources like ChatGPT are used, and what user information, if any, is disclosed. Due to the high resource requirements of AI, the company has drawn something of a line in the sand. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max or later models will run Apple Intelligence, and devices will need at least an A17 or M1 chipset, with at least 8GB of RAM. Apple has a lot to do to close the gap between its own development and those of its rivals across 2025 and into 2026. This will be accomplished by hiring additional engineers, acquiring companies with promising new technology, and otherwise plowing lots more resources into Apple Intelligence development. While Apple Intelligence matures, the company will focus on bringing out hardware that can run the advanced services as they arrive. The next iPhone SE is expected to have an A18 chip and 8GB of RAM in it, and the entry-level iPad is likely to get a similar update sometime in 2025. According to the report, by early 2026, Apple's entire Mac, iPhone, and iPad lines will be Apple Intelligence-ready. The company will focus on using that, along with redesigns on some products and other updates, to convince users to upgrade.",
