  "text": "Apple Vision Pro has been available for just over seven months, and Apple is starting to ramp up its market research among customers. The company is sending surveys to early Vision Pro adopters inviting them to share their experiences with things like comfort, use cases, and much more. Apple’s survey guides users through a series of questions about their thoughts on Apple Vision Pro and the broader Apple ecosystem. Here are some of the questions asked by the survey: Did you buy Apple Vision Pro or receive it from someone else? Do you still have this Apple Vision Pro? Overall, how satisfied are you with your Apple Vision Pro? What is your favorite feature or aspect of Apple Vision Pro so far? How often do you use your Apple Vision Pro? For how long do you typically wear your Apple Vision Pro before you decide to take it off? What head band do you use most often with your Apple Vision Pro? Did you get ZEISS Optical Inserts for your Apple Vision Pro? How often do you use your Apple Vision Pro while the battery is connected to a power source? For what purposes do you use Mac Virtual Display? Where do you typically use Mac Virtual Display? What types of activities do you use Mac Virtual Display for? What one thing, if anything, would you add to or change about Apple Vision Pro? Apple also asks users what features they planned to use when they first bought Vision Pro, and whether they still use those features today. There are also multiple questions about satisfaction across different categories, including: Comfort while wearing Durability Weight Battery life Screen resolution Fit and stability Ease of use Responsiveness to eyes and hands Ease of set-up Apple also asks users about which accessories they use with Apple Vision Pro, ranging from third-party headbands to cases and battery belt clips. There’s also a question that asks users about other technology products they use in their lives outside of the Apple ecosystem – including other AR/VR products such as Meta Quest headsets. Apple regularly sends surveys like this to customers to gauge feedback and data on new product releases. This time around, the questioning is a touch more interesting given that Apple Vision Pro is a first-generation product and Apple’s foray into a brand new industry.
