  "text": "News It seems a bit surprising, but analysts think Apple is about to deliver some upbeat financial news. AI image: Google Gemini/Cult of Mac Wall Street is putting out positive vibes about the March quarter results Apple will announce Thursday. Analysts anticipate a 4% increase in Apple’s revenue, plus a jump in earnings per share. That might seem surprising in the wake of President Donald Trump imposing a 20% tariff on electronics coming in from China. However, the Apple financial results about to be revealed are for the quarter that ended in March. Trump didn’t announce the tariffs until April, so they don’t affect these numbers. That won’t happen until Apple provides its June quarter results. Analysts remain upbeat about Apple financial results When Apple announces the March 2025 quarter results, analysts will scrutinize how well the company’s products sold in China. Greater China accounted for 18% of Apple’s revenue during the March 2024 quarter, but a year later, that might slip. Even before the import taxes hit in April, Trump began verbally attacking China. The Chinese government responded in kind. The result might be reduced demand for Apple products in China last quarter. On the positive side, the popular MacBook Air got the latest M4 processor last quarter. And the newly launched iPhone 16e is reportedly selling well. The net result: Wall Street analysts seem generally upbeat. An average of their predictions pegs Apple’s revenue in the first three months of 2025 at $94.6 billion, according to figures compiled by Yahoo Finance. That’s up 4% from the $90.7 billion the tech giant took in during the same quarter at the start of 2024. And the average earnings per share estimate stands at $1.62, up almost 6% year-over-year from $1.53. Apple plans to reveal the results of its March quarter — the company’s Q2 2025 financial quarter — after trading closes Thursday. Tariff troubles ahead As per tradition, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh will hold a conference call with investors after the company reports its financial results. Much of the call will consist of a question-and-answer session. You can expect the Trump tariffs to come up frequently. Whether Cook can calm jittery investors will surely have a large effect on Apple’s share price Friday. As of Wednesday, the AAPL share price is down 8% since Trump was sworn into office, though Apple remains the world’s most valuable company.",
