  "text": "When Apple announced iOS 18 in June at WWDC, the company unveiled some new features for HomeKit and the Home app – including support for vacuuming robots. However, this feature wasn’t included in the first releases of iOS 18, and Apple has now quietly confirmed that HomeKit support for robot vacuum cleaners has been postponed until 2025. HomeKit to support robot vacuum cleaners next year Previously, the Home app webpage on Apple’s website said that support for vacuuming robots in HomeKit would arrive with a future iOS 18 update later this year. However, as noted by MacRumors, the page has now been silently updated with a footnote saying that the feature will arrive early next year. “Feature will be available in early 2025,” the footnote reads. Apple also emphasizes that the integration to control robot vacuum cleaners with Siri will only work in U.S. English. Support for robot vacuum cleaners in HomeKit comes after the Matter 1.2 standard (which is supported by Apple) was formalized last year with support for vacuum cleaners as well. Although Apple hasn’t provided many details about how the integration will work, users will most likely be able to start a cleaning from the Home app or by asking Siri. It’s also likely that the vacuuming robots will support Home app automations and scenes too. Roborock has already committed to adding HomeKit support to the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra robot vacuum in the fure. Hopefully, other manufacturers will also add HomeKit support to their vacuum cleaners soon. With iOS 18, Apple has made it easier for users to invite temporary guests to control their HomeKit accessories. The update also added support for Ultra Wideband door locks. More iOS 18 features that have been delayed In addition to support for robot vacuum cleaners in the Home app, many other iOS 18 features announced at WWDC in June have also been delayed. The first set of Apple Intelligence features arrived in October, a month after iOS 18 was released to the public. Apple is currently testing more AI features with iOS 18.2 beta, while the more advanced Siri has also been delayed until next year. iOS 18 is available for iPhone XR and later.
