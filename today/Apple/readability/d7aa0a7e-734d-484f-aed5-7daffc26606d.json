An Illinois state law took effect on January 1, 2025 that will bring digital versions of IDs and driver's licenses to Apple Wallet. Illinois is already working with Apple to make digital IDs a reality, according to a press release from the Illinois Secretary of State, Alexi Giannoulias, as was originally discovered by 9to5mac. Residents will be able to access their new digital IDs via Apple Wallet on their iPhone or Apple Watch. Digital IDs will be available at no cost and will be usable alongside existing physical ID cards rather than replacing them entirely. Digital identity cards can mainly be used at select airports and TSA checkpoints within the United States, instead of a hard copy license or ID. Users will still need their physical identity cards for traffic stops or as a means of verifying age when attempting to purchase alcohol. The Illinois Secretary of State will implement \"robust testing requirements to ensure the office delivers the most secure and private product for Illinois residents.\" \"We're excited to have kickstarted our work with Apple - a company that shares our commitment to data security - to provide IDs in Apple Wallet that will offer convenience and privacy for Illinoisans,\" Giannoulias said. \"This is the first component of a multi-faceted approach to deliver a state-of-the-art mobile driver's license and state ID program that leverages best-in-class technology for residents.\" By implementing digital IDs and driver's licenses, Illinois will join 10 other states and territories where the option already exists. Digital IDs and driver's licenses in Apple Wallet are currently available in Arizona, Colorado, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, and Puerto Rico. Several other states have committed to implementing digital IDs in the Apple Wallet app but have yet to deliver on this promise. This includes the likes of Connecticut, Kentucky, Montana, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia. Some states, like Florida, have used proprietary digital ID formats not intended for Apple Wallet. Support for digital identity cards in the Apple Wallet app was announced in 2021. Recently, in October 2024, the Vice President of Apple Pay revealed, among other things, that more states were working with the company to implement their digital IDs and driver's licenses in the Wallet app.",
