  "text": "Here we go again for another season of rumors. This time, multiple reports suggest that all iPhone 17 models will have ProMotion – as Apple calls the technology for displays with a higher refresh rate. While this seems highly likely, you probably shouldn’t get too excited about it – and here’s why. iPhone 17 and the rumors about higher refresh rate displays Well-known display analyst Ross Young said back in September that every iPhone 17 model would have ProMotion, a technology that is currently exclusive to Pro models. Earlier today, a leaker known as Digital Chat Station (who has been right about Apple rumors in the past) corroborated reports that the entire iPhone 17 series will have LTPO displays with variable refresh rate. Since the iPhone 13 Pro, every Pro model comes with an LTPO display that adjusts the refresh rate automatically and can go up to 120Hz to show super-smooth animations. Meanwhile, non-Pro models are locked at 60Hz all the time. With the recent rumors, people have started to believe that the non-Pro iPhone 17 models will also have 120Hz displays with ProMotion. Personally, I don’t think this is entirely true. As the name suggests, “ProMotion” is something that Apple considers a Pro feature. The only devices with ProMotion so far are the iPad Pro, iPhone Pro, and MacBook Pro. Sure, Apple sometimes ends up bringing Pro device features to the less expensive variants, but that’s not always the case – especially when the feature has “Pro” in its name. If I had to guess, I’d say that Apple will indeed put higher refresh rate displays in the iPhone 17 and 17 Air, but they won’t be 120Hz. Instead, it seems more likely that Apple will use 90Hz panels, which would be smoother than the 60Hz panels but still not on the same level as the ProMotion displays. I can even see them coming up with a new marketing name like “Liquid Motion.” Last month, an anonymous source told the Upgrade podcast that Apple has been exploring 90Hz displays for products such as the iPad Air, Studio Display, and even the iMac. To me, it seems plausible to think that the same technology will come to non-Pro iPhones. What about you? Do you think non-Pro iPhones will get 120Hz or 90Hz displays?
