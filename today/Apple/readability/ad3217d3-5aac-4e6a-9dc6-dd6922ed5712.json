The graphic shows an Apple Watch with an \"84\" on it. Surrounding the outside is a ring that features the same colors as the sleep stages tracked within the Sleep app. The graphic, discovered by MacRumors also features a couple of Apple's existing sleep-related icons, as well as a couple of new ones. A moon and stars, three Zzz's, the sleep focus mode icon, and an alarm clock. Image Credit: MacRumorsThere is also a thermometer icon, which suggests that the feature would take temperature into account when calculating the score. Apple Watch already does something similar when measuring a user's Vitals. According to MacRumors, the image is named \"Watch Focus Score,\" which suggests that this would be the score given to the user in sleep focus mode. Other wearables, including the Oura Ring and FitBit, give their users daily readiness scores — it makes sense that Apple would implement a similar feature.",
