  "description": "Macworld Even at $249, the AirPods Pro 2 have been one of the best noise-canceling earbuds you can buy ever since they arrived in 2023, and with the upcoming Hearing Health features that provide the world’s first software-enabled Hearing Aid feature, they can also help with hearing loss. And today, they’re a bargain too: Amazon is selling the AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C charging case for $169, a savings of $80, and the lowest price we’ve ever seen. The AirPods Pro design hasn’t changed since the original model arrived in 2019 other than a USB-C case instead of Lightning, but it has a slew of upgrades inside. The AirPods Pro 2 have longer battery life (6 hours vs 4.5 hours), better audio quality, and 2X noise cancellation with Adaptive Transparency mode. And this latest model also brings IP54 water and dust resistance as well as lossless audio when paired with Vision Pro. In our 4.5-star review, we praised the AirPods Pro 2’s upgrades, concluding that  “the sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par.” And now, the price is just right so go grab a pair. AirPods Pro are $80 off for Prime DayGO GRAB THIS DEAL",
