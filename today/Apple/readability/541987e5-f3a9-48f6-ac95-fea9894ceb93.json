  "text": "News Accessing Google Gemini on iPad just got easier. Photo: Cult of Mac iPad users no longer have to depend on an iPhone application to access Google’s Gemini AI-powered chatbot. Software designed specifically for iPad users launched Wednesday. This comes after Google recently introduced home screen widgets to give iPhone and iPad users easier access to Gemini. Google Gemini gets better on iPad Artificial intelligence is changing the way people use their computers, and Apple is behind the curve. But users of Apple devices nevertheless have plenty of options to turn to for AI access. That includes Google Gemini, and iPad users got an application that takes full advantage of the capabilities of the tablet. That includes support for Split View to put Gemini side-by-side with other apps for multitasking. “It makes accessing key Gemini features – designed to boost your learning, creativity, and productivity – easier and more intuitive than ever on the larger iPad screen,” said a company spokesperson. Previously, tablet users had to choose between an iPhone app that couldn’t go full screen and a web interface. But the dedicated iPad Gemini application launched Wednesday in all countries where Google’s AI is already offered. It can be downloaded directly from the App Store. Gemini home screen widgets for iPhone launch, too Last week, Google began rolling out Gemini home screen widgets for iPhone and iPad users, and they should now be available to everyone. “With these new widgets, users can access features like using their camera, sharing files or images, initiating a conversation with Gemini Live, or opening the microphone, all directly from the home screen,” said a Google spokesperson. A smaller widget includes four icons giving easy access to features of the app. A larger version adds a text box to ask Google’s AI questions directly from the widget. Once the Gemini application is installed on the iPhone or iPad, the widgets can be added to the computer’s home screen. Need help? Read our how-to guide on adding widgets.",
