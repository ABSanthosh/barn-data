  "description": "Macworld Sure, we love Apple’s Magic Mouse, but despite its alluring design, it’s probably not the one we’d recommend buying. However, this Corsair M75 Air mouse is far more suitable for most users, and it’s only $40 right now, a savings of $90 off what Apple charges for the same mouse (although that model has RGB lighting and is slightly heavier). This wireless mouse brings clean lines and a classic design that’s comfortable to use for long hours. Equipped with a 26K DPI optical sensor, this Corsair mouse is highly sensitive, so the smallest of movements you make will translate well on the screen. The mouse also boasts 650 IPS tracking and up to 50G acceleration. The mouse is also super light, so you won’t feel like you’re lifting weights just moving this thing around. Your wrist will thank you because this mouse only weighs 60 grams. Our friends over at PCWorld reviewed the Corsair M75 Air, giving it a 4-star rating, their Editors’ Choice award, and said the model is “like the peregrine falcon of the gaming mouse world; streamlined, and with just the right amount of weight, it moves across your mouse mat with a smoothness and glide that you’d be hard pressed finding in any competitors.” At this point, the fact that you can get it for $40 seems like the cherry on top, so order your very own Corsair M75 Air sooner rather than later because you can never know how long the deal will last. Buy now at Amazon",
