  "text": "News Cate Blanchett is only one of the big stars in “Disclaimer,” now streaming on Apple TV+ Photo: Apple TV+ Disclaimer just debuted Friday on Apple TV+ and it’s already near the top of a rating’s company’s popularity chart. The thriller about sex and secrets stars Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline, and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón. And two other Apple TV+ series continue to hold onto audiences: Slow Horses and Bad Monkey. Disclaimer didn’t wait to become a hit Story arcs have become almost de rigueur for streaming TV series. Taken to the extreme, a series can be a 10-hour movie broken into weekly episodes. Apple TV+ does this brilliantly with multiple series, whether a thriller like Severance or a comedy like Shrinking. That’s what to expect from Disclaimer, too. With so many big names involved in the project, there’s enormous pressure on the just-launched series to be a success. Still, all the attention helps pull in viewers. Disclaimer debuted at No. 2 on the JustWatch list of Top 10 TV shows this week. That’s impressive considering Apple just launched the show on Friday, though it actually hit the streaming service on Thursday night. Three Apple TV+ series made the Top 10 list this week.Photo: JustWatch Estimates from companies like JustWatch are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. If this immediate popularity gets piques your interest, the Apple TV+ summary says: “Acclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others. When she receives a novel from an unknown author, she is horrified to realize she is now the main character in a story that exposes her darkest secrets and threatens to destroy her family. “As Catherine races to uncover the writer’s true identity, she is forced to confront her past before it destroys her life and her relationships with her husband Robert (Baron Cohen) and son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The ensemble cast includes Kline, Lesley Manville, Louis Partridge, Leila George and Hoyeon, and features Indira Varma as the narrator.” The first two episodes of Disclaimer are ready to watch now on Apple TV+. The third will hit the streaming service on Friday. More Apple TV+ hit shows: Slow Horses and Bad Monkey Season 4 of Slow Horses stayed at the top of JustWatch’s popularity chart for another week. The series starring Gary Oldman has been a fixture of the chart since the debut in September. This week it sits at No. 7. The Apple TV+ summary says: “Slow Horses is a darkly humorous espionage drama that follows a dysfunctional team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 known un-affectionately as Slough House. Season four opens with a bombing that detonates personal secrets, rocking the already unstable foundations of Slough House.” The season finale premiered on Wednesday so all six episodes are ready to binge watch. And Apple’s crime comedy Bad Monkey starring Vince Vaughn also spent another week on the list most popular shows on streaming. The series about a former detective turned restaurant inspector solving an oddball murder in hopes of getting his old job back is at No. 10 on JustWatch’s chart. Its season finale also played on Wednesday so all ten episodes can be binged immediately. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming Disclaimer, Slow Horses, Bad Monkey, plus many other series or films comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes much more, of course. There’s a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
