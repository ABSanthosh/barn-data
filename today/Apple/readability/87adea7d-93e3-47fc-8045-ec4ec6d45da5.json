  "text": "$200 off a 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 Pro at B\u0026H - Image credit: Apple Save $200 when you buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro and 1TB of storage from B\u0026H, and save even more with Payboo. If you wanted to upgrade to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro, now's a great opportunity to do so. Thanks to the Black Friday sales on B\u0026H Photo, you can get a tasty $200 discount on this configuration. Available in a Space Black colorway at the reduced price, this version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro has the M4 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU. It's also got 24GB of unified memory, 1TB of storage, a standard finish display, and all-day battery life to go with its high performance. The normal price is $2,199, but for Black Friday, B\u0026H Photo is selling this configuration for $1,999, a $200 savings. However, if you're a Payboo card holder, there's a bit extra to sweeten the deal. In qualifying states, cardholders can secure an instant tax refund, or set up special financing offers. If this configuration isn't quite what you want from your next Mac upgrade, there's still hope. Check out our Black Friday deals page for more offers, as well as our Mac Price Guide.",
