  "description": "Macworld Apple’s 10th-generation iPad was introduced in October 2022. It gained a new colorful design with no Home button, USB-C instead of Lightning, a better camera, and a larger screen (10.9 inches up from 10.2 inches). The iPad mini was updated in October 2024. It costs $150/£150 more and offers a better processor and a slightly better display, and comes in a smaller package (which will either be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on your preference). In this guide, we will assess whether you should spend extra to get the iPad mini or spend less to buy the 10th gen iPad. If you are on the market for a new iPad and are wondering which one will be best for you read on to find out how the cheapest iPad options compare. There are various factors likely to impact your decision, including value for money, cameras, and how well the iPad in question will do the tasks you need it to do. There are also some pretty obvious differences: size, weight, and design–specifically the lack of a Home button on two of the three models we are considering here. We’ll start by examining what you get for your money. We also compare the 10th gen iPad and iPad Air and for even more help read our iPad Buying guide. iPad mini vs iPad: Which is the best value for money? When Apple introduced the 10th gen iPad in October 2022 it kept the 9th gen iPad (introduced in September 2021) on sale. But in May 2024, Apple discontinued the 9th gen iPad and lowered the price of the 10th gen iPad to $349/£349, making it the cheapest option.

See: Best iPad deals (10th gen) and Best iPad mini deals. You should also consider whether you want to pay for more storage. For example, Apple offers only two options for the 10th gen iPad, and it’s a considerable $150/£150 to upgrade to 256GB. For the iPad mini, the jump from 128GB to 256GB is $100/£100. Not a trivial increase.

The iPad and iPad mini are considered consumer-level products and Apple offers those products with colorful choices. Home button There is no Home button on the iPad mini or the 10th-gen iPad. They still use Touch ID (not Face ID) and it is still the simplest way to unlock the device, but now you tap your finger on the on/off switch at the top of the device. We think this is a superb solution, allowing Apple to give the iPad a larger display without increasing the size of the iPad. Relocating Touch ID from the Home button to the Power button will also be considered a bonus by those who prefer Touch ID over Face ID because of the simplicity and speed of using it. However, for some people the Home button is a familiar and simple way to navigate the iPad, and while it is possible to create a software version of the Home button in accessibility settings, some people won’t be prepared to wave goodbye to the Home button yet. If you aren’t ready to give it up then the 9th gen iPad is the only iPad with a Home button now. It’s discontinued, but you might be able to find it at third-party retailers or on Apple’s Certified Refurbished Store. Display The removal of the Home button does mean that both the iPad mini and the 10th gen iPad now have bigger displays than they did before. The iPad mini increased from 7.9 inches to 8.3 inches, while in 2022 the iPad screen grew from 10.2 inches to 10.9 inches. Despite the screen size increase, Apple has managed to keep the dimensions of the devices pretty much the same as the older models, so there is no real trade-off. You get a larger screen, but the device itself is practically the same size and weight. We’ll discuss the dimensions in more detail below. Obviously, the screen of the iPad mini is still smaller than that of the 10.9-inch iPad, but as we said above, some people will be looking for a smaller screen on a lighter device for a variety of reasons. If the thing that matters to you is screen size then the choice will be relatively simple, but if you are concerned about screen quality then there are differences to be considered. The iPad mini screen is superior to the 10th generation iPad. For one thing, the iPad mini benefits from a fully laminated display and anti-reflective coating, something shared with the iPad Air and iPad Pro. The standard iPad is the only iPad that lacks these features and it is at a disadvantage because of it. The non-laminated display just doesn’t give the same impression of quality. The iPad mini screen also trumps both iPads with denser pixels (326 ppi compared to 264 ppi) and it also boasts wide-color P3 gamut support while both iPads are just sRGB. But both iPads are limited to 500 nits max. Only the iPad Pro manages more than that. Cameras Both the iPad and iPad mini have a 12MP camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture. However, the iPad mini supports Smart HDR 4, which is Apple technology that combines multiple shots at different exposures to create an ideal image. The iPad uses Smart HDR 3, which is an older version of the technology. Both the iPad and iPad mini have a front camera for FaceTime calls or selfies. Both offer an Ultra Wide 12MP front camera with ƒ/2.4 aperture, 2x zoom, and support for Center Stage (a feature that keeps you in the frame even if you move around.). The iPad has relocated the front camera on the landscape side–much better suited to how people use their iPads during FaceTime calls. The iPad mini still has the camera on the portrait side. Apple Dimensions Despite every bit of technology in the iPad mini, if the screen is too small for you then you may prefer the iPad. However, for some the compact dimensions of the iPad mini are the main benefit. Recapping on those dimensions: iPad mini7.69 x 5.3 x .25 inches, .65 pounds195.4 x 134.8 x 6.2mm, 293g 10th gen iPad9.79 x 7.07 x .28 inches, 1.05 pounds248.6 x 179.5 x 7mm, 477g Ports and connectivity One final difference to mention: the iPad mini and the 10th gen iPad have a USB-C port, like the iPad Pro and Air models. The Lightning port is gone. If you are anything like us you probably have a house full of Lightning connectors and very few USB-C plugs, but there are benefits to USB-C, such as being able to attach an external display. The iPad mini and iPad also offers better connectivity options including Bluetooth, WiFi, and an option for 5G cellular. The last thing to mention is that the iPad mini works with the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the Apple Pencil Pro. The iPad is only compatible with the Apple Pencil 1. Verdict Our advice is that, if you have the money, buy the iPad mini, but if you don’t need the additional features that model brings, and you want to save money, the 10th gen iPad is still a great option (and if there are any deals on that model you’ll see them below). iPad mini (A17 Pro) prices Retailer Price $478 View Deal $499 View Deal $499 View Deal $499 View Deal $499 View Deal $499.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket iPad (10th generation) prices New Refurbished Retailer Price $299 View Deal $299 View Deal $299.99 View Deal $339 View Deal $339 View Deal $449 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price iPad 10.9 (2022) 64GB – Yellow – (WiFi) $288.09 View Deal iPad 10.9 (2022) 64GB – Blue – (WiFi) $304.44 View Deal iPad 10.9 (2022) 64GB – Silver – (WiFi) $305 View Deal $409.99 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket",

They still use Touch ID (not Face ID) and it is still the simplest way to unlock the device, but now you tap your finger on the on/off switch at the top of the device. We think this is a superb solution, allowing Apple to give the iPad a larger display without increasing the size of the iPad. Relocating Touch ID from the Home button to the Power button will also be considered a bonus by those who prefer Touch ID over Face ID because of the simplicity and speed of using it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for some people the Home button is a familiar and simple way to navigate the iPad, and while it is possible to \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672833/how-to-get-a-home-button-on-the-iphone.html\"\u003ecreate a software version of the Home button\u003c/a\u003e in accessibility settings, some people won’t be prepared to wave goodbye to the Home button yet.

The iPad mini increased from 7.9 inches to 8.3 inches, while in 2022 the iPad screen grew from 10.2 inches to 10.9 inches. Despite the screen size increase, Apple has managed to keep the dimensions of the devices pretty much the same as the older models, so there is no real trade-off. You get a larger screen, but the device itself is practically the same size and weight. We’ll discuss the dimensions in more detail below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, the screen of the iPad mini is still smaller than that of the 10.9-inch iPad, but as we said above, some people will be looking for a smaller screen on a lighter device for a variety of reasons. If the thing that matters to you is screen size then the choice will be relatively simple, but if you are concerned about screen quality then there are differences to be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe iPad mini screen is superior to the 10th generation iPad. For one thing, the iPad mini benefits from a fully laminated display and anti-reflective coating, something shared with the iPad Air and iPad Pro. The standard iPad is the only iPad that lacks these features and it is at a disadvantage because of it. The non-laminated display just doesn’t give the same impression of quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe iPad mini screen also trumps both iPads with denser pixels (326 ppi compared to 264 ppi) and it also boasts wide-color P3 gamut support while both iPads are just sRGB.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut both iPads are limited to 500 nits max. Only the iPad Pro manages more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3808486/ipad_mini_screen_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"iPad mini screen\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"cameras\"\u003eCameras\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the iPad and iPad mini have a 12MP camera with ƒ/1.8 aperture. However, the iPad mini supports Smart HDR 4, which is Apple technology that combines multiple shots at different exposures to create an ideal image. The iPad uses Smart HDR 3, which is an older version of the technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the iPad and iPad mini have a front camera for FaceTime calls or selfies. Both offer an Ultra Wide 12MP front camera with ƒ/2.4 aperture, 2x zoom, and support for Center Stage (a feature that keeps you in the frame even if you move around.). The iPad has relocated the front camera on the landscape side–much better suited to how people use their iPads during FaceTime calls.
