Mosyle is the only solution that integrates in a single professional-grade platform all the solutions necessary to seamlessly and automatically deploy, manage \u0026 protect Apple devices at work. Over 45,000 organizations trust Mosyle to make millions of Apple devices work-ready with no effort and at an affordable cost. Request your EXTENDED TRIAL today and understand why Mosyle is everything you need to work with Apple. Apple Business Manager (and School Manager) is Apple’s web-based portal that helps IT teams deploy and manage their Apple fleets at scale, ensuring automatic enrollment, configuration, and oversight of company-owned hardware that connects to their device management system of choice. Over the years, With a recent update, Apple Business Manager now provides IT administrators with additional visibility into released and replaced devices. This makes it easier to monitor when a device was removed, which person authorized the release, and whether a replacement device has been issued. About Apple @ Work: Bradley Chambers managed an enterprise IT network from 2009 to 2021. Through his experience deploying and managing firewalls, switches, a mobile device management system, enterprise grade Wi-Fi, 1000s of Macs, and 1000s of iPads, Bradley will highlight ways in which Apple IT managers deploy Apple devices, build networks to support them, train users, stories from the trenches of IT management, and ways Apple could improve its products for IT departments. Why this is an important update Compliance, audit tracking, and record-keeping are essential parts of IT management that often goes overlooked. This new feature means that teams can maintain and better document what’s happening inside of Apple School Manager and produce audit logs for compliance. Without proper oversight, gaps in device management can lead to security vulnerabilities, missing assets, or compliance violations. For IT teams, having clear, auditable records of device actions—who removed a device, when it was released from ownership, and what replaced it—helps maintain accountability and means that every piece of hardware remains under proper management. One of the biggest benefits of this update is improved oversight of how devices leave an organization’s ABM/ASM environment. Before this release, IT admins had limited visibility into when and how a device was released from ABM, often leading to confusion if the teams weren’t communicating. Now, admins can see whether a device was removed by an authorized user, an MDM solution, or an Apple Authorized Reseller—providing clear paper trail for each release and information about the why. In large organizations (especially for remote IT teams) where device replacement cycles are often ongoing, this feature streamlines IT asset management so that every new device is accounted for and properly assigned. It also reduces manual tracking efforts. Wrap up This might seem like a minor update to smaller teams, but I think this is a pretty important one. ABM/ASM are key parts of scaling Apple in the enterprise. These enhancements provide IT teams with the tools they better track everyone dealing with their entire fleet in a very automated way with auditable records. This probably could have been held for WWDC this summer, but I love that Apple has released it mid-cycle. Apple @ Work is exclusively brought to you by Mosyle, the only Apple Unified Platform.
