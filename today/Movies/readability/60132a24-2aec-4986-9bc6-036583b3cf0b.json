Here's the official trailer (+ two posters) for Disney+ Korea's series Hyper Knife, direct from YouTube: Disney+ series Hyper Knife follows Dr. Jung Se-ok (Park Eun-bin), a brilliant but disgraced neurosurgeon haunted by a past tragedy. Stripped of her medical license, she resorts to performing illegal surgeries in the shadows, driven by an insatiable thirst for pushing the boundaries of neuroscience. But when her path crosses with her former mentor, the renowned but enigmatic Dr. Choi Deok-hee (Sul Kyung-gu), old wounds are reopened and a dangerous game of power and revenge ensues. As Se-ok delves deeper into groundbreaking yet ethically questionable procedures, she grapples with the moral consequences of her actions, blurring the lines between medical necessity and personal ambition. Hyper Knife, also known as 하이퍼나이프 in Korean, is a series created and written by Kim Sun-hee. It's directed by the Korean filmmaker Kim Jung-hyun, also of the TV series \"At A Distance, Spring Is Green\", \"Crazy Love\", \"The Fabulous\", and \"Nineteen to Twenty\".
