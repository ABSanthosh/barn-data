Freeze frame: “Boy Meets World” and “Brotherly Love” star Matthew Lawrence was the latest celebrity to be revealed on Season 13 of Fox’s “The Masked Singer.” On the show’s Wednesday episode, Lawrence was unmasked as Paparazzo after performing “Unpretty,” by TLC. “Man, if you had told me that this little guy would still be standing here, I’d say you’re crazy. Because I’ve never sang before,” Lawrence said as Paparazzo in his pre-tape package. “And — big spoiler alert — the next song is the biggest hint to my identity yet. So listen closely.” That’s referring to Lawrence’s relationship with TLC member Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas. Popular on Variety For Paparazzo, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg got it right with Matthew Lawrence.
