  "text": "[Editor’s note: The following article contains some spoilers for both “Superman” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.”] It long ago became a familiar refrain for both this writer and plenty of other critics, journalists, film fans, and superhero stans: We’re done with origin stories. And while the ever-expanding nature of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the spruced-up DC version requires the seemingly constant addition of new heroes and new stories, which, in turn, mean more movies and TV shows that chronicle how these super-beings came to be, it’s time to call time on those heavy-hitter origin tales. We know why Batman is Batman, how Spider-Man became Spider-Man, and that Superman is an extraterrestrial. That’s a lesson that both of this summer’s big superheroic releases — James Gunn’s delightful DC franchise reset “Superman” and Matt Shakman’s less successful MCU entry “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” — both intrinsically understand and honor. Both films open after our titular heroes have become, well, heroes. Gunn’s film not only opens after his Clark Kent (David Corenswet) has crash-landed on Earth from his native Krypton, but also after he’s come to terms with his powers, grappled with growing up in Smallville, become Superman as we know him, moved to Metropolis, gotten a job at the Daily Planet, met Lois Lane, told Lois Lane who he is, and set about saving the world one squirrel at a time. That’s a tremendous amount of ground to cover and more than enough for its own film — or, as we’ve seen over the past 87 years the hero has been in the zeitgeist, more than enough for multiple films, TV series, shorts, radio plays, even a musical, and a little thing called comic books — and is simply not required anymore. Jumping into the Superman story in medias res doesn’t mean that we’re robbed of enjoying the building blocks of how something came to be, but that we get to enjoy the story from a different starting point. Seeing how Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan in Gunn’s film) reacts to discovering that Clark and Supes are the same person? That’s not nearly as interesting or fresh as watching her grapple with that dichotomy, over and over, and in different situations. Similarly, Gunn’s film doesn’t push any superhero-to-superhero meetings on the audience; instead, when Superman joins a fight alongside the so-called Justice Gang, we get to observe relationships that are already in place. What a relatively small touch — hey, these people know each other — that pays off big time. ‘Superman’Warner Bros. Gunn and company are in the midst of something of a DC reset, which affords them the opportunity to take on seemingly risky things like “not having to remind us that Superman is literally from space and also Clark Kent,” but even before this new iteration of DC screen lore, Warner Bros. was starting to dip its rubberized wings into less origin-centric superhero stories. Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” (which is, and we’re getting deep here, not actually part of the overall DC superhero franchise, but is its own thing, called the quite-chewy “Batman Epic Crime Saga”) similarly works off a baseline understanding of the Caped Crusader (Robert Pattinson). And while, yes, Bruce Wayne’s beloved dead parents and their horrific deaths are included in the film, it doesn’t play out as a traditional origin story. Consider it a happy side effect of the film’s earliest incarnations, when Ben Affleck was going to direct and star in his own Batman movie, after his Bruce had already been “introduced” in other DCEU films. For once, development hell has rewards. Much like “Superman,” Shakman’s “Fantastic Four” opens four years (you get it, right?) after the titular superhero family was turned into cosmically powered individuals after a spaceflight gone bad. Because of the alternate Earth the fab four inhabit, the energetic opening of Shakman’s MCU film not only gets to show off the superhero clan, but the retrofuturistic world they protect. It’s the highlight of the film, a zippy and genuinely fun way to introduce the group (including Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn) within the confines of their kitschy planet (which is also, incidentally, filled to bursting with citizens who adore them). ‘The Fantastic Four: First Steps’Disney/Marvel Cleverly packaged as a TV chat show introduction to the famous group, Shakman finds the space to introduce the heroes, their world, and even show off some of their exploits (from befriending Mole Man to vanquishing, as best we can tell, a bunch of super-smart apes). For fans of the comic book heroes, it’s an opening full of classic storylines and some “hey, I get that reference!” nods. For newbies, it’s a whiz-bang trip through lore that sets up the story to come. Mostly, it’s refreshing. Consider this year’s other MCU entries, including “Captain America: Brave New World” and “Thunderbolts,” both of which require a high level of franchise knowledge to really stick, including the consumption of multiple movies and TV shows (and, and this is essential, a solid memory when it applies to all of them). If you’re an MCU fan, that’s a lot of time spent to “get” a film or two. If you’re just a casual watcher of the movies, it’s nearly insurmountable. Let’s stop that now. “Superman” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” lead the way. That’s heroics we can get behind. Both “Superman” and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” are now in theaters.",

What a relatively small touch — hey, these people know each other — that pays off big time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"680\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"\u0026#39;Superman\u0026#39;\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg 680w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=300,158 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=189,100 189w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=600,317 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=474,250 474w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=244,129 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=568,300 568w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=180,95 180w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=76,40 76w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=50,26 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=47,25 47w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=284,150 284w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=150,79 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=110,58 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=285,150 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=320,169 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GvmrpyDWEAASzOW.jpg?resize=640,338 640w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Superman’\u003ccite\u003eWarner Bros.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGunn and company are in the midst of something of a DC reset, which affords them the opportunity to take on seemingly risky things like “not having to remind us that Superman is literally from space and also Clark Kent,” but even before this new iteration of DC screen lore, Warner Bros. was starting to dip its rubberized wings into less origin-centric superhero stories. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-batman-review-2022-1234702878/\"\u003eMatt Reeves’ “The Batman”\u003c/a\u003e (which is, and we’re getting deep here, not actually part of the overall DC superhero franchise, but is its own thing, called the quite-chewy “Batman Epic Crime Saga”) similarly works off a baseline understanding of the Caped Crusader (Robert Pattinson). And while, yes, Bruce Wayne’s beloved dead parents and their horrific deaths are included in the film, it doesn’t play out as a traditional origin story. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsider it a happy side effect of the film’s earliest incarnations, when Ben Affleck was going to direct and star in his own Batman movie, \u003cem\u003eafter \u003c/em\u003ehis Bruce had already been “introduced” in other DCEU films. For once, development hell has rewards.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like “Superman,” Shakman’s “Fantastic Four” opens four years (you get it, right?) after the titular superhero family was turned into cosmically powered individuals after a spaceflight gone bad. Because of the alternate Earth the fab four inhabit, the energetic opening of Shakman’s MCU film not only gets to show off the superhero clan, but the retrofuturistic world they protect. It’s the highlight of the film, a zippy and genuinely fun way to introduce the group (including Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Joseph Quinn) within the confines of their kitschy planet (which is also, incidentally, filled to bursting with citizens who adore them).\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"579\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-04-at-8.29.12%E2%80%AFAM.png?w=650\" alt=\"\u0026#39;The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u0026#39;\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘The Fantastic Four: First Steps’\u003ccite\u003eDisney/Marvel\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCleverly packaged as a TV chat show introduction to the famous group, Shakman finds the space to introduce the heroes, their world, and even show off some of their exploits (from befriending Mole Man to vanquishing, as best we can tell, a bunch of super-smart apes). For fans of the comic book heroes, it’s an opening full of classic storylines and some “hey, I get that reference!” nods. For newbies, it’s a whiz-bang trip through lore that sets up the story to come. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMostly, it’s \u003cem\u003erefreshing\u003c/em\u003e.
