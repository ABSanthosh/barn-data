  "text": "Author and journalist Liz Plank is distancing herself from her podcast co-host Justin Baldoni‘s following the serious allegations Baldoni has faced from his It Ends with Us co-star Blake Lively. “I’m writing to you today to let you know that I have had my representatives inform Wayfarer that I will no longer be co-hosting The Man Enough podcast,” Plank wrote in a message to fans. “Thank you for trusting me with your hearts and stories, for holding space for mine, and for making this show what it was. I will miss you, the listeners, so much. I love what this community created together with every fiber of my being, and that’s because of you.” Launched in 2021, Man Enough “explores what it means to be a man today and how rigid gender roles have affected all people.” Plank co-hosted it with Baldoni and Jamey Heath, CEO of Baldoni’s Wayfarer Studios. Watch on Deadline Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer were all named In Blake’s Dec. 20 complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, which alleges a toxic work environment of sexual harassment on the set of It All Ends With Us and accuses Baldoni and his PR team of a deliberate smear campaign after the movie’s release. “As this chapter closes for me, I remain committed to the values we’ve built together,” Plank continued. “Thank you for being here, for trusting me, and for being by my side for the last four years. We all deserve better, and I know that together, we can create it. I will have more to share soon as I continue to process everything that has happened.In the meantime, I will continue to support everyone who calls out injustice and holds the people standing in their way accountable.” Also, today, Baldoni’s Voices Of Solidarity Award from a non-profit supporting women was rescinded. Meanwhile, Lively has garnered strong support from It All Ends With Us author Colleen Hoover, along with a load of Hollywood A-listers, including Amber Heard, Amy Schumer, Paul Feig, Gwyneth Paltrow, her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants co-stars and many more.
