  "text": "Barbie 2 is in the works, according to a new report from THR. What do we know about Barbie 2? According to THR’s report, Barbie 2 is in the “early stages” of development, with filmmaking couple Greta Gerwig — who co-wrote and directed the original film — and Noah Baumbach described to have “hatched an idea for” a new movie, with the pair already bringing it to Warner Bros. However, in an interesting twist, reps for both Warner Bros. and Gergwig/Baumbach said that there was no such sequel planned. “There is no legitimacy to this reporting,” said Gerwig and Baumbach’s rep, with Warner Bros.’ representative adding that “THR’s reporting is inaccurate.” THR’s report notes that if a deal comes together, the pair will begin work on the project following each of their own respective upcoming films. Baumbach is working on the upcoming film Jay Kelly for Netflix that Gerwig stars in alongside an all-star ensemble, while Gerwig is also working on a film for Netflix, her planned Chronicles of Narnia adaptation. 2023’s Barbie film was a massive success for Warner Bros. Discovery. The film starred Margot Robbie in the titular role, with Ryan Gosling playing the role of Ken, and became the highest-grossing film of 2023 and the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time, earning more than $1.4 billion at the global box office. The film followed the story of Barbie as she found her way into the real world, and went on a journey of self-discovery through Barbieland as a result. Other stars in the film included America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, Hari Nef, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lipa, and more. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Gosling), and won Best Original Song for Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” (Source: The Hollywood Reporter)",
