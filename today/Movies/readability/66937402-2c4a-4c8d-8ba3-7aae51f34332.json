  "text": "It’s no secret to state that Hollywood is brutal — but it makes a difference who’s saying it. Far from the glossy and decorated “La La Land” or quick-witted “Hacks” there is “Leads,” director Bryan Poyser’s ode to pounding the pavement when it might be crumbling under you — and one actress and her brother’s persistence throughout. The film‘s title has multiple meanings; the treacherous showbiz terminology that divides performers into leading and non-leading roles, and leads like tips, indicators, opportunities for the future. Both kinds of leads end up tormenting Mags (Heather Kafka) and Merritt Malloy (Justin Arnold) when the latter comes banging on his sister’s door to run from his problems. “Leads” looks and feels like a true indie, with a small cast, few locations, and a clear-cut visual language — pretty much all of which hinges upon Kafka to carry it home. From the very first shots of her face as Mags directs an acting class, Kafka is vulnerable and meticulous with her portrayal. The part calls for a 49-year-old actress who once led a film at Sundance, who is terrified that the peak of her career and existence is behind her — the kind of role that anyone with more fame or less experience couldn’t handle. Kafka bolsters Mags with her own decades of industry experience, from indie leads to the skills picked up as a supporting player. Then there’s Arnold, who bursts onto the screen as a fully-formed chaotic uncle (Mags is also single mother to a seven-year-old), fleshed out and instantly familiar. Not only does he explode into his sister’s life sporting an injured wrist and rotting fish (unrelated), but he asks to stay a while and ends up joining the acting class as her student. He befriends every student, catches the acting bug himself, and continues to champion his sister’s career, all while nurturing his own artistic dreams and sitting on the truth of what brought him to her door in the first place. ‘Leads’ The duo’s sibling dynamic drives the film, thanks to Poyser’s credible script and character work. Again, this is a no-frills movie — including the perilous frill that is expository dialogue. Along with cinematographer Ellie Ann Fenton, he finds striking and intimate ways to shoot the actors without gratuitous flare. It’s hard to make a film that’s even remotely about actors or acting without veering towards self importance, but “Leads” is never in such danger. Whether its Mags, Merritt, star student Alisha (Aaliyah Tardio) or any of her peers, the film treats its central craft with the same wonder as those young pupils on screen discovering every tool and impulse afresh. And in an increasingly tense industry, Poyser also demonstrates the power of independent cinema and the resourcefulness and passion that measure a project’s success long before box office receipts. He used footage from his own shelved projects, original songs by Arnold, photos from Kafka’s career, and his real-life acting students. It’s a brutal business, but if you love the work, quitting isn’t an option — no matter how big or small the part. Grade: B “Leads” premiered at the 2025 Tribeca Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.
