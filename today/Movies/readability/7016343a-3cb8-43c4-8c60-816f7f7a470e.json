  "text": "Below are The 1% Club questions and answers for Australia Season 3 for 2025. Like the UK and US versions of the popular game show, this AUS variant on Seven Network (and 7plus) poses questions that get harder and harder over the course of the episode. But since these brain-teasers are based on common sense and logic, contestants can figure out the solution without needing to know that much trivia. Comedian Jim Jefferies returns as the host for the third season. Here’s a list of every question and answer for the 2025 Australian episodes of The 1% Club. List of The 1% Club (AUS) questions and answers for 2025 The following is a breakdown of The 1% Club questions and answers for each episode in AUS Season 3. They are placed in chronological order with the answers hidden (click on the arrows below each question to reveal the solution). You can also use the quick list below to advance to the exact episode you want the answers for. We’ll update this guide as more episodes in the third season are released. (Note: It’s unclear why Episode 2 is the first episode of the season, but it’s officially labelled as S03E02 on 7plus so that’s what we’re going with. The same goes for Episode 4, which aired second.) Episode 2 – January 28, 2025 Episode 4 – April 27, 2025 Episode 6 – May 4, 2025 Episode 5 – May 11, 2025 Episode 2 Questions and Answers – January 28, 2025 90% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Which of these animal pictures isn’t possible? [image above] Answer to 90% Question – A. [I mean, I suppose someone could transplant a koala to the ice caps, but the koala shouldn’t be a climate next to polar bears.] 80% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Al accidentally fell asleep in the sun with his left hand on his chest. When he woke up, what shape was his sunburn? [image above] Answer to 80% Question – A. B and D are imprints of his right hand in different positions, and C is a foot. Only A is the silhouette of his left hand. 70% Question \u0026 Answer Q: If Sydney and Canberra were to swap names, the Opera House would be in Canberra and the Federal Parliament would meet in Sydney. In this case, the Melbourne Cricket Ground would be in which city? Answer to 70% Question – MELBOURNE. The MCG would still be in Melbourne, unaffected by Sydney and Canberra swapping names.[Yep, it’s a trick question.] 60% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Are there more chickens or eggs in this image? Answer to 60% Question – CHICKENS. Because the chicken comes both first and last in this image of alternating chickens and eggs, there must be one more chicken than eggs. 50% Question \u0026 Answer Q: Bill’s glass is half full. Ben’s is half empty. Bill drinks half of what’s in Ben’s glass and Ben throws half of what’s in Bill’s glass in Bill’s face. Ben empties his glass into Bill’s glass. How full is Bill’s glass now? Answer to 50% Question – HALF. After Bill drinks half Ben’s glass and Ben throw out half Bill’s glass, both glasses are now a quarter full. Adding these together brings Bill’s glass back to half full. 40% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Ozzie the Postie is in an odd state.

Answer to 25% Question – MARY.

[image above] Answer to 20% Question – C. 15% Question \u0026 Answer Q: The times on these clocks are a code to the name of which Australian city? 1:04 5:12 1:09 4:05 Answer to 15% Question – ADELAIDE.

It is not allowed to be loaded above the top of the bin rim. How many 2 metre long, 1 metre wide and 5cm thick plywood sheets will it take before the bin is no longer empty? Answer to 10% Question – ONE. As soon as a sheet is placed into the bin, it is no longer empty. [It’s another trick question!] 5% Question \u0026 Answer Q: (Skipped since only one contestant was left in the show.) 1% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Reiki is playing with her home-made dartboard. She has 4 darts and needs to score exactly 25. She must hit the board with all 4 darts, not land on a number more than once, AND NOT in a segment next to where another has landed. What 4 numbers will win it for Reiki? [image above] Answer to 1% Question – 4, 5, 7, 9. 4 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. [This isn’t that hard, but can you get it within the time limit?] Episode 4 Questions and Answers – April 27, 2025 90% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Say what you see to reveal the name of both a Marvel superhero and a triathlon event.

Each twin has two arms AND each chair has two arms. 50% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Sophie runs two businesses but can only afford to advertise one on her van. She’s come up with a clever plan though. She sells sandwiches when the side door is closed. What does she sell when the side door is open? [image above] Answer to 50% Question – Sand. [When the door is open the sign becomes Sophie Sells Sand Here.] 40% Question \u0026 Answer Q: Ebony and Shellie are spending $1,500 a quarter on electricity. Shellie comes up with the bright idea of installing their own wind turbine. The turbine will cost $36,000 to install and then nothing for electricity after that. In how many years will the turbine have paid for itself? Answer to 40% Question – 6 years. If Shellie and Ebony are spending $1,500 a quarter, then the maths is: $1,500 x 4 = $6,000 a year. $36,000 divided by $6,000 = 6 years to pay for itself. 35% Question \u0026 Answer Q: The writers think Jim comes to work with his top on backwards too often. Which of these nonsense words is the odd one out? PMUJSUIT, DRACIGAN, SKIBIDIE, DNAHBAGS, UORTSERS Answer to 35% Question – SKIBIDIE. Reversing the first four letters of each creates an English word, except of SKIBIDIE. [PMUJSUIT becomes JUMPSUIT, DRACIGAN becomes CARDIGAN, DNAHBAGS becomes HANDBAGS and UORTSERS becomes TROUSERS.] 30% Question \u0026 Answer Q: Allegra has just turned 40. She has four children: Anni, Cat, Bo and Mac. Her twins were born when she was 26. Bo is 16. He is younger than Anni. Who are the twins? Answer to 30% Question – Cat and Mac. As Bo is 16, Allegra was 24 when she had him, so he is not a twin. Neither is Anni, who is older than Bo. This leaves Mac and Cat as the twins. 25% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: What three-word phrase describes how this man is feeling is suggested by his position below? [image above] Answer to 25% Question – UNDER THE WEATHER. 20% Question \u0026 Answer Q: What is the only letter of the English alphabet, from a to z, to be unjustly and vindictively excluded from this question?

[image above] Answer to 15% Question – 31. 10% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: If these two dice continue to roll in the directions indicated by the arrows, what will the upward faces total at the end? [image above] Answer to 10% Question – 5. [The top dice rolls four times, leading to the same number, a 1. The bottom dice rolls to the side, putting the 4 on the bottom, and then goes up twice to show the 4 on top.] 5% Question \u0026 Answer Q: After matching online, Astrid, 32, meets up with Ed for a date. Only he looks twice as old as he does in the photo he used. When asked his age he says: “I’m really the same age as you… plus half my age.” How old is Ed? Answer to 5% Question – 64.

Phoebe found the most, so got 4 more eggs than Walter as a reward. How many eggs did Walter end up with? Answer to 40% Question – 8 eggs. If you take Phoebe’s 4 bonus eggs from the total 20 there are sixteen left. These are evenly divided between Phoebe and Walter, so Walter will end up with 8. [The mathematical formula would be x + (x – 4) = 20.] 35% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Which of these is an extra piece, not needed to complete this photo? [image above] (A), (B), (C), or (D) Answer to 35% Question – D.

The straw house cost $10 to build, the stick house $50 and the brick house $90, but the WolfAway Solar house cost just 50% more than the average non-WolfAway pig home. What did the fourth pig pay? Answer to 30% Question – $75. With prices of $10, $50, and $90, the average price of the non-WolfAway pig homes is $50. Adding 50% of $50 makes the cost $75. 25% Question \u0026 Answer [Image Credit: 7plus] Q: Which line at the bottom is a continuation of the line at the top?

[Don’t forget the question mark at the end of the question in the circle.] 15% Question \u0026 Answer Q: Which little word, hidden amongst these wordy words, does not contain any letter that is contained in the words “THE ONE PERCENT CLUB”?

Based on the position of the balls that are left on the table, what number ball is Smellson about to pot? [image above] Answer to 5% Question – 12.
