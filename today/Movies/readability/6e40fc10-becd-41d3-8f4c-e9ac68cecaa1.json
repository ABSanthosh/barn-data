Starring Judy Greer, Alexander Skarsgård, Alison Pill, Paul Sparks, and Tracy Letts. This is finally opening in April this spring. It seems like it's very similar to Mass and We Need to Talk About Kevin. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Michael Shannon's film Eric LaRue, direct from YouTube: In the film, Janice (Greer) is coping with the fallout after her son murders three of his school classmates. Struggling \u0026 moving through life as if in a haze, she is unable to let go of her anger \u0026 frustration. While her husband (Skarsgård) has found refuge at a new church, Janice finds it hard to seek solace in her faith despite her pastor's pleas to heal her wounds by meeting with the mothers of her son's victims. As Janice ponders what that meeting could achieve for her and her community, Eric LaRue asks us to witness the frayed emotional ripples that violent acts can engender. Eric LaRue is directed by the American actor / filmmaker Michael Shannon, making his feature directorial debut with this. The screenplay is written by Brett Neveu, based on his own play. Produced by Sarah Green, Karl Hartman, and Jina Panebianco. This initially premiered at the 2023 Tribeca Film Festival a few years ago. Magnolia will debut Shannon's Eric LaRue film in select US theaters on April 4th, 2025, then on VOD starting April 11th. Visit the film's site.
