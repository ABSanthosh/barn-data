Brent Bozell III, founder of the conservative watchdog group Media Research Center, is Donald Trump‘s choice to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the agency that oversees U.S. broadcast entities like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. Trump wrote on Truth Social, “As Founder and President of the Media Research Center for 38 years, few understand the Global Media landscape in print, television, and online better than Brent. He and his family have fought for the American principles of Liberty, Freedom, Equality, and Justice for generations, and he will ensure that message is heard by Freedom-loving people around the World. Brent will bring some much needed change to the U.S. Agency for Global Media.” Bozell also was the founder of the Parents Television Council, which long called out and filed FCC complaints over what it characterized as indecent content on the public airwaves. Watch on Deadline The CEO position requires Senate confirmation. He would succeed Amanda Bennett, who resigned this week. Earlier, Trump said that he would name Kari Lake to lead the Voice of America, but her appointment has to be approved by the seven-member International Broadcasting Advisory Board. During Trump’s first term, he selected Michael Pack, a documentary filmmaker, to lead the U.S. Agency for Global Media. But his tenure was tumultuous, as he fired the leaders of some of the broadcast entities and installed Trump loyalists. A 1994 international broadcasting law “prohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news,” per the VOA. Bozell’s son, Leo Brent Bozell, was among those pardoned this week by Trump for their roles in storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
