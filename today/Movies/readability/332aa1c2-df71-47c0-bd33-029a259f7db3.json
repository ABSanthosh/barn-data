  "text": "Carl Dean, Dolly Parton‘s little-seen but often talked-about husband of six decades, has died, the singer announced Monday on social media. He was 82. “Carl and I spent many wonderful years together,” Parton wrote in an Instagram post. “Words can’t do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years. Thank you for your prayers and sympathy.” A statement added, “He will be laid to rest in a private ceremony with immediate family attending. He was survived by his siblings Sandra and Donnie. … The family has asked for privacy during this difficult time.” Dean has been a subject of fan fascination since the beginning of Parton’s career, never attending events with the superstar and rarely even seen in photographs, with Parton always insisting that their mutual agreement on his staying out of the limelight helped the relationship stay together. Parton and Dean were married on May 30, 1966 in Ringhold, Georgia, with Parton’s mother in attendance, two years after they began dating, which began when she was 18. Dean was rarely sighted with her even in the early years of their marriage, before she became a country-pop and music/screen crossover sensation. Popular on Variety When they met at a laundromat almost immediately after her arrival in Nashville, Parton said, “I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me). He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about.” “A lot of people say there’s no Carl Dean, that he’s just somebody I made up to keep other people off me,” she acknowledged in an interview with the Associated Press in 1984, adding that she wished she could talk him into doing a photo shoot. In 2015, she explained to Parade, “I married a really good man, a guy that’s completely different from me… He loves to hear about the things I do. I love to hear about the things he does. So we enjoy each other’s company. We get along good.” In 2016, in honor of their 50th anniversary, Parton’s website devoted a page to the couple ( including a very rare photo of the two together, with Dean smooching her on the cheek in what appears to be the ’70s or ’80s ), saying they had “enjoyed 50 years of wedded bliss despite facing many of life’s obstacles common to most married couples and plenty of unique challenges all their own.” The page added that Dolly and Carl have lived happily-ever-after for 50 years. They’ve loved and supported each other while respecting each other’s independence… While one would think Dolly would be the most entertaining of the two, she often says that it’s Carl’s unique sense of humor which keeps her laughing. Given Dolly’s larger-than-life outlook on everything, it makes perfect sense that her one-and-only would be equally as special in every way.” In a 2012 interview with TV station WRCB in Tennessee, Parton went into greater detail about the circumstances of getting married to Dean. “I met him the day I got to Nashville, and we dated for two years,” she said then. “At that time, I was working with Fred Foster, who owned Monument Records and Combine Music. He was going to put some money behind me, to make me a star…. I was engaged,” she said, and the label head “asked me not to get married. He said it’ll make it so much harder if you’re married with all this promotion,” adds Dolly. My mother-in-law had already sent out invitations. It broke her heart because I said we had to call the wedding off.”    “But we went that next weekend, sneaked out because we didn’t want to go anywhere close by, like in Bryson City, North Carolina. So we thought Ringgold because we knew that was where you could get your license and get married the same day. And they said, ‘You have to get married in the courthouse.’ I said, ‘I am not getting married in the courthouse. I am getting married in the church’.” “I said, ‘I’ve got to have momma there’,” she continued. “So I had bought a little dress, momma had bought me a Bible, some flowers on it. We grabbed momma and went back, and got married on a Monday, in a church. We found a pastor, (and although) neither one of us were Baptist, my dad’s people were, so I’d been to a lot of Baptist churches. So we got married in the Baptist there. … We took momma back to the bus station in Chattanooga so she could ride on back to Knoxville, so she wouldn’t be on our so-called honeymoon, which was a few hours, (since) we both had to go back to work the next morning.” Parton told the station that she and her husband often revisited Ringgold, the site of their wedding, on their May 30 anniversary. “We try to go down there every year if we can,” Dolly says. “We at least go every three years. We take a trip down there and take a picnic… Chattanooga’s great, we love Lookout Mountain, we love doing all that. When we go to Ringgold, we just kind of make that a whole weekend trip.”  How Parton and her husband were able to go on driving trips in rural areas, as claimed, was a source of fascination for fans. But, she insisted, “They never know that we’re there. We have a little RV camper that we travel around in. We stop and I’m not totally in my rhinestones. I put on little makeup for my husband, I usually have my own hair, just put it up in a little scrunchy or something. But you wouldn’t think about it; you just don’t see me,. But if you hear me and see me up close, you know it’s me.” A stage musical Parton has written about her life story is bound for Broadway in 2026, with a first tryout run scheduled to premiere in Nashville in August. Parton has not discussed in detail which aspects of her life the musical will cover, so fans have been curious about how, or if, the relationship with Dean will be portrayed. Parton’s website said that she wrote the song “From Here to the Moon and Back” with Dean in mind, and singled out these lyrics: “”From here to the moon and back / Who else in this world will love you like that? / Love everlasting, I promise you that / From here to the moon and back.”",
