  "text": "Porsha Williams gave some insight on The Real Housewives of Atlanta into when she found out her cousin, Londie Favors, had died. On the episode from Sunday, June 29, Williams shared with co-star Phaedra Parks that Favors was on the phone with her sister Lauren when she died. “Dealing with he loss of my cousin Londie… I’m going through a lot emotionally while being there for my family. She meant so much to all of us. So it’s pretty difficult,” Williams said in a confessional. In the scene at Parks’ house, Lauren said, “I’m just numb. We’re like sisters. We grew up… we were babies together.” Watch on Deadline “So you know they were on the phone,” Williams told Parks. “She actually transionted while you were on the phone?” Parks asked Lauren. “Yeah,” Lauren said. In a confessional, Williams revealed, “I was at work and I got some news that Londie was in distress and within an hour or two we had lost Londie. She was just the most giving person you could ever think of.” Favors had been featured throughout the current season of RHOA, working closely with Williams, planning events around her brand, and assisting her in her multiple ventures. Williams’ cousin was also featured on the RHOA spinoff Porsha’s Family Matters, which ran for one season on Bravo in 2022. “God has given us strength because He knows that her mom and sister wouldn’t be able to do all this right now,” Williams said before mentioning she and her sister were planning Favors’ funeral. Favors died in August 2024, and in the previous episode, Williams told Parks she wouldn’t be able to attend an event she had organized following news of her cousin. “It just was so sudden — so difficult,” Williams said during a confessional. “Londie was just the most giving person you could ever think of. [She was] a loyal person, the most creative with her company. She did so much for my grandfather’s foundation. The most honest person you can ever think of. It’s just a huge loss.” The episode wraps up with a title card: “In Loving Memory. Yolanda “Londie” Favors. 1989-2024.” Londie Favors Bravo",
