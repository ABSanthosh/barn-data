  "text": "Carmelo Anthony is joining the roster at NBC Sports and Peacock as a studio analyst for the network’s revitalized NBA coverage. Appearing Saturday on NBC Sports’ coverage of the Kentucky Derby, the 10x NBA All-Star announced that he is expected to be in the studio one or more nights per week starting in October, reporting on the 2025-’26 season throughout the playoffs. “A new chapter begins @NBAonNBC this fall,” wrote Anthony on X with a video teasing his new gig. Watch on Deadline After more than two decades on other networks, NBA makes its return to NBC this fall. Anthony recalled the influence the network’s coverage had on him as a child. “Watching the NBA on NBC growing up shaped my love for the game,” he said. “Now, I’m thrilled to join the NBC Sports family. I’ve always used my platform to help grow the game, and I’m excited to bring fans a fresh perspective as we usher in a new era of NBA coverage and programming.” During Saturday’s broadcast, Anthony said he’s most excited to be “just building a team, getting back into a team-oriented aspect,” following the news that Jamal Crawford and Reggie Miller will join NBA on NBC game analysts. Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle will also serve as play-by-play analysts. “Talking the game, speaking the game, figuring out what’s the ‘why’ on what a lot of people are doing, what a lot of players are doing in the game,” added Anthony. “The game within the game, I think, needs to be talked about.” Anthony, who was drafted as the Denver Nuggets’ first-round pick in 2003, ended his 19-season NBA career in 2022 with the Los Angeles Lakers. Since retiring, he’s gone on to discuss the league on his 7PM in Brooklyn with Carmelo Anthony podcast.",
