The executive was previously EVP Marketing for the China-based promotion and marketing division that’s dedicated to releasing Legendary and third-party content in the territory. She is replacing outgoing CEO Sirena Lu. In her new role, Mu will expand the company’s reach by infusing local audience insights into the marketing of its premium films and TV series. She will report to Legendary CEO Joshua Grode. With more than 22 years of experience in film marketing, creative advertising and integrated media strategy, Mu has been recognized for her ability to combine the Hollywood and domestic Chinese film markets. Since joining Legendary East in 2016, she has been credited with elevating Hollywood IP in China through her pioneering precision marketing, audience-first localization strategies and cross-sector brand collaborations. She has overseen 12 Legendary film campaigns in China, with box office grosses topping $1.34 billion. Notable titles include Warcraft, which set the record for highest-grossing imported film at the time; Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the top imported film of 2024; and A Minecraft Movie, the leading import of 2025 so far. Other Legendary campaigns she has led include those for Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, Godzilla vs. Kong and both Dune and Dune: Part Two. “Di Mu has been an invaluable member of Legendary East playing an integral role in the execution of the local marketing campaigns of our successful films in China,” Grode said. “Her knowledge of the local market combined with her creativity and leadership skills make her an ideal leader for our next chapter in the region.” Watch on Deadline Said Mu, “I am proud of the success we at Legendary have had thus far, bringing some of the world’s biggest films to Chinese audiences in new ways that feel authentic and resonant. As we move forward with this new phase, I am excited to continue bridging our cultures, leveraging my local experience and relationships to strengthen Legendary’s reputation as a market leader.” Legendary Entertainment’s upcoming films include live action-animation hybrid comedy Animal Friends, starring Ryan Reynolds, Jason Momoa, Aubrey Plaza and Dan Levy; Dune: Part Three; the adaptation of iconic game Street Fighter; the untitled Alejandro G. Iñárritu film starring Tom Cruise; and a new entry in the Monsterverse franchise.",
