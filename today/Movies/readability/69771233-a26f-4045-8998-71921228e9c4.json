  "text": "Fans of Liam Neeson were surprised to learn that the classic thriller Non-Stop (2014) is leaving Netflix, prompting many to ask where to find it next. The film follows a U.S. air marshal who receives threats against his passengers unless $150 million is transferred to an offshore account. As the departure date nears, fans are eager for updates on when Non-Stop will leave Netflix and where to watch it afterward. Here are the latest updates on the movie: When will Liam Neeson’s Non-Stop leave Netflix? It’s official: Liam Neeson’s Non-Stop is leaving Netflix on January 1, 2025. Non-Stop is an essential watch for all Liam Neeson enthusiasts. However, don’t delay your viewing, as this iconic thriller will depart from Netflix on January 1, 2025. Sadly, the new year won’t bring this film back, as Netflix has opted to take it down. So, gather your friends and family for an adrenaline-pumping experience before Non-Stop leaves the platform. Where can you watch Non-Stop after it leaves Netflix? Currently, no streaming platform has taken over the rights to the 2014 movie Non-Stop. No streaming service has been announced to acquire the rights for this film after its removal from Netflix. It is speculated that these rights may be obtained by other platforms, as several options exist. Given that Universal Pictures distributed the film, it may eventually become available on Peacock. However, neither Peacock nor any media reports have confirmed this possibility. As of now, this remains a hopeful prediction rather than a confirmed outcome. Non-Stop (2014) is a gripping mystery-action thriller directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. The intense film, co-produced by renowned Joel Silver, features standout performances from Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the lead roles. The film performed remarkably at the box office, earning over $222 million globally on a $50 million budget. Filming started at York Studios in Maspeth, Queens, New York City. It later moved to JFK Airport and Long Island MacArthur Airport. The cast includes Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy, Michelle Dockery, Nate Parker, Jason Butler Harner, and Anson Mount.",
