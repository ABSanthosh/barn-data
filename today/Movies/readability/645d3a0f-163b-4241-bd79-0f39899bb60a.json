  "description": "\"It's time to play one last time...\" Here we go again! Netflix has unveiled the teaser trailer for Squid Game 3, the third (and final!!) season of the hit Korean thriller series Squid Game from 2021. The second season debuted last December though it's just half of a story - Netflix decided to split it up and play it out across these two final seasons. Squid Game 3 drops on Netflix worldwide in June this summer. Hundreds of cash-strapped players accept a strange invitation to play a series of games. A very tempting cash prize awaits with deadly high stakes: a whopping ₩45.6 billion prize for whoever can stay alive until the end. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk writes and directs and seems poised to hit us hard at the end. Squid Game 3's cast features Lee Jung-jae as 456, Lee Byung-hun as The Front Man, Yim Si-wan, Kang Ha-neul, Wi Ha-jun, Park Gyu-young, Park Sung-hoon, Yang Dong-geun, Kang Ae-sim, Jo Yuri, Lee David, Roh Jae-won. After the brutal second season, where 456 had trouble changing anyone's mind, will they finally really end this vicious game? Or will it go on forever? This is a rather chilling no-dialogue teaser. I can't wait […]",
