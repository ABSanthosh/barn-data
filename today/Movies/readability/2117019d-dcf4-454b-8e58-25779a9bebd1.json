Directed by David Schurmann, the story follows the meeting between a penguin, rescued from an oil spill, and a heartbroken fisherman. The penguin and fisherman soon form a friendship that brings a positive aura to the latter’s life. The Jesse Eisenberg-directed film, A Real Pain, will be available on Hulu starting January 16. Starring Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin as cousins, the story follows their reunion for a tour in Poland to honor their grandmother. However, underlying tensions and their contrasting personalities threaten to complicate the journey. Also dropping this week on Hulu is Toilet Bound Hanako-kun Season 2.
