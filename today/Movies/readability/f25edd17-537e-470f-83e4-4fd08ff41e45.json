  "text": "Black Panther alum Danai Gurira has officially signed on to join the Matchbox cast for the upcoming live-action film adaptation of Mattel Films’ real-world die-cast car toy line of the same name. At the moment, further details about The Walking Dead star’s character are still undisclosed. “The story is described as an action-packed, globetrotting adventure that centers on a group of childhood friends who must work together to stop an impending worldwide disaster and rediscover their friendship along the way,” reads the initial synopsis. Who is in the Matchbox cast? The live-action Matchbox movie will be led by John Cena (Peacemaker), Jessica Biel (Candy), Sam Richardson (Ted Lasso), Teyonah Parris (WandaVision), and Arturo Castro (Broad City). The project is being directed by Sam Hargrave, who’s best known for helming Chris Hemsworth’s Extraction movies. Matchbox was created by automotive expert Jack Odell in 1953 for Lesney Products. In 1997, the toy brand was officially acquired by Mattel. The screenplay is co-written by David Coggeshall (The Family Plan) and Jonathan Tropper (The Adam Project). It hails from Apple Original Films, Skydance, and Mattel Films, with David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Don Granger, and Robbie Brenner serving as producers. “For nearly 70 years, Matchbox has carried enormous cultural relevance and inspired generations of kids to unleash their imaginations, combining what they see in the world every day with what they dream their own world to be,” Brenner said in a previous statement when the project was first announced back in 2022. “We look forward to working with our incredible partners at Skydance Media to craft a story for the big screen that evokes the same, imaginative spirit of this beloved Mattel franchise and delights fans of all ages.” (Source: The Hollywood Reporter)",
