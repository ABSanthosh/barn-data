  "text": "Time Magazine has just released the shortlist for its 2024 Person of the Year. With the list out, Swifties are curious whether singer Taylor Swift will again clench the prominent title this year. The pop icon recently wrapped up her Eras Tour after two years and 149 concerts. Hence, here is the answer to whether Swift has made it to the list of nominees for Time Magazine’s 2024 Person of the Year or not. Is Taylor Swift a part of Time Magazine’s Person of the Year 2024 shortlist? No, Taylor Swift has not been announced as a nominee for Time Magazine’s 2024 People of the Year title. Time Magazine released its shortlist on December 9, 2024, the result of which will be out on Thursday, December 12. However, this year, Swift has not been nominated after she was announced as Time Magazine’s Person of the Year in 2023. In 2023, Taylor Swift became the only woman to become Person of the Year twice. She made history by bagging the title in 2017 and 2023, according to the Los Angeles Times. Swift also entered into record books by being the first entertainer to be announced as Person of the Year. 2023 became the year that boosted Swift’s standing as one of the most influential people on the planet. The singer kicked off her immensely successful Eras Tour in March 2023. She also released a movie on it in October, taking her wealth to over a billion dollars, as per Forbes. Announcing Taylor Swift as the Person of the Year in 2023, Time stated, “Swift is also a symbol of generational change: she is only the fourth solo Person of the Year born in the past half-century.” Meanwhile, the nominees who are a part of Time Magazine’s 2024 Person of the Year shortlist are Kamala Harris, Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Kate Middleton, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Joe Rogan. Additionally, Mark Zuckerberg, Claudia Sheinbaum, Jerome Powell, and Yulia Navalnaya have made it to the list.",
