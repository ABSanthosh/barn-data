  "text": "Connie Britton and Kyle Allen recently opened up about what their own life lists would look like after starring in the Netflix romantic dramedy. What did Connie Britton and Kyle Allen say would be on their life lists? Speaking to ComingSoon in a recent interview, Britton — who plays Elizabeth Rose, the mother of Sofia Carson’s Alexandra “Alex” Rose — was asked about what would be on her own personal “life list.” In the movie, a life list is a list of goals someone would like to achieve throughout their life. For Britton, one goal that she’s had since a child and not yet achieved is to visit one of the great wonders of the world. “Well, let’s see. There are a few that I can remember from childhood,” said Britton. “There’s one that I have still not accomplished, which was on my list in childhood, which was I wanted to be an archaeologist and I really wanted to visit the Egyptian pyramids. I have not done that yet, so I would put that on my list today. I also really wish I could surf. I really wish I could surf, but…I would be so bad. I’d be terrible. But gosh, that would be cool. If I could surf would be cool. A cool feeling.” As for Allen — who plays Bradley “Brad” Ackerman in the movie — his life list includes a strange situation involving an acting legend. “Behold. Let me tell you, I would like to be punched in the face. This side of my face, preferably by Jackie Chan, in a professional setting,” said Allen, before noting that he’s “never told anyone” of his hope, and joking that he bets Chan has “firm yet soft hands.” “When Alex Rose’s mother sends her on a quest to complete her childhood bucket list, it takes her on a journey that will make you both laugh and cry as she uncovers family secrets, finds romance, and discovers herself along the way,” says the synopsis for The Life List, which is available to watch now on Netflix.",
