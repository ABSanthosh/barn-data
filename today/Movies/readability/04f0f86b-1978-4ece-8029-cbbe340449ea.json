  "text": "Singapore’s Silver Media Group is teaming with U.S. companies Ford Studios and Ark Entertainment on “Samurai Saint,” an animated feature chronicling the true story of Takayama Ukon, a 16th-century samurai who chose exile over renouncing his Christian faith. The project was unveiled on the sidelines of the inaugural JAFF Market that takes place alongside the Jogja-Netpac Asian Film Festival (JAFF) in Yogyakarta (Jogja) from Dec. 3-5. The feature, set during Japan’s tumultuous Sengoku period, follows Ukon’s rise through feudal Japan’s military ranks and his eventual exile alongside 350 other Christians after refusing to abandon his faith under pressure from the Imperial Regent. Beatified by the Catholic Church in 2017, Ukon’s story bridges historical drama with spiritual journey. “I first learnt about Ukon’s story early this year, and it thoroughly captivated me,” said Chan Gin Kai, CEO of Silver Media Group. “‘Samurai Saint’ is more than a film to me; it’s a legacy of inspiration. In a cruel world where some are willing to resort to unscrupulous ways to achieve their selfish ambitions, Ukon’s quest to protect his people despite immense persecution for his beliefs left an indelible mark on me. Through this film, we aim to bring his extraordinary story of love, honor and courage to a worldwide audience.” Popular on Variety The project brings together veteran talent, including former studio executive Marc Ford, who previously worked on franchises like “Fantastic Four,” “X-Men,” “Star Wars,” “James Bond,” and “Ice Age.” “‘Samurai Saint’ isn’t just a film – it’s the perfect fusion of today’s cinematic trends,” Ford said. “With the meteoric rise of anime, a global fascination with Japan-centric narratives, and a renewed hunger for powerful biopics, this project is tailor-made to resonate with audiences worldwide. When Gin Kai first shared the incredible story of Takayama Ukon, I was captivated. His journey is extraordinary, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to co-write and co-produce this film alongside Gin Kai.” Core Works Force, whose artists have worked on “One Piece,” “Dragonball Z,” Netflix’s “Castlevania Season 4” and “Castlevania: Nocturne,” will handle the 2D anime-style animation, bringing together artists from Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Ark Entertainment CEO Ross Campbell outlined additional plans: “‘Samurai Saint’ promises epic action that will enthrall audiences, and a heroic tale that will move them. We’re thrilled to also announce a role-playing game based on the film, bringing Ukon’s world to a new generation of gamers.” Production is due to begin in the first quarter of 2025.",
