The actor, who has portrayed Michael Corinthos on the soap since 2010, made a post on Instagram today sharing that he felt it was the “right time” in his life to exit. “After many incredible years with General Hospital, I’ve decided to step away from the show,” he wrote in a statement, alongside a cast photo. “This wasn’t an easy decision for me, but it feels like the right time in my life. I’m beyond grateful to Frank Valentini, the cast, crew, and everyone behind the scenes who have been like family to me throughout this amazing journey.” “To all the fans: thank you from the bottom of my heart for your unwavering support and for letting Michael Corinthos be a part of your lives. Your love and encouragement has meant the world to me :),” he continued, adding, “This isn’t a goodbye—it’s a see you later. Much love, Chad.” Watch on Deadline Deadline has reached out to ABC for further comment. Duell assumed the role of Carly (Laura Wright) and Sonny’s (Maurice Benard) son from Drew Garrett, who himself inherited the character from Dylan Cash. Since making his debut on the series, Duell has six Daytime Emmy noms and one win from 2015 for Outstanding Supporting Actor. The Emmy Award-winning daytime drama marked its 60th anniversary just last year. The series is both the longest-running scripted drama and the longest-running American soap opera currently in production, holding the record for the most Outstanding Daytime Drama accolades and taking home the prestigious Daytime Emmy Award a record 17 times. Per the show’s official logline, GH “continues its tradition of passion, intrigue and adventure that has depicted the ongoing lives of the diverse and evolving citizens of the fictional town of Port Charles set in upstate New York. The glamour and excitement of those who have come to find their destinies in this familiar seaport town intertwine with the lives, loves and fortunes of beloved, well-known faces.” The series spawned spinoffs Port Charles and primetime series General Hospital: Night Shift.
