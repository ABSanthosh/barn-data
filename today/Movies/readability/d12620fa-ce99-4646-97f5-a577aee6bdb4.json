However, the pandemic, financial issues, and SAG-AFTRA strikes forced a pause in production. Fortunately, The History of Sound is up and running with its first images of the leads playing lovers released. Mescal has brought us to tears in movies like Aftersun and All of Us Strangers. He also showed us his warrior strength in Gladiator II. Meanwhile, O’Connor has continued to dabble in period pieces like La Chimera and Lee, as well as the romantic sports drama Challengers. Check out the first-look photos of The History of Sound below: What’s important to know about The History of Sound? Mescal plays Lionel, who falls for his music student, David, played by O’Connor. Adapted from Ben Shattuck’s award-winning short story, the two meet in 1916 at the Boston Conservatory. Years later, they reunite and go on a mission to record the traditional music rooted in the backwoods of Maine. Resulting in a love affair while collecting timeless tunes, this unexpected reunion will then take the two on an unforgettable journey. In fact, we’ll even get to hear Mescal sing in the period movie. The History of Sound will have its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival this month. Distributed by MUBI, no theatrical release date has been set as of yet.",
