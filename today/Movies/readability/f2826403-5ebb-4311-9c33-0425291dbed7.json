  "text": "Andrew Scott is feeling good at tonight’s SAG Awards. But the same can’t be said for the first time the “Ripley” actor was at the ceremony back in 2020 when he passed a kidney stone on the same night he was nominated for his role in “Fleabag.” “I was beside Phoebe [Waller-Bridge] and Laura Dern had just won best supporting actress and we were standing up,” Scott told Variety‘s Marc Malkin at the SAG Awards red carpet in Los Angeles. “I don’t know if anyone has ever experienced having a kidney stone before, but it sends you, the pain is so immediate.” Scott recalled how by the time Dern finished accepting her award for “Marriage Story,” he was already ripping off his tux. “I was in the back [of the room]…writhing around in agony.” He knew what was going on since he had passed a kidney stone before. Waller-Bridge was running water to him and Scott ended up being taken away by an ambulance. His condition was unknown to other attendees. When Malkin asked where he left the stone, Scott laughed. “That’s too much,” he said. “People don’t need to know about that. It was grisly.” Tonight at the SAG awards, Scott is nominated for outstanding performance by a male actor in a television movie or limited series for “Ripley.” Scott is nominated alongside Javier Bardem (“Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story”), Colin Farrell (“The Penguin”), Richard Gadd (“Baby Reindeer”) and Kevin Kline (“Disclaimer”). In the critically acclaimed Netflix show, Scott plays Tom Ripley, the manipulative character created by Patricia Highsmith in her 1955 novel. Her book was previously adapted into “Purple Noon” in 1960 with Alain Delon and “The Talented Mr. Ripley” in 1999 with Matt Damon in the lead role.",
