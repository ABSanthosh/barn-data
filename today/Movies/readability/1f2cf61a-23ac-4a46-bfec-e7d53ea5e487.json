  "description": "\"One day you wake up and realize... that this was all designed. And there's potential for us to change it.\" Focus has debuted a second trailer for Piece by Piece, a LEGO version of the story of musician Pharrell Williams. Opening in theaters THIS weekend! This is one of the first LEGO movies that is not related to another franchise (like Star Wars), instead it's all about Pharrell, but told using the same animated LEGO style anyway. It's described as a \"one-of-a-kind cinematic experience about one of music's most innovative minds.\" Told through the lens of LEGO animation, turn up the volume on your imagination and witness the evolution of one of music's most innovative minds. With appearances by Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. Follow this autobiographical movie where Pharrell shows his imaginative \u0026 creative process using LEGO, as he constructs models representing his artistic development. Each build reflects a different creative milestone. It's directed by doc mastermind Morgan Neville. I'm looking forward to watching this! Kinda cool to see them visualize ...",
