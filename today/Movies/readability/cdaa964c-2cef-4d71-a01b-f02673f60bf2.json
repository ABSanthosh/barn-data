  "text": "David Corenswet’s recent film, Superman, has arrived in theaters and has received numerous reactions from fans. Helmed by James Gunn, the movie has been under a microscope since it was announced, and fans and critics have scrutinized everything from the first poster to the final clips. Now, the movie has received a positive response, and so has Corenswet’s version of the Man of Steel. Here’s what fans think about David Corenswet as Superman As a whole, the 32-year-old actor’s version of Superman has received a highly positive response after the film premiered on July 11. David Corenswet always looked the part, but reviews claim that he has managed to do “a good job” and has brought ” a lot of humor, humanity, and heart” to the character. Meanwhile, fans online are also gushing about how he looks in the film and how he fights. A user called @SpencyBSpittin wrote on X (formerly Twitter), “I loved all the others, but he is the most Superman Superman. You feel me?” Meanwhile, another user praised Corenswet’s casting and how he fits the role. There was a concern among fans that David Corenswet would not be able to deliver the gravitas that Henry Cavill had. While it is true that Cavill felt more “invincible,” not being god-like is what makes Corenswet’s Superman more relatable and exciting to witness. A fan on X wrote, “I can’t think of a bigger upgrade in film history (from Cavill). And I like Cavill. This guy just freaking nailed it!” On the other hand, some fans seemingly like Corenswet more than most actors who played the iconic role. Many have also put him above the likes of Cavill and right after the legendary Christopher Reeve. Furthermore, even the late actor’s son, Will Reeve, commented on the comparison. Will Reeve on David Corenswet\"David brings a humanity and sincerity that is necessary.. getting to know him has been a real treat because he absolutely inhabits this role.. he has a lot of similarities with my dad.. it's not just dressing up.. it means something more than that\" pic.twitter.com/1qw3ecDPOy— DCU Superman News (@DCUSuperNews) July 8, 2025 Of course, Gunn choreographed the fight sequences in a way that seemingly brings out the best of the comic bits. Many fans have also claimed that the movie and the character are entertaining throughout the packed runtime. However, some have also felt that the humor was a bit off-time. A fan on Reddit commented, “Reviews are about as expected. Solid blockbuster with a good message, a lot of fun, but narratively uneven and sometimes inappropriately timed humour. Sounds like James Gunn.” Additionally, critics have had their say regarding some aspects of Superman, including its pacing and over-reliance on superhero tropes. But Corenswet’s acting was not a part of the criticism. All in all, fans and critics seem impressed with David Corenswet’s version of Superman, and it may be for the best that he will lead the line in DCU going forward.",
