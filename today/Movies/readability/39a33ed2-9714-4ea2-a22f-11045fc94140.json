  "text": "Despite the ire toward and denouncement of J.K. Rowling from such colleagues like Nicola Coughlan, Pedro Pascal and David Tennant, and amid the rise of anti-trans rhetoric from the presidential administration, John Lithgow is befuddled at how the author’s sentiments factor into his decision to step into the role of Albus Dumbledore in HBO‘s forthcoming Harry Potter serialized adaptation. Speaking to The Times U.K., the Conclave actor said he didn’t expect the backlash at his involvement and that the censure by audiences didn’t put him off from continuing with the project. Watch on Deadline “I thought, why is this a factor at all? I wonder how J.K. Rowling has absorbed it. I suppose at a certain point I’ll meet her and I’m curious to talk to her,” he said. When asked if the criticism dissuaded him, he responded, “Oh, heavens no.” The veteran actor also said he wasn’t put off when a “very good friend,” who is a mother to a trans child, sent him the link to an article titled “An Open Letter to John Lithgow: Please Walk Away from Harry Potter.” He admitted that the exchange was “the canary in the coal mine” regarding the ensuing backlash. When asked if he expected such condemnation, Lithgow said, “No, absolutely not. Of course, it was a big decision because it’s probably the last major role I’ll play. It’s an eight-year commitment so I was just thinking about mortality and that this is a very good winding-down role.” The Tony, Golden Globe and recently minted Olivier Award winner, who is currently reprising his role as Roald Dahl in Giant at London’s Harold Pinter Theatre, added that he was also confused that his decision to portray the well-known antisemitic author was not critiqued. “No one complained when I agreed to play Dahl, but I’ve received so many messages about J.K. Rowling. Isn’t that odd?” he stated. Previously, Lithgow spoke out to assuage concern from fans of the Harry Potter franchise about his capability at portraying the beloved professor/mentor character in the wizarding world. He reiterated to The Times U.K. his initial hedging about whether an American actor would be accepted in the canonically British role. “I will be following the great Michael Gambon. I’m not an Englishman, although I’ve played one on TV,” he told BBC’s The One Show earlier this month. “I remind everyone that I did play Winston Churchill on The Crown and did just fine.” As reported by Deadline previously, HBO chairman Casey Bloys has indicated Rowling’s close involvement with the series as executive producer. The CEO has also deflected questions about Rowling’s heavily criticized stance, saying, “That’s a very online conversation, very nuanced and complicated and not something we’re going to get into. Our priority is what’s on the screen. Obviously, the Harry Potter story is incredibly affirmative and positive and about love and self-acceptance. That’s our priority — what’s on screen.”",
