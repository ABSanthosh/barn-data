  "description": "\"Staying alive matters and we're not going to do that with your fancy little mini-burritos.\" \"It's called a taquito!\" Mmmmmm I would like to try some. An official trailer has debuted for a super wacky, low budget indie comedy called Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse, from filmmaker Kyle Weingart. Set to debut in theaters during the next few months. 10 years after the world as we know it ends, one aspiring chef refuses to give up on his dreams and creates the apocalypse's first cooking show. For John, it will take more than the end of the world for him to give up on his dream of getting his cooking show \"out there\". John lives in the Gilligan Island-esc town of New Missoula. After he uploads his show to the town’s makeshift internet service, the apocalyptic town’s exact location becomes known to the world. The film stars Kevin Jack as John, Kevin Sorbo, Natasha Leggero, Emilio Rivera, Zuzu Weingart, \u0026 Braeden Sorbo. Another of these films you'd find in the back of a VHS store and laugh at because it is so dumb \u0026 goofy, but that's the whole point.

Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Kyle Weingart's film Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse, from YouTube: \"Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse is a film about not letting the end of the world get in the way of you following your dreams. It will make you feel like you've just rented a VHS from Blockbuster, cracked open a pop, and are about to kick back with your old gang. It was made based on a love for '90s cinema classics and as a tribute to the timeless masters of comedy such as Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, and even Monty Python.\" –Writer/Director Kyle Weingart It started with zombies. Then came the robots. Then of course the robot zombies, but that was a mixture of the plague, and something that came off the asteroid that destroyed New York City, but I digress - The Apocalypse is here. For one chef named John, it will take more than the end of the world for him to give up on his dream of getting his cooking show \"out there\". John lives in the Gilligan Island-esc town of New Missoula. After he uploads his show to the town's makeshift internet service, the apocalyptic town's exact location becomes known. New Missoula has no choice but to assemble a team of their strongest, most able-bodied citizens to manually stop the download. John? I said the strongest, didn't I? He's not invited. After all, what good is a chef in the apocalypse? Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse is written \u0026 directed by indie filmmaker Kyle Weingart, making his second film after directing The Waiting Game previously. It's produced by Joe Borden, Eden Matson, Zuzu Weingart, Kyle Weingart. The indie comedy Cuisine de la 'Pocalypse will debut in select US theaters starting on February 2025 coming soon.
