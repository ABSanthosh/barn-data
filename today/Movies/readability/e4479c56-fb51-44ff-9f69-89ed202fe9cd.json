  "text": "The truth is still out there, and with any luck, Agent Dana Scully could be back on the case. Ryan Coogler recently gave an update on his upcoming reboot of The X Files, which he revealed is “immediately next” for him, noting that he’s “spoken to the great Gillian Anderson” about the series. “She’s incredible. Fingers crossed there,” said Coogler on Last Podcast on the Left. Watch on Deadline “I’ve been excited about that for a long time, and I’m fired up to get back to it. Some of those episodes, if we do our jobs right, will be really f—ing scary,” he teased, adding: “We’re gonna try to make something really great, bro, and really be something for the real X Files fans, and maybe find some new ones.” Following news of Coogler’s reimagining, Anderson said she “cannot think of a better way around for a reboot to happen,” calling the filmmaker “a bit of a genius.” David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in ‘The X-Files’. 20th Century Fox “Whether I am involved in it is a whole other thing,” she added. “I’m not saying no. I think he’s really cool and I think if he did it, it would probably be done incredibly well. And maybe I’ll pop in for a little something something.” Originally running for nine seasons from 1993 to 2002, The X Files starred Anderson and David Duchovny as FBI Special Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder, who are tasked with investigating cases of the paranormal. In addition to the feature adaptations, The X Files (1998) and The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008), the show was brought back for a two-season revival from 2016 to 2018. Last year, OG series creator Chris Carter revealed that Coogler is “going to remount The X Files with a diverse cast” amid the Black Panther director’s five-year exclusive deal with Disney Television through his Proximity Media banner. “So, he’s got his work cut out for him because we covered so much territory,” said Carter on the On the Coast podcast, acknowledging that a modern update in which the characters investigate the paranormal would look different as “we’re steeped in conspiracies” today.",
