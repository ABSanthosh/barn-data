  "text": "Despite appearing in Showtime‘s spinoff Dexter: New Blood, Jennifer Carpenter revealed she will not be returning for the forthcoming Dexter: Resurrection. The 1923 actress, who portrayed the adoptive sister Debra of Michael C. Hall‘s titular character, recently opened up to People about the decision. “I am pretty focused where I am, and I feel like I’ve completed that box. I’m proud of it,” Carpenter said. “I hope that they’re having a wonderful time,” she added, referring to the cast and crew working on the project, set to launch in the summer on Paramount+ with Showtime. Watch on Deadline Carpenter, who plays the the highly capable U.S. Deputy Marshall Mamie Fossett on the Yellowstone prequel show, now airing Season 2, concluded, “And I’m so happy for the fans to have more to chew on.” The Emmy-winning mothership series, which stretched across nearly 100 episodes from 2006 to 2013, centered on a Miami PD blood spatter analyst solving murders — and committing them, channeling his urge to kill against violent criminals. At the drama’s conclusion, Carpenter’s character was taken off of life support by her brother after suffering a stroke. Dexter spawned several spinoffs, the first being Dexter: New Blood, in which Carpenter reprised her role as an imaginary presence. Prequel Dexter: Original Sin, featuring a young Dexter eventually succumbing to his bloodlust, recently aired its finale. Meanwhile, Dexter: Resurrection will reunite some of the original cast, including Hall, who executive produces, David Zayas and James Remar. Also starring are Jack Alcott, Uma Thurman and Peter Dinklage.",
