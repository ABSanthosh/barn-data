  "text": "SZA’s “SOS” returns to the top of the albums chart (it was at No. 15 in the previous week) following the release of its deluxe reissue, a 15-song extension dubbed “Lana.” This is the 11th total week at No. 1 for the Grammy-winning record that debuted in December 2022. Prior to “Lana,” “SOS'” final week at the summit took place in March 2023 — that 22-month gap between weeks is the longest for any album on the 67 year-old list. The way the count works all depends on Luminate, the data company powering the Billboard charts, which combines the units earned of both the parent LP and the deluxe reissue for tracking and charting purposes. “SOS” is at No. 1 on the Jan. 4-dated chart with 178,000 album units earned in the United States in the week ending Dec. 26. Meanwhile, official streams of the set climbed to 220 million. Popular on Variety In an X post reacting to her No. 1 position on Spotify’s Global Artist lists, SZA wrote, “The fact that yall have me at number one for a third day w no playlisting. no promo. no radio. onna deluxe. This is why I try my best because yall always got me no matter what. Thank you.” The set was preceded by much anticipation but the rollout officially began in early December with a snippet of a new release, “Kitchen,” followed by a Ben Stiller-starring visual treatment for “Drive.” SZA also released “Saturn” as a single in February after performing song at the Grammy Awards, where she took home three (out of nine nominations for “SOS”).  Plans for the deluxe edition were first made public during interviews around the release of “SOS” (2022) — which had its own long road to completion, arriving nearly five years after her official debut full-length, “Ctrl.” The “Lana” reissue includes only one featured artist — Kendrick Lamar on “30 for 30” — and her frequent team of producers including ThankGod4Cody and Carter Lang, among other contributors from Lil Yachty to Benny Blanco. The rest of the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 is filled out by holiday favorites including Frank Sinatra’s “Ultimate Christmas” at No. 10, marking the late icon’s first top 10-charting set in over a decade. Michael Bublé’s “Christmas” is at No. 2; Bing Crosby’s “Ultimate Christmas” is at No. 3; Nat King Cole’s “The Christmas Song” is at No. 4; Mariah Carey’s “Merry Christmas” is at No. 6; and “A Christmas Gift for You From Phil Spector” is at No. 6. Outside of “SOS,” the only non-holiday sets at the peak are Lamar’s “GNX” at No. 5, Taylor Swift’s “The Tortured Poets Department” at No. 7 and “The Wicked” film soundtrack at No. 8.",
