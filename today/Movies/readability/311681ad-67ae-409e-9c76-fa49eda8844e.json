She hopes the movie will film sometime next year. “There’s a lot of us who are directors now,” she told Variety on Wednesday night at the premiere of “Bride Hard.” “There are many candidates – Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Kay Cannon, who is the original writer and Elizabeth Banks, so we’ll see. I’m about to direct another movie, so that keeps me busy until early next year. Hopefully, it’ll go into production next year.”  When asked about what’s next for Fat Amy, Wilson said,  “I think there should be a wedding.” Popular on Variety Rebel Wilson at the “Bride Hard” Los Angeles Premiere held at the DGA Theater on June 18, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

The story follows Sam (Wilson), a secret agent who has allowed her high-stakes job to take priority over everything in her life, including being maid of honor for her best friend Betsy’s (Camp) destination wedding. Determined to prove that she can be there for her friend, Sam is thrown into another mission when a group of mercenaries crash the wedding and hold the guests hostage. The project was directed by Simon West and written by Shaina Steinberg.  To prepare for her fight scenes, Wilson trained for five weeks, focusing on conditioning and choreography with the stunt coordinators who worked with Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz on their roles in “Batman.” She was also skilled in using nunchucks, which came in handy for one particular scene where she used curly irons as a weapon to fight off one of the mercenaries.  “When I was 18, I trained for a hostile martial arts fighting tournament in South Africa,” she said. “I trained for six months, so I did have a little tiny bit of a background in karate, but that was a long time ago.” On the carpet, Wilson also discussed reuniting with Camp following their work together in “Pitch Perfect.” “We play a slightly different dynamic in this movie,” she said. “In ‘Pitch Perfect,’ she’s very uptight, and I’m more the –what we call in comedy– the wavy line. In this one, because I’m an operative, I’m more the straight line, and she’s the wavy line, playing kind of a ditzy bride. It’s good to switch of our dynamics.” She added, “You can tell in the movie that we’re such good friends. There’s just good camaraderie. We shot this during the writer’s strike, so some of the scenes weren’t quite written. But because we were besties, we could play that and improvise that quite well.” Camp shared similar sentiments about how their real-life bond shaped the way she approached her role. “We’ve known each other for 14 years, and we have an amazing dialogue together,” she said. “We can make each other laugh, feel comfortable on set and try crazy jokes, which we did the whole time. It made us feel like we were best friends because we are.” The actress shared her support for ‘Pitch Perfect 4’ and what she would like to see from her character. “I would like to see her move out to the desert like Joshua Tree and become a total hippie cooking weed and being completely the opposite of how she started out so uptight. Now she’s so loose and crazy.”  See more photos from the “Bride Hard” premiere below.
