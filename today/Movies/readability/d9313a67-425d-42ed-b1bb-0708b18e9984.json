The film’s North American theatrical release will begin in New York City later this summer, with screenings hosted by the director and featuring special guests.  “As a filmmaker, it’s so rare to find a story that is so uplifting – so hopeful— that it brings tears to your eyes. That’s the power of stories about animals. Watching these men and women, dodging bombs while carrying a lion to safety – it restores your faith in humanity,” Zeman said in a statement. “I think audiences are craving these types of stories right now – stories about real-life heroes who embody empathy, compassion, and selflessness.” Popular on Variety The release will come on the heels of “Checkpoint Zoo’s” Tribeca Festival premiere and an ongoing festival run including stops at the Tribeca, Mill Valley, Palm Springs, Sonoma and Salem Film Festivals. Most recently “Checkpoint Zoo” won Jury awards at the Miami, Annapolis and Minneapolis, St. Paul Film Festivals.

From June 1-Aug. 30, the museum will celebrate the season with the film series “Summer of Camp!” bringing cult classic films like “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,” “White Chicks” and “Reefer Madness.” Another series titled “Queer, Period: Desire Through the Ages” will run June 15-30, bringing historical dramas and period pieces that tell subtle queer stories. Additional highlights include the 4K restoration screening of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” on June 13, a tribute to Val Kilmer featuring a 4K screening of “Tombstone” on June 28 and a screening of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Crip Camp” on July 19, followed by a conversation with directors Jim Lebrecht and Nicole Newnham. “This summer’s lineup reflects the creativity and collaboration that define the Academy Museum,” Academy Museum director and president Amy Homma said in a statement. “From filmmaker talks and curated film series, to hands-on workshops for all ages, we’re bringing together diverse voices and perspectives. Programs like our ‘Crip Camp’ conversation and screening showcase how cinema can inspire dialogue, community, and change — all made possible through the artists and partners who help shape these experiences.” A full list of screenings and events can be found here.
