  "description": "\"Help yourself! :)\" Apple TV has finally revealed a first look at the new series from the creator of Breaking Bad, writer Vince Gilligan, which is ready to debut at the end of 2025 (starting in November). His new sci-fi drama series is titled Pluribus - the Latin word is an adjective that means \"much, many\" (used in the U.S. slogan \"E pluribus unum\"). There's still not much really known about what the show is about or what will be happening, but we finally have a one-line intro: The most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness. Pluribus stars Rhea Seehorn (who was in Gilligan's \"Better Call Saul\") along with Carlos Manuel Vesga, Karolina Wydra, Miriam Shor, and Samba Schutte. This sounds like it will be closer to something like Apple TV's hit show Severance rather than their other series Foundation (one of my faves) in terms of the sci-fi aspects of it. Perhaps she's spreading some \"miserable\" illness around? The rest is being kept a secret for now. Stay tuned for any updates on this series throughout the rest of the year.
