Popular on Variety She went on to say that the incident did not help her anxiety as she stepped into play Rhaenyra, one of the most iconic characters in the “Thrones” universe. “It just confirmed everything that I’ve kind of known to be true, [which] is that I’m not very good at my job,” she said. “You know what I mean! I was like, ‘I can’t do this. This is terrible. This is a big mistake.’” Alcock costarred alongside Emma D’Arcy, Matt Smith and Rhys Ifans in Season 1 of “House of the Dragon,” but only made a brief appearance in Season 2. Variety recently reported that “House of the Dragon” Season 3 began filming in March. New cast members for the third season include Tommy Flanagan, Dan Fogler, Tom Cullen, Joplin Sibtain and Barry Sloane. “House of the Dragon” is set about 200 years before the events of “Game of Thrones,” and is based on the fantasy novel “Fire \u0026 Blood” by “Thrones” mastermind George R.R. Martin.",
