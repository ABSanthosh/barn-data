  "text": "Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey cast continues to grow its star-studded list of actors, with THR reporting that Elliot Page, Himesh Patel, Bill Irwin, and Samantha Morton have all joined the cast of the film. Page broke out into superstardom in 2007’s Juno, and also recently starred in Netflix’s The Umbrella Academy. Patel starred in 2018’s Yesterday, and also recently starred on HBO’s The Franchise. Irwin has appeared in a number of projects, including Rustin, Third Rock from the Sun, Sesame Street, and CSI. Morton is a two-time Academy Award-nominated actor, and is best known for starring in Starz’s The Serpent Queen. Their roles, like those of every other casting decision in The Odyssey, is unknown as of now. Page, Patel, and Irwin are no strangers to working with Nolan, with Page having starred in Nolan’s 2010 Inception, while Patel appeared in 2020’s Tenet. Irwin, meanwhile, starred as TARS the robot, which briefly appeared in Interstellar. The group joins a cast that is absolutely star-studded. Previously, it was announced that Robert Pattinson, Matt Damon, Tom Holland, and Anne Hathaway would all also star in the upcoming project. Recently, Benny Safdie was also announced to have joined the cast. Early reports suggest that Pattinson, Damon, Holland, and Hathaway will make up “the core leads” of the movie. Lupita Nyong’o and Zendaya, both of whom were recently reported to be in the project, will also have supporting roles to some degree, as will Charlize Theron. It has also been reported that John Leguizamo is set to join the movie in some capacity. What do we know about The Odyssey? “Christopher Nolan’s next film The Odyssey is a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX film technology,” Universal said about the upcoming film. “The film brings Homer’s foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026.” The Odyssey is one of two ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer, a Greek poet who is also credited as the author of the Iliad and who is often seen as one of the most influential and important authors in human history. The Odyssey follows the story of the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, as he journeys home after the Trojan War. Presumed dead, Odysseus’ wife Penelope and son Telemachus contend with various suitors who compete for Penelope’s hand in Odysseus’ absence. The Odyssey is thought to have been written sometime in the 8th or 7th century BC and is one of the most important works in literary history.",
