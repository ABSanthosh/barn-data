  "text": "Below you’ll find the Wheel of Fortune bonus puzzle answer for November 7, 2024. We’ve also got you covered if you want to know the solutions for all the other puzzles in today’s game. This also includes all the toss-ups. That said, we’re beginning to notice that many of the puzzles this season have been quite short in length. At any rate, the contestants for tonight’s episode are Marc Rosenthal, Kristin Cook, and Mary Daigre.
