Choi In-beom, an ambitious employee working for the global investment firm Solqueen, approaches Gukbo with his plans for an acquisition. As the two men, driven by contrasting motivations, engage in a corporate battle, their relationship evolves, with soju serving as a symbolic bridge between them. So this is The Soju Movie! Ha.

Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Choi Yoon-Jin's film Big Deal, direct from YouTube: In 1997, when the Asian financial crisis hit Korea, Gukbo, the number one Soju company is on the brink of bankruptcy. In the high-stakes market of M\u0026A [meaning mergers \u0026 acquisitions], In-beom (Lee Je-hoon), a young ambitious associate at global investment firm Solquin, heads back home to take Gukbo as his first target. Hiding his greediness, In-beom approaches Jong-rok (Yoo Hai-jin), an executive loyal to Gukbo, as an innocent consultant aiming to rehabilitate Gukbo. While In-beom digs deeper into Gukbo, he finds this may lead to an unlikely outcome. Big Deal, also known as 소주전쟁 in Korean (or Soju War), is both written and directed by Korean filmmaker Choi Yoon-Jin, also director of the upcoming film Moral Hazard as well. Originally released by Showbox in Korea. Well Go USA will release Choi Yoon-Jin's Big Deal movie in select US theaters starting on June 6th, 2025 coming up this summer. Who wants to watch this?
