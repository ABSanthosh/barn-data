  "text": "We will update this article throughout the season, along with all our predictions, so make sure to keep checking IndieWire for the latest news from the 2025 Emmys race. The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT. The State of the Race One interesting thing about the Emmy race for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series this year is that none of the nominees from last year are eligible. Of course, that makes room for previously nominated actresses like “Yellowjackets” star Melanie Lynskey, “Bad Sisters” star Sharon Horgan, “The Last of Us” star Bella Ramsey, “The Diplomat” star Keri Russell, and “The Handmaid’s Tale” star Elisabeth Moss, a winner in 2017, to pick up where they left off. But even if they were all nominated again, there would still be room for at least one newcomer. Popular on IndieWire Most obvious right now: Critics Choice Award winner Kathy Bates for her successful “Matlock” reboot and “Severance” star Britt Lower, who had an even bigger, more complex role as both an Innie and a corrupt Outie in the long-awaited second season of the Apple TV+ hit. Some other names in the mix for shows that got some winter TV awards nominations: Keira Knightley for the Netflix series “Black Doves” and Lashana Lynch for the Peacock series “The Day of the Jackal,” both spy shows. However, the bigger swings come from the stars of shows with a passionate audience of either TV viewers, TV critics, or both, like “Industry” star Marisa Abela, “Bridgerton” star Nicola Coughlan, “High Potential” star Kaitlin Olson, and “Elsbeth” star Carrie Preston (who has actually already won an Emmy for originating the character on “The Good Wife.”)  There is still much to look out for, but one of the more enticing narratives from a campaign perspective is Paramount giving Helen Mirren a big push, as she not only returned to “1923” this season, but stars on the studio’s new Guy Ritchie-helmed series “MobLand.”  Current Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Marisa Abela, “Industry” (HBO)Kathy Bates, “Matlock” (CBS)Nicola Coughlan, “Bridgerton” (Netflix)Sharon Horgan, “Bad Sisters” (Apple TV+)Keira Knightley, “Black Doves” (Netflix)Britt Lower, “Severance” (Apple TV+)Lashana Lynch, “The Day of the Jackal” (Peacock)Melanie Lynskey, “Yellowjackets” (Showtime)Helen Mirren, “1923” (Paramount+)Elisabeth Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale” (Hulu)Kaitlin Olson, “High Potential” (ABC)Carrie Preston, “Elsbeth” (CBS)Bella Ramsey, “The Last of Us” (HBO)Keri Russell, “The Diplomat” (Netflix)Lovie Simone, “Forever” (Netflix) More Drama Category Predictions:Outstanding Drama SeriesOutstanding Lead Actor in a Drama SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama SeriesOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series View IndieWire’s full set of predictions for the 77th Emmy Awards. Last Year’s Winner: Anna Sawai, “Shōgun”Still Eligible: No.Hot Streak: None of the potential nominees are on an Emmys hot streak, and FX, the last network to win this award, does not have many Drama contenders this year. But it would be fascinating if Elisabeth Moss won for the final season of “The Handmaid’s Tale” on Hulu almost a decade after winning this category for her performance in the show’s premiere season.Notable Ineligible Series: Imelda Staunton, “The Crown” (ended); Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, “The Morning Show” (Season 4 is not eligible); Carrie Coon, “The Gilded Age” (Season 3 is not eligible); Maya Erskine, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” (Season 2 is not eligible).",
