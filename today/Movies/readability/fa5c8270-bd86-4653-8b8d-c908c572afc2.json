In their expanded roles, Ordonez and Parker will continue to oversee publicity and communications for a wide range of clients in the brand and strategic communications divisions, respectively, while also focusing on further building out the company’s capabilities to encompass a broad and holistic approach to events. They will report to The Lede Company co-founders and co-CEOs Sarah Rothman, Christine Su, Amanda Silverman and Meredith O’Sullivan. At the same time, former Vogue experiential lead Eliseé Brwochuk joins Lede as director of events and Walter Inge has been named senior director of brand and events. Carlos Frexeida will lead events in Paris. “Events have become a crucial element of communications strategies, and over the past few years, Emma and Brendan have flawlessly organized and executed numerous high-profile events — from red carpets and fashion shows to awards shows, charity-fundraising events, premieres, dinners and store openings — for our clients. Their dedication and hard work are truly unparalleled, and we couldn’t be prouder of everything they’ve achieved,” The Lede Company co-founders and co-CEOs Rothman and Su said in a statement Monday. “Launching this division was a natural progression for us, and we’re excited to see Emma and Brendan officially step into these roles and continue expanding Lede’s capabilities. With Walker being promoted, Carlos leading our events in Paris, and Eliseé joining the team, we’re even more energized about the future of this new division and the new heights we’ll reach together.” Popular on Variety Lede has offices in New York, Los Angeles, London and Paris.  “I’m honored to take on this role and the incredible opportunity to further push the boundaries of Lede’s events excellence,” Ordonez said. “By building on our collective experience and expertise, we are ready to deliver unparalleled experiences for our clients at the center of culture.” Parker said, “It’s been really special to be with Lede from the beginning and see how much the company has evolved. I’m so excited to take this next step and be part of what makes Lede such a force in this industry.”",
