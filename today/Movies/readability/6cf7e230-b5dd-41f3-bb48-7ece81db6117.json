  "description": "With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival wrapped up, it's time for a debrief and recap. Every year for the past few years, I hop on a podcast with my friend Aaron Neuwirth to discuss the festival and the films we watched – comparing notes and opinions. It's always refreshing to take some time to reflect on the festival, on all of the the films (54 for me this year!!), on the very talented new filmmakers, and on the experience of Sundance in January every tear. After 10 intense days of non-stop watching, it's a relief to kick back \u0026 chat about what was the best, and what was the worst, plus everything else good about this indie festival and its always fascinating selection of films each year. My 2025 festival recap podcast with Aaron (recorded as a bonus episode of his podcast show \"Out Now with Aaron \u0026 Abe\") is out now and can be listened to online or via any podcast platform around. I've included a Spotify embed below for anyone who wants to tune in. We tried to cover many of our favorites and also chat about any film that stuck out for just over an hour. Enjoy. […]",

Every year for the past few years, I hop on a podcast with my friend Aaron Neuwirth to discuss the festival and the films we watched – comparing notes and opinions. It's always refreshing to take some time to reflect on the festival, on all of the the films (54 for me this year!!), on the very talented new filmmakers, and on the experience of Sundance in January every tear. After 10 intense days of non-stop watching, it's a relief to kick back \u0026 chat about what was the best, and what was the worst, plus everything else good about this indie festival and its always fascinating selection of films each year. My 2025 festival recap podcast with Aaron (recorded as a bonus episode of his podcast show \"Out Now with Aaron \u0026 Abe\") is out now and can be listened to online or via any podcast platform around. I've included a Spotify embed below for anyone who wants to tune in. We tried to cover many of our favorites and also chat about any film that stuck out for just over an hour. Enjoy. Thanks to Aaron for arranging, editing, and recording this wild podcast discussing Sundance 2025 and our favorite films (and a few films we didn't like). The podcast is available via Audioboom, including on all the usual services: Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Amazon, CastBox, iHeart, and others. Sometimes chatting about films is just as fun as writing about them. \"Enjoy thoughts on some of the more notable films featured, including Twinless, Sorry Baby, East of Wall, Together, Lurker, The Wedding Banquet, Train Dreams, Peter Hujar's Day, Atropia, Love, Brooklyn, and more, along with a few documentaries, including Andre Is an Idiot, Cutting Through Rocks, and Middletown.\" For my full list of Sundance 2025 favorites, head to my Letterboxd diary. This podcast is a bonus episode of the weekly Out Now with Aaron \u0026 Abe show (celebrating more than 500 shows already). As usual, if any of these films we discussed sound like you want to watch, keep an eye out for them whenever they're playing in your area. All of them are worth a look.
