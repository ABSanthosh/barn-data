Once the Catholic Church's most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence finds himself at the center of a conspiracy and discovers a secret that could shake the very foundation of The Church... Conclave is directed by the Academy Award-nominated German filmmaker Edward Berger, director of the films Strait-Jacket, Sidewalk Hotel, Smelly Dinners, Wanderbread, Gomez: Heads or Tails, Jack, All My Loving, and 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front previously, as well as the TV series \"Deutschland 83\" \u0026 \"Patrick Melrose\".

This is expected to premiere at the 2024 Venice \u0026 Telluride Film Festivals this fall. Focus Features will debut Berger's Conclave film in select US theaters starting on October 25th, 2024 this month. Want to watch? Find more posts: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
