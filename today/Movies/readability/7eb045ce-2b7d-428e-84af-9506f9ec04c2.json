  "description": "\"We're getting married?!\" Uh oh. Magnet Releasing has unveiled an official trailer for a home invasion thriller titled Borderline, marking the feature directorial debut of Cocaine Bear writer Jimmy Warden. Strangely this hasn't played at any film festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Magnet is dropping this in theaters in March in a month from now. The premise is a bit like Misery but with an intriguing psychopathic patriarchal twist. Borderline is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that follows a dangerously persistent stalker who invades the home of a '90s pop superstar with grand delusions of a wedding. With her life on the line and help from her loyal bodyguard, she must escape the stalker’s sinister grip before they tie the knot. Paul is desperate to prove his dedication but Sofia's just trying to survive the night... How will she make it out?! Starring Samara Weaving, Ray Nicholson, Jimmie Fails, Alba Baptista, and Eric Dane. This looks totally nuts! Not just a simple home invasion thriller, a lot more strange things going on in here. Get a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jimmy Warden's thriller Borderline, direct from YouTube: Cocaine Bear writer Jimmy Warden makes his twisted […]",
