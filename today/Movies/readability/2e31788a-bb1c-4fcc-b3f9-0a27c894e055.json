  "text": "Welcome to Deadline’s live blog for the Golden Globes. Last year’s event, broadcast on CBS, was considered a success, particularly after the organization went through an ownership change and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association was dissolved as a result of a series of controversies including the fact that it had no Black voting members. It is now a for-profit venture under Dick Clark Productions, which is co-owned by Deadline parent PMC and Eldridge and run by PMC CEO Jay Penske, with a new five-year deal on CBS. However, Deadline co-editor-in-chief Mike Fleming Jr and Peter White, executive editor of television, who are overseeing this live blog with a slew of contributions from Deadline staffers at the Beverly Hilton, plan to pull no punches during the three-hour show. Comedian Nikki Glaser, seven months on from being the MVP of The Roast of Tom Brady, is host – the ceremony’s first solo female host, in fact, and she is “not messing around.” The real question this year is whether the Globes have truly turned a corner and the 300 voters (some of them paid) representing 76 countries can select winners that can provide some clarity for the Oscars race. Does Netflix’s Emilia Pérez, a Spanish-language cartel musical from France, have what it takes to top Anora, a comedy drama about a sex worker tied up with the Russian oligarchy? Can the 215-minute hipster choice The Brutalist topple Conclave’s search for a new Pope? Have the voters left any space for Wicked? There are also some TV awards to pick through. Last year’s Globes came less than two weeks before the postponed Emmys, but this time around Shōgun, The Bear, Baby Reindeer and Hacks already have won awards so it will be interesting to see whether there’s a repeat, or whether voters chart their own path with nods for dystopian murder dolls in the second season of Squid Game or hot rabbis in Nobody Wants This.
