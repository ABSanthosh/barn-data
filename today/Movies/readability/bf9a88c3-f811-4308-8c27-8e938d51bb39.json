Here's the first official trailer (+ poster) for Scott Derrickson's film The Gorge, direct from YouTube: Two highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller \u0026 Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within.
