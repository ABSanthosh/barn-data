  "text": "The simplest setup in “Adolescence” is just two people talking in a room — but even that looks different than it might if the Netflix series had been made five years ago.  Episode 3 follows psychologist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty) in real time as she assesses Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), a 13-year-old boy accused of stabbing his classmate Katie Leonard (Emilia Holliday) to death. The camera is rarely static over the chess match between the two, always motivated by the flashes of thought and the thunderclaps of emotion that play out between them. The conversation is a marathon acting challenge for Doherty and Cooper, of course, but it’s also no small feat for cinematographer Matthew Lewis and camera operator Lee David Brown.  Could you hold 20 pounds of camera equipment for an hour without rest, moving in, out, and around the actors on specific cues, and achieve any kind of precision? Episode 3 of “Adolescence” shot two takes per day over the course of five days. Can you dance the camera around the actors that many times in a row?  Lewis told IndieWire that he reckoned that if the team had been making Episode 3 five years ago and wanted to do an episode-length oner, “You probably would have to try and suspend the camera from the ceiling and move through the set that’s [rigged with] wires or something. You wouldn’t be able to hold the camera for that long. Like, physically, it would have been too demanding to achieve,” Lewis said.  What made the difference for “Adolescence,” and for many other film and television projects in recent years, has been the proliferation of lightweight cameras and lenses. Lewis tested a number of options with the goal of creating a look that would feel slick, smooth, and connected to the characters.  “Adolescence” Courtesy of Netflix He eventually landed on the DJI Ronin 4D, which was also used in Alex Garland’s “Civil War” for a searing precision amid the frenzy of combat sequences. The Ronin’s a very small, mobile camera that doesn’t need to be attached to any kind of easyrig to stabilize it, doesn’t require, in Lewis’s words, “a load of gubbins,” and can be easily transferred between operators mid-take.  “The size of the camera package meant that we could do moves that we couldn’t have done before: Passing the camera through a window, moving it onto a drone, doing really fast handovers that you couldn’t have done with a bigger rig, even just really simple stuff like moving under doorways. On a [larger camera] with an easyrig, all that becomes a huge challenge. Each doorway you go through, you’re really hoping you don’t feel the fact that you’re half-squatting to try and get underneath it,” Lewis said.  Equally important to opening up the possibilities for longer takes have been lighter lenses. “A lot of lightweight cinema glasses have come out because companies are recognizing a gap in the market. So we’re able to jump on that and we ended up using the Cooke SP3s. It was a 32mm that ended up being the favorite we used for all the episodes,” Lewis said.  “Adolescence”Courtesy of Netflix Cameras like the Ronin 4D have also gotten better at transitioning between indoor and outdoor space in terms of lighting so that operators don’t have to drastically stop down to handle the (mild, British) sun.  The more versatility that’s physically available to the operator, the more opportunities open up to create more complex camera sequences. “Adolescence” does this on an episode scale, of course. But shows as varied as “Severance” and “Hacks” have proven how crews can execute ambitiously choreographed long takes and operator-to-drone handoffs as part of a show’s fluid visual grammar and not a “Rope”-like conceit that requires specialized sets and equipment.  Just as important as understanding the technology that’s made long takes and oners doable on television timelines and budgets, however, is understanding why they’re effective. “Not being able to leave the story forces you to engage and makes you think something’s about to happen all the time. You’re moving through a space and if [it looks normal], someone could be eating their cereal in the morning and you’d think, ‘Oh, there’s going to be a plane crash outside the window.’ Because why would we be looking at it? It’s unrelenting, in that sense,” Lewis said.  “Adolescence”Courtesy of Ben Blackall/Netflix The longer we sit in a shot, the more strongly we feel the tension of not cutting. This translates to increased suspense, as in most of “Adolescence,” but can also give us a sense of heightened anticipation and thrill as a camera glides through space to find its hero — “Hacks” does this more than once and with a drone hand-off in Season 3 — or greater dread as we watch a situation teeter back and forth on the edge of disaster (enter Episode 7 of “The Bear”).  “ I’ve previously thought that it was genre-based, but I don’t think it is,” Lewis said. “There might be some really cool combinations of things that work really well.”  Luckily, now cinematographers have the tools they need to find out.",

The Ronin’s a very small, mobile camera that doesn’t need to be attached to any kind of easyrig to stabilize it, doesn’t require, in Lewis’s words, “a load of gubbins,” and can be easily transferred between operators mid-take. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“The size of the camera package meant that we could do moves that we couldn’t have done before: Passing the camera through a window, moving it onto a drone, doing really fast handovers that you couldn’t have done with a bigger rig, even just really simple stuff like moving under doorways. On a [larger camera] with an easyrig, all that becomes a huge challenge. Each doorway you go through, you’re really hoping you don’t feel the fact that you’re half-squatting to try and get underneath it,” Lewis said. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEqually important to opening up the possibilities for longer takes have been lighter lenses. “A lot of lightweight cinema glasses have come out because companies are recognizing a gap in the market. So we’re able to jump on that and we ended up using the Cooke SP3s. It was a 32mm that ended up being the favorite we used for all the episodes,” Lewis said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"6316\" height=\"3158\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/A_102_Unit_00176_RT.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"Adolescence.

But shows as varied as “Severance” and “Hacks” have proven how crews can execute ambitiously choreographed long takes and operator-to-drone handoffs as part of a show’s fluid visual grammar and not a “Rope”-like conceit that requires specialized sets and equipment. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust as important as understanding the technology that’s made long takes and oners doable on television timelines and budgets, however, is understanding why they’re effective. “Not being able to leave the story forces you to engage and makes you think something’s about to happen all the time. You’re moving through a space and if [it looks normal], someone could be eating their cereal in the morning and you’d think, ‘Oh, there’s going to be a plane crash outside the window.’ Because why would we be looking at it? It’s unrelenting, in that sense,” Lewis said. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"7827\" height=\"3914\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/A_104_Unit_00160-RT3.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"Adolescence.
