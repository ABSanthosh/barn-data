  "description": "\"And then what happened?\" \"It was a moment of true liberation from the ego mind.\" Don't you want to find out more? Will you be forever changed by this story? Dive in and find out. Heroic Dose is a hilarious new comedy short film created and directed by a filmmaker known as Dugan Gundelfinger (not his real last name). This his \"opus\", an autobiographical tale of the time he tripped on way too much acid. \"A genre bending comedic retelling of the time I had a psychedelic-induced mystical journey exploring the ego mind, 'reality' and the cosmic joke of the human experience...\" During a dinner gathering discussing trying drugs, Gundelfinger tells his story of the time he was given a \"heroic dose\" LSD and went hard on psychedelics. It's not exactly meant to be a philosophical film (though I do like his idea about the \"ahh\" sound). But it might actually make a few people want to try this? Please be safe. The dinner cast includes Leighton Lovejoy, Jena Malone, Nick Rutherford, Rachael Leigh Cook, Demorge Brown, Max Baumgarten, and April Lee. This wacky short is only 13 mins long and will definitely have you laughing out loud many times. [â€¦]",
