  "description": "\"Are you content?\" Well, are you? Vertical has released another new official US trailer for an indie sci-fi romantic thriller called Turn Me On set in an emotionless dystopian future. It premiered at the 2024 San Sebastian Film Festival and already opened in the UK last fall (view that one here). In a lifeless world, one couple will find their spark again in this dystopian romcom. In a world where the inconvenience of human emotion has been eradicated by a government-imposed daily vitamin, one young couple skips their dose and discovers love, joy, sex and all the baggage that comes with it. A young couple (named Joy and William) discover many new feelings, but realize they come with more challenges as well. Starring Bel Powley, Nick Robinson, Justin H. Min, Griffin Newman, Nesta Cooper, Patti Harrison, and D'Arcy Carden. This is the same concept as the sci-fi romance film Equals (2015) with Kristen Stewart from a few years ago. It doesn't seem like it has anything new to offer or much to say about emotions that we don't already know. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Michael Tyburski's film Turn Me On, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch [â€¦]",

The only sacrifice is... yourself. \"Feel something. Change everything.\" One young woman named Joy (Bel Powley) living in a dystopian future finds herself forced to stop taking her meds which results in a brand-new world laid out before her, one with happiness, sadness, anger and joy. Experiencing sex, love and contentment for the first time, they grapple with these new emotions, and all of the baggage that comes along with it... Turn Me On is directed by American indie filmmaker Michael Tyburski, making his second feature film after directing The Sound of Silence previously, plus a few other short films. The screenplay is written by Angela Bourassa (If You Were the Last). Produced by Sean Bradley, Toby Nalbandian, Zareh Nalbandian, Gregory Schmidt.
