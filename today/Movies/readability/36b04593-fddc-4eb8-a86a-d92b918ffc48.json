  "text": "The Shrek 5 teaser trailer is here, sparking speculation about Antonio Banderas’ return as Puss in Boots. Introduced in Shrek 2 as an assassin turned ally, Puss later joined Shrek’s adventures in Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. At the end of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, he sails toward Far Far Away, hinting at a possible reunion with Shrek. But is he in Shrek 5? Here’s what we know. Will Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots be in Shrek 5’s cast? As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding Banderas’ return as Puss in Boots in Shrek 5. In a recent interview with Parade, Banderas was asked whether he had been contacted for the upcoming installment. He responded, “I’m not so far, and I’m not being called for that.” While he denied being approached for Shrek 5, he didn’t entirely rule out the possibility. There is still a chance that Puss could be involved, considering how Puss in Boots: The Last Wish ended. The movie follows Puss on a quest for the Wishing Star to restore his nine lives. In the end, he learns to cherish his final life and embarks on a new adventure. Puss, Kitty Softpaws, and Perrito are last seen sailing toward Far Far Away to reunite with old friends. Since that kingdom is the setting for the Shrek movies, a cameo remains a possibility—perhaps even to set up Puss in Boots 3. However, no reports have directly suggested this. For now, fans will have to wait for an official confirmation regarding Banderas’ involvement. Shrek 5 marks the first installment in the franchise since Shrek Forever After (2010). The confirmed returning cast includes Mike Myers as Shrek, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Cameron Diaz as Fiona. A notable addition to the cast is Zendaya, who will voice Shrek’s daughter. The film is set to hit theaters on December 23, 2026.",
