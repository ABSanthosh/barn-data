It's his latest feature since making the experimental Kuso film in 2017, along with a short film in the V/H/S/99 anthology. A woman wakes up on a distant planet and finds the crew of her space station viciously killed. Her investigation into what happened sets in motion a terrifying chain of events. Apparently this is less experimental and more \"contained\" than Kuso, with a full-on production budget. He shot it down in NZ: \"People go to New Zealand to shoot sci-fi and fantasy movies, so I was [working with] all these people who worked on The Lord of the Rings and other Peter Jackson and James Cameron stuff.\" Ash stars Eiza González, Aaron Paul, Iko Uwais, Kate Elliott, Beulah Koale, and Flying Lotus himself. Whoa this looks rad! Hell yes! My first impression is that it almost seems like a live-action version of Scavengers Reign, about a crew on this strange planet filled with mysterious entities...

Whoa this looks rad! Hell yes! My first impression is that it almost seems like a live-action version of Scavengers Reign, about a crew on this strange planet filled with mysterious entities... Here's the first look teaser trailer for Flying Lotus' sci-fi horror film Ash, direct from RLJE's YouTube: On the mysterious planet of Ash, Riya (Eiza González) awakens to find her crew slaughtered. When a man named Brion (Aaron Paul) arrives to rescue her, an ordeal of psychological and physical terror ensues while Riya and Brion must decide if they can trust one another to survive. Ash is directed by American musician / filmmaker Flying Lotus, originally named Steven D. Bingley-Ellison, director of the film Kuso previously, as well as a segment in the V/H/S/99 horror film and other music videos as well. The screenplay is written by Swiss writer Jonni Remmler (Das Quartett series). It's produced by Nate Bolotin and Matthew Metcalfe. This hasn't premiered at any festivals just yet - stay tuned for updates. RLJE debuts Flying Lotus' film Ash in select US theaters in early 2025 before it's streaming on Shudder. First impression?
