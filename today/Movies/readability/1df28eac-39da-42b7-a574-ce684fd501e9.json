  "text": "Michelle Trachtenberg and Danny Tamberelli in 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete' Nickelodeon Danny Tamberelli, who starred in Nickelodeon‘s The Adventures of Pete \u0026 Pete, paid tribute to his co-star Michelle Trachtenberg after news of her death. In an emotional tribute, Tamberelli remembered working with Trachtenberg on the set of the television series. “We grew up learning how to make people laugh together. More importantly, we learned to make each other laugh and pull pranks on everyone,” Tamberelli wrote on Instagram. “We were doing improv when it was still called playing pretend to get laughs. She was a master of the clothespin game, tagging any and everyone she could.” He continued, “She once got upset when I got my 1st bass on set because I wouldn’t hang out during lunch. She hid the cable so I couldn’t play through the amp. I got the message. She was a bright light, firecracker and caring person who spent a lot of time and effort advocating for people who needed a louder voice.” Watch on Deadline RELATED: Blake Lively Pays Tribute To ‘Gossip Girl’ Co-Star Michelle Trachtenberg: “She Was Electricity” Tamberelli played the role of “Little” Pete Wrigley, while Trachtenberg played the role of Nona F.
