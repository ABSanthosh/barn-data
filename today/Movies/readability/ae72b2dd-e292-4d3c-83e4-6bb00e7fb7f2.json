The deal was announced Sunday during a livestream on 5\u00262 Studios’ YouTube page, and comes as 5\u00262 Studios prepares to release Season 5 of “The Chosen” next month in theaters. After that, “The Chosen” Season 5 will now exclusively premiere on Amazon’s Prime Video in the U.S. this June. (“The Chosen” will also be available, on a non-exclusive basis, on Prime Video in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sub-Saharan Africa, UK, and Latin America later this year.) Under the deal, Prime Video will also take over exclusive U.S. streaming rights to the first five seasons of “The Chosen,” as well as future seasons of “The Chosen.” “The Chosen” was previously available on multiple platforms, including Netflix, Hulu and Peacock — but those deals have all expired in recent months. The show has also been run linearly in primetime on The CW, but it’s unclear whether Season 5 of “The Chosen” will still get a broadcast run. Popular on Variety Additionally, Amazon MGM Studios will also now hold theatrical distribution rights to the next two installments of “The Chosen,” focused on the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, which will make up Seasons 6 and 7 (the final two seasons) of the series. Currently, Season 5 is set to be distributed in the U.S. next month by Fathom and internationally by Trafalgar Releasing. This continues the unique distribution model that “The Chosen” has done since its launch as a crowdfunded indie short in 2017  — including “The Chosen” app, theatrical, linear outlets and streaming. “The Chosen” has found success in recent years by premiering in theaters first before moving to other windows. 5\u00262 Studios founder Dallas Jenkins had been looking at possibly bringing on an exclusive distribution partner for “The Chosen” ever since he was able to take over full ownership of the series. Last year, an arbitrator ended the relationship between Jenkins’ The Chosen LLC and former partner Angel Studios, giving Jenkins oversight of “The Chosen.” “For several years, the team at Amazon MGM Studios has proved over and over they’re passionate about this show and our fans,” said Jenkins. “They’re going to make us better and get the show to more people, and I can’t wait to build this relationship.” Jenkins launched 5\u00262 Studios in September, after the arbitration ruling gave him control of “The Chosen.” At the time, he exclusively revealed to Variety his plans to expand “The Chosen” universe with several new projects, including “The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls.” Other projects in the works include “The Chosen Adventures,” a youthful take on the Jesus story, featuring voice actors including Paul Walter Hauser (“Black Bird”) and Yvonne Orji (“Insecure”). And after “The Chosen” wraps, for his next flagship program, Jenkins plans to next write, direct and showrun a three-season series about the life of Moses. The deal with Amazon MGM Studios has so far only mentioned “The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,” and made no mention of “The Chosen Adventures” or future projects. But as part of the deal, Amazon MGM Studios signed a first-look series and film deal with 5\u00262 Studios. “’The Chosen’ has had renowned success captivating audiences across generations, and we are looking forward to collaborating with Dallas and 5\u00262 Studios on a larger scale,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “As we look ahead, we see massive opportunities to develop additional faith-inspired content for our global Prime Video customers.”  Sanders joined Jenkins, the chairman/CEO of 5\u00262 Studios and creator/exec producer of “The Chosen” and “The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,” on the livestream. Also in attendance was Amazon MGM Studios development exec Traci Blackwell. Lionsgate, which handles global distribution for “The Chosen” and “The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,” negotiated the deal for 5\u00262 Studios with Amazon MGM Studios, while CAA — which reps 5\u00262 Studios — handled the first-look component. Insiders noted that Lionsgate has found success in striking third-party deals, including one it did for the hit series “Schitt’s Creek” with Hulu. This one was even more elaborate given the mix of a theatrical window in addition to scripted and unscripted franchises. “Amazon MGM Studios is the perfect partner to take this already highly sought-after property to the next level,” said Lionsgate’s Jim Packer, president of worldwide television distribution. “This wide-ranging, multi-territory deal presents a unique opportunity to deepen engagement with ‘The Chosen’s’ loyal fanbase while drawing in new viewers around the world.” “The Chosen” Season 5 has been dubbed “The Chosen: Last Supper.” Here’s the logline: “The table is set. The people of Israel welcome Jesus as king while his disciples anticipate his crowning. But—instead of confronting Rome—he turns the tables on the Jewish religious festival. Their power threatened, the country’s religious and political leaders will go to any length to ensure this Passover meal is Jesus’ last.” As for the six-episode “The Chosen In The Wild with Bear Grylls,” the host “takes the cast of The Chosen, as well as director Dallas Jenkins, on their own adventures into the wilderness. Bear Grylls will find out exactly what makes his guests tick, explore their personal journeys, and push them to their ultimate limits,” per the logline. Besides CAA, 5\u00262 Studios is also repped by Andrew Kramer of Willkie Farr \u0026 Gallagher, LLP.",
