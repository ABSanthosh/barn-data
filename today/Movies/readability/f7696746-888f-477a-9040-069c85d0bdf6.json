I'm a big fan of this doc already and this series looks like an amusing take on the cozy concept. Here's the official trailer for Mike Schur's series A Man on the Inside, direct from Netflix's YouTube: Retired professor Charles (Ted Danson) feels life has nothing new in store for him. A year after his wife's passing, he's stuck in his routine \u0026 grown distant from his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis). But when he spies a classified ad from private investigator Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada), he's inspired to roll the dice on a new adventure. Charles' mission: to go undercover inside the Pacific View Retirement Home and solve the mystery of a stolen family heirloom. Everyone, residents \u0026 staff, is a potential suspect, and it's up to Charles to solve the case without landing on the radar of Didi (Stephanie Beatriz), the all-seeing, all-knowing director of Pacific View. Keeping a low profile proves difficult as the affable Charles quickly endears himself to his fellow residents. Being a \"man on the inside\" sends him on an exciting journey that makes him realize there is a lot more life left to be had — and allows him to reconnect with his daughter. A Man on the Inside is a comedy series created by acclaimed TV writer / producer Mike Schur, creator of \"Parks and Recreation\", \"The Good Place\", \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", \"Rutherford Falls\". Based on Academy Award-nominated documentary The Mole Agent directed by Chilean filmmaker Maite Alberdi. With writing by Sylvia Batey Alcalá and Lisa Muse Bryant. And episodes directed by Rebecca Asher and Morgan Sackett. Made by Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. Executive produced by Mike Schur (Fremulon), Morgan Sackett, David Miner (3 Arts Entertainment), Maite Alberdi and Marcela Santibañez (Micromundo Producciones), Julie Goldman and Christopher Clements (Motto Pictures). Netflix will debut A Man on the Inside streaming on Netflix starting on November 21st, 2024 this fall. Want to watch this? Find more posts: Comedy, Streaming, To Watch, Trailer",
