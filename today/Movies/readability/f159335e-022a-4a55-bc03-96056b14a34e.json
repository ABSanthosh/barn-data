  "description": "\"If you stay inside, you are protected.\" Kino Lorber has revealed a brand new trailer for the 4K re-release of the iconically weird Yorgos Lanthimos film titled Dogtooth, which originally premiered back in 2009.

This film is definitely not for everyone, but it's a fabulous example of Yorgos' quirky, kinky, playful ideas \u0026 how he prefers narratives that go against the grain. Enjoy. Here's the new trailer (+ poster) for the 4K restoration of Yorgos Lanthimos' Dogtooth, via YouTube: Graceful, enigmatic, often frightening, Dogtooth is an ingenious dark comedy that won a prize during the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nom for Best Foreign Language Film, propelling director Yorgos Lanthimos to the forefront of contemporary cinema's most ambitious filmmakers. In an effort to protect their three children from the corrupting influence of the outside world, a Greek couple transforms their home into a gated compound of cultural deprivation \u0026 very strict rules of behavior. But children cannot remain innocent forever. When the father brings home a young woman to satisfy his son's sexual urges, the family's engineered \"reality\" begins to crumble, with devastating consequences. Like the haunting, dystopic visions of Michael Haneke \u0026 Gaspar Noé, Dogtooth punctuates its compelling drama with moments of shocking violence, creating a biting social satire that is as profound as it is provocative. Dogtooth is directed by visionary Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, his third feature film at the time after My Best Friend and Kinetta, and just before making Alps after. The screenplay is written by Efthymis Filippou \u0026 Yorgos Lanthimos (the same duo that would go on to write The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, Nimic, Kinds of Kindness). Produced by Yorgos Tsourgiannis. It first premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival years ago, and was nominated for an Oscar in 2011. Kino Lorber will re-release Dogtooth in 4K starting on June 20th, 2025 with more cities throughout the summer. For details, visit their official site.
