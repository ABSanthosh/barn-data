  "text": "WWE Hall of Famer The Undertaker recently shared a shocking statistic about his record against a top WWE superstar. Over his legendary career spanning more than three decades, The Undertaker has always stood out as a leader in WWE. Throughout the years, he has engaged in top rivalries with major pro wrestling icons. This includes Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Stone Cold, Kane, Randy Orton, and many others. Most of these stars have struggled to secure a good record against The Undertaker. In a recent revelation, the WWE Hall of Famer disclosed that in his storied career, he has only been able to defeat a particular superstar one time. While many might initially think of Roman Reigns, The Deadman has faced him just once at WWE WrestleMania 33, where Reigns became the second pro wrestler to defeat him at that grand event. However, the superstar The Undertaker has only beaten once is none other than Brock Lesnar. He is the first who won against him at WrestleMania by breaking his winning streak of 21 victories. The Undertaker reflects poor record against Brock Lesnar The Undertaker and Brock Lesnar have engaged in a heated rivalry in WWE for over 20 years. Lesnar also had a legendary feud with The Deadman during his initial run in WWE. This rivalry included Lesnar defeating The Undertaker at No Mercy 2002 in a Hell in a Cell match and again in a Biker Chain match in 2003 at No Mercy. After returning to WWE in 2012, Lesnar reignited their fierce rivalry from 2014 to 2015. This culminated in his victory at WrestleMania 30, where he famously ended The Undertaker’s Streak, making it 21-1. On the Six Feet Under Podcast, The Undertaker discussed his record against Lesnar and revealed that he has only managed to defeat him once throughout his career. He stated, “I enjoyed, uh… although my record against Brock was not really good. I think I only beat him once in a pay-per-view, um… but I always enjoyed working with him.” The Undertaker’s only victory over Brock Lesnar occurred at WWE SummerSlam 2015. However, Lesnar quickly avenged that loss a few months later by defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match, aided by a low blow. This victory gave Brock Lesnar a dominant winning record of 4-1 against The Undertaker.",
