  "text": "Netflix has enlisted six new cast members, who will be joining lead star Gabriel Basso in The Night Agent Season 3, which has already started filming in Istanbul. This comes ahead of Season 2’s premiere on January 23, 2025, nearly two years since the show debuted its first ten episodes. Who is involved in The Night Agent Season 3? Jennifer Morrison (Once Upon a Time) and Stephen Moyer (True Blood) have officially signed on for key roles in the third installment of the hit action thriller series, along with David Lyons (Revolution), Genesis Rodriguez (Lioness) and child actor Callum Vinson (Chucky). Meanwhile, Suraj Sharma (How I Met Your Father) has also been tapped to portray an undisclosed recurring role. Further details about their characters and Season 3’s plot are still under wraps at the moment. Based on Matthew Quirk’s novel, The Night Agent is created and executive produced by Shawn Ryan. The cast includes Gabriel Basso, Luciane Buchanan, Amanda Warren, Louis Herthum, Berto Colon, Michael Malarkey, Keon Alexander, Hong Chau, Arienne Mandi, Louis Herthum, Brittany Snow, Teddy Sears, Navid Negahban, and Rob Heaps. “The series is a sophisticated, character-based, action-thriller centering on a low level FBI Agent, Peter Sutherland, whose efforts to save The President in Season 1 earn him an opportunity to become a Night Agent in Season 2,” reads the show’s newest synopsis. “But working in the secretive organization of Night Action will propel Peter into a world where danger is everywhere and trust is in short supply.” (Source: TVLine)",
