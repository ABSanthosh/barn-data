As the Premier League nears the halfway point of the 2024-25 season, teams continue to vie against one another to further their respective positions. One such matchup today that would heavily influence the status quo in the top half of the table is the game between the two Manchester teams. With bragging rights and three crucial points on the line, both Manchester clubs will look to etch a memorable victory in today’s fixture. Find out how to watch the Manchester City vs. Manchester United game live below. Where can you watch the Manchester City vs. Manchester United game today? You can watch Manchester City vs. Manchester United today via USA Network, FuboTV, and SlingTV. Meanwhile, UK fans can catch the game on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, Sky Ultra HD, Sky Go, and NowTV. NBC’s acquisition of the broadcasting rights to a hoard of Premier League matches in the US means that many games are televised on USA Network, including today’s match. The game is also available to stream on FuboTV and SlingTV. Meanwhile, fans in the UK can view the Manchester Derby on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Sports Ultra HDR, with Sky Go and NowTV serving as the streaming options. What time does the match start? Manchester City vs. Manchester United takes place at 11:30 AM ET, 8:30 AM PT, and 4:30 PM BST on December 15. Despite having won a record four Premier League titles on the trot, reigning champions Manchester City currently find themselves in a form-rut. Pep Guardiola’s men have only registered a solitary victory in their last ten games across all competitions. Their cross-city rivals have not fared much better and currently occupy the 13th position in the Premier League table. How to watch \u0026 stream Manchester City vs. Manchester United for free? You can watch Manchester City vs. Manchester United for free via FuboTV and NowTV. FuboTV allows interested viewers in the US to catch today’s game for free through their 7-day free trial. UK fans can do the same via NowTV. Both platforms offer a week’s introductory period to new users, after which the standard subscription prices apply. Predictions Considering City’s current form, it seems that Manchester United will not have a better chance to cause an upset in the upcoming Manchester derby. Under new boss Ruben Amorim, the Red Devils have showcased flashes of brilliance but have yet to find a consistent rhythm to their game. As such, United are winless in their last two Premier League matches, losing to Arsenal and Nottingham Forest. If Amorim’s men can exploit Manchester City’s wobbly backline, they should be able to etch a historic victory against their bitter rivals.",
