This riveting new action thriller is about a father trying to find his daughter (rewatch the first official trailer).

This stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Bob Ferguson, plus Regina Hall, Sean Penn, Alana Haim, Teyana Taylor, Wood Harris, Benicio del Toro as \"Sensei\", with Shayna McHayle. This is also the sixth movie collaboration between P.T. Anderson and composer Jonny Greenwood. The movie isn't premiering at the Venice Film Festival, instead it's likely to just hit theaters in the fall without a festival stop first. Still looks like it's going to be a blast to watch!
