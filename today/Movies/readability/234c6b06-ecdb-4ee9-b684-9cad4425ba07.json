  "text": "Posted in: Disney+, Marvel, Movies, TV | Tagged: mcu, what ifSet to hit screens with daily drops beginning December 22nd, here's a sneak peek at Marvel Animation and Disney+'s What If...? Season 3. With only ten days to go until the third and final season of Marvel Animation and Disney+'s What If…? starts hitting our screens, filmmakers from the animated series joined guests at a launch event in Santa Monica on Wednesday evening. Seth Green, directors Bryan Andrews and Stephan Franck, and executive producers Brad Winderbaum and Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt joined fans and industry guests for a screening and a post-screening reception. But for those of us who couldn't be there, Marvel Animation made sure we weren't left out – dropping a sneak preview that can best be described with one word: invasion. SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA – DECEMBER 11: (L-R) Seth Green, Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt, Brad Winderbaum, Executive, Television, Streaming, Animation, Marvel Feature Film Production, and Bryan Andrews attend the What If… Season 3 Screening Event on December 11, 2024 in Santa Monica, California. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Disney) Marvel's What If…? Season 3 brings the culminating adventure through the multiverse – as classic characters make unexpected choices that will mutate their worlds into spectacular alternate versions of the MCU. The Watcher (Jeffrey Wright) will guide viewers as the series traverses new genres, bigger spectacles, and incredible new characters. The series features a voice cast that includes a number of stars reprising their roles – with Season 3 featuring characters like Captain America/Sam Wilson (yup, Anthony Mackie), The Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes, Hulk/Bruce Banner, The Red Guardian, Captain Peggy Carter, Agatha Harkness, Shang-Chi, Storm the Goddess of Thunder (!!!), and many more. Now, here's the latest look at the third and final season of the animated anthology series (Don't forget! The final run starts streaming on December 22nd, with a new chapter dropping daily for eight straight days): With a third and final season of What If…? on the way, Brad Winderbaum, Marvel Studios' Head of Streaming, Television and Animation, is reassuring fans that the final run will do right by Wright's Uatu while also bringing a proper closure to the animated series. \"It feels like the completion of a trilogy,\" Winderbaum shared during an episode of The Official Marvel Podcast. \"It takes us to places that you'd never expect. It goes beyond the first two seasons in its exploration of the multiverse. It pulls in characters that are very unexpected and has what I think is an extremely moving and very fulfilling culmination for Uatu the Watcher.\" The final season's chapters are directed by Bryan Andrews and Stephan Franck and are written by Matthew Chauncey, Ryan Little, and A.C. Bradley. Executive producers are Winderbaum, Andrews, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, and Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt, with co-executive producer Matthew Chauncey and producers Danielle Costa, Carrie Wassenaar, and Alex Scharf.
