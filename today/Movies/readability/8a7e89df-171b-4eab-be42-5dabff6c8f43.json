It's not easy, of course. There's always much to think about. But it's the right thing to do. Love, Brooklyn is a film about exactly this moment in the life of a man living in Brooklyn, New York. This delightful and humble film is the feature directorial debut of an impressive, up-and-coming indie filmmaker named Rachael Abigail Holder who's from New York (it's obvious from the way she captures Brooklyn on camera). After directing on many TV series previously, she is making her mark on the indie film scene by directing this lovely little feature - from a screenplay written by Paul Zimmerman. This is such a beautiful discovery, and I had such a warm \u0026 wonderful experience watching this at its world premiere at Sundance. I could feel the buzz and energy in the air, the audience was wrapped up in this story and moved by it as much as I was. That communal experience of falling in love with a film while sitting together is always so touching. Love, Brooklyn stars André Holland (who was also at Sundance last year starring in the very emotional film Exhibiting Forgiveness) as Roger, a writer living in Brooklyn in his charming red brick loft. He's stuck – he can't finish the article about Brooklyn's latest evolution that he has been assigned to write, because he doesn't agree with the premise and doesn't really know what to say. But he's also stuck in his relationships and his emotional growth. He has two women he's bouncing between. There's Nicole Beharie as Casey, a gallery owner in Brooklyn and lover of art who is also his ex from a past relationship though they still go on dates. Then there's DeWanda Wise as Nicole, a single mother who is now his hookup buddy, though she wishes he was actually interested in more than just sex. So he has a woman who he hooks up with but won't let it turn into a real relationship, and he has a woman who he doesn't sleep with but still has an emotional connection to and can't move on from. I believe many people out there are familiar with this exact situation. This very New York film is presented by fellow filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and director Rachel Abigail Holder thanked him for all his support (both financial and artistic) in the intro during the world premiere at Sundance. It feels especially wholesome and touching that Soderbergh, whose career launched at Sundance years ago with Sex, Lies and Videotape, is now able to support and make sure the up-and-coming artists of today can speak their voice in cinema. He certainly has an eye for real talent because I am as impressed by her filmmaking as he already is, too. She has such an effortless sense of understanding in terms of every technical detail and capturing the real, genuine beauty of Brooklyn life on camera. In addition to gorgeous, vibrant cinematography (shot by DP Martim Vian), the blocking and all of the performances are exquisite and natural, the score and visual flourishes enhance the film's light \u0026 lovely mood, the editing choices \u0026 directing decisions are meaningful and confident. All of this to say that Rachael Holder is a filmmaker who deserves every chance to make whatever she wants, because she clearly knows how to make fabulous films. I fell instantly in love with Love, Brooklyn, a film that is light and enjoyable and intelligent. A film made for adults to appreciate, even if they need to do a bit of growing up themselves. Before Sunrise / Before Sunset vibes throughout this following a Roger around Brooklyn dealing with his different relationships with these two women. Elegant moments aplenty, meaningful conversations, heartfelt connections, funny mishaps, and other cute interactions. This is such a beautiful discovery. I could've spent so much more time with Roger \u0026 Casey \u0026 Nicole and their friends. Roy Wood Jr. makes a notable appearance in a few scenes as a friend. I also greatly enjoyed watching Roger ride his bike around the city, something that proves this guy really is a local who loves his neighborhood and feels like he's a part of it. I felt so refreshed and delighted by the end of this film, as if just emerging from a first date that went so well I wonder if this person might just be the one. This cast, this filmmaker, this whole film is a success and I look forward to revisiting it again and again.
