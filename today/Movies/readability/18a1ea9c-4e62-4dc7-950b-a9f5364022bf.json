  "text": "Peacock‘s new TV and movie releases for March 17-23, 2025, include Wicked and the first season finale of Happy’s Place. March 21 brings Wicked and its feature-length sing-along alternate version to Peacock. This film was directed by Jon M. Chu, whose previous credits include Now You See Me 2, In the Heights, and Crazy Rich Asians. Featuring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the movie is set in the fictional land of Oz. It follows Elphaba, an ostracized green-skinned woman who befriends her roommate, the popular and beautiful Glinda at Shiz University. However, the pair’s friendship is challenged by their diverging paths as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good. Then, March 22 brings Happy’s Place Season 1 finale to Peacock. This comedy drama featuring Reba McEntire follows Bobbie, a woman who gets her father’s eatery after his demise. Bobbie eventually learns that her business partner is none other than her estranged half-sister, much to her dismay. Also releasing on Peacock this week are the films The Invisible Man and Minions: The Rise of Gru. The Invisible Man follows Cecilia, whose life dramatically changes when her abusive ex-partner suddenly dies by suicide. He leaves her his fortune. Suspecting a hoax, and after several near brushes with death, Cecilia tries to prove to her friends that an invisible being is hunting her down.
