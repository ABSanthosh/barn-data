  "text": "The International Documentary Association has added 11 more films to its FallDocs screening series, an important FYC showcase for Oscar-contending documentaries. Among them is No Other Land, the film directed by a collective of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers that offers a ground level view of life for Palestinian residents of a West Bank community, who face expulsion from their homes by the Israel Defense Forces. The documentary has won well over a dozen awards around the world, including the Berlinale Documentary Award and the Panorama Audience Award at the Berlinale. Another of the newly added films — Zurawski v Texas, directed by Maisie Crow and Abbie Perrault — will screen at FallDocs on October 29 at The Culver Theater in Culver City, Calif. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton are among the executive producers of the timely documentary, which examines “A group of women denied abortions, even as their lives are at risk, [who] band together with a fearless attorney to sue the state of Texas in an extraordinary effort to regain their rights and reproductive futures — not only for themselves but millions of others.” Watch on Deadline Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, directed by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui, features the three children of the late Christopher Reeve reflecting on his career and legacy and his valiant return to work after he was paralyzed in a horse riding accident. FallDocs in-person screenings take place in Oakland, San Francisco and in L.A. at The Culver Theater; virtual screenings are available globally through IDA’s Eventive streaming platform. Scroll for the schedule of the newly added films. (The full lineup can be found here). A conversation with filmmakers follows all the FallDocs screenings. It’s a very busy fall for the IDA.

The supermax prison was explicitly designed for mass-scale solitary confinement and isolated men for decades. Then, one day, 30,000 incarcerated people went on hunger strike. Told by those who lived it, The Strike goes beyond making a case against solitary confinement; it illuminates the power of organizing and, in doing so, flips the true-crime genre on its head.
