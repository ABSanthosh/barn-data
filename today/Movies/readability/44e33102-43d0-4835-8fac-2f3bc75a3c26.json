  "description": "\"Needs to be heard big and loud.\" Sovereign Film in the UK has unveiled the trailer for a documentary film titled Desire: The Carl Craig Story, a biopic doc profiling the legendary techno producer, DJ and record label creator Carl Craig. This first premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year but it still doesn't have a US release set yet - only the UK. An intimate portrait of techno mastermind \u0026 DJ Carl Craig and an ode to his beloved city, Detroit. Raised in a middle class African American family, Carl's parents fostered his artistic pursuits, even if that meant breaking with their traditions. With Detroit's decline \u0026 recovery as a backdrop, the film follows the career of a musical pioneer whose genre-defying music has been performed around the world. 35 years into his music career, Carl Craig, a leading figure of the second generation of the Detroit techno artists, has now been embraced by the visual arts world, with recent exhibitions at MOCA in Los Angeles and Dia Beacon in New York. But at the pinnacle of his creative and deejaying success, the musician faces challenges that could force him to stay away from the dance floor. [â€¦]",

But at the pinnacle of his creative and deejaying success, the musician faces challenges that could force him to stay away from the dance floor. Yep - this looks very good. Here's the official UK trailer for Jean-Cosme Delaloye's doc Desire: The Carl Craig Story, via YouTube: ðŸŽµ Genre-defying music producer Carl Craig bridges elements within the spectrum of electronic music. He plays with notes from techno to jazz, not to mention he gathers audiences at night clubs and all the way to Carnegie Hall. Moving between dance floors in Detroit, London, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and all over the world, the documentary Desire: The Carl Craig Story tells a story of an artist whose music tells a story all of its own â€” one of struggle and joy in the city of Detroit, all while bringing techno (EDM) music far beyond what the world ever expected. Told through Craig himself as well as the legions of artists that have played a part in his meteoric rise, Desire: The Carl Craig Story beautifully and boldly captures Carlâ€™s extraordinary journey through music and beyond. ðŸŽ§ Desire: The Carl Craig Story is directed by indie filmmaker Jean-Cosme Delaloye, director of the films By My Side, La Prenda, Stray Bullet, and Harley, plus a few other shorts. Produced by Dan Wechsler and Andreas Roald. This initially premiered at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival last year. Sovereign Film will debut Delaloye's Desire: The Carl Craig Story in UK + Ireland cinemas starting May 8th, 2025 this summer. No US release date is set yet - stay tuned. Any good?
