This stars Alexis Zollicoffer, Jon Heder, Mallory Everton, Noah Kershisnik, Archelaus Crisanto, Dave Martinez, Mac Steele Foster, and Oran Stainbrook. It reminds me of the opening party in Cloverfield, but turns into something else trippy \u0026 crazy in the second half of this teaser. Wild.

Gotta check this out at some point, looks like a potential hidden gem. Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Jacob Lees Johnson's film I See the Demon, from YouTube: After seeing a strange object floating in the sky, Lucy (Alexis Zollicoffer) comes home to her own surprise birthday party with all of her favorite people. She's overjoyed, but when asked about her day, she realizes she can't remember anything about it. Her loved ones assure her it's nothing to worry about, but as more unsettling things occur that only she seems to notice, they keep telling her to relax... and enjoy the party... there's nothing to worry about... we'll take care of you... As the evening descends into madness, Lucy must discern reality from illusion, and who of her friends are really on her side. All of this will reveal that the forgotten trauma Lucy's tried to bury, and the secrets of a bizarre procedure she cannot understand. I See the Demon is directed by indie filmmaker Jacob Lees Johnson, director of the film The Thief, along with a few other shorts. The screenplay is written by Jacob Lees Johnson, Davey Morrison, and Martha Duzett. Produced by Jordan Augustine, Ashley Cook, Jacob Lees Johnson, Derek Romrell. This is premiering at the 2025 Cinequest Film Festival this March. No release date has been set yet - stay tuned. Curious to see more? Find more posts in: Horror, Indies, Sci-Fi, To Watch, Trailer",
