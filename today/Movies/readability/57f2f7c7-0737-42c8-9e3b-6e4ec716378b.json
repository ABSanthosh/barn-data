  "description": "\"True story, I swear.\" Netflix has revealed an official trailer for Bad Boy, an Israeli series from the original creators of the Israeli version of \"Euphoria\". This series originally premiered in 2023 at the Toronto Film Festival, and was picked up by Netflix there. It's now set for a streaming debut worldwide on Netflix this May. From Ron Leshem, creator of the original Israeli \"Euphoria\" from 2012 (which was remade in the HBO version), comes Bad Boy, the award-winning new series about youth, survival, and redemption.

Doesn't sound like the most uplifting series to watch right now. But this trailer hints at how creative and unique this series is – reminds me of City of God in several ways.
