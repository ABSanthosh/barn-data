Pixar has revealed their second full-length trailer for Elio, the fascinating sci-fi adventure comedy arriving in theaters soon this summer. It'll be out in theaters worldwide later in June, and we've already posted another official trailer before and this featurette today. It was delayed from last year – is everyone ready to watch? A space fanatic with an active imagination and huge alien obsession, Elio's all in for an epic undertaking when he's beamed up to the Communiverse, an interplanetary organization with representatives from galaxies far \u0026 wide. When Elio is mistakenly identified as Earth's leader, he must form new bonds with many eccentric alien lifeforms, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and somehow discover who \u0026 where he's truly meant to be. With the voices of Yonas Kibreab as Elio, Zoe Saldaña as Aunt Olga, Remy Edgerly as Glordon, Brad Garrett as Lord Grigon, Jameela Jamil as Ambassador Questa, and Shirley Henderson as OOOOO. I've got a good feeling this is going to be a winner! My kind of sci-fi story about a space dreamer. Here's the final official […]",

I've got a good feeling this is going to be a winner! My kind of sci-fi story about a space dreamer. Here's the final official trailer (+ more posters) for Pixar's sci-fi movie Elio, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the second teaser for Pixar's Elio movie right here and the first official trailer here. \"What if the thing you were searching for... found you first?\" Eleven-year-old dreamer Elio (voiced by Yonas Kibreab) is artistic, creative, and an avid indoorsman who finds it hard to fit in. Meanwhile, Mom Olga, who runs a top-secret military project, is working to decode a strange alien signal from outer space. But it's Elio who makes contact, gets beamed into space and is subsequently mistaken for an intergalactic Ambassador for Earth in this original animated adventure. Pixar's Elio is co-directed by three animation filmmakers: Adrian Molina (co-director on Pixar's Coco), Madeline Sharafian (director of the Burrow Sparkshort), and Domee Shi (director of Turning Red and Bao short). Screenplay credits have not been finalized yet. Produced by Mary Alice Drumm. Made by Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, CA. Disney will debut Pixar's Elio in theaters nationwide on June 20th, 2025 coming soon this summer. Looks good? Find more posts in: Animation, Pixar, Sci-Fi, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
