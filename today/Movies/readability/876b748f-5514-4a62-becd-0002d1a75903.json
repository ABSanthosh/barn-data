The film’s one-leg scenes, depicting Robles’ incredible journey as a wrestling champion, have captivated audiences with their authenticity, achieved through a mix of advanced visual effects and Robles’ direct involvement. Let’s explore how Jerome transformed into the legendary athlete, the techniques behind the Unstoppable one-leg scenes, and the collaboration that made this portrayal so impactful. How Jharrel Jerome and Anthony Robles filmed Unstoppable’s one-legged scenes Jharrel Jerome portrayed Anthony Robles, a one-legged NCAA Division I wrestling champion, in Unstoppable. The film used advanced visual effects and the participation of Robles himself to accurately depict the athlete’s unique physicality. Jerome, who has both legs in real life, relied on CGI for many scenes where his right leg was digitally removed. Director William Goldenberg explained the process, stating, “We had both Anthony and Jharrel do all the wrestling. And then, in the editing room, we decided what was best. When it’s Anthony wrestling, we used visual effects to put Jharrel’s face on Anthony’s body. And when it’s Jharrel wrestling, we use CGI to take Jharrel’s leg away.” Goldenberg emphasized the seamlessness of the effects, crediting the visual effects team for their meticulous work. Anthony Robles also performed in specific wrestling sequences, with Jerome’s face composited onto his body. Goldenberg highlighted Robles’ unique athletic ability, saying, “No one can move like him. He’s an incredible athlete, and there are some things that he can do because he’s missing a leg that a person with two legs could never do.” Robles’ involvement was essential in ensuring authenticity. Goldenberg noted Robles’ contributions, stating, “We couldn’t have done it without [Robles]. He was so integral in making it. I mean, he’s a credited actor of the film” (via The Direct). Jerome trained alongside Robles to align his movements with the athlete’s style, creating a cohesive portrayal. The collaboration of Jerome, Robles, and the visual effects team brought Unstoppable to life, ensuring the depiction of Robles’ story was both authentic and technically convincing. The movie premiered on Amazon Prime Video on January 15, 2025.",
