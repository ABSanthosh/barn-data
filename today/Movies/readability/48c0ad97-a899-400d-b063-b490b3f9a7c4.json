Their fashion knowledge will be put to the test as the actors join the cast of “The Devil Wears Prada 2.” And they won’t be the only new faces around Runway magazine. Other newcomers to the call sheet include Broadway stars Helen J. Shen (“Maybe Happy Ending”) and Conrad Ricamora (“Oh, Mary!”), as well as comedian Caleb Hearon. Meanwhile, two recognizable characters, Tracie Thoms, who played Lily, the handbag-loving best friend of Anne Hathaway’s character, and Tibor Feldman, who portrayed Irv Ravitz, the chairman of Runway’s parent company Elias-Clark, will reprise their roles in the sequel. Popular on Variety They will appear alongside the original film’s stars, Meryl Streep, Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci. Disney’s 20th Century Studios is backing the sequel, which is currently in production and set to open theatrically on May 1, 2026. Though plot details haven’t been confirmed, the story reportedly follows Runway’s terrifying editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly (Streep) as she navigates her career amid the decline of traditional magazine publishing. She faces off against Blunt’s character, her one-time assistant who is now a high-powered executive for a luxury group, with advertising dollars that Priestly desperately needs. David Frankel, who directed the 2006 film, and Aline Brosh McKenna, who penned the original screenplay, are returning for the sequel along with producer Karen Rosenfelt. Based on Lauren Weisberger’s novel, a roman à clef about working for Anna Wintour at Vogue, “The Devil Wears Prada” follows aspiring journalist Andy Sachs (Hathaway) who is hired as an assistant at a glossy fashion magazine but finds herself at the mercy of her demanding boss. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning $326 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for Streep. Liu is best known for the “Charlie’s Angels” trilogy, “Kill Bill” and, more recently, “Set It Up” and Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence.” Theroux, who worked with Liu on 2003’s “Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle,” has since starred in “Miami Vice,” “The Girl on the Train” and “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.” Novak broke out as a writer and star on “The Office” and made his feature directorial debut with 2022’s “Vengeance.” Chalamet, the older sister of Timothée Chalamet, rose to fame in the HBO Max comedy series “The Sex Lives of College Girls.” Novak is repped by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett \u0026 Kole. Thoms is repped by Schachter Entertainment and The Gersh Agency. Shen is repped by Artists \u0026 Representatives, Solstice Talent, and Sunshine Sachs Morgan \u0026 Lylis. Feldman is repped by Jamie Harris and Justin Busch at Clear Talent Group and Jodi Schoenbrun Carter 1022m Management. Ricamora is repped by Paradigm Talent Agency. That’s all.",
