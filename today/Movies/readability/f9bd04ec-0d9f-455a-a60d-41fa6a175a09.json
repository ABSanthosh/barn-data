  "text": "A new trailer for Peacemaker Season 2 has been released. The first season of Peacemaker premiered on HBO Max in January 2022. Created by James Gunn, the show serves as a spin-off to 2021’s The Suicide Squad and sees John Cena reprise his role as Chris Smith. The second season of Peacemaker premieres next month. While the first season took place in the DCEU, which ended with 2023’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Peacemaker Season 2 will now be part of Gunn and Peter Safran’s DCU. Gunn has reassured fans many times that the new season will address the continuity change. Check out the new Peacemaker Season 2 trailer below (watch more trailers and clips): What happens in the Peacemaker Season 2 trailer? It’s Chris Smith versus Rick Flag Sr. in the Peacemaker Season 2 trailer, as the story for the new season revolves around Frank Grillo’s character, who is now the director of A.R.G.U.S., wanting revenge for the death of his son. Tim Meadows plays A.R.G.U.S. agent Langston Fleury in the show’s next entry, while Michael Rooker appears as Red St. Wild, a hunter who is on a mission to kill Eagly. The cast of Peacemaker Season 2 further includes Danielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo, Freddie Stroma as Adrian Chase/Vigilante, Jennifer Holland as Emilia Harcourt, Steve Agee as John Economos, Isabela Merced as Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl, Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Sean Gunn as Maxwell Lord, and more. The short synopsis for the new season of Peacemaker reads, “Peacemaker struggles to reconcile his past with his newfound sense of purpose while continuing to kick evildoer butt in his quest for peace at any cost.” Peacemaker Season 2 premieres on HBO Max on August 21, 2025. The first season and The Suicide Squad, meanwhile, are currently available to watch on the streaming platform. Originally reported by Brandon Schreur at SuperHeroHype.",
