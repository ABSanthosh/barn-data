  "text": "The Writers Guild of America Awards nominations have been postponed to Monday, Jan. 13, due to the ongoing Southern California wildfires. In a joint statement provided to Variety, WGA West and WGA East announced: “With Los Angeles under a state of emergency due to multiple wildfires, we will be delaying the announcement of nominees until Monday, Jan. 13, 2025.” This decision follows the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ extension of its Oscar nomination voting period by two days. The Oscars also shifted the announcement of the 97th nominations from Jan. 17 to Jan. 19. The wildfires have caused significant disruptions across Hollywood. Premieres for Amazon MGM’s “Unstoppable” and Universal’s “Wolf Man” were called off. Wednesday morning’s Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations, which were set to be announced by Joey King and Cooper Koch, were also canceled, with a press release instead provided to the media. Popular on Variety Additionally, other major industry events have been postponed. The AFI Awards luncheon, initially set for Jan. 10, and the BAFTA Tea Party, scheduled for Jan. 11, have been delayed. The Critics Choice Awards, planned for Jan. 12 in Santa Monica, has been rescheduled for Jan. 26. The wildfires have ravaged communities across Southern California and continue to affect the entertainment industry. While the rescheduling ensures the safety of all involved, it underscores the broader impact of this natural disaster on the Los Angeles area. The WGA Awards recognize the most critically lauded screenwriters in film and television. This year’s nomination lineup is expected to include some of the year’s biggest awards contenders, including Neon’s “Anora,” Searchlight’s “A Complete Unknown” and Universal’s “Wicked.”",
