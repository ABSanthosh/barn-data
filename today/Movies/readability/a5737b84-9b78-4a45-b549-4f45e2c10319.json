  "text": "Here you’ll find the Final Jeopardy clue for Thursday, October 10, 2024. Mark Fitzpatrick, the winner of Wednesday’s match, comes in as a 4-day Jeopardy champion and could become our first contestant to get a 5-day streak this season. He’s had good luck so far with runaway leads heading into the final and has an impressive total of $81,600. Attempting to stop his streak are nonprofit executive Cynthia Bullock from Colorado and test-prep coach Mike Obstgarten from Nevada. Here is the question and answer for Final Jeopardy on 10/10/2024, plus the wagers and the winner of the episode. Final Jeopardy Question for October 10 The Final Jeopardy question for October 10, 2024 is in the category of “Movies” and has the following clue: More than 25 cast members from this 1990 film drama would later appear on an HBO series with a similar theme The right answer to this clue can be found at the end of this guide. This is to make sure we don’t spoil anything before you see it. Final Jeopardy Wagers and Winner for October 10 In a hotly contested match, Mark became a rare five-day champion by answering the Final Jeopardy question correctly and making an aggressive bet. Since Mark had $18,600 and Mike had $12,800 before the segment, there was no runaway. But Mark answered correctly and won $7,001, snatching victory with $25,601. This brought his total past the $100,000 mark with $107,201. Mike made the strategic play of betting $0, though he did get the answer correct as well. It just didn’t pan out this time, and so he left in second place with $12,800. Cynthia only had $4,400 in the bank before Final Jeopardy and lost $3,000 with her guess of Star Trek. She placed third with $1,400. Final Jeopardy Answer for October 10 The correct answer for Final Jeopardy on October 10, 2024 is “What is Goodfellas?” This is effectively a two-part clue. The first is figuring out which HBO drama it’s talking about, particularly which series would be inspired by a film. This wouldn’t be Game of Thrones, Succession, nor The Wire. I think most TV buffs would land on The Sopranos given the prevalence of critically-acclaimed films about the mafia. From there, thinking about what famous films with crime bosses that are set in New Jersey would lead to Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas. We won’t list every actor that was in both the movie and the HBO series, but some of the more notable ones are Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi and Karen Friedman Hill, Tony Sirico as Paule Gaultieri and Tony Stacks, plus Frank Vincent as Phil Leotardo and Billy Batts.",
