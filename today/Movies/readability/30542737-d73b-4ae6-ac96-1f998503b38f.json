Grey and black, dotted with poster frames, and lit by an overhanging readograph, its presence is tucked away from the other, brighter multiplexes of Leicester Square. There, within its small interior, a team of ushers push through the day.\" Set and filmed entirely in the beloved independent cinema (The Prince Charles Cinema) in London, The Regulars captures one day in the life of its hapless team of employees. Between ushering movies, arguing with difficult customers, and navigating their own internal dramas, the cinema staff must also learn to survive each other. The Regulars is both written and directed by indie filmmaker / editor Fil Freitas, making his feature directorial debut after one other short film (After the Bell) previously. Produced by Dusty Keeney and Fil Freitas. This initially premiered in the UK earlier this year. It also screens next at the 2025 Sheffield Film Festival. Fil Freitas' The Regulars film opens in select UK cinemas starting on August 22nd, 2025 coming soon. No US release date is set yet. For more info, visit the film's official site. Look any good?
