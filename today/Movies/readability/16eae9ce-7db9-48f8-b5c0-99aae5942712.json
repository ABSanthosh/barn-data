Anarchy Pictures has revealed an official trailer for Satoshi: The Movie, a new Bitcoin-inspired movie about the creation of the (in)famous cryptocurrency and its anonymous Japanese inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Yes this is so cheesy because it's meant to be a first look teaser \u0026 pitch video for this movie which is pretty much made by Bitcoin fans for Bitcoin fans. \"Freedom comes with a price\" is the tagline which is a standard way of claiming that cryptocurrency is \"free\" from all government currency. Whatever. Satoshi is a scripted mystery-thriller from Anarchy Pictures exploring Bitcoinâ€™s untold origin â€” not through speculation, but through story. Starring Casper Van Dien as Hal Finney, and Peter Shinkoda as Satoshi Nakamoto, directed by indie filmmaker Shaun Piccinino. \"Satoshi reframes the question from who is Satoshi to why was Bitcoin born â€” honoring the freedom-first ethos at its core.\" Okay sure but this doesn't look like it's going to be a very exciting movie. Pretty dull footage so far. Stay tuned for more updates as this isn't expected to debut until 2026 anyway. ðŸ¤‘ Here's the first teaser trailer [â€¦]",
