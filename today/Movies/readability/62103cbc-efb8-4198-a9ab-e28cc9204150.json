This crime drama series has been praised by viewers for its interesting storylines, stellar performances, great action sequences, and likable, complex characters. Although the series has received mixed reviews, in terms of viewership, it has been doing excellently well. With the initial season having released 10 episodes, many want to know whether another episode or the next season is on the cards. Here’s all you need to know whether Episode 11 is happening or not. MobLand Episode 11 release date and time explained There isn’t a MobLand Episode 11 release date and time. This is because the series ended with Episode 10 titled “The Beast in Me.” MobLand is a British crime-drama series developed by Ronan Bennett. It chronicles the rivalries between two mob families, the Harrigans and the Stevensons. To protect their empires and save their lives, the former family takes the help of Harry Da Souza, a street-smart fixer. Has MobLand ended? Yes, MobLand has finished. It had only 10 episodes. At the time of writing, Season 2 hasn’t been announced. The finale focuses on Kevin stepping up to tackle a problem, whereas Tattersall completes a promise. Elsewhere, Richie gets ready for a battle, and Seraphina is convinced to have a meeting. Meanwhile, Maeve shares interesting gossip.
