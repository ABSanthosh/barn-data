  "text": "The ever so busy Jenna Ortega came to Austin, Texas to celebrate the world premiere of her A24 film “Death of a Unicorn” at SXSW. The film, written and directed by Alex Scharfman, follows father daughter duo, played by Paul Rudd and Ortega, as they hit a unicorn while driving to a mini-retreat. At the end of 2024, Ortega wrapped filming the second season of Netflix‘s “Wednesday.” Just weeks before wrapping, it was announced that Lady Gaga would be joining Season 2. Her character details are being kept under wraps, though it’s expected that the role is more of a cameo.  “It’s the best,” Ortega told IndieWire of working with Lady Gaga. “She’s the best, definitely one of the most talented individuals I’ve ever worked with. It was just a really, really special environment to be there with her and Tim [Burton], two people that I respect and have been inspired by so much.” “Then just finding out that she’s such a sweetheart and really kind and reserved, it’s very strange,” she continued. “I love that you never know what to expect from her, but you can always expect kindness and generosity.” Ortega famously had an iconic dance scene in the first season of “Wednesday” where she danced to Lady Gaga’s 2011 hit “Bloody Mary.” As for if Ortega talked to the “Mayhem” singer about it, she says, “No, actually we didn’t. I don’t think we did. We should have. Actually, I can’t remember. Maybe I just saw an interview clip of her talking about it, because I feel like I’m fabricating this story in my head, but I think honestly on that day, we all were just so lucky that she came to do the show that we kept it as normal as we could.” “I don’t want to give away anything about being part of the show,” Gaga told Entertainment Weekly of working on the series. “I want to keep it extra secret — but, I love Jenna, and I really had an amazing time!” Ortega has further teased that the new season of “Wednesday,” which brings director Tim Burton back into the fold, leans further into the horror elements and has episodes that each feel like a mini-movie. “Wednesday” Season 1 remains the most-watched English-language show in Netflix history, behind only “Squid Game” for the most views of any show. “Death of a Unicorn” releases in theaters on March 28.
