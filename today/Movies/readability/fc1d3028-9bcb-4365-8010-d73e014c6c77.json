  "text": "Sebastian Stan is not here for the Marvel criticism and defends the studio as the MCU continues to transition. The actor who is set to reprise his role of Bucky Barnes in Marvel’s Thunderbolts in 2025 has positive things to say about his time working with the studio. “I’ve never been part of a company that puts so much heart and thought into anything,” Stan said in an interview with British GQ. Marvel has been getting a lot of criticism for their latest films as they introduce new superheroes, but Stan makes note that there isn’t another studio to replicate what they have done. Watch on Deadline “I think if Marvel was gone, it’d be such a big hole to try and fill up. Don’t just go out there and shit on something without offering something better,” he said. As Stan is part of the MCU, he hopes he will be able to act alongside Robert Downey Jr. after he was confirmed to return to Marvel as the villain Doctor Doom. RELATED: Jeremy Renner Says ‘Avengers’ Co-Star Robert Downey Jr. Didn’t Tell Him About Doctor Doom Casting: “And We’re Good Friends” “I hope I’m in a scene with him,” Stan told the publication. “Is there any other guy that could pull that off? I don’t know, probably not. After Tropic Thunder, is there anything that guy can’t do?” Stan first played Bucky Barnes in 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The actor reprised the Marvel role in 2015’s Ant-Man, 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, 2018’s Black Panther, 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War and 2019’s Avengers: Endgame. In addition to playing Bucky Barnes in film, Stan also reprised the role in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Stan will next reprise Bucky Barnes in Thunderbolts, which is set to be released on May 2, 2025. The actor will co-star alongside Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer, Wendell Edward Pierce, Hannah John-Kamen, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.",
