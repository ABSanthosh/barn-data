  "text": "Weezer performed at Coachella on Saturday afternoon without addressing the fact that bassist Scott Shriner’s wife was shot by Los Angeles police and arrested just a few days prior. Weezer, which Scott Shriner joined in 2001, was a last-minute addition to the bill at the desert festival — announced just a few days before the incident — albeit set to appear only for the first weekend. The band played a tightened version of its recent setlist, although it opened with “My Name Is Jonas” a favorite from its blockbuster self-titled 1994 debut album, which is usually aired much later in the set. The band then roared into “Hash Pipe” and “Pork and Beans” before frontman Rivers Cuomo greeted the audience and said, “We were making the Weezer movie back in Los Angeles, but when Coachella called and asked if we could make a surprise appearance, we said ‘Heck yeah.’ It’s so great to be here with all you guys and let out all these emotions,” which presumably could be perceived as an oblique comment on the band’s week (if there are plans to make a Weezer movie, they have not been publicized). They launched into “The Sweater Song,” also from the first album, with sarcastic Coachella-themed commentary from guitarist Brian Bell. Later in the set, Cuomo put his arm around Shriner as the bassist sang the chorus of “Surf Wax America.” Scott Shriner’s wife, Jillian Shriner, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder during a search for a hit-and-run suspect on April 9. Her injury was said to be not life-threatening and she was released from custody on a reported $1 million bond. Popular on Variety The incident took place while police were at a home in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles searching a hit-and-run suspect. Officers spotted Jillian Shriner in the yard of her house, located next door, holding a pistol. Police said they asked her to drop the weapon multiple times, but she refused, instead turning it on the officers, per the LAPD’s report on the incident. LAPD then opened fire and she was hit in the shoulder. No officers or members of the public were harmed during the incident, according to the LAPD report. After being shot, Jillian Shriner was then taken into custody and brought to a local hospital to be treated for the gunshot wound, which police say was non-life threatening. According to the Associated Press, she later posted $1 million bond and was released from custody. The LAPD stated Jillian Shriner had nothing to do with the hit-and-run, and she was later booked for attempted murder.",
