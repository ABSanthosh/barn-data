Here’s what the actress said about her speculated relationship with the BUNK’D star. Josie Totah denies dating Karan Brar amid viral TikTok video The rumors about the two former co-stars broke out when they posted a video online, garnering massive traction. In the now-deleted TikTok video, Josie Totah and Karan Brar appeared to be extremely close as they vibed to “Brooklyn Baby” by Lana Del Rey. Moreover, the duo later kissed each other on the lips, igniting dating rumors. With the clip receiving such massive attention, Totah had to make another TikTok video, to clarify the whole situation. In the follow-up video, the actress laughingly claimed that the whole scenario was a “joke.” Her caption read, “We are two platonic best friends who danced a little too close to the sun.” In addition, Brar took to his Instagram stories, revealing that the video wasn’t meant to be taken this seriously, debunking dating claims. (via People) However, fans had a hard time believing that the rumored couple were really joking, considering their evident intimacy and lip-lock moment. They were quick to take to their comment section to express that the set-up didn’t feel like a joke at all. Josie Totah and Karan Brar met on the sets of the popular sitcom, Jessie. They portrayed Ravi Ross and Stuart Wooten, respectively. This is not the first time the duo has ignited romance rumors. Such speculations previously circulated in July 2024, when Brar posted a carousel of images on Instagram, including one featuring Totah. Nonetheless, both have denied any such rumors as of writing.",
