  "description": "\"You might be missing your chance to win this war.\" FX on Hulu has debuted a second trailer for the series Say Nothing, set in Belfast during the infamous The Troubles period. It's out for streaming this week in the US. This historical drama limited series is created by Josh Zetumer for Disney+ and it's produced by FX Productions. Detailing four generations in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, it is an adaptation of the book Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland by Patrick Radden Keefe. The series follows the lives of people growing up in Belfast in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Starring Lola Petticrew, Hazel Doupe, Anthony Boyle, Josh Finan, and Maxine Peake. For another great film about Belfast, Ireland, I highly recommend watching Kneecap also from this year. This series seems to be more about how a divided nation is bad and hurting each other is bad, but I'm not sure which side it will into regarding the actual politics. Is it pro-Crown or pro-Ireland? Or it's just pro-people? What do you think from this footage? Here's the second official trailer for FX's The Troubles series Say Nothing, direct from YouTube: You [â€¦]",

Here's the second official trailer for FX's The Troubles series Say Nothing, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the first full trailer for FX's Say Nothing series right here, to view even more footage. FX's series Say Nothing is a gripping story of murder \u0026 memory in Northern Ireland during The Troubles. The nine-episode series is based on the book by Patrick Radden Keefe. Spanning four decades, the series opens with the shocking disappearance of Jean McConville, a single mother of ten who was abducted from her home in 1972 and never seen alive again. Telling the story of various Irish Republican Army (IRA) members, Say Nothing explores the extremes some people will go to in the name of their beliefs, the way a deeply divided society can suddenly tip over into armed conflict, the long shadow of radical violence for all affected, and the emotional and psychological costs of a code of silence. Say Nothing is a series created by writer Josh Zetumer, writer on the movies RoboCop and Patriots Day previously. Based on the book by Patrick Radden Keefe. Featuring episodes directed by Anthony Byrne, Michael Lennox, Mary Nighy, Alice Seabright. Executive produced by Edward McDonnell, Monica Levinson, Josh Zetumer, Michael Lennox. FX debuts this Say Nothing series streaming on Hulu in the US starting November 14th, 2024 coming soon. Find more posts: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
