  "description": "\"The death loop.\" Another remake of an American movie! Check out this official trailer for The Shallows, a Chinese remake of the 2016 shark movie thriller that starred Blake Lively as a surfer attacked by a violent shark. This Chinese version keeps the same name - it's literally called The Shallows (also going by é²¨æ»© in Mandarin) and is mostly similar. With a few crazy new technological additions - early reviews say that it features AI and VR - which this trailer hints at as part of her replaying this scenario. Of course in 2025 they add AI and VR. The Shallows is \"the story of a girl who loves extreme sports. When she came to the beach alone to surf, she was attacked by a sudden giant shark.\" Xiaoyun Chen stars in the Blake Lively lead role, with a cast also including Sinan Li, Sen Wang, and Peng Bi Yao. The movie already opened in China in January a few months ago, but we're only catching up with it now. An early review says it's solid - \"Clocking in at 73 minutes, there is entertainment a-plenty in this title, with a rather bloodthirsty opening.\" Hmmmm. Here's the first trailer [â€¦]",

Here's the first trailer (+ posters) for Banchang Xia's remake of The Shallows, from YouTube (via BD): The story of a girl (Xiaoyun Chen) who loves extreme sports. When she goes to the beach alone to surf, she is suddenly attacked by a giant shark. A Chinese remake of the American movie The Shallows. One review explains: \"Like the Chinese remake of Sharktopus that used the creature and military weapon concept but created an original story, this movie does the same â€“ keeping the elements of the shark and the survival component but adding in a sci-fi twist about Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality.\" ðŸ¦ˆ The Shallows, originally known as é²¨æ»© in Mandarin (also called Shark Beach China Edition), is written and directed by Chinese filmmaker Banchang Xia, director of the Chinese VFX movies Dune Devils and Geocentric Crisis previously. This new remake of The Shallows already debuted online in China in January 2025 earlier this year. No US release date has been confirmed yet - stay tuned for more updates. Anyone want to watch this?
