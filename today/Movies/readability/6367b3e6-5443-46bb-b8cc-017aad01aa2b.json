  "text": "The Diplomat and Nobody Wants This have both been renewed by Netflix. The first season of the breakout hit comedy series Nobody Wants This premiered on Netflix in September 2024. Created by Erin Foster, the series stars Kristen Bell, Adam Brody, Justine Lupe, and Timothy Simons. Netflix has now officially renewed the series for a second season. An announcement video can be seen below (watch more trailers and clips): “An agnostic podcast host and an unconventional rabbi on the rebound walk into a party. When they walk out — together — the unlikely pair, Joanne (Kristen Bell) and Noah (Adam Brody), can tell there is something between them,” the synopsis for the series reads. “But also potentially between them, with their differing outlooks on life, all of the modern obstacles to love, and their sometimes well-meaning, sometimes sabotaging families — including her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe) and his brother Sasha (Timothy Simons).” Jenni Konner and Bruce Eric Kaplan are joining Nobody Wants This Season 2, which will premiere in 2025, as executive producers and showrunners, while Nora Silver is also joining as an executive producer. Netflix renews The Diplomat for a third season Additionally, Netflix has renewed The Diplomat for a third season. The first season of the Keri Russell-starring series premiered in April 2023, while the second season is scheduled to arrive on October 31, 2024. Production on The Diplomat Season 3 is now underway. Debora Cahn created the series and returns for the third season as executive producer alongside Russell, Janice Wiliams, and Alex Graves. Ali Ahn, Rory Kinnear, and Ato Essandoh also play key roles in the series. “Season 3 flips the chessboard. In Season 3, Kate lives the particular nightmare that is getting what you want,” Cahn told Tudum about the third season of the series, which does not yet have a premiere date.",
