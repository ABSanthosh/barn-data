  "text": "Sebastian Stan is a key member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to his ongoing role as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, a character he’s been playing since 2011’s “Captain America: The First Avenger.” But the actor recently confirmed on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast that he tried to break into other Hollywood franchises before landing the Marvel gig, one of which was “Star Trek.” “There were a couple things I didn’t get that I really, desperately wanted,” Stan said. “Captain Kirk for J.J. Abrams was one of the first things that I got very close to. I was really close and I had a screen test with him at Paramount studios and my manager had me do a separate photoshoot where I would try and replicate all of these William Shatner pictures just to send to [J.J.] to see how much I look like him and stuff. Didn’t get it.” Abrams ended up casting Chris Pine as Kirk in his rebooted “Star Trek” franchise, which kicked off with 2009’s “Star Trek” and continued with 2013’s “Star Trek Into Darkness” and 2016’s “Star Trek Beyond.” Popular on Variety “‘Green Lantern’ was another one I screen tested for,” Stan said. “I remember getting there and it’s like me, Justin Timberlake, Jared Leto, Ryan Reynolds, and maybe one other person. I am looking at these guys going, ‘I am fucked. There is no way this is happening for me.’ You would get close and it wouldn’t happen, but looking back I am almost glad it didn’t. I don’t know if I could’ve handed that level of attention like some of those guys.” Reynolds ultimately landed the role of Green Lantern, but the 2011 comic book movie was an infamous box office flop and critical dud. Stan would rebound from the rejection by landing Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The role has spanned several MCU movies and television shows, such as the Disney+ series “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” and next includes the film tentpole “Thunderbolts,” which Stan is headlining alongside Florence Pugh. Watch Stan’s full appearance on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast in the video below. His next Marvel movie, “Thunderbolts,” opens in theaters May 2, 2025.",
