  "text": "Gersh has signed actor Ruby Cruz for representation. Cruz is best known for her performance as the timid outsider Hazel in Emma Seligman’s acclaimed comedy “Bottoms,” also starring Rachel Sennott, Emmy winner Ayo Edebiri, Havana Rose Liu, Kaia Gerber and Nicholas Galitzine. The film follows two unpopular students who start a fight club as a way to sleep with cheerleaders before their graduation. She also appeared as Jess in the crime drama miniseries “Mare of Easttown” with Kate Winslet, Jean Smart, Sosie Bacon and Cailee Spaeny. Cruz made history as Disney’s first openly LGBTQ+ princess, Kit Tanthalos, in the Disney+ fantasy series “Willow,” produced by Imagine Entertainment and Lucas Television. The series was a sequel to the 1988 film of the same name starring Warwick Davis, and followed six heroes as they came together to save their world from evil forces known as the Gales. Other television credits include Hulu’s “Castle Rock,” in which she played a young Lizzy Caplan and an episode of the CBS police procedural drama “Blue Bloods.” Popular on Variety Cruz can next be seen in a recurring role on the forthcoming third season of Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble’s Max comedy “The Sex Lives of College Girls” with Pauline Chalamet, Amrit Kaur and Alyah Chanelle Scott. She’s also set to star in Chad Hartigan’s romantic comedy film “The Threesome,” opposite Zoey Deutch and “The Little Mermaid” breakout Jonah Hauer King. Josh Segarra and Jaboukie Young-White also star. In addition to Gersh, Cruz is also represented by Landsburg Management.",
