  "description": "\"Why can't we just celebrate together?\" Prime Video has debuted a third and final fun trailer for the goofy comedy You're Cordially Invited, an ensemble wedding bash created and directed by filmmaker Nick Stoller (of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek, The Five-Year Engagement, Neighbors 1 \u0026 2, Bros). Streaming to watch later this week if anyone wants to drop in on the fun and join the parties (either one!). You're Cordially Invited follows a woman who is planning her sister's wedding, as well as the father of another bride-to-be. They discover that they are double-booked for their fancy destination wedding, so both parties decide to share the venue, but chaos and disaster await, of course. Will Ferrell and Reese Witherspoon star as the feuding hosts, with a fun cast including Geraldine Viswanathan, Meredith Hagner, Wesley Mann, Jimmy Tatro, Celia Weston, Leanne Morgan, Rory Scovel, and Keyla Monterroso Mejia. This is actually the best trailer yet - saving the best for last! Though I'm not sure why they didn't release this actually-funny trailer any earlier. It finally has plenty of legitimately amusing jokes. Here's the third \u0026 final trailer for Nicholas Stoller's You're Cordially Invited, direct from YouTube: [â€¦]",
