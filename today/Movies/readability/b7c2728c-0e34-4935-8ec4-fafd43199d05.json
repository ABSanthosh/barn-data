  "text": "Netflix‘s “Squid Game” has come to a close, and now, series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk is opening up about the real-life resemblances of his villains. During a recent discussion with Time, Hwang said it was hard not to think of Tesla founder Elon Musk when writing about the show’s VIPs, who act as sinister (and exuberantly rich) spectators for the deadly games. “Elon Musk is everywhere these days, right? Everybody talks about him,” Hwang said. “Not only is he the head of a huge tech company that controls the world almost, but he’s also this showman. After writing [Season 3], of course I thought, ‘Oh, some of the VIPs do kind of resemble Elon Musk.’” Popular on Variety While sitting courtside for the first two seasons, the VIPs actually get in on the games for Season 3. As explained by Hwang, “They take their masks off and go into the game and kill others with their own hands.” Hwang added that this decision was largely inspired by the current political climate in the United States. “In the past, those that really controlled the system and maintained power, they were hidden behind the curtain, almost like this big unseen conspiracy,” he explained. “However, it’s no longer the case, especially in America. We talk a lot about oligarchy these days, but these so-called big tech owners, they step up, telling everyone who they’re backing with their money. The people who really control the power and the system, they no longer hide behind a curtain. They willingly take their masks off, almost as if to declare, ‘We’re the ones running everything. We’re the ones in control.’”",
