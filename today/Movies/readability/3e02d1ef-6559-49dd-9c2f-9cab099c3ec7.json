I'd prefer not to get involved in any of my neighbors' lives. No, thank you. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Starz's thriller series The Couple Next Door, from YouTube: A six-part thriller, The Couple Next Door stars Sam Heughan, Eleanor Tomlinson, Jessica De Gouw, and Alfred Enoch. The series is a deliciously dark psychological drama exploring the stultifying claustrophobia of suburbia as well as the fallout of chasing your darkest desires. When Evie (Eleanor Tomlinson) and Pete (Alfred Enoch) move into an upscale neighborhood, they find themselves in a world of curtain twitching and status anxiety but soon find friendship in the shape of the couple next door: alpha traffic cop Danny (Sam Heughan) and his wife, glamorous yoga instructor Becka (Jessica De Gouw). The Couple Next Door is a series created and written by David Allison, a writer on \"The Case\", \"Bedlam\", \"Trust Me\", \"Marcella\", \"Suspect\". All of the episodes are directed by Belgian director Dries Vos. Based on the Dutch series Nieuwe Buren (The Neighbors) originally from 2024. Produced by Jen Burnet; made by Eagle Eye Drama \u0026 Happy Duck Films. Executive produced by Jo McGrath, Walter Iuzzolino, Alison Kee. Starz will debut The Couple Next Door series streaming on Starz starting on January 17th, 2025 early next year. Anyone interested? Find more posts: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
