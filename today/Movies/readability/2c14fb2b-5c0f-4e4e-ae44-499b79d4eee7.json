  "text": "When it comes to adaptations of IP with huge fan bases, it’s impossible to please everyone, but there are some controversies that just feel unnecessary. Take for instance the recent online criticism over Bella Ramsey‘s appearance in “The Last of Us” Season 2. In the video game, as with the series, a five-year gap separates the two narrative installments, with main character Ellie jumping from 14 years old to 19 and putting on a good deal of muscle and height between that time. Though Ramsey was actually 19 when they shot Season 2, they opted not to beef up too much for the part and remains at 5’1″, sparking many to criticize the choice to cast them. However, in a recent interview in The Hollywood Reporter, co-creator and showrunner Craig Mazin shared that he remains confident in his decision to bring Ramsey onto the project despite not perfectly matching the source material’s visuals. “Ellie in the game looks much older. Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don’t,” he said. “I’m not interested in the physical aspect — although I’ve been looking at Bella’s face for years while editing, and I can see that they’ve certainly grown. I’m interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality.” In that regard, Mazin believes Ramsey fits the bill perfectly. He does however recognize the concern for how a character like Ellie would protect themselves in the world of “The Last of Us” being a short individual as Ramsey is. Mazin chose to use this challenge in Season 2 rather than gloss over it. “How does a small person fight with a big person? It’s not going to be karate. It’s not going to be awesome punches and kicks — they’ll lose,” Mazin said. “The answer is Juujitsu. I watch a lot of jiujitsu and I’ve specifically watched sessions where a small person is taking down a big person. That’s how that would happen because nobody’s fucking around in this world.” On the other hand, when it came to tapping into Ellie’s softer side, Mazin wanted to cast a romantic interest that wouldn’t cast a shadow over Ramsey. He ended up finding Isabella Merced to play Dina, who is about the same height as her co-star. “We wanted somebody that was this contrast, this sunlight, because Ellie is tough and reserved and careful, and we wanted somebody who is radiating sun,” said Mazin to THR. “We also didn’t want somebody that was 5’9″, because Bella is pretty short. It’s one of those things where it gets a little wonky to frame [two actors of very different height], or Dina might feel maternal, like a mom.” Other new cast members for this season include Kaitlyn Dever, Catherine O’Hara, Jeffrey Wright, Young Mazino, Danny Ramirez, and Joe Pantoliano, as well as returning co-lead Pedro Pascal. “The Last of Us” Season 2 premieres on HBO and Max Sunday, April 13.",
