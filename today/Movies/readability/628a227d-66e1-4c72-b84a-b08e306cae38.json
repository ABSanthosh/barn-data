  "text": "Spanish rock music veteran Juanes has teamed up with rising reggaeton star Ryan Castro for a festive and catchy new single, “El Chucu Chucu.” The song, the pair’s first collaboration, is an homage to the holiday traditions of the Colombian singers’ Antioquia ancestry. Castro annually releases a festive single, always donning his alter ego, “Richy,” in the visuals. This year, Richy is joined by cousin “Toño,” portrayed by Juanes. The collaboration is said to be the product of the pair’s goal to “create a festive anthem celebrating family, music, and heritage,” according to a press release. On the collaboration and Castro’s participation, Juanes said, “In 1967 Pedro Jairo Garcés releasing his album ‘Playa Brisa y Mar,’ a classic of the chucuchucu paisa sound. I love that so many years later we can come out with this chucuchucu to dance.” He continued, “I thank Ryan Castro for the invitation and interest in rescuing this Christmas tradition and this genre from our roots.” Castro’s holiday anthems include his popular 2021 single, “Mujeriego,” “El Pan de Estefanía” and “La Garrafa” (2022), and last year’s “Richy El Pichón” and “El Bote.” Popular on Variety “Working with Juanes on ‘Chucu Chucu’ is a dream come true,” said Castro. “His music has been a part of my life since I was a kid, and now to create something together that celebrates our Christmas rootsand traditions is special. ¡Que viva Colombia!” Castro recently closed his “¡Ay Bendito Ghetto!” tour across the United States, a co-headlining trek with Blessd produced by Zamora Live. The tour spanned 16 cities, sold out 13 shows, and recentlyannounced its extension to Latin America and Spain. Watch the video for “El Chucu Chucu” below.",
