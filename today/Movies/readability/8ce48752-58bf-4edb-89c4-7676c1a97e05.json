We’re still in the knockout rounds for this year’s tournament, with Game #3 and #4 below. Contestants will receive points for their performances: 3 for a win, 1 for second, and 0 for third. After three episodes (so two games per contestant), the three players with the least amount of match points will be out of the tournament. Since these match points are cumulative, every game will count. The first game for Jeopardy Masters tonight will feature Isaac Hirsch, Adriana Harmeyer, and Neilesh Vinjamuri. The second game will have contestants Roger Craig, Isaac Hirsch (once more), and Yogesh Raut. The difficulty for the clues in Jeopardy Masters are expected to be very high, but these are some of the best contestants of the game. Here are the Final Jeopardy clues for Jeopardy Masters on 5/7/2025. Jeopardy Masters Game 3 – Final Jeopardy Question The Jeopardy Masters Final Jeopardy question for Game 3 on May 7, 2025 is in the category of “Saints” and has the following clue: This saint who helped convert Scotland to Christianity shares his name with the Latin word for an animal sent out 3 times by Noah To prevent spoilers, the right response to this religion question has been placed two sections below. Jeopardy Masters Game 3 – Final Jeopardy Wagers and Winner In a rarity, Isaac managed to get a runway victory in Game 3 for Jeopardy Masters. This was due to several incorrect answers from both Adriana and Neilesh in the second round. With 20,000 points, Isaac had enough to win Game 3 without needing to get Final Jeopardy right. As such, he didn’t risk anything with his incorrect guess of “Paul” and came away with 3 points. Neilesh unfortunately crossed out the right answer, second-guessing himself with “Columbus.” He lost a wagered 5,601, dropping his score from 9,200 to 3,599. This put him in third place, earning him no points. Adriana had 7,400 and also couldn’t come up with the right answer, guessing “St. Mungo.” She lost 3,000, but had enough with $4,400 to get 1 point for second place. Jeopardy Masters Game 3 – Final Jeopardy Answer The correct answer for Final Jeopardy for Jeopardy Masters Game 1 on May 7, 2025 is “Who is Columba?” Columba, who lived from 521 to 597 AD, is known as an Irish abbot who helped to establish Christianity in Scotland. As a result, he has become a saint in Catholicism and is recognized as one of Ireland’s Twelve Apostles. The animal referenced in the clue is the dove, otherwise known as the “Columba pigeon,” which Noah sent out multiple times to discover if land had appeared after the flood.

Jeopardy Masters Game 4 – Final Jeopardy Wagers and Winner On a hot streak, Yogesh won Game 4 of Jeopardy Masters with a runaway victory without needing to answer the Final Jeopardy clue correctly. With numerous right answers in the second round, Yogesh amassed a whopping 25,700. This gave him more than enough for the victory. He still bet 10,000 on “Cassatt,” which was sadly wrong. Still, 15,700 got him the win for 3 more points. Isaac had 4,400 but also answered “Cassatt,” losing 1,201. This put him in third place with 3,199 for 0 points. Meanwhile, Roger nailed the clue, nearly doubling his point total from 2,800 to 5,599 with his 2,799 wager. This gave him the extra point, which could come into play in next week’s eliminations. Jeopardy Masters Game 4 – Final Jeopardy Answer The correct answer for Final Jeopardy for Jeopardy Masters Game 4 on May 7, 2025 is “Who is Berthe Morisot?” The French Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot and is called one of three great ladies (or “les trois grandes dames”) of Impressionism. The Boulevard des Capucines refers to a famous street in Paris that is associated with the First Impressionist Exhibition. Both “Hide \u0026 Seek” and “The Cradle” are an oil on canvas paintings, the first done in 1873 and the second in 1872.",
