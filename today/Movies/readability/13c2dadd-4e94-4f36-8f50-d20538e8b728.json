  "text": "The excitement of Emmy nomination morning fades quickly for studios and networks, because the more daunting question is always the same: How do we actually win? It’s tempting to judge frontrunners based on sheer nomination tallies. If we followed that logic, drama series “Severance” with 27 nods, satirical comedy “The Studio” with a record-breaking 23, and the villainous limited series “The Penguin” with 24 would seem like the ones to beat. But this is the Emmys — nothing is ever that simple. Looking at the drama categories, the race looks to shape up with Apple TV+’s “Severance” versus HBO Max’s critically acclaimed freshman entry “The Pitt,” which earned a solid 13 nominations. Popular on Variety On Emmy night, winning is rarely about just one factor. It’s about crafting the “winning package,” and both “Severance” and “The Pitt” performed exceptionally well with the Television Academy’s four largest branches: Executives, Actors, Writers, and Editors. Courtesy of Apple TV+ In lead drama actor category, Adam Scott (“Severance”) and Noah Wyle (“The Pitt”) are in a season-long faceoff. Wyle, nominated four times more than 25 years ago for “ER,” might finally get his moment.Ben Stiller’s riveting finale for “Severance,” titled “Cold Harbor,” could give him the edge in directing. But with co-director Jessica Lee Gagné also nominated, the threat of vote-splitting looms. Just ask “Shōgun” last year. Britt Lower (“Severance”) also has a shot in lead drama actress, especially as the legendary Kathy Bates is “Matlock’s” sole nominee. Historically, no actor has won when they’re the only nominee representing their series — a 20-year trend that Bates hopes to buck. Meanwhile, Tramell Tillman could make history as the wordsmith and mysterious Milchik in “Severance.” If he wins the supporting drama actor award, he’ll be the first Black performer to ever win that category, making this one to watch. In comedy, the conversation isn’t whether “The Studio” can win, but rather: how many will it win? The freshman satire stomped the nomination record previously held by “Ted Lasso,” and tied “The Bear” for the most-nominated comedy of all time. While “The Bear” posted substantial numbers again, its third season wasn’t as critically adored as its earlier ones. Meanwhile, “Hacks” had a solid showing but missed a major nomination for supporting actor Paul W. Downs. Seth Rogen, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders and Ike Barinholtz in “The Studio” Courtesy of Apple TV+ Seth Rogen — nominated for producing, directing, writing, and starring in “The Studio” — could join the elite club of individuals who won four Emmys in one night, alongside Moira Demos (2016), Amy Sherman-Palladino (2018), and Dan Levy (2020). Supporting comedy actor could go in several directions: Harrison Ford (“Shrinking”) is a sentimental favorite with his first-ever Emmy nom, while two-time champ Ebon Moss-Bachrach (“The Bear”) and scene-stealer Ike Barinholtz (“The Studio”) are strong contenders. On the actress side, Catherine O’Hara — nominated for both “The Studio” and a guest turn on “The Last of Us” — could be a spoiler in supporting comedy actress. With “Abbott Elementary” earning its lowest nomination count to date (just six), the door may finally be open for overdue contenders like Janelle James or “Hacks” standout Hannah Einbinder. Stephen Graham as Eddie Miller and Christine Tremarco as Manda Miller in “Adolescence.” Courtesy of Netflix The limited or anthology categories are where things get heated. While “The Penguin” lived up to expectations with 24 nominations, the surprise standout was the British drama “Adolescence,” which scored 13 nods and is considered a frontrunner in at least six categories. Owen Cooper and Erin Doherty are formidable contenders in the supporting acting categories, and the show is also a major threat in the directing, writing and cinematography categories. Colin Farrell’s turn as the sinister mob boss in “The Penguin” will face stiff competition from Stephen Graham’s gripping performance in “Adolescence.” This one could go down to the wire on Sept. 14. In lead limited actress, it’s a tight race between Cristin Milioti (“The Penguin”) and Emmy winner Michelle Williams (“Dying for Sex”). If voters are judging solely on “The Bear” Season 3, Liza Colón-Zayas could be headed for another win after becoming the first Latina to take home supporting actress in a comedy last year. But “The Bear” is in murky territory. Several past acting wins for the show — like those for Moss-Bachrach and Ayo Edebiri — seemed to come a season early. With mixed buzz around Season 4, and with creator Christopher Storer snubbed in both writing and directing, its winning momentum might be waning. The final round Emmy voting begins Aug. 18. Expect a flurry of campaigning, strategy and last-minute narrative shifts. The first out-the-gate winner predictions are below. The official Emmy predictions pages will be updated over the next week.

Several past acting wins for the show — like those for Moss-Bachrach and Ayo Edebiri — seemed to come a season early. With mixed buzz around Season 4, and with creator Christopher Storer snubbed in both writing and directing, its winning momentum might be waning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\tThe final round Emmy voting begins Aug. 18.
