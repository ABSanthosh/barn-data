  "text": "Netflix has released a new Happy Gilmore 2 trailer, previewing the return of Adam Sandler to his iconic character, and plenty of cameos. What happens in the Happy Gilmore 2 trailer? The trailer sees Sandler’s Gilmore looking to get back into the swing of things after years away from golf. Now facing off against some of the best golfers in the world, Gilmore will have to work hard to get back to where he was. Happy Gilmore 2 is set to release on July 25, 2025, exclusively on Netflix. Check out the Happy Gilmore 2 trailer below (watch other trailers): Netflix’s logline is short and to the point: “Happy Gilmore returns!” In the teaser, Happy has not swung a club in years. However, the big hitter returns to the golf course to face some of the world’s best professional golfers. Donning his Boston Bruins jersey, the unorthodox golfer must rediscover his “happy place” to find success. Some original cast members rejoining Sandler for the sequel include Julie Bowen as Virginia Venit, Christopher McDonald as Shooter McGavin, and Ben Stiller as Hal. Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (Bad Bunny), Sadie Sandler, Sunny Sandler, Conor Sherry, Ethan Cutkosky, Philip Fine Schneider, Maxwell Jacob Friedman, Travis Kelce, and Blake Clark also star. Happy Gilmore 2 features several professional golfers and personalities, including John Daly, Justin Thomas, Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, and Paige Spiranic. Kyle Newacheck, who directed Sandler in Murder Mystery, helms Happy Gilmore 2. Tim Herlihy returns to write Happy Gilmore 2 with Sandler. Producers include Sandler, Herlihy, Jack Giarraputo, and Robert Simonds. Meanwhile, Judit Maull, Kevin Grady, Dennis Dugan, Barry Bernardi, David Bausch, and Dan Bulla are listed as executive producers.",
