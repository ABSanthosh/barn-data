  "description": "\"He was a good boy...\" Music Box has revealed an official US trailer for Kill the Jockey, the Argentinian film starring Nahuel Pérez Biscayart as a rogue horse racing jockey who goes on the run. Thi premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year, and also played at the Toronto, San Sebastian, Viennale, Tokyo, and Stockholm Festivals. It's a gem! One of my favorites from last year – an especially clever, perfectly shot fable with an unforgettable lead performance. Spanish-Argentina actor Nahuel Pérez Biscayart stars as Remo, the on-the-run jockey at the center of this cinematic tale of a man in the midst of transition. Remo's self-destructive behavior and alcoholism overshadows his talent. Abril, an upcoming jockey is pregnant by Remo and has to decide between child or continuing to race. They both race for Sirena, a businessman who saved Remo's life in the past. Also starring Úrsula Corberó, Daniel Giménez Cacho, Daniel Fanego, Osmar Núñez, and Roberto Carnaghi. This already opened in many places last year, and is finally ready for US release in summer. Catch it on the big screen for the full cinematic experience. I'm lucky a snippet of my Venice review last year is quoted […]",

I'm lucky a snippet of my Venice review last year is quoted in this trailer. And check out two stylish red posters for the film below. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Luis Ortega's film Kill the Jockey, direct from YouTube: Once-renowned jockey Remo Manfredi (starring Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) has run out of track. Perpetually inebriated, hopped up on horse drugs, and in hock to a minor mafioso, Remo seems to have a death wish. His girlfriend and fellow jockey Abril (Úrsula Corberó) is pregnant, but more invested in the libidinous equestrian underworld than in their drab domestic existence. Remo’s only hope of getting out of debt and starting a new life is riding on Mishima, a thoroughbred specially imported from Japan for his next race. When Mishima leaps over the fence, Remo winds up in the hospital with a dangerous concussion. Hunted by the mob and replaced in Abril’s bed by the alluring Ana (Mariana Di Girolamo), Remo dons a disguise and finds himself as herself, wandering the streets of Buenos Aires in a striking mink coat and going by the name Dolores. A wild and surreal crime comedy from Luis Ortega (El Angel), Kill the Jockey explores the fluidity of identity, and desire, and animal magnetism in a wholly original and unpredictable register. Kill the Jockey, originally known as El Jockey in Spanish, is directed by acclaimed Argentinian filmmaker Luis Ortega, also director of the films Monobloc, Damn Summer, Dromómanos, Lulu, and El Angel, plus a few episodes of \"Narcos: Mexico\" recently. The screenplay is written by Luis Ortega and Rodolfo Palacios and Fabian Casas. Produced by Charlie Cohen, Benjamín Domenech, Santiago Gallelli, Axel Kuschevatzky, Isaac Lee, Paz Lázaro, Luis Ortega, Esteban Perroud, Matias Roveda, Cindy Teperman. This first premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year, and it also played at TIFF. Music Box Films will release Ortega's Kill the Jockey film in select US theaters starting on July 2nd, 2025 this summer. Anyone else interested?
