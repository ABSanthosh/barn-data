  "text": "Many are curious about when McDonald’s will bring its nationwide famous McRib Sandwich and newly-launched sauce into the U.S. market. Recently, the fast-food giant announced that the latest edition will serve as a holiday gift for devoted customers. It has also provided a specific date for its launch and details on where customers can buy it. Here are the details: McDonald’s announces return of McRib sauce The McRib delighted McDonald’s fans for years but left the permanent menu in 2005. The reason for its removal was cited as: “Unfortunately, many of our restaurants do not have enough grill capacity to cook pork and beef products at the same time” (via The Sun). Since then, the McRib has made limited-time appearances in U.S. markets on special occasions, allowing customers to enjoy it for short periods. Now, with the holiday season upon us, McDonald’s has officially announced the return of the McRib, starting December 3, in a limited capacity. The sandwich will be available for order online via the McDonald’s app, in-restaurant, and through the Drive-Thru. Additionally, McDonald’s has surprised fans with a brand-new McRib Sauce, debuting on November 25 at 10:00 a.m. Customers can purchase a limited-edition half-gallon jug of “A Whole Lotta McRib Sauce” online at www.wholelottamcribsauce.com for $19.99. In a press release, Tariq Hassan, chief marketing and customer experience officer at McDonald’s, celebrated the return of the McRib. He emphasized the cultural significance of the sandwich and noted that the holiday season provided the perfect opportunity to bring it back for fans. He said, “The McRib is more than a sandwich – it’s a part of culture, it’s a legend, it’s an event. McRib SZN is a holiday unto itself, so we wanted to embrace that spirit and give fans an even bigger way to celebrate this year with A Whole Lotta McRib Sauce.” The McRib, created in 1981, features a pork patty with barbecue sauce, pickles, and onions on a bun. Removed in 2005, it has since returned for limited-time runs, including a “farewell tour” in 2022. Now, it’s back nationwide on December 3, accompanied by the holiday song “It Could Only Mean One Thing (McRib is Here).”",
