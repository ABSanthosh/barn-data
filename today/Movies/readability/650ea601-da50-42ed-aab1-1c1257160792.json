  "description": "\"There's been a change in England and we are part of the change.\" Greenwich Entertainment has revealed an official trailer for a music documentary film called AngelHeaded Hipster, also a reference to the poem \"Howl\" by Allen Ginsberg. \"Angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night...\" The film first premiered back in 2022 and never opened in the US - it's only now finally hitting theaters three years later. The film is inspired by the complex and revolutionary music and lyrics of Marc Bolan and T. Rex, the glam rock powerhouse behind \"Bang a Gong (Get it On)\" and other iconic songs. Featuring archival performances and interviews with Elton John, Ringo Starr, and David Bowie, plus filmed musical interpretations by artists such as Nick Cave, John Cameron Mitchell, Joan Jett, Macy Gray, U2, and Father John Misty. These combine with archival footage to trace Bolan's life from his teenage years digging through Carnaby Street dustbins with David Bowie to his tragic death at the age of 29.

It looks like an exciting doc showing how they rattled the cages of rock and are still inspiring musicians. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Ethan Silverman's doc AngelHeaded Hipster, from YouTube: A leader of the glam-rock movement and an early champion of punk, Marc Bolan was always ahead of the curve. This was both an advantage and a stumbling block for the mop-headed T. Rex bandleader, whose unique approach to pop songcraft is highlighted in Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan and T. Rex. Director Ethan Silverman was involved in both the creation of this documentary and the 2020 Marc Bolan tribute album of the same name. This gives him intimate access, both to those who knew Bolan best and to the musicians who were profoundly impacted by his work. Angelheaded Hipster: The Songs of Marc Bolan \u0026 T. Rex is a doc film directed by the music filmmaker Ethan Silverman, making his feature directorial debut after directing a few music films previously. Produced by Bill Curbishley. This initially premiered at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival years ago. Greenwich Ent. will debut Silverman's AngelHeaded Hipster in select US theaters starting on August 8th, 2025 later this summer.
