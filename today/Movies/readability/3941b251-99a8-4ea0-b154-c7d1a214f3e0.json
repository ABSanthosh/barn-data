  "text": "Cody Rhodes, the WWE Undisputed Champion and husband of Brandi Rhodes, joined forces with Roman Reigns at Bad Blood 2024 this past weekend. This is after Solo Sikoa took charge of The Bloodline during Reigns’ absence since WrestleMania 40. Reigns returned to confront Sikoa at SummerSlam, which forced him to face The Bloodline for Ula Fala. As Reigns found himself outnumbered, Cody Rhodes stepped in to assist him. Together, they defeated Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu at WWE Bad Blood. Cody Rhodes’s decision to partner with Roman Reigns raised questions among fans due to his complicated history with Reigns and The Bloodline. Ahead of the match, Rhodes had previously asked Reigns to have his back, promising to do the same in return. At WWE Bad Blood 2024, Reigns kept his word and they won the tag team match. However, after their victory, The Bloodline attacked Rhodes, who was saved by Reigns and Jimmy Uso. Amidst the chaos, Brandi Rhodes captured attention by sharing a photo of herself during Reigns’ entrance. She raised her finger and captioned the post, “I don’t know, guys.” This sparked speculation among fans about whether she acknowledged Roman Reigns at the event. Brandi Rhodes sets the record straight: Denies acknowledging Roman Reigns Brandi Rhodes, the wife of WWE Undisputed Champion Cody Rhodes, has finally addressed the speculation. She took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to set the record straight. In her tweet, she clarified, “For the record, I haven’t acknowledged ?,” confirming that she did not acknowledge Roman Reigns at WWE Bad Blood last weekend in Atlanta, Georgia. For the record, I haven't acknowledged ?— Brandi Rhodes (@TheBrandiRhodes) October 10, 2024 Meanwhile, Cody Rhodes experienced repercussions for teaming with Reigns. After the show, Kevin Owens confronted Cody near his tour bus. Their conversation became heated, resulting in Owens attacking Rhodes. Fans captured the incident on video, as WWE arranged for the fans to capture the moment rather than using their production team. The arrangement was successful as the video went viral on social media.",
