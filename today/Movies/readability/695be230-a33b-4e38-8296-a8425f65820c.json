  "description": "\"I'm already proud of you, Marcel.\" Sony Pictures Classics has revealed the first teaser trailer for a French animated film called Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol, the latest creation from Sylvain Chomet. You already know his other films - The Triplets of Belleville and The Illusionist. This is his latest feature since Attila Marcel in 2013. He also directed the animated short at the start of Joker: Folie à Deux about his shadow. His new film follows the life of Marcel Pagnol, a playwright, novelist, and a filmmaker who became one of the world's most inventive \u0026 prolific artists in the mid-20th century. Based on Pagnol's book, examining his entire life from childhood through his successful career in France and beyond. No US release date is set - expected in early 2025. This teaser features an English-language voice cast with what sounds like Tom Hiddleston as the voice of Marcel, though they did not announce the cast yet. This looks like a mesmerizing, compelling, vibrant follow-up to his previous films, with more eccentric characters. Definitely curious to see more footage ...",

This looks like a mesmerizing, compelling, vibrant follow-up to his previous films, with more eccentric characters. Definitely curious to see more footage from it. I'll be watching because anything that Chomet makes is worth watching. Here's the first teaser for Sylvain Chomet's The Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol, from YouTube: In 1955, 60-year-old Marcel Pagnol is a well-known and acclaimed playwright and filmmaker. When the editor-in-chief of ELLE magazine commissions a weekly column about Pagnol's childhood, he sees this as a great opportunity to go back to his artistic roots: writing. Realizing his memory is failing him and deeply affected by the disappointing results of his last two plays, Pagnol starts doubting his ability to pursue his work. That is until Little Marcel - the young boy he used to be - appears to him as if by magic. Together, they will explore Marcel Pagnol's incredible life and bring back to life his most cherished encounters and memories... The Magnificent Life of Marcel Pagnol, also known as Marcel et Monsieur Pagnol in French, is written and directed by the iconic French animation filmmaker Sylvain Chomet, director of the films The Triplets of Belleville, The Illusionist, and Attila Marcel previously. Adapted from Marcel Pagnol's novel. Produced by Eric Goossens, Ashargin Poiré, Valérie Puech, Aton Soumache. The film opens first in cinemas in France this month. No US release date has been confirmed yet - stay tuned for updates. Who's interested? Find more posts: Animation, Foreign Films, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
