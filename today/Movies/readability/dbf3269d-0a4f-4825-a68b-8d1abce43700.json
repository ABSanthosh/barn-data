  "text": "Bruce Springsteen shared pointed words for Donald Trump during an appearance at Kamala Harris and Barack Obama’s rally in Atlanta today. Between acoustic performances of his songs “The Promised Land” and “Land of Hope and Dreams,” he took a moment to address the crowd, explaining why he will be supporting Harris in the upcoming election and referring to Trump a “tyrant.” “I’m Bruce Springsteen, and I am here today to support Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as President and Vice President of the United States,” he told the crowd. “And to oppose Donald Trump and JD Vance. Here’s why.” He continued on to explain that he believes in Harris’ values and that he wants to support a candidate who honors the lawful traditions of the United States. “I want a president who reveres the constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for a woman’s right to choose, and who wants to create a middle-class economy that will serve all our citizens,” he said. “There is only one candidate in this election who holds those principles dear: Kamala Harris.” Popular on Variety Springsteen turned his attention to Trump, claiming that he doesn’t respect what it means to be an American. “She’s running to be the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant,” he said. “He does not understand this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American. And that’s why November 5, I’m casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I urge all of you who believe in the American way to join me.” The legendary rocker’s appearance in Georgia is the first of two rallies he’s attending in the run-up to the election, and on Monday, he’ll appear in Philadelphia alongside Obama. The pair of events are launching a series of “When We Vote We Win” shows in the seven major swing states during the final days of the campaign. Earlier this week, Eminem made an appearance at a rally in Michigan, where he introduced Obama and championed Harris as a candidate. Tomorrow, Beyoncé is expected to perform at a Harris rally in Houston.",
