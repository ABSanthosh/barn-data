  "text": "As CinemaCon gets underway in Las Vegas next week, studios are locking down their release dates. Amazon MGM Studios is calling dibs on May 15, 2026 for Michael Showalter’s feature take of the Colleen Hoover novel, Verity. In a May male month next year of Disney/Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Doomsday and Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu, Verity will serve as a nice piece of counterprogramming. Deadline first told you about the project which stars Anne Hathaway, Dakota Johnson, Josh Hartnett, Ismael Cruz Cordóva and Brady Wagner. The Nick Antosca adapted take follows struggling writer Lowen Ashleigh who is hired as a ghostwriter for renowned author Verity Crawford under mysterious circumstances. But her assignment takes a dark turn after discovering chilling autobiographical notes. Faced with a series of deadly family secrets, Lowen struggles to separate fiction from reality, while also blurring the lines with Verity’s husband, Jeremy. Watch on Deadline Previous writers on the script included Hoover \u0026 Lauren Levine, Hillary Seitz, Angela LaManna, and Will Honley \u0026 April Maguire. Producers are Antosca, Alex Hedlund, Stacey Sher, Showalter, Jordana Mollick, Hathaway and Hoover. EPs are Johnson, Levine and Kerry Orent. Verity is produced by Eat the Cat, Semi-Formal Productions, Shiny Penny, Somewhere Pictures, and Heartbones Entertainment. Currently scheduled against Verity on May 15 next year are untitled movies from Universal and NEON.",
