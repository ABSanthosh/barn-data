  "description": "\"You are trespassing!\" Netflix has revealed an official trailer for a documentary film called Yintah, which is the word for \"land\" in this tribe's language. This premiered at the True/False Film Festival earlier this year and has played at a number of other prestigious fests in 2024. The film focuses on the impact on the lives of the Wet'suwet'en people who live on unceded territory (in Canada), as they push back against and oppose the construction of multiple pipelines. Yintah is \"about an anti-colonial resurgence—a fierce \u0026 ongoing fight for Indigenous and human rights in the face of a colonial government committed to seizing lands at gunpoint.\" Canada has authorized fossil fuel giants to build pipelines across Wet'suwet'en land. The result: a decade long clash between Wet'suwet'en land defenders and Canadian police seeking to seize Wet'suwet'en land at gunpoint. The story is about two Indigenous women and other land defenders fighting to hold onto their land. Looks like an empowering and vitally important doc spending time with the real people involved.

This premiered at the True/False Film Festival earlier this year and has played at a number of other prestigious fests in 2024. The film focuses on the impact on the lives of the Wet'suwet'en people who live on unceded territory (in Canada), as they push back against and oppose the construction of multiple pipelines.

The result: a decade long clash between Wet'suwet'en land defenders and Canadian police seeking to seize Wet'suwet'en land at gunpoint. The story is about two Indigenous women and other land defenders fighting to hold onto their land. Looks like an empowering and vitally important doc spending time with the real people involved. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Toledano \u0026 Wickham \u0026 Michell's doc film Yintah, from YouTube: Yintah, meaning \"land\", is a documentary on the Wet'suwet'en nation’s fight for sovereignty. Spanning more than a decade, the film follows Howilhkat Freda Huson and Sleydo' Molly Wickham as their nation reoccupies and protects their ancestral lands from several of the largest fossil fuel companies on Earth. Yintah is the story of the Indigenous right to sovereignty over Indigenous territories. Freda, Molly, and the Dinï ze' and Tsakë ze' are part of a centuries-long fight to protect their children, culture, and land from colonial violence. For the Wet'suwet'en, their very future is at stake. Yintah is co-directed and produced by three filmmakers: Michael Toledano, Jennifer Wickham, and Brenda Michell. It's also produced by Bob Moore. This initially premiered at the 2024 True/False Film Festival earlier this year, and it also played at Hot Docs in Canada. Netflix will debut the Yintah doc streaming on Netflix (in the US, UK, and Canada) starting on October 18th, 2024 coming up this month. For more details on the film visit their official site.
