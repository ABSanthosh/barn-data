The emcee, whose real name is Rufus Lee Cooper III, reportedly took his own life in Atlanta, according to fellow Outlawz member E.D.I. Mean who shared the news of his death on social media. “Today I got some of the worst and unexpected news imaginable,” he wrote. “My brother and partner for over 30 years took his life this morning. Rest in Power Rufus Young Noble Cooper. I obviously am in no shape to talk about this right now so PLEASE give his family and I some time to process this. Mental illness is a real battle being fought by so many.” Shakur’s Instagram account, managed by his estate, reposted the message. Popular on Variety The rapper was best known for his work with the Outlawz and appearances on Shakur tracks including “Hail Mary” and the posthumous “Baby Don’t Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II).” Throughout his career, he released five solo albums and numerous collaborative projects with artists including Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone and Dead Prez’s Stic.Man. Cooper was born in Sierra Madre, CA, and moved to New Jersey when he was eight years old. It was there that he met fellow Outlawz members Yaki Kadafi and Hussein Fatal and started recording music. He connected with Shakur after moving back to California and made his debut on the rapper’s 1996 album “The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,” appearing on the opening track “Bomb First (My Second Reply)” and as part of the Outlawz on “Just Like Daddy” and “Hail Mary.” Over the years, Cooper amassed a sizable discography following his solo debut “Noble Justice” in 2002. He released his most recent album “Outlaw University” in 2023. Following news of his death, several of his associates posted on social media in his remembrance. “RIP to my Thug Brother @young_noble just got the devastating news,” wrote Layzie Bone. “I think of Edi and his whole family. My condolences to his family Wife and kids and friends and fans rest up eternal bro. This mental health is a scary thing.”",
