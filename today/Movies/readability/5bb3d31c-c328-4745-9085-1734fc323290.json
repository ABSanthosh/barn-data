  "text": "Prime Video’s beloved sci-fi series is getting closer to its imminent end. Series actor Robbie Amell has shared behind-the-scenes images from Upload Season 4, confirming that the final season has already wrapped filming.  “How it ended vs how it started,” the actor wrote. “The 4th and final season of Upload is officially wrapped and we can’t wait for you to see how it ends. Thank you to everyone who’s been watching with us over the last 6 years.” You can check out Amell’s Instagram post down below:  What to expect in Upload Season 4? Amell, who plays Nathan Brown, is set to return for the fourth and final season of Upload. It hasn’t been officially confirmed yet who’s joining the actor for Upload Season 4. However, Andy Allo and Allegra Edwards are expected to return as Nora Antony and Ingrid Kannerman, respectively.  Upload is set in a world wherein people can upload themselves to a virtual world of their choosing after their death. When computer programmer Nathan unexpectedly died, he found himself uploaded to an expensive virtual world called Lakeview.  The third season ended with quite a cliffhanger, bringing in two Nathans in the mix. Details about Season 4 are still thin, but the upcoming final season is expected to answer all the questions left in the Season 3 finale: which of the two Nathans survived?  “Set in a technologically advanced future where holographic phones, self-driving vehicles, AI assistance, and 3D food printers are the norm. And, forget about dying – instead, you’ll be “uploaded” to a virtual reality afterlife, and enjoy all the comforts of a world-class resort. Provided you can afford it,” the synopsis reads.  The series is created by Greg Daniels (The Office). It also stars Zainab Johnson as Aleesha Morrison-Downey and Kevin Bigley as Luke Crossley, among others.  No release date has been set yet for Upload Season 4. Previous seasons are available to stream on Prime Video.",
