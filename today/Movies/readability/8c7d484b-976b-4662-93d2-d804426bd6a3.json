  "text": "Billboard Women in Music 2025 “See you at the Oscars,” joked Richard Brener, President \u0026 Chief Creative Officer of New Line after showing an extended 20-minute look at Final Destination: Bloodlines. “Two brother think they have to figure out a way to thwart Death,” he said. “What could go wrong?” Oscar maybe not, but there’s a lot of hope for the first Final Destination in 14 years: The pic’s trailer ranks as the second most watched for a horror movie after It with 178.7M global views. The Final Destination franchise through five movies counts over $660M at the global box office. The long look at the fan-favorite franchise has peanut-allergic Bobby Campbell attempting to retrieve a peanut butter cup from a hospital vending machine urged on by his brother, who plans to revive him. “If I am going out, it’s not going be on those unsalted bitches,” Bobby said, rejecting Erik’s first choice of a deadly snack. He’s reluctant to take a bite, but does. “Technically, I am gong to let you die, but I am going to bring you back,” says Erik. It doesn’t as planned and its nasty. There’s magnetic force. There is blood. Blurb for the pic directed by Zach Lipovsky and Adam B. Stein: Plagued by a recurring violent nightmare, a college student returns home to find the one person who can break the cycle and save her family from the horrific fate that inevitably awaits them. Guy Busick \u0026 Lori Evans Taylor wrote the screenplay and story is by Jon Watts and Busick \u0026 Taylor. The project is based on characters created by Jeffrey Reddick. Producers are Craig Perry, Sheila Hanahan Taylor, Jon Watts, Dianne McGunigle and Toby Emmerich. EPs are David Siegel and Warren Zide. Kaitlyn Santa Juana, Teo Briones, Richard Harmon, Owen Patrick Joyner, Anna Lore, with Brec Bassinger and Tony Todd star.",
