  "text": "Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt FOX Sports While Tom Cruise took care of the Olympics handoff solo, he had some company today pumping up America before the Super Bowl. “The long winding road here has all led to this,” intoned Cruise in a pre-game hype video broadcast today on Fox just a few minutes before kickoff. Cruise’s video mixed Mission: Impossible-adjacent encomiums with slow-motion shots of Eagles and Chiefs players as they readied themselves for the big game. Just a few minutes earlier, a stirring video narrated by Brad Pitt dropped online, with the superstar stressing the Super Bowl as a metaphor for national unity: “Today, we celebrate the urgency of now, the thrill of what’s next, the glory of this game, and we do it as one.” Watch on Deadline (Extra points for architecture buff Pitt working L.A.’s iconic Bradbury Building into his video.) Both stars also had trailers for their next films drop during the big game. A promo for Cruise’s final outing as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning showcased the high stakes of the star’s last stint chasing down villains, conducting submarine reconnaissance and hanging off planes. Pitt teams with Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski for the racing drama F1, the Super Bowl trailer for which shows the actor navigating some tense moments on and off the track as former Formula One driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport after a horrible crash took him out of commission in the ’90s.
