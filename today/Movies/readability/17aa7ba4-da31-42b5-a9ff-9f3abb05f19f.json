  "text": "Chad A. Verdi of Verdi Productions and Anthony Gudas and Aaron Kaufman of Public School Productions have partnered with producers John Scalise, Keanu Reeves and Fisher Stevens to produce “The Jet,” a documentary on the life story of Benny “The Jet” Urquidez. The film is currently in production from director Jennifer Tiexiera. Verdi, Gudas, and Kaufman will join Reeves, Maura Anderson, Zak Kilberg and Scalise as producers. Urquidez is known for his influence on martial arts in mainstream culture as an actor, fight coordinator, and trainer to the stars. He held a total of six world titles in five weight divisions and remained undefeated throughout his more than 20-year kickboxing career. Urquidez is also known for his contributions to martial arts cinema, appearing in numerous action films during the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his film credits include “The Octagon,” “Road House” and “Grosse Pointe Blank.” Over the years, he also trained and worked with Jackie Chan, Muhammed Ali, Elvis Presley, Mark Wahlberg, Nicole Kidman, Kurt Russell, Patrick Swayze, Nicolas Cage, Michelle Pfeiffer, Duff McKagan and others. Popular on Variety “Having just completed filming in Italy on Martin Scorsese’s documentary ‘Shipwrecks of Sicily,’ Verdi Productions is excited to start producing another documentary for our upcoming filming slate. Our company looks forward to collaborating with Johnny, Keanu, Fisher, and Jennifer in Rhode Island during Q4 of 2024,” Verdi said. “We are honored to have Verdi Productions join us in telling the fantastic and unbelievable story of an icon who bridged the worlds of Hollywood and martial arts. Benny is a once-in-a-lifetime icon who has inspired people from all walks of life, from the barrio to Hollywood studios. It is inspiring to have the support of so many remarkable individuals as we bring this project to life,” said Scalise. Filming will begin in Rhode Island in November. Michelle Verdi, Chad Verdi Jr, Paul Luba and Sera Verdi from Verdi Productions will join Nancy Weisler, Brian Maya, Chris Quintos Cathcart, and Tyler Boehm as executive producers on the project, which is currently slated for release in 2025.",
