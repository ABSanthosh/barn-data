  "text": "FX has once again said “yes, chef” to “The Bear,” renewing the hit culinary drama for a fifth season. “’The Bear’ continues to be a fan favorite worldwide and their response to this season—as seen through incredibly high viewership—has been as spectacular as any of its previous seasons,” FX chairman John Landgraf said in a statement. “Year-in and year-out, Chris Storer, the producers, cast and crew make ‘The Bear’ one of the best shows on television, and we are excited that they will continue to tell this magnificent story.” No production timeline or release date for “The Bear” Season 5 was announced, though history suggests the show is likely to return in summer 2026. “The Bear” famously releases new seasons at the same time that Emmy voters are considering the previous season, ensuring that the show is top of mind during the home stretch of the Emmy race. If that happens, Season 5 will aid the Emmy campaign of the just-dropped Season 4, which has received largely positive reviews, even if the ending proved to be polarizing. “Seen one way, ‘The Bear’ Season 4 is still pretty fun; an emotionally rich restaurant drama with great food, a few laughs, and lots of heart,” IndieWire’s Ben Travers wrote in his Season 4 review. “Seen another way, though, and it’s our second straight disappointment; a prolonged story propped up by its talented cast and dragged out for reasons that remain unclear. Revisiting ‘The Bear’ will likely always leave you nourished. But it’s drifting further away from a Michelin-level hang.” Co-showrunners Christopher Storer and Joanna Calo also have to reckon with a problem faced by many successful TV shows: the budding film careers of their cast. Jeremy Allen White will play Bruce Springsteen (and possibly mount an Oscar campaign) for this fall’s “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” Ebon Moss-Bachrach makes his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in this month’s “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” and Ayo Edeberi stars in Luca Guadagnino’s upcoming campus drama “After the Hunt.”",
