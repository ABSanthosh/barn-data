  "text": "Netflix has announced the Sweet Magnolias Season 4 release date for the upcoming return of the hit romantic drama, after over a year since the released of its 10-episode third season. The show is based on the book series by Sherryl Woods. “Come spend the holidays in Serenity, as Season 4 of Sweet Magnolias takes us from Halloween to Christmas, with surprising laughter, unexpected heartbreak, and renewed resolve along the way,” reads the official synopsis. “While negotiating the twists and turns of their romantic lives, Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen must also navigate the return of old foes, the loss of great loves, and the pain of transition from past dreams to present ones. As the men in their lives pursue their own dreams and the teenagers take uneasy steps toward adulthood, the Magnolias support each other with creative problem-solving, deep-hearted commitment, and — as always — weekly margaritas.” When is the Sweet Magnolias Season 4 release date? Sweet Magnolias Season 4 will be available for streaming starting on February 6, 2025. The ensemble cast includes JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Brooke Elliott, Heather Headley, Logan Allen, Anneliese Judge, Carson Rowland, Dion Johnstone, Brandon Quinn, Jamie Lynn Spears, and Chris Medlin with Justin Bruening. The series is created and executive produced by showrunner Sheryl J. Anderson. Executive producers are Woods, Dan Paulson, Matt Drake, and Norman Buckley, with Brian J. Johnson serving as its director of photography. The directing lineup includes Lauren Petzke, Christine Swanson, Buckley, JoaAnne Garcie Swisher, and Drake, with Buckley helming four episodes.",
