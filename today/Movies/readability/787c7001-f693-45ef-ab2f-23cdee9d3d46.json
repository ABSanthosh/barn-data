  "text": "While a lot of fans originally seemed opposed to Rachel Brosnahan playing the iconic role of Lois Lane in James Gunn’s Superman, the movie’s recent release has changed the opinions considerably. Not only has the 35-year-old actress received overwhelmingly positive responses to her portrayal, but some are even calling it the best version of Lois Lane on screen so far. How fans reacted to Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane The fan reaction to The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star as Lois Lane has been overwhelmingly positive. Rachel Brosnahan has done a fantastic job playing the character, and many have been seemingly won over by the character’s comic accuracy. Several fans are discussing this on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit, claiming that her Lois Lane is like no other. “Rachel Brosnahan is without a doubt my favorite Lois Lane, it’s like you shook a comic and she fell out. This is her movie just as much as it is #Superman’s, she commands the screen so naturally. Her chemistry with David is next level, I really love how much she challenges Clark,” a fan wrote on X. Meanwhile, other fans had similar things to say about Brosnahan’s performance and are eager to see more of her as Lane. A third user said, “Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane is generational casting btw. She ate up this whole movie. If you love Lois? Like, if you’re a Lois Lane fan? MANNNNN… you’re in for a treat. It’s her movie just as much as Superman’s. She’s so good. Her chemistry with David is off the charts.” Furthermore, Reddit users couldn’t stop gushing over the actress’ work and called her comic-accurate. Some even compared Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane to Margo Kidder’s portrayal of Superman’s love interest. These reactions clearly indicate how much fans love the new Lois Lane. To add to this, Rachel Brosnahan has also been praised by critics for her performance. With David Corenswet also standing out as the new Superman, it seems that this DCU has built a solid foundation that will be able to sustain the new universe.",
