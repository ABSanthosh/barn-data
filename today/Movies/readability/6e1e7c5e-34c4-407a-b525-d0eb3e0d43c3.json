Featuring a brand new interview with Eminem. Not sure if it'll touch on the darker side of fandom, hopefully they cover all aspects of it. Have a look below. Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Steven Leckart's documentary Stans, direct from YouTube: Released in 2000, Eminem's song \"Stan\" — about an obsessive, unstable fan — remains iconic. So iconic the term stan was officially to the dictionary in 2017. In the song, the titular character handwrites a series of emotional letters to Eminem, repeating the line: \"I'm just like you.\" That refrain serves as the guiding light for this unconventional and fully authorized feature, which follows a highly curated cast of real-life stans whose deep personal connections to Eminem mirror some of the themes found throughout his lyrics. More than just an exploration of fandom, the film examines the complicated relationship between one of the world's most private artists \u0026 his massive public persona. Through stylized recreations, rare archival footage, intimate interviews, and an exclusive original interview with Eminem himself, it offers a raw, loud, and revealing journey across his music career, and the passionate fanbase that has grown with him. Stans is a documentary directed by American producer / filmmaker Steven Leckart, director of episodes of \"Dogs\" and \"Challenger: The Final Flight\" doc series previously, plus a producer on many other doc series including \"Wild Things: Siegfried \u0026 Roy\" and \"Legacy: The True Story of the LA Lakers\". Produced by Tony DiSanto, Antoine Fuqua, Stuart Parr, Paul Rosenberg, and Eminem. Executive produced by Steven Leckart and Michael Maniaci. This hasn't premiered at any festivals, as far as we know. Trafalgar Releasing debuts Leckart's Stans doc in theaters worldwide starting August 7th, 2025. For info + tickets visit the film's site.
