  "text": "Babyface got snubbed at the 2025 Grammy Awards in favor of Chappell Roan, and the moment went viral. Midway through an interview with the AP, the Grammy winner was cut off to interview the “Good Luck, Babe” singer. As Babyface was talking to reporters, one of the reporters noticed Chappell Roan was behind them, waiting to get interviews. The reporter calls out the “Hot To Go” singer by name a couple of times, and Babyface turns around and tells the reporters, “You guys want to… go do that.” Babyface gives the microphone back to the reporters while they apologize to him and greet Chappell Roan. Many fans on social media have dinged the moment as unprofessional and disrespectful to Babyface.
