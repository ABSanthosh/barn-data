Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Albert Serra's doc film Afternoons of Solitude, from YouTube: A film from the visionary director of Pacifiction, Albert Serra's Afternoons of Solitude is a spellbinding documentary that turns its gaze on the ceremonial splendor and devastating brutality of bullfighting in Spain. With quiet intensity, Serra follows famed matador Andrés Roca Rey, from the solitude of his hotel room \u0026 meticulousness of his preparations to the charged spectacle of the arena. Through his immersive \u0026 unhurried lens, Serra reveals Rey's profound physical, spiritual, aesthetic commitment to a centuries-old ritual—one that demands he take part in a timeless duel between man and beast. Afternoons of Solitude, also known as Tardes de Soledad in Spanish, is directed by the filmmaker Albert Serra, director of the films Crespià, Birdsong, 60 Seconds of Solitude in Year Zero, Story of My Death, The Death of Louis XIV, Roi Soleil, Liberté, Pacifiction previously. It's produced by Pierre-Olivier Bardet, Luis Ferrón, Marta Lacima Ligero, Pedro Palacios, Ricard Sales, Joaquim Sapinho, Albert Serra, Montse Triola, \u0026 Marta Vieira Alves.
