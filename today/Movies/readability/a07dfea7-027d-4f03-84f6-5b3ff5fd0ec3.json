  "text": "Break out those parachutes and pull on that face-shifting mask because a “Mission: Impossible” exhibition will debut at Museum of the Moving Image (MoMI) next month on April 18. Titled “Mission: Impossible — Story and Spectacle,” this special presentation will explore star and producer Tom Cruise’s devotion to practical stunt work throughout the hit espionage franchise. More importantly, it will dissect how each installment and the series as a whole utilizes technical craftsmanship to shape its overall narrative. Launching in the lead-up to the Memorial Day Weekend release of Ethan Hunt’s eighth adventure, “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” this exhibition aims to celebrate a saga that continues to stretch the limits of what can be captured on film. As per Variety, each film in the series will receive its own section that highlights the main stunt or action set-piece featured as part of its story, ranging from Cruise rappelling into the vault in the first entry to him hanging off the side of a carrier aircraft in “Rogue Nation.” Rare behind-the-scenes content will be shown that break down how Cruise and the production team approach each life-threatening leap through the air, with corresponding production artifacts on display as well, courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Deputy director for curatorial affairs at MoMI, Barbara Miller, said in a statement of the project, “For almost 30 years, ‘Mission: Impossible’ films have thrilled audiences with suspenseful stories and unparalleled practical stunts. MoMI is excited to partner with Paramount Pictures on this major exhibition to explore the series’ unique achievements and create a fun, illuminating experience for fans and visitors.”  Those who purchase general admission tickets to MoMI will automatically be granted entry to “Mission: Impossible — Story and Spectacle” during its run. In addition to Paramount, Empire State Development and I LOVE NY, New York State’s Division of Tourism, have also made this exhibition and related program possible through its Market New York grant.  Rotating exhibitions and hosting screenings on a frequent basis, MoMi houses more than 130,000 artifacts at its Astoria, Queens location. A direct follow-up to “Mission Impossible — Dead Reckoning,” which sees legendary spy Ethan Hunt facing an enemy he can’t see or chase, “Mission Impossible — The Final Reckoning” is estimated to be one of the most expensive films ever made, costing a rough $400 million dollars. As seen in the film’s trailer, the key stunt of this chapter looks to involve Tom Cruise hanging off the side of a 20th century biplane.",
