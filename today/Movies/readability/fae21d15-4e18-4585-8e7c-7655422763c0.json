  "text": "Chris Evans is officially returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as TheWrap is reporting that the star who played Captain America for over a decade will be in Avengers: Doomsday. Who will Chris Evans be in Avengers: Doomsday? Although Evans is reportedly returning to the world of Marvel, it’s unclear whether or not he will be back as Captain America. TheWrap’s report notes that the extent and exact nature of Evans’ appearance is unknown. Famously, Evans said goodbye to the role of Steve Rogers in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame, with the character choosing to stay back in time and grow old with Peggy Carter. Anthony Mackie, who plays Sam Wilson in the MCU, is set to take up the moniker of Captain America in the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, which releases on February 14, 2025. Evans’ return to the MCU has been something that has been rumored for some time now. The actor himself even said he’d be open to returning as long as the right thing came up in the past, and now it apparently has. He’ll be joining fellow former MCU member Robert Downey Jr. in the project, with the latter set to play the role of Victor Von Doom, aka Doctor Doom, in the film. Doomsday will also see the return of MCU mainstays The Russo Brothers, with Joe and Anthony set to direct the next ensemble film. Avengers: Doomsday does not have an official release date as of yet, although Marvel Studios has said the film is coming in May 2026. It was previously dated a year prior for May 2, 2025, but joined a lengthy list of Marvel delays as many movies saw rewrites and were impacted by the entertainment industry strikes throughout 2023. The film was previously named Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, but has since been renamed following the firing of Jonathan Majors last year. While the plot of the film is unclear, the film will all but certainly focus entirely around Doom, one of the most iconic and well-known villains in comic book history. (Source: TheWrap)",
