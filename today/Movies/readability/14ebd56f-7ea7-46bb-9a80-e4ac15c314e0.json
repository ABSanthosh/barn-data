From filmmaker Ruth Leitman, this premiered at the 2023 DOC NYC Film Festival last year and is opening next week just before the upcoming election. The film is \"a bold call to action driven by the power of humor in social change, where joy prevails.\" No One Asked You follows the comedian and disruptor-extraordinaire Lizz Winstead (co-creator of The Daily Show), and her organization Abortion Access Front (website), as they crisscross the U.S. to support abortion clinic staff and bust stigma with comedy shows. Pop culture icons \u0026 next-gen comics fuel this 6-year road film activating small-town folks to rebuild vandalized clinics, expose all the wrongdoer politicians, anti-abortion extremists, and media neglect as the race to the bottom ensues and our rights burn down.

From filmmaker Ruth Leitman, this premiered at the 2023 DOC NYC Film Festival last year and is opening next week just before the upcoming election.

Yep, this is the kind of fresh new take on activism we really do need right now. \"This is a movement.\" I like her line about how at the end of the day they will celebrate joy above all. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Ruth Leitman's doc No One Asked You, direct from YouTube: Comedian, disrupter extraordinaire Lizz Winstead (also co-creator of The Daily Show) and her team of activists crisscross the U.S. to support abortion clinic staff and bust stigma. Pop culture icons and next-gen comics fuel this six-year road film activating small-town folks to rebuild vandalized clinics, exposing wrongdoer politicians, domestic terrorists, and media neglect as the race to the bottom ensues. A bold call to action reminds us that when the patriarchy burns down, joy will prevail. No One Asked You is directed by American indie filmmaker Ruth Leitman, director of the films Wildwood NJ, Alma, Tony \u0026 Janina's American Wedding, and Lipstick \u0026 Dynamite, Piss \u0026 Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling previously. It's produced by Andrea Raby and Rachel Rozycki. This initially premiered at the 2023 DOC NYC Film Festival last year. Leitman's No One Asked You doc will debut in select US theaters (at DCTV's Firehouse Cinema in NYC) starting on October 18th, 2024 with more cinemas in November throughout Election Day. It'll also be available to watch online via Jolt later in October. For more info, visit the film's official site. Interested? Find more posts: Documentaries, Indies, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
