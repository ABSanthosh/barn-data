The first teaser trailer is here.Article Summary CinemaCon debuts a teaser for Five Nights At Freddy's 2 with a theater exclusive release on December 2. The film delivers intense horror thrills and captures the iconic spirit of Five Nights At Freddy's games. Director Emma Tammi returns to craft a visually engaging journey for fans of Five Nights At Freddy's. Blumhouse and Universal ignite holiday horror with CinemaCon buzz and high box office expectations. Five Nights At Freddy's 2 is, in some circles, the most anticipated film of the year. Last week, Jason Blum teased that there would be something happening this week, and tonight at CinemaCon, something did indeed happen. The teaser trailer for the second film is now online, and on top of that, the film will debut in theaters only on December 2. No day and date Peacock drop for this one. Emma Tammi returns to direct, with Josh Hutcherson is back as Mike,  Matthew Lillard is back as well as Piper Rubio as Abby and Elizabeth Lail as Vanessa. Five Nights At Freddy's 2 Is the Horror Event Of The Winter From exclusive Hollywood product presentations debuting a slate of upcoming films, to must-see premiere feature screenings, to the biggest stars, producers and directors, CinemaCon will jumpstart the excitement and buzz that surrounds the holiday season (and beyond) at the box office. The CinemaCon schedule will be broad, diverse, educational and fun, and will feature the largest cinema trade show in the world. It will appeal to and attract all facets of the international motion picture theater industry—exhibition, distribution, marketing, publicity and advertising, internet and social media and of course, the theater equipment and concessions manufacturers and dealers who will showcase the latest technological advances and innovative concession offerings at the trade show, which is run in association with our partners at ICTA and NAC. As well, CinemaCon will once again incorporate a special day of programming geared just for the international marketplace, that being Monday, 31 March, 2025. Credit Blumhouse Five Nights At Freddy's 2 is as close to a sure thing as there is in Hollywood at this point, and a hit that Blumhouse badly needs. That teaser is not much to go off of if you are someone like me who has never played the games, but my daughter is currently running around the house screaming and amped up, so I guess that was enough for her.
