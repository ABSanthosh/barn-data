  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: October is Jim “Kitty” Kaat’s time of year. Not only did the southpaw pitch in the World Series three times – winning a ring with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982 – but he became a great broadcaster, covering the MLB playoffs for ESPN, as well as serving as an announcer for the Yankees and later the Minnesota Twins. This October, there’s more news about the 85-year-old Hall of Famer. A documentary about him, Kitty to Cooperstown, has been acquired by Gravitas Ventures, a deal covering U.S. and Canadian distribution rights. Kitty to Cooperstown, directed by Nick Hagen, “delves deep into the career and personal journey of Jim Kaat, capturing his path to Cooperstown, the challenges he faced, and his enduring legacy in the sport of baseball,” according to a release. “Kaat, who has left an indelible mark on the game, is celebrated not only for his remarkable pitching career but also for his contributions as a broadcaster and mentor to younger players. Baseball Hall of Famer Jim “Kitty” Kaat Gravitas Ventures “Jim Kaat, affectionately known as ‘Kitty,’ enjoyed a prolific career spanning 25 seasons in Major League Baseball, pitching for teams including the Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, and St. Louis Cardinals. He was a three-time All-Star and a 16-time Gold Glove Award winner, renowned for his exceptional fielding skills and consistency on the mound. In 1982, Kaat achieved the pinnacle of his career by winning a World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals.” Watch on Deadline Cincinnati Reds pitching coach Jim Kaat (R) talks to player/manager Pete Rose during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1984 in Pittsburgh, Penn. George Gojkovich/Getty Images The documentary includes exclusive interviews with Kaat, as well as insights from Hall of Famers Ozzie Smith, Rod Carew, and Mike Schmidt. It also features interviews with broadcaster Bob Costas, and two of Kitty’s MLB contemporaries — Pete Rose (the Hit King who died in late September), and Tony Oliva. “We are incredibly excited to partner with Gravitas Ventures to distribute this documentary,” Hagen said in a statement. “Jim Kaat’s story is one of perseverance, dedication, and passion for the game of baseball. And as Bob Costas said it best, Jim is an exemplary citizen of the game. I hope this documentary can cement that for fans and future players that enjoy it.” Gravitas Ventures Gravitas Ventures, an Anthem Sports \u0026 Entertainment Company, says the documentary will premiere later this year, with a release date to be announced soon. “Fans of baseball and sports enthusiasts alike can look forward to an inspiring and heartfelt portrayal of a true Hall of Famer.” Producers of the documentary are Hamid and Camille Torabpour, NFL Hall of Famer Willie and Angela Roaf, and Nick Hagen. The acquisition deal was negotiated by Kirk Harris and Mary Poole of Fairway Film Alliance. Producers Hamid and Camille Torabpour are represented by Karen Gottlieb at Grubman Shire Meiselas \u0026 Sacks. Watch the trailer for Kitty to Cooperstown here:",
