This looks most fascinating as a time capsule doc featuring stories about music \u0026 how its changed over the years. Here's the official trailer for Gale \u0026 Olson's doc Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted, from YouTube: Legendary musician Swamp Dogg has been described as \"one of the great cult figures of 20th century American music\" \u0026 \"the soul genius time forgot.\" He's a genuine eccentric responsible for some of the most unique rock-influenced R\u0026B (and wildest album covers) ever made. Hidden away deep in suburban Los Angeles, Swamp Dogg, alongside housemates Moogstar \u0026 Guitar Shorty, transformed his home into an artistic playground. Together, they navigate the many tumultuous waves of the music industry, forging a wonderfully bizarre and inspiring path across time \u0026 space. Amazing access to Swamp Dogg, along with incredible archival material, creates a fun, hilarious, unconventional film for a perfectly unconventional life. Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted is a doc film directed by indie filmmakers / musicians Isaac Gale and Ryan Olson, both making their feature directorial debut with this. Co-directed by David McMurry. It's produced by Paul Lovelace, David McMurry, Ben Wu, Isaac Gale \u0026 Ryan Olson. This initially premiered at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival last year, and it also play at Hot Docs in Toronto. Magnolia Pictures will debut Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted in select US theaters starting May 2nd, 2025 coming soon. Intrigued? Find more posts in: Comedy, Documentaries, To Watch, Trailer",
