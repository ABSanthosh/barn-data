The singer shared the news in a video posted on her X, Instagram and TikTok accounts on Friday night. “I have followed Kamala Harris since she was my U.S. senator. She fought for me then and she is fighting for all of us now. That’s why I’m proudly voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” Cher said. “I know they will fight to protect our rights and I’m so grateful to be able to make my voice count this year. I hope you will too.” Cher is among the high-profile celebrities to endorse Harris in the upcoming election against Trump. Fellow singers who have thrown their weight behind Harris’ campaign include Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Bruce Springsteen and Marc Anthony. During the Democratic National Convention in August, John Legend, Stevie Wonder and more performed in support of the vice president. Popular on Variety In July, Cher was one of several Hollywood figures who commented on President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race.

I campaigned for him I believe it’s time to pass the baton, time for dems to think ‘way’ outside the box. Maybe even a split ticket.” Watch Cher’s full endorsement in the video below.",
