  "text": "Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire is getting a new name and some new cast members as it enters its third season. The AMC drama series will be known as The Vampire Lestat for season three as it focuses on the second book in her Vampire Chronicles series. The announcement was made at San Diego’s Comic-Con where cast and crew were on a panel. The contemporary adaptation of Rice’s gothic novel follows Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson), Lestat de Lioncourt (Sam Reid) and Claudia’s (Delainey Hayles) story of love and immortality, as told to journalist Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian). In season three, the Vampire Lestat sets his story straight in a way only he can — by starting a band and going on tour. Gabrielle. Nicholas. Magnus. Marius. Those Who Must Be Kept. They join Louis, Armand, Molloy, Sam, Raglan, Fareed on a sexy pilgrimage across space, time and trauma. Watch on Deadline Jennifer Ehle (Lioness) joins as Gabriella, Christopher Heyerdahl (Under the Banner of Heaven) is Marius, Damien Atkins (Slings \u0026 Arrows) plays Magnus, Ella Ballentine (Black Conflux) is Baby Jenks and Jeanine Serralles (Apples Never Fall) joins as Christine Claire. Assad Zaman returns as Armand. “I think we’re going to call it The Vampire Lestat, aren’t we?,” Reid said in a teaser for the new season (watch below). The series is executive produced by Mark Johnson — who oversees AMC’s Anne Rice Immortal Universe —alongside Rolin Jones, who is showrunner, Mark Taylor, Hannah Moscovitch, Christopher Rice and the late Anne Rice.",
