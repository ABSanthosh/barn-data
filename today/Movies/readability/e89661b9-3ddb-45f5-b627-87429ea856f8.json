  "text": "Stranger Things Season 5 is officially a step closer to coming out, as Netflix and the Duffer Brothers confirmed that production on the highly anticipated final season had officially wrapped. Following a production that lasted just under a year, co-creator Ross Duffer took to Instagram to celebrate the news with a series of behind-the-scenes photos. In a separate post, Duffer reflected on the journey everyone involved in the show has been on, and said that the show wasn’t just a show for many of the cast, and was instead a “defining part of their childhood,” and reflected on how the entire cast and crew have grown up as a family over the past decade. “We’ve been telling this story for nearly a decade now,” Duffer’s post reads. “Many of our cast members joined us when they were kids, just ten or eleven years old. It wasn’t just a show for them — it was a defining part of their childhood. They’ve grown up before our eyes, becoming more than actors — they’ve become family. “But it’s not just the cast we consider family. Our crew — many of whom have been with us from the very beginning — holds a special place in our hearts. Their dedication and passion have been the backbone of this journey. Everyone involved was determined to bring this story to a satisfying conclusion. They poured their hearts and souls into it, and we couldn’t be more proud of what they’ve accomplished. We can’t wait to share it with you all next year. Until then — over and out.” What do we know about Stranger Things Season 5? Stranger Things Season 5 will star Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, David Harbour as Jim Hopper, Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven, Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair, Sadie Sink as Maxine “Max” Mayfield, Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Joe Keery as Steve Harrington, Maya Hawke as Robin Buckley, Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair, Jamie Cambell Bower as Vecna, Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler, Amybeth McNulty as Vickie, and Linda Hamilton in an undisclosed role. Stranger Things Season 4 set a record for Netflix, having been viewed for more than 287 million hours during the week of May 23-30. That’s not only good enough for the top spot of the week for Netflix, but it’s also more than enough to break the record for the streaming platform’s biggest-ever premiere weekend for an English-language series. That was previously held by the second season of Bridgerton (193 million hours).",
