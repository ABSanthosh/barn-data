Mostly made with non-professional actors, with no acting background at all, and shot on location on Corsica. This looks damn good - stylish, gripping, and epic. Definitely need to catch this. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Julien Colonna's film The Kingdom, direct from YouTube: On the pale, sun soaked island of Corsica in the summer of 1995, teen Lesia is plucked from her sheltered life, and taken to a remote villa where her fugitive mob boss father, Pierre-Paul, is hiding out. Pierre Paul is a menacing figure, a near stranger to Lesia, and at first she feels trapped by the secrecy and danger which defines his life. But when an assassination attempt sets a chain of bloody vendettas in motion, Lesia and Paul-Pierre are forced to go on the run together. As they flee, Lesia becomes closer than ever with her father, and as they wade together through the violent underworld which he is entrenched in, his devotion to revenge begins to rub off on her. Julien Colonna's The Kingdom is a story of blood: blood split, blood sought, and the blood which binds us... The Kingdom, also known as Le Royaume in French, is directed by Corsican filmmaker Julien Colonna, making his first narrative feature film after directing the doc Luo Yang's Girls and episodes of the series \"Gloria\", plus a few other short films. The screenplay is written by Julien Colonna \u0026 Jeanne Herry. Produced by Antoine Lafon and Hugo Sélignac. This initially premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival last year in the Un Certain Regard section. Metrograph Pictures will debut Colonna's The Kingdom in select US theaters starting on May 30th, 2025 this summer. Who's interested? Find more posts in: Foreign Films, Indies, To Watch, Trailer",
