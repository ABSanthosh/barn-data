  "text": "Tributes from across the music industry poured in Wednesday evening for Liam Payne, with news emerging that the One Direction member had died at the age of 31 after reportedly falling from a hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The English singer entered the music industry after appearing as a competitor on “The X Factor” in 2008. The appearance was only his first, with Payne returning to the program two years later alongside Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik. The quintet placed third and were quickly signed to Simon Cowell’s Syco Entertainment, beginning a partnership that would launch One Direction as one of the most popular and highest-selling boy bands of all time. The group achieved music industry dominance from 2010 to 2016, selling more than 70 million records worldwide boosted by chart-topping hits like “What Makes You Beautiful,” “Night Changes” and “Story of My Life.” In 2017, Payne debuted as a solo singer with “Strip That Down,” after One Direction had announced an indefinite hiatus. His debut album “LP1” was released in 2019. Popular on Variety “I am in shock right now. Liam was always so kind to me. He was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he’s gone,” Charlie Puth wrote on his Instagram story. “I am so upset right now, may he rest in peace.” “Just talked to you 2 days ago my guy. Ima miss u frfr,” rapper Ty Dolla Sign wrote on his Instagram story, sharing a video of Payne. “So upsetting to hear the news of [Liam Payne] passing,” Paris Hilton wrote on X. “Sending love and condolences to his family \u0026 loved ones. 🙏 RIP my friend” So upsetting to hear the news of @LiamPayne passing😢 Sending love and condolences to his family \u0026 loved ones. 🙏 RIP my friend🥺— Paris Hilton (@ParisHilton) October 16, 2024 Lou Teasdale, One Direction’s traveling hairdresser for their time as a band, chimed in via X in a tweet that has been viewed over a million times. “Sending you all so much love,” Teasdale wrote. Zedd wrote on X, “RIP Liam… I can’t believe this is real… absolutely heartbreaking.” In a separate tweet, he continued, “Life is short and fragile… You never know what people are going through. We live in times where being rude, divisive and mean is normal; sometimes even celebrated. It doesn’t have to be this way. We should do our best to be kind, supportive and mindful.” The Irish duo act Jedward, who also competed on “X Factor UK,” sent strength to Liam Payne’s son Bear and Bear’s mother Cheryl.
