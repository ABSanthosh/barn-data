She's awesome. Yep – this looks like it's an engaging and uplifting biopic doc to watch. Here's the official trailer for Shoshannah Stern's doc Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore, on YouTube: In 1987, at the young age of just 21, Marlee Matlin shattered expectations as the first Deaf actor to win an Academy Award for her groundbreaking performance in Children of a Lesser God. Catapulted into the spotlight, she seized the moment to challenge an industry unprepared for her immense talent, emerging as a trailblazer not only as a great performer but also as an author and activist. Matlin's incredible journey continued with standout roles in acclaimed projects such as The West Wing and the Oscar-winning CODA, all while relentlessly advocating for greater inclusion and accessibility both within Hollywood and beyond its borders. In this film, Matlin opens up about her personal \u0026 professional struggles – her meteoric rise to fame, challenges of navigating a predominantly hearing industry, the pain of a tumultuous high-profile relationship, getting sober and years of being overlooked by Hollywood – alongside her many triumphs. Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore is directed by fellow Deaf actress Shoshannah Stern, who is making her feature directorial debut with this film; she also created the series \"This Close\" and worked on Marvel's \"Echo\" among her many other acting roles. It's produced by Bonni Cohen, Robyn Kopp, Justine Nagan, and Shoshannah Stern. This initially premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and it also played at Hot Docs, SXSW, and RiverRun. Kino Lorber opens Stern's Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore doc in select US theaters starting on June 20th, 2025 this summer. For more info, visit their official site.
