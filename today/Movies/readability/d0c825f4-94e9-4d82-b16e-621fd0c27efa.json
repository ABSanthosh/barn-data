  "text": "For the first time in her career, Lynne Ramsay plans to direct an actor she’s worked with before on another project. It just may surprise some who she’s decided to collaborate with once more. “I’m making a vampire movie,” Ramsay said in a recent interview with The Los Angeles Times, adding, “It’s with Ezra Miller who was in ‘Kevin.’ He’s the main character. That’s in development.” Despite being such a formidable figure in international cinema over the last 25 years, it may be shocking for some to discover that Lynne Ramsay has only made five feature films (“Ratcatcher,” “Morvern Callar,” “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” “You Were Never Really Here,” and “Die My Love“). She’s directed a number of short films as well, and it’s not as if she hasn’t wanted to make more, but it’s sometimes easier said than done. “It’s not by design. It’s just life takes over,” she said. “I have a daughter, there was COVID, stuff nearly gets there and falls through. It’s just a tough industry.” Ramsay also considers herself a “picky” filmmaker in that if she’s going to “stick with a project for two or three years,” she wants to be passionate about every aspect. This wasn’t the case when she recently tried to adapt a Margaret Atwood short story from the novella “Stone Mattress” with actress Julianne Moore. Problems arose when producers pushed for a location that didn’t work and led to script changes. “The actor, Julianne Moore, would do a couple of lines in one location, fly four hours and do the rest of the scene. And I just don’t work like that,” said Ramsay. “I can’t do it all broken up in pieces and it’s not good for the actors either.” Eventually she walked away and Jennifer Lawrence brought Ariana Harwicz’s “Die, My Love” to her. The film recently had its premiere in Main Competition at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, nearly a decade after her last feature, “You Were Never Really Here.” In IndieWire’s review out of Cannes, Ryan Lattanzio said of the postpartum drama, “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Jennifer Lawrence doing any of the debasing things she does in Lynne Ramsay’s ‘Die My Love,’ like crawling on all fours through a field of grass, a kitchen knife in hand as she closes in on her character Grace’s newborn baby, or masturbating gloomily in a state of postpartum doom while her husband Jackson (Robert Pattinson) finishes cooking dinner downstairs, a self-induced orgasm timed to the spring of a toaster below.” Hopefully the next one doesn’t take as long, as Ramsay told the LA Times she has “three scripts” in the works, all at different stages. Ramsay acknowledged that she doesn’t want to leave audiences hanging either. “You won’t wait for 10 years,” she said. “I don’t have 10 years. I’ve got to do it quicker than that.” “Die My Love” will be released later this year from Mubi.",
