  "description": "\"You young people suck!\" HBO has revealed the official US trailer for the Spanish series Rage, premiering on Max for streaming starting in July this summer. Originally known as Furia, this will premiere in Spain on the exact same day, too. Five women face extreme situations like extortion, oppression, \u0026 manipulation. Their conflicts all intertwine, triggering a butterfly effect, ultimately leading to a shared catharsis. Rage, a series of eight 30-minute episodes, is created and directed by Félix Sabroso. The new series brings together five iconic actresses on screen together for the first time: Carmen Machi, Candela Peña, Cecilia Roth, Nathalie Poza, and Pilar Castro. These five women go to the limit and perpetrate revenge, but not even they are spared in this contemporary satire. Additional cast also includes Claudia Salas, Alberto San Juan, Ana Torrent, Claudia Roset, Mima Riera, Pedro Casablanc, Marilu Marini, Iván Pellicer, Francesc Garrido, Martxelo Rubio and Pepón Nieto, among others. This series looks very clever and entertaining, a spunky \u0026 satirical take on everything wrong with the world right now and how it treats women. Check this out below. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Félix Sabroso's series Rage, direct from HBO's YouTube: […]",

Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Félix Sabroso's series Rage, direct from HBO's YouTube: \"5 women on the edge. 5 connected stories.\" Rage is a contemporary portrait about women: five female characters who lead this surprising, realistic and intense drama. Five women ready to do anything in the face of extreme situations such as extortion, oppression, deceit, exclusion or manipulation in a shared universe articulated around 5 conflicts that will develop like a butterfly effect – one as a consequence of the other – and so on to shared catharsis. A kaleidoscopic portrait of the current social moment with high doses of irony and humor. Rage, also known as Furia in Spanish, is a Spanish series created \u0026 developed \u0026 written entirely by Félix Sabroso (The Island Inside, Age Of Monster, Canta Y No Llores) and produced in Spain by Producciones Mandarina. With episodes directed by Félix Sabroso and Jau Fornés. Exec produced by Santi Botello, José María Caro, Alberto Carullo, David Ocaña, Antonio Trashorras, Teddy Villalba. HBO will debut Sabroso's Rage series streaming on Max in the US starting July 11th, 2025 this summer. Any good? Find more posts in: Streaming, To Watch, Trailer",
