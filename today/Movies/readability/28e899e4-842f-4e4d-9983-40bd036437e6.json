  "text": "Posted in: Dune, Legendary, Movies, Warner Bros | Tagged: Dune: Part Two director Denis Villeneuve explains his complex relationship with cell phones and why they are banned on his sets.Article Summary Denis Villeneuve discusses his strict no-phone policy on the Dune: Part Two set. The director compares human behavior to AI circuits in a thought-provoking way. Villeneuve admits the allure of phones and his desire to disconnect while working. Villeneuve emphasizes focus and presence, banning distractions from his filmmaking process. To say that we all have complicated relationships with our phones would be the understatement of the century. Every day, it feels like we're having some new debate concerning phones or AI. Threads were going around on social media in the last couple of weeks about students freaking out that ChatGPT was down and they couldn't use it to do their assignments or how other students were getting papers they wholely wrote themselves getting flagged as AI by AI and having to defend themselves against that allegation. Wicked and its release has somehow made the conversations about phones in movie theaters even worse as more and more people take pictures of screens like it's no big deal. We're all grappling with it, and when you're adapting some of the most influential science fiction of all time, there is no avoiding talking about AI and robot overlords. Dune: Part Two director¬†Denis Villeneuve was asked by the LA Times about his thoughts on the idea of AI taking over, and he replied that he believes we're already at that point. \"I feel that human beings are ruled by algorithms right now,\" he explained. \"We behave like AI circuits. The ways we see the world are narrow-minded binaries. We're disconnecting from each other, and society is crumbling in some ways. It's frightening.\" Dune: Part Two ‚Äì Summary, Cast List, Release Date The saga continues as award-winning filmmaker Denis Villeneuve embarks on Dune: Part Two, the next chapter of Frank Herbert's celebrated novel Dune, with an expanded all-star international ensemble cast.
