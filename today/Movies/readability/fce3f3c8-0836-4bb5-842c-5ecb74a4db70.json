  "text": "Taylor Sheridan is moving towards the southeast and is planning a spinoff of his hit streaming series “Tulsa King.” But instead of Sylvester Stallone, joining the Sheridan universe is Samuel L. Jackson taking the reins as the mob boss in the French Quarter. Specific plot details are being kept under wraps for the series currently titled “NOLA King,” but according to Variety, Jackson’s character will make a cameo appearance in the upcoming third season of “Tulsa King,” teeing up the new series. Paramount+ had no comment on the subject. There’s no slowing Sheridan down, and Paramount+ clearly feels there’s never too much Sheridan that audiences can handle. “Tulsa King” was the #1 new show back in 2023, and the series at the time of its debut was the biggest single day for sign-ups in Paramount+’s history. But we also had an idea this could be coming at some point. At TCA in 2023, then Paramount+ streaming chief Tanya Giles told us just as Paramount+ went all in on “Yellowstone” spinoffs, “Tulsa King” could easily get the same treatment because that’s just how Sheridan rolls. “The huge success we’ve had with ‘Tulsa King’ and Sylvester Stallone opens up possibilities with Taylor Sheridan, who consistently, his mind works in terms of universes and backstories, so I think there’s always a possibility that there’s more to that universe and more to that story. More to come there,” Giles said. “The Sopranos” producer Terence Winter was originally the writer and showrunner for Season 1, and he left the project before returning for Season 2. The new season is currently in production in Atlanta and Oklahoma. “Tulsa King” stars Stallone as a former New York mob boss whom after 25 years in prison is cast out to Oklahoma by his former family, only to quickly build his own criminal network. Jackson starred most recently in the Netflix film “The Piano Lesson,” and he’ll next be seen in the Western “The Unholy Trinity” opening next week. He also previously starred on a streaming series with the Marvel show “Secret Invasion” on Disney+.",
