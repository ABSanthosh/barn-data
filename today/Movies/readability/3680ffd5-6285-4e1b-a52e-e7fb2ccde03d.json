  "description": "\"If you work with us, we'll let you off the hook.\" Prime Video in Japan has revealed a trailer for Broken Rage, a unique Takeshi Kitano film ready for release on streaming in the next few months. This initially premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival as a special selection following his 3-hour long film Kubi the year before. Broken Rage follows a hitman, Nezumi (played by Beat Talkeshi), fighting for his survival when he’s caught between the police and yakuza. But in the second half, the gritty crime-action thriller takes an unexpected turn, evolving into a self-parodying comedy that retells the same story with a very humorous touch. A two-part film. This first half is a gritty action film in a dark criminal underworld revolving around a hitman and his struggle for survival. Aside from Takeshi Kitano, this also stars Tadanobu Asano and Nao Ômori. I watched this in Venice last year and it's hilarious - I had a blast with it. The second half is full-on Three Stooges-esque slapstick comedy making fun of these yakuza thrillers and action films and how dumb it really is to portray in a film. And of course, Takeshi-san rocks this funny role […]",

And of course, Takeshi-san rocks this funny role and delivers heaps of laughs. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Takeshi Kitano's comedy film Broken Rage, direct from YouTube: The theme of this film directed by, written by, and starring Takeshi Kitano, who is still active as a film director and continues to receive worldwide acclaim while reigning supreme in comedy, is \"comedy in a violent film\". This is an experimental film that shatters the conventional wisdom of the film industry with its unconventional direction and unpredictable development, and was made possible by the Kitano of the World. Broken Rage is written and directed by and starring Takeshi Kitano (aka Beat Takeshi), director of many, many films including Violent Cop, Boiling Point, Getting Any?, Kikujiro, Brother, Dolls, Zatōichi, Achilles and the Tortoise, Outrage, Beyond Outrage, Outrage Coda, Ryuzo and the Seven Henchmen, and Kubi previously. Produced by Emiko Kitano. Made by Kitano Agency. This initially premiered at the 2024 Venice Film Festival last year. Prime Video Japan will debut Broken Rage streaming worldwide starting on February 13th, 2025 this winter. It should be available to watch everywhere then. Who wants to watch?
