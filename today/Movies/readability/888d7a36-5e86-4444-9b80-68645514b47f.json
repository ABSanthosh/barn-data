  "text": "Jax Taylor is set to face one of the most challenging moments of his life in front of the cameras in The Valley Season 2. Ahead of the premiere of the Vanderpump Rules spinoff reality TV series, Taylor opened up about what viewers can expect to see from him. In the second season of the Bravo series, Taylor’s life is entirely different than when the show premiered in 2024. “It’s night and day,” Taylor told Deadline. “I watch a lot of reality TV [and] I don’t think I’ve ever seen a season like this in my life, especially for me — [this has been the] hardest year in my life. The last thing I want right now is for people to see what they’re about to see.” Taylor continued: “You’re going to see me at my most vulnerable state. You’re going to see me at rock bottom. You’re going to see me hanging on by a thread. It was very, very tough for me. That first episode is bad. Episode 2 — [it’s] really bad, really bad.” Watch on Deadline The former model has been living his life in front of the cameras for more than a decade, and skipping out on being filmed during one of the most complicated moments of his life was an option. Taylor explained why it was vital for him to show this part of his life to viewers. “It crossed my mind,” he said about stepping away from The Valley. “But you know what? I have a disease, and I think [what] is going to come out of this is going to make me a better person. I think you got to look at the silver lining of this, and it’s a sickness, and it’s something that I have to work on for the rest of my life, and it’s made me a better person. You gotta remember what you’re seeing was shot a year ago. Things are different. Friends are different, dynamics are different. I’m not that same person anymore. But I watched the episode and I saw that human being, that shell of a man, that disgusting person that I was, and I let myself become something that I despise. “I was very angry and then I get a divorce, I lose my house, I go to rehab twice, I get diagnosed with bipolar, PTSD [and] OCD, almost lose my kid, lost my friends. What man could deal with that in one year? That’s a lot,” he continued, “There was times where I was like, ‘I don’t want to be here anymore.’ But you know what? The reason I kept going is for my son. I have a 3-year-old little boy that’s going to need me forever, and I love that he needs me. There’s nothing better than your kids needing you. And I love him so much. He’s my pride and joy. He’s my heart. He’s everything to Brittany and I, and we love him so much. I just couldn’t bear to leave him. I couldn’t do it.” RELATED: ‘The Valley’ Season 2 Cast To Feature ‘Vanderpump Rules’ Alum Scheana Shay, Tom Schwartz \u0026 Lala Kent Following Reboot Taylor has been open about his struggles with substance abuse and told us he is 133 days sober and proud of the work he’s putting into bettering himself. “I go to AA every every week, I go to therapy. I’m rebranding myself. I’m restructuring myself,” he said. “You gotta remember, I’m 45 years old, so I’ve been doing this for 20 years. So I have a lot of work to do. But I love the path that I’m on right now. I love where I’m at right now. I love that Brittany and I are starting to talk a little bit more. We’re amicable parents. We’re not trying to be getting down and dirty like some other people on the show, but at the end of the day, it’s about our little boy, and Brittany and I need to put our problems aside and worry about that little boy, because he’s the only thing that matters.” Taylor often is considered a villain in reality TV and participated in House of Villains Season 1. With social media so invested in reality show drama, Taylor revealed how he handles the negative criticism he often receives. “I don’t really let social media bother me too much. These are just keyboard warriors. It is what it is,” he explained. “People have the right. I decided to be on TV. This is my choice. So people have the right to say whatever they want. That’s fine.” The Valley Season 2 premieres at 9 p.m. Tuesday, April 15, on Bravo.",
