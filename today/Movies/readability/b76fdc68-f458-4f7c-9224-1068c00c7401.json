  "text": "Carrie Underwood will be joined by performers including Kid Rock, the Village People, Billy Ray Cyrus, Lee Greenwood, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean and more over the weekend and Monday as part of Donald Trump‘s inauguration events in Washington, D.C. The Trump Vance Inaugural Committee revealed the lineup, confirming that Underwood will take part in the official swearing-in ceremony Monday making Trump the 47th President of the United States. Underwood will sing “America the Beautiful” on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, with tenor Christopher Macchio set to sing the national anthem and Greenwood also set to perform. Trump is scheduled to be sworn it at noon ET. Watch on Deadline Greenwood will also take part in Trump’s Make America Great Again Victory Rally on Sunday beginning at 3 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena in D.C., joined by Rock, the Village People, Cyrus and Liberty University’s Praise Choir, the committee said. On Monday evening, the Village People, Aldean and a “surprise musical guest” will perform at the Liberty Ball, one of three official inauguration-night balls. Rascal Flatts and Parker McCollum are set to perform a the Commander-In-Chief Ball, and Gavin DeGraw will perform at the Starlight Ball. Trump Vance Inaugural Committee co-chairs Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler called the events “a celebration of music, unity, and patriotism, ushering in America’s new Golden Age.” Earlier in the week, Underwood, and eight-time Grammy winner, was tipped to sing “America The Beautiful” at the swearing-in ceremony, listed among the performers including the Armed Forces Chorus and the United States Naval Academy Glee Club. She joins a list of past performers at the main inauguration ceremony that includes Garth Brooks singing “Amazing Grace” at Joe Biden’s inauguration, Beyoncé singing the national anthem at Barack Obama’s 2012 inauguration, and Aretha Franklin singing “My Country Tis of Thee” at Obama’s inauguration in 2008. Security screening gates at the Capitol open at 5 a.m. ET Monday, with music to begin at around 9:30 a.m., according to the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. After the swearing-in, events will include a farewell to then-former President Biden and then-former VP Kamala Harris, a U.S. Capitol Departure Ceremony, the President’s Signing Room Ceremony, a JCCIC Congressional Luncheon, the President’s Review of the Troops and a Presidential Parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, where there will be an Oval Office signing ceremony.",
