  "description": "\"You're asking for the grave.\" Quiver Distribution has unveiled an official trailer for a western called Long Shadows, another redundant American western drama about a batch of desperate people getting into even more trouble when everyone starts trying to kill everyone else. It's directed by actor William Shockley as his feature directorial debut, and also features former NFL star Tom Brady as a producer. When a young boy's mother and father are savagely murdered, he ages out of an orphanage intent on revenge, but the love of a girl and psychological trauma lead him down a mystifying path. In a rapidly modernizing American West, Long Shadows is the riveting story of a broken young man, a survivor of tragic violence, torn between his thirst for vengeance and love's redemption, \u0026 his soul so fractured reality itself is questioned. This western action thriller stars Dermot Mulroney \u0026 Dominic Monaghan, with Jacqueline Bisset, Blaine Maye, Sarah Cortez, Chris Mulkey, Anthony Skordi, and Ronnie Gene Blevins. This looks slightly better than most of the junk westerns being made recently, but still nothing to write home about. It's worth a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Shockley's western film Long Shadows, [â€¦]",

This looks slightly better than most of the junk westerns being made recently, but still nothing to write home about. It's worth a look. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for William Shockley's western film Long Shadows, from YouTube: Dermot Mulroney stars as Dallas Garrett, a former outlaw living with a lifetime full of regrets, who takes a young man named Marcus Dollar (Blaine Maye) under his wing teaching him the hard lessons of life. Jacqueline Bisset co-stars as Vivian Villere, the mercurial Madam and owner of the Purgatory Saloon, a woman who will stop at nothing to manipulate her power for her own gain. Dominic Monaghan plays Ned Duxbury, Vivian's long-time, conflicted, and ambitious assistant, who uses the Purgatory Saloon to hide in the shadows from societal norms of the time. Long Shadows is directed by American actor / producer / filmmaker William Shockley, making his feature directorial debut after one other short film previously. The screenplay is written by Shelley Reid, William Shockley, Grainger Hines. Produced by William Shockley, Grainger Hines, Tom Brady, Allen Gilmer, Tiiu Loigu, Justin Kreinbrink.
