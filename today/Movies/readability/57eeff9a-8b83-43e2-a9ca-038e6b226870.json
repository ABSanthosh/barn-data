  "text": "There are certain performances audiences need to see to believe, especially when it comes to the ones on the HBO series “Fantasmas,” from creator, director, and star Julio Torres. For instance, how can one properly describe Steve Buscemi playing the letter “Q,” or Oscar winner Tilda Swinton being the voice of water? IndieWire has exclusively learned that the current Gotham TV Awards nominee will be submitting for several Emmys categories, including the Outstanding Scripted Variety Series. The actors on “Fantasmas,” however, will still be among the Comedy Series contenders, similar to “Saturday Night Live,” which Torres used to write for. They include Torres for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, breakout star Martine for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, and “Fire Island” star Tomás Matos for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. All three performers are part of the connective tissue of the series, which is loosely about Torres’ character trying to find an earring he lost, taking him on a journey through a dreamy, alternate version of New York City. But “Fantasmas” is also a vessel for many memorable sketches about characters looking to find meaning, purpose, and connection in an increasingly isolating world.  For Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, HBO will be submitting Buscemi and Paul Dano (who was Emmy-nominated last year for his guest role on “Mr. and Mrs. Smith”). For Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series, the show will be submitting Alexa Demie, in her first role since “Euphoria” Season 2, and two-time Oscar winner Emma Stone who, in addition to appearing in a “Real Housewives” parody in the season finale, is also an executive producer of “Fantasmas.” Both Swinton as water, and actor Joe Rumrill, as Torres’ robot helper Bibo, will be submitted for Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance. The former is featured in the third episode “Toilets,” which is Torres’ submission for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series, while the latter is in the premiere episode “Cookies and Spaghetti,” which is Torres’ submission for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. “Fantasmas” will also be submitting for Emmy recognition in Picture Editing, Cinematography, Production Design, Title Design, Sound Mixing, Music Composition, Original Main Title Theme Music, Original Music \u0026 Lyrics, Motion Design, Costumes, Hairstyling, and Makeup for a Variety series and/or half-hour program. All episodes of “Fantasmas” are available on HBO Max.",
