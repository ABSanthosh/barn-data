  "text": "“The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon” will return with Season 3 on Sep. 7. The spin-off series starring Norman Reedus as Daryl and Melissa McBride as Carol will air at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+. The upcoming season focuses on the pair trying to make their way home, but encountering more obstacles along the way. The cast also includes Candela Saitta, Gonzalo Bouza, Hada Nieto, Yassmine Othman, Cuco Usín, Stephen Merchant, Hugo Arbués and Greta Fernández. New series regulars are Eduardo Noriega, Óscar Jaenada and Alexandra Masangkay. Executive producers include Reedus, McBride, showrunner David Zabel, Scott M. Gimple, Greg Nicotero, Angela Kang, Brian Bockrath, Jason Richman, Dan Percival and Steve Squillante. Additionally, Silvia Aráez and Jesús de la Vega also executive produce via Ánima Stillking. Popular on Variety “I couldn’t be more thrilled to announce a third season and to be working side by side with the brilliant Melissa McBride,” Reedus previously said in a statement, ahead of the second season. “Season 2 is some of my favorite storytelling of this series. Watching Melissa shine along with our brilliant cast and crew has been one of my fondest memories playing this character.” Manuel Fernandez-Valdes/AMC McBride joined the series, set in Europe, in Season 2 although it was initially supposed to focus on both Daryl and Carol from the beginning. “It’s one of the things that distinguishes us from the other ‘Walking Dead’ shows — that we get to show how different parts of the world have responded to the walker apocalypse and the different impact it has had in different places and come up with some cool, new things that you don’t see in the American versions,” Zabel told Variety last year.
