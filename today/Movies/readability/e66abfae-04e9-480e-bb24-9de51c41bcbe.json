This is another fun discovery! Made by an animation filmmaker from Montreal for a band from Montreal called Nap Eyes, this super weird super fun music video is worth a watch. \"Dr. Cool\", as he calls himself, created this hand-drawn music video for the Nap Eyes' song \"Dark Mystery Enigma Bird\" off of their new album out this month. It starts out with a group of horses going on a joy ride when the truck they're standing in rolls down a hill and takes them into the mountains and around the hills. As usual with these music videos, all kinds of weird things happen. Dr. Cool jokes in his intro: \"I shoulda made it so the horses roll back down the hill in the final scene but at some point you just gotta stop working on the video!\" Ahaha love it.

Dr. Cool jokes in his intro: \"I shoulda made it so the horses roll back down the hill in the final scene but at some point you just gotta stop working on the video!\" Ahaha love it. I'm always a fan of these kind of super wacky \u0026 weird music videos, letting the animation go off the rails anywhere it wants. The music is really cool, too. Thanks to Vimeo Staff Picks for the tip on this short film / music video debuting online. Here's the amusing full intro to the video via Vimeo: \"For this video I tried to focus on that feeling of summer sun blasting in ur eyes! I wanted it to seem extra hot out that day, like t-shirt and shorts weather. I also wanted to showcase my favourite meal, dry yellow hay. I also wanted there to be some sorta mysterious bird element but not too much, though I do like animating birds.\" The animated short for Nap Eyes's \"Dark Mystery Enigma Bird\" is directed by the Canadian animation filmmaker \"Doctor Cool\" aka Jordan Minkoff based in Montreal - you can see more of his work on his Vimeo or check out his Linktree or follow him on IG @jordzigram. This video was created thanks to the MVP Project, a joint initiative of RBCxMusic and the Prism Prize. The song is from the new Nap Eyes album called \"The Neon Gate\" which will debut this month (more info here). For full credits \u0026 details on the video, visit Vimeo.
