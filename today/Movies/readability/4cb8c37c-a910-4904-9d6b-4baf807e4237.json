  "text": "Mary is an epic biblical movie currently streaming on Netflix, and viewers are curious to know what happens in the film at the end. The story revolves around Mary (Noa Cohen), a young Jewish girl born with a grand destiny. She must overcome incredible adversities to be the harbinger of humanity’s salvation. Meanwhile, the elderly King Herod (Anthony Hopkins) rules over Judea with an iron fist with the help of his Roman allies and grows more fearful by day as citizens of his kingdom whisper about the coming of the Messiah. Here’s all you need to about Mary’s ending. What happens to Mary and Jesus at the end of the movie? Mary, the movie, begins with Mary’s parents desperately wanting a child and encountering Archangel Gabriel. He promises them they will have a girl but tells them that they have to dedicate her to the service of God in the Bethlehem temple. It is how Mary shoulders the responsibilities bestowed upon her by the divine that makes her incredible. Her destiny is unveiled over the course of the movie and despite the hardship she faces and the temptations she encounters, she never loses her faith. Toward the end of the film, Mary gives birth to Jesus, escapes from soldiers, and returns to Bethlehem with her son and Joseph. The guards at the city gate let her in after Anna the Prophetess sees her. Mary then visits the Second Temple and presents her child to Baba ben Buta. Is Herod alive or dead in Mary? Herod doesn’t die at the end of Mary, but his powers greatly diminish. He sees Gabriel, who calls him a “wretched soul” and warns him that his time is ending. A furious Herod tries to attack the divine messenger but without any success. Eventually, Herod’s soldiers and advisors desert him, leaving him all alone in his throne room. Mary’s return to Bethlehem with Jesus seems to coincide with Herod’s fall, noting that there is a new king of Judea. The movie ends by foreshadowing Jesus’ life. Mary reflects on the sacrifices one must make for love, and how ultimately, the results are worth the effort as salvation can only be achieved through love.",
