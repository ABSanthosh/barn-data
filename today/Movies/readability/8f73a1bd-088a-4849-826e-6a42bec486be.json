Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Lucy Turner's film Feather Christmas, direct from YouTube: For the single dad, and veterinarian, Martin (Ocean M Harris), Christmas is all about upholding regular family traditions to keep the memory of his late wife alive. But when an ailing pet chicken arrives at his home-run animal sanctuary, the family's festive plans, and entire world, are turned upside down, as new love blossoms and spreads its wings! Feather Christmas is directed by British filmmaker Lucy Turner, making her feature directorial debut with this project. The screenplay is written by Dan William O'Leary, from a story by Lucy Turner. It's produced by Becca Hirani, Benny J. Smith, and Lucy Turner. This hasn't premiered at any film festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Gravitas \u0026 Kaleidoscope will debut Turner's Feather Christmas film direct-to-VOD starting on November 19th, 2024 this fall. Who wants to watch? Find more posts: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
