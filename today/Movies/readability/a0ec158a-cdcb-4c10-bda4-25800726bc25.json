  "description": "A first look teaser trailer has debuted for the indie horror comedy film called Super Happy Fun Clown, the latest creation from indie genre filmmaker Patrick Rea (I Am Lisa, They Wait In The Dark, Shriek). It kind of sounds like a mashup between Joker and Falling Down (always worth a watch) featuring a woman this time who goes berserk and heads on a killing spree. To escape a life of oppressed obscurity, a battered former wunderkind weaponizes her obsession with clowning, serial killers, \u0026 classic movie monsters into a night of shocking infamy. Jennifer Seward stars as a woman who dresses up as \"Jenn-O the Clown\", who decides to let loose after realize her life is fading away. The film also features Dan Daly, Tim Shelburne, Nicole Hall, Matt Leisy, Deborah Madick, and Violet Rea. Thanks to Bloody Disgusting for the tip on this. Looks like it might turn out pretty badass - a brutal tale of vengeance from a pissed off clown. Even if it does seem like a Joker remix at least it should be a bit better than Joker 2 in the end. Check this out below. Here's the teaser (+ poster) for Patrick Rea's horror [â€¦]",

It kind of sounds like a mashup between Joker and Falling Down (always worth a watch) featuring a woman this time who goes berserk and heads on a killing spree. To escape a life of oppressed obscurity, a battered former wunderkind weaponizes her obsession with clowning, serial killers, \u0026 classic movie monsters into a night of shocking infamy. Jennifer Seward stars as a woman who dresses up as \"Jenn-O the Clown\", who decides to let loose after realize her life is fading away. The film also features Dan Daly, Tim Shelburne, Nicole Hall, Matt Leisy, Deborah Madick, and Violet Rea. Thanks to Bloody Disgusting for the tip on this. Looks like it might turn out pretty badass - a brutal tale of vengeance from a pissed off clown. Even if it does seem like a Joker remix at least it should be a bit better than Joker 2 in the end. Check this out below. Here's the teaser (+ poster) for Patrick Rea's horror Super Happy Fun Clown, from YouTube (via BD): Jennifer (Jennifer Seward) works a menial, low-paying job. Her mother \u0026 slovenly husband emotionally abuse her, rubbing her nose in perceived failures. Her only comforts in life are her side gig entertaining people at a park as \"Jenn-O the Clown\" and her friendship with her coworker, Ryan. Watching her dreams of fortune \u0026 glory slowly fade away, Jenn-O decides to embrace the mantra that infamy = immortality. She combines her love of clowning, serial killers and classic movie monsters into a night of bloody horror the world will never forget. That is, unless Detectives Marshall \u0026 Barnes can put a stop to her rampage. Super Happy Fun Clown is directed by American indie genre filmmaker Patrick Rea, director of the films Nailbiter, I Am Lisa, They Wait in the Dark, and The Last Butterflies previously, plus tons of other short films. The screenplay is written by Eric Winkler. It's produced by Andrea Fantauzzi, Kipp Feldt, Matthew Garrett, Wayne Gassman, Tony Ontiveros, Jennifer Seward, Bobby Thompson, \u0026 Patrick Rea. This recently finished shooting and will be ready for release sometime in 2025 - stay tuned for updates. Who's curious? Find more posts: Horror, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
