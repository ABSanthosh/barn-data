The dazzling shows, unforgettable performances, and stunning visuals have captured the hearts of audiences worldwide. Now, fans are waiting in anticipation for the next stop on this extraordinary tour. So, where is Taylor Swift performing tonight? Here is everything to know. Where is Taylor Swift today, October 13? Taylor Swift has no scheduled performance for today, October 13. She is using her break to rest and spend time with her loved ones. In a recent episode of Only Murders in the Building, Selena Gomez and her co-stars Martin Short and Steve Martin appeared to drop a hint for fans of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The episode, which aired on October 8, features a doll that looks a lot like Swift, complete with blonde hair and bangs. This doll is dressed in a jersey with the number ’87,’ matching Kelce’s jersey number for the Kansas City Chiefs. Swift has also been seen wearing accessories with the ’87’ number while attending his games. This reference comes shortly after Gomez mentioned in an interview with E! News that a Swift cameo might be unlikely, saying, “She’s a little busy, you guys.” When is Taylor Swift’s next show? Taylor Swift is set to bring her Eras Tour to Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium for an exciting three-night run from October 18 to 20, 2024. Fans are eagerly anticipating more of the captivating performances and visuals that have defined the tour so far. Following her Miami shows, Swift will head to Toronto. There, she’s scheduled for an extended run at the Rogers Centre from November 14 to 23, 2024. The tour will then wrap up in Vancouver, with the final shows taking place at BC Place from December 6 to 8, 2024.",
