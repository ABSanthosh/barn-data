It's a 2-min, hand-drawn animated short film featuring metallic humanoids posing \u0026 interacting – in celebration of and announcing the LGN Spring/Summer '26 collection. It's very obviously inspired by Blade Runner, literally even the name The Replicant like Deckard, but also feels distinct in its own way with these robotic models doing their thing. The short is created by an animation shop called Wizz Studio based near Paris, animated by a French animation duo known as Milli. I'm usually not into fashion, but this is legit dope. Slick style, stunning animation, a clever concept and fresh way to promote clothing. It also reminds me of French electronica duo Daft Punk's iconic 2003 anime music video, aka Interstella 5555, since these 'bots remind me of those, too. I'm always excited about any new hand-drawn animation. Enjoy. Thanks to Catsuka for the tip.
