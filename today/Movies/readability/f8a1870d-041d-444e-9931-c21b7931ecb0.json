  "text": "Multi-Grammy-nominated rock band Alice in Chains has canceled its forthcoming headlining shows and festival appearances to prioritize the health of co-founding member and drummer Sean Kinney. The Seattle-hailing group posted the news to Instagram yesterday, writing, “After careful consideration and following the advice of medical professionals, we have made the decision to cancel our remaining upcoming festival performances and the Alice in Chains headline shows.” Continuing, the heavy metal/grunge band added, “While we were all eager to return to the stage, Sean’s health is our top priority at this moment.” No further information was shared regarding Kinney’s medical diagnosis, and the “Man in the Box” musicians noted the artist’s health issue “requires immediate attention,” though “his long-term prognosis is positive.” Watch on Deadline “We sincerely appreciate your understanding and support during this time,” Alice in Chains concluded in the statement. The announcement follows an earlier social media post from May 8, in which the band revealed Kinney “experienced a non-life-threatening medical emergency” resulting in the cancellation of a scheduled show at Montville, Conn.’s Mohegan Sun Arena. “We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Refunds are available at the point of purchase,” the band wrote at the time. Established in 1987, the band’s lineup has comprised co-lead vocalists and guitarists Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall, bassist Mike Inez and drummer Kinney since 2006. Former members included late singer Layne Staley and late bassist Mike Starr. Per the group’s website, the only listed concert appearance is Black Sabbath’s sold-out charity farewell show for Ozzy Osbourne, also featuring acts like Metallica, happening July 5 in Birmingham’s Villa Park.",
