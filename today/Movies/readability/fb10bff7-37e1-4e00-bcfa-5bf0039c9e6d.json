  "text": "From being depicted in “Mindhunter” to inspiring Lady Gaga’s Harley Quinn for “Joker: Folie á Deux” and being immortalized in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” Charles Manson has been a Hollywood fixation for decades. Now, the late convicted murderer and alleged cult leader is posthumously narrating his own infamous legacy with Peacock docuseries “Making Manson.” The series consists of three one-hour episodes that include more than 100 hours of intimate conversations recorded over 20 years up until Manson’s death in 2017. Manson and three members of his California-based following were convicted for the murders of seven people, including actress Sharon Tate, on January 26, 1971. Manson died in prison. Peacock bills this upcoming docuseries as being the “most comprehensive Manson portrait yet on film or television” ever. Nearly 20 contributors appear onscreen, including Manson Family alums, to actual family members of their victims. Some interviewees are speaking out on-camera first time. The official synopsis reads: “‘Making Manson’ is an explosive series offering unfiltered insights into America’s most notorious killer, Charles Manson. Through 20 years’ worth of never-before-aired conversations, those closest to the case have their views challenged as Manson talks openly about his part in the infamous crimes, as well as his upbringing, criminal youth and his true feelings about ‘The Family.’ Manson reveals the cruelty he suffered in reform school and the childhood experiences that made him who he was. Former ‘Family’ members listen to the exclusive conversations and are taken back to the time when they ‘would do anything for Charlie.’ Manson recounts the early crimes that led to the murder spree in the summer of ‘69, laying out an explanation of loyalty and brotherhood that pushes against the accepted motive: his desire to incite Helter Skelter.” And, in the final moments before his death, Manson also is captured “reflecting on his life in prison and shows rare tenderness for the man who spoke to him across the decades.” Billie Mintz directs “Making Manson,” which is produced by Renowned Films. Max Welch, Kate Maddigan, Tim Withers, and Duane Jones executive produce for Renowned Films, which also was behind “My Son Jeffrey: The Dahmer Tapes” and “Loving Elvis.” “Making Manson” premieres November 19 on Peacock.
