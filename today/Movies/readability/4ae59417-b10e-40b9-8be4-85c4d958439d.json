The cuts are believed to be part of a reorganization under Natalie Bjelajac who was named VP Of Domestic Publicity in July. Among those affected by today’s layoffs was Director of Publicity Jason Clark who had been at Netflix for over seven years. He shared the news on Instagram. “Getting laid off sucks, which has impacted many of my Netflix friends today and over the past months for many,” he wrote. The layoffs were being implemented while Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria was making news at the Bloomberg Screentime event earlier Thursday morning, announcing several series pickups and renewals. Watch on Deadline In April, Netflix laid off 15 people in its film department as part of reorganization after Dan Lin took over for Scott Stuber. It has been a brutal year in the media industry with frequent — and deep — cuts in challenging economic conditions.",
