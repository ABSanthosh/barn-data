  "text": "Even though it’s set high in the Norwegian Arctic, you wouldn’t necessarily expect a documentary about young people taking a gap year to learn sled dog driving and survival skills to start… in the world of mythology. Yet that is exactly how directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady choose to open “Folktales,” connecting the story of its young subjects looking to change something about themselves to a tradition that’s far older than the Pasvik Folk High School and the students it takes in every summer.  Indeed, “Folktales” doesn’t just open with the story of Odin seeking knowledge from Yggdrasil, the tree of the cosmos, and meeting the Norns, who have the power to weave the course of human lives. Throughout the documentary, we snap back to a figure walking through the dark of a snowy night and see trees wrapped in red thread, marks of fate working its will in the world. For Ewing and Grady, the touches of legend were an important piece of the film’s setting and tone, and one they had to lay down from the very start.  “Heidi and I were looking for something that would help us explain in some way the magic that exists in this place. It feels very magical. The light — it’s just weird in a good way. It’s a mystical place,” Grady told IndieWire. “This device really spoke to the story and brought it to a bigger place, which is this universal concept of coming of age, which every single person on Earth must do and has done for thousands of years and will do for thousands of years in the future.”  But as Ewing pointed out, a concept is just a concept. Filmmaking requires a visual representation to make an idea work. It was all well and good to be reading Norse Mythology while they were shooting at Pasvik and seeing its echoes in the landscape, their young subjects, and the teachers who were trying to help students figure out their purpose. But then, in November, they found a tree.  “It’s like bramble-y and alive, like an old lady. She just demanded respect. She demanded to be looked at. We hiked back a mile and a half, actually, from where we were to go find the tree [again] the next morning because we couldn’t shoot it when we walked by,” Ewing told IndieWire. “It was the grail, at least for me — the tactile representation of how we could make this concept work.”  ‘Folktales’Courtesy Sundance Institute It also helped that Ewing and Grady are far enough along in their collaboration as filmmakers that they trusted each other and their team to try something, and if it didn’t work, they wouldn’t use it. They had a whole other opening for the film planned out, one they were very enthusiastic about, but ended up scrapping it in favor of the dramatization of Odin and the Norns.  “ Your audience will give you five minutes, maybe, to feel if they’re in good hands or not. So your opening needs to deliver the promise of the premise, and you have to work in this device right away. They can’t see it at Minute 11 or Minute 14,” Ewing said. “So we really had to retrofit the opening to start inside the myth.”  For as fun as it was to buy out all the red yarn in Finnmark, Ewing and Grady also had to really balance the amount of mythic material woven into “Folktales” so that it would create that expansive sense of place and an equally epic sense of adolescent possibility, but never feel forced or intrusive in the flow of the story. “The cadence took the whole edit — when to bring it in and when it should be visual and, you know, it’s a device, so you have to be careful,” Grady said.  It’s something that the directors became aware of as they started doing test screenings and showing cuts of the film to people as part of, as Grady affectionately described it, ‘manhandling’ their cuts. The mythological touches help to jolt audiences out of a particularly American mindset of looking for stages and skills and tests.  “A [viewer] said that it’s almost like the entire point of the school is when a kid was able to build a fire in the snow. And that is the point. The point is if you can build a fire in a snowstorm in the woods, you’re good. You will survive your life,” Grady said.  ‘Folktales’Tori Edvin Eliassen/Magnolia Pictures. Crafting a version of the documentary that effectively expresses that idea required a lot of patience on Ewing, Grady, and their team’s part, some very long lightweight lenses to make sure the subjects never felt the intrusion of the camera team while working on their fires, and a pretty rapid approach to editing. Because of the amount of Norwegian spoken at Pasvik — students learn it as part of their nine-month study — all the dailies needed to be subtitled.  Ewing and Grady also wanted to kick the tires and know what they were getting, so they could make better use of the precious time across the semesters (including the months of complete darkness).  “We were editing and roughing out scenes by September, and that really helped because we hadn’t worked with these two cinematographers before. So they had access to Frame.io so we would be sharing all the rough scenes with them, so they could understand what we’re using, what shots we favor, what worked, what didn’t work,” Ewing said.”They had never worked that way before [and] had access to the material they’d shot. It really motivated them, like, ‘Oh, we’re onto something. This is more emotional than we thought.’”  The early edits helped the filmmaking team do a bit of necessary mind-melding and, Ewing said, boosted morale through the cold, hard winter months of shooting. “Gen-Z is not for the faint of heart — at least photographing them. And so it really worked out,” Ewing said.  “Folktales” is screening at the IFC Center in New York July 25-31.",

We hiked back a mile and a half, actually, from where we were to go find the tree [again] the next morning because we couldn’t shoot it when we walked by,” Ewing told IndieWire. “It was the grail, at least for me — the tactile representation of how we could make this concept work.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"Folktales\" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg 1920w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=178,100 178w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=600,338 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=660,370 660w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1000,563 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=444,250 444w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=244,137 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1160,653 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=533,300 533w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=169,95 169w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=71,40 71w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=44,25 44w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=267,150 267w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1067,600 1067w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=110,62 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=285,160 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thumbnail_image001.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Folktales’\u003ccite\u003eCourtesy Sundance Institute\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt also helped that Ewing and Grady are far enough along in their collaboration as filmmakers that they trusted each other and their team to try something, and if it didn’t work, they wouldn’t use it. They had a whole other opening for the film planned out, one they were very enthusiastic about, but ended up scrapping it in favor of the dramatization of Odin and the Norns. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“ Your audience will give you five minutes, maybe, to feel if they’re in good hands or not. So your opening needs to deliver the promise of the premise, and you have to work in this device right away. They can’t see it at Minute 11 or Minute 14,” Ewing said. “So we really had to retrofit the opening to start inside the myth.” \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor as fun as it was to buy out all the red yarn in Finnmark, Ewing and Grady also had to really balance the amount of mythic material woven into “Folktales” so that it would create that expansive sense of place and an equally epic sense of adolescent possibility, but never feel forced or intrusive in the flow of the story. “The cadence took the whole edit — when to bring it in and when it should be visual and, you know, it’s a device, so you have to be careful,” Grady said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s something that the directors became aware of as they started doing test screenings and showing cuts of the film to people as part of, as Grady affectionately described it, ‘manhandling’ their cuts. The mythological touches help to jolt audiences out of a particularly American mindset of looking for stages and skills and tests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“A [viewer] said that it’s almost like the entire point of the school is when a kid was able to build a fire in the snow. And that is the point. The point is if you can build a fire in a snowstorm in the woods, you’re good. You will survive your life,” Grady said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" width=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?w=650\" alt=\"A boy takes a selfie of a cat perched on his soldiers in darkness while wearing a headlamp in \u0026#39;Folktales\u0026#39; \" srcset=\"https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg 2500w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=178,100 178w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=600,337 600w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=125,70 125w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=660,370 660w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1000,562 1000w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=445,250 445w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=244,137 244w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1160,652 1160w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=533,300 533w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=169,95 169w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=71,40 71w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=50,28 50w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=44,25 44w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=267,150 267w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1067,600 1067w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=110,62 110w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=285,160 285w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/3_da0b44.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e‘Folktales’\u003ccite\u003eTori Edvin Eliassen/Magnolia Pictures.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCrafting a version of the documentary that effectively expresses that idea required a lot of patience on Ewing, Grady, and their team’s part, some very long lightweight lenses to make sure the subjects never felt the intrusion of the camera team while working on their fires, and a pretty rapid approach to editing. Because of the amount of Norwegian spoken at Pasvik — students learn it as part of their nine-month study — all the dailies needed to be subtitled. \n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEwing and Grady also wanted to kick the tires and know what they were getting, so they could make better use of the precious time across the semesters (including the months of complete darkness). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We were editing and roughing out scenes by September, and that really helped because we hadn’t worked with these two cinematographers before. So they had access to \u003ca href=\"http://frame.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFrame.io\u003c/a\u003e so we would be sharing all the rough scenes with them, so they could understand what we’re using, what shots we favor, what worked, what didn’t work,” Ewing said.”They had never worked that way before [and] had access to the material they’d shot. It really motivated them, like, ‘Oh, we’re onto something. This is more emotional than we thought.’” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe early edits helped the filmmaking team do a bit of necessary mind-melding and, Ewing said, boosted morale through the cold, hard winter months of shooting. “Gen-Z is not for the faint of heart — at least photographing them. And so it really worked out,” Ewing said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Folktales” is screening at the IFC Center in New York July 25-31.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
