Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Jason Eric Perlman's sci-fi thriller Site, direct from YouTube: While inspecting an abandoned military site, Neil Bardo (Jake McLaughlin) suffers a mind-altering time distortion. Soon after, haunting hallucinations of strangers and troubling events from the past bleed into Neil’s reality. One vision is so traumatic, it leads to a biking accident that nearly blinds his only son. With his life unraveling and his son’s sight hanging in the balance, Neil must uncover the secrets of the facility and the soul-shattering truth of his hallucinations. Site is both written and directed by American writer / filmmaker Jason Eric Perlman, making his second feature after directing the film Threshold previously, plus a few other shorts. Produced by Benjamin Cooke, Kelly Hayes, Jason Eric Perlman, Yvonne Supangkat. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere, as far as we know. Blue Fox Entertainment will debut Perlman's Site film in select US theaters + on VOD starting August 7th, 2025 coming up. Who's curious?
