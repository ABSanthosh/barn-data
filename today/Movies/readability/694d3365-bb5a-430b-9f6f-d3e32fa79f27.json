  "description": "\"Hollywood has developed countless ways to make car chases feel more real and visceral to audiences.\" This easy-to-watch video essay takes a quick 10-minute look back at a handful of the most unforgettable car chases in movie history. We missed this video when it first dropped on YouTube back in 2021 - it was made as promotion for Fast and Furious 9 aka just F9 which opened in 2021 - but it's still fun to watch anytime. The video covers iconic car chase scenes from Bullitt (1968), The French Connection (1971), Vanishing Point (1971), Ronin (1998), Drive (2011), Black Panther (2018), Extraction (2020), Ford v Ferrari (2019) + a few others. Insider's How Car Chase Scenes Have Evolved Over 100 Years begins with the iconic Buster Keaton chase in 1924's Sherlock Jr. (followed up by his classic The General). While this isn't the most in-depth or extensive cinema history video essay, it will get you excited to watch more of these movies. And I'm glad they mention \"The Biscuit\" which is pretty much the industry standard used on most sets nowadays. Thanks to OpenCulture for the tip.

Video intro via YouTube: \"Fast \u0026 Furious 9, set for a 2021 release, is the 10th installment in a franchise known for pushing the boundaries of car chases. But there has been a lot of technological innovation leading up to this point that originated in classic films like The French Connection and allowed for even more realistic and dynamic chases in newer films like Baby Driver and Extraction. In this episode of Movies Insider [for the Insider channel], we take a look at how the art of the car chase has evolved over eight decades in Hollywood, from the influential chase in Bullitt to the wild spectacles of the Fast \u0026 Furious franchise.\" This car chase scenes video is produced by Meredith Geaghan-Breiner for the Insider YouTube channel with Chris Snyder as showrunner. The video is edited by Kyle Desiderio. And narrated by Abby Tang. We've also posted other great car chase videos including \"Driving at Night\" profile of Drive \u0026 Nightcrawler scenes, and Spectre Video Blog on Rome Car Chase. What is your fave car chase?
