  "description": "\"We're gonna handle this locally...\" This looks intensely dark and unsettling. Well Go USA has unveiled an official trailer for Barron's Cove, a very dark crime thriller marking the feature debut of filmmaker Evan Ari Kelman. This originally premiered at the 2024 Hamptons Film Festival last year, and it will also be out to watch in June this summer, including on VOD right away. When Caleb Whitaker's son is killed in a tragic accident, grief consumes him entirely... But when the system fails to hold the responsible child accountable, Caleb takes matters into his own hands—abducting the boy and vanishing into the wilderness.

But hard to tell if it'll be an engaging watch or not. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Evan Ari Kelman's film Barron's Cove, direct from YouTube: Barron's Cove follows a father with a violent past (Garett Hedlund) as he grieves the sudden loss of his only child. Convinced of a cover-up and intent on obtaining answers about his son’s death, he kidnaps the troubled boy that he holds responsible – the son of a prominent local politician – which ignites a media firestorm and frenzied manhunt. But as he grows ever closer to uncovering the truth, he is left to wonder whether his pursuers are really seeking to protect the boy, or merely the secrets he keeps. Barron's Cove is written and directed by filmmaker Evan Ari Kelman, making his feature directorial debut after making many short films previously and commercials. It's produced by Jordan Beckerman, Jason Michael Berman, Chadd Harbold, Jordan Yale Levine, Bannor Michael MacGregor, Will Raynor, Shaun Sanghani, and Cory Thompson. This initially premiered at the 2024 Hamptons Film Festival last year. Well Go USA will release Barron's Cove in select US theaters + on VOD starting June 6th, 2025 this summer. Who wants to watch?
