  "text": "John Mulaney may have packed up “The Sack Lunch Bunch,” but he’ll be back on Netflix next year in a big way. The standup comedian is getting his own live variety talk show on the streaming service; it will premiere in early 2025. Mulaney will host the show, co-showrun it, and executive produce though his Multiple Camera Productions. The rest of the details remain under wraps, though here at IndieWire we do have one strong suggestion: Mr. Music (Jake Gyllenhaal) as bandleader. Mulaney and Netflix tested this whole thing out earlier this year with six episodes of “John Mulaney’s Everybody’s in L.A.,” a live show that was part of the 2024 Netflix Is a Joke Fest. He’s also debuted three of his standup specials on Netflix: Last year’s “Baby J,” 2018’s “Kid Gorgeous,” and 2015’s “The Comeback Kid.” And then of course there was the excellent “John Mulaney \u0026 The Sack Lunch Bunch” in 2019. Mulaney, who will be on Broadway (so, in New York City) until the beginning of January 2025, won Emmys for “Baby J” and “Kid Gorgeous.” IndieWire’s Erin Strecker loved “Everybody’s in L.A.” In her review of the first episode, Strecker wrote that “silly, weird” show “has the feel of a late-night public access show (complimentary).” He was also celebrated as part of the IndieWire Honors event for his work on the show. Check it out to hear his great jab at comedy legend Carol Burnett. Netflix’s Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria made the announcement of the new Mulaney talk series on stage Thursday at the Bloomberg Screentime event. The Mulaney series is another part of Netflix’s upcoming live push, which also includes the recent Tom Brady roast, a pair of NFL games on Christmas Day, and even the WWE coming to Netflix. She did not comment on how many people watched the six episodes of “Everybody’s in LA,” but Netflix’s recent “What We Watched” report outlining the first six months of viewership in 2024 showed that it Season 1 notched 1.1 million views and 8 million viewing hours, both of which were behind Mulaney’s appearance on David Letterman’s “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction” talk show and Mulaney’s own “Baby J” special from a year ago. Still, the offbeat variety show format of “Everybody’s in LA” made for great engagement for those who did, including some randos calling into the show only to get swiftly hung up on by Mulaney after he asked them what kind of car they drove. It was a truly odd show, and we loved it. We’ll see if his new one is just as experimental.",
