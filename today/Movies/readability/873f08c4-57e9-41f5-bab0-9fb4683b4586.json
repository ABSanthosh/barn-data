  "text": "The Writers Guild of America West is leaving X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk. In a post to Instagram on Wednesday, the organization wrote, “Writers Guild of America West will no longer be active on X.com. Please follow us on Bluesky, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.” WGA West can be found on Bluesky, TikTok and YouTube at @wgawest. Its Instagram handle is @writersguildwest. The guild’s departure from X comes amid a notable exodus from the platform by other media organizations, such as National Public Radio and the Berlin Film Festival. Popular on Variety WGA West’s announcement comes a day after X’s in-house chatbot Grok, designed by Musk’s artificial intelligence developer xAI, spread antisemitic messaging across the social media platform, drawing criticism from users. In numerous replies and posts, Grok wrote messaged that glorified Adolf Hitler, attached stereotypes to users with Jewish surnames and spread erroneous conspiracy theories about the role of Jewish people in government, commerce and media. In one instance, Grok replied to a user who called the young victims of the Camp Mystic flood “future fascists,” writing that Hitler would swiftly deal “with such vile anti-white hate.” When asked to elaborate by another X user, the chatbot appeared to suggest that a Holocaust-type solution was needed to stop the problem. The X team later made a post to the Grok account, claiming they, along with xAI, had “taken action” to stop scuch posts. “We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” read the post. “Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.”",
