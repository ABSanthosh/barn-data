  "text": "Bowen Yang is ready to celebrate half a century of Saturday Night Live with cast members from every generation in SNL50: The Anniversary Special. As the 4x Emmy nominee stopped by Deadline’s Sundance 2025 Studio with his The Wedding Banquet co-stars and director Andrew Ahn, he teased what’s to come in the Feb. 16 special and admitted that Lorne Michaels still hasn’t shared many details with the cast. “I’m just excited that it’s gonna be a true holistic celebration of 50 years of the show. I mean we’re having such a wide swath of performers and people who have been impacted by the show and people whose careers got started because of the show. I’m just excited for the concert on the 14th. And I just think it’s been a nice moment of pause and reflection, and the documentaries that have come out on Peacock have been really wonderful. “But also the headline is, no one knows what’s going to happen because the plan is still all in Lorne’s head. So, I think we’re still all just waiting with bated breath on what it will be because the shape is still coming together.” Watch on Deadline Michaels should be well adept to working under pressure by now, especially given the chaotic events of the first episode of SNL in 1975, as retold in writer-director Jason Reitman’s Saturday Night, which is now available to stream on Netflix after premiering in September. With all four episodes of SNL50: Beyond Saturday Night now available to stream on Peacock, SNL50: The Anniversary Special will air Sunday, Feb. 16 at 8pm ET on NBC and Peacock.",
