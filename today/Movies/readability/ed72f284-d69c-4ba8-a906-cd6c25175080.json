Both films have big shoes to fill after the feature adaptation of It Ends With Us starring Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, who directed the film. Verity is another one of Hoover’s popular novels, and it has a thriller bent. The cast is stacked as is the team working behind the scenes. For everything we know about Amazon’s Verity adaptation, read on. When will the Verity movie come out in theaters? Watch on Deadline The thriller has locked in the date of May 15, 2026 for its theatrical release. Is the Verity movie in production yet? Yes, photos of Dakota Johnson and Josh Hartnett in New York City filming what looks to be a key intro scene from the beginning of Hoover’s book were captured earlier this month. Dakota Johnson and Josh Hartnett seen filming ‘Verity’ in Pershing Square on March 12, 2025 in New York City. Aeon/GC Images Who is in the cast of the Verity film? Deadline exclusively broke the news that Anne Hathaway was cast in the triller film as the titular character Verity Crawford. We later first told you that Josh Hartnett will star as Verity’s husband Jeremy, and that Dakota Johnson will star as author Lowen Ashleigh. “I’m basically the bad guy I think,” Johnson said of her character in an interview with Deadline. “It’s so fun.” Johnson also shared that she didn’t know what Verity was before she was sent the script. “She’s a really cool person,” the Materialists star said of Colleen Hoover. “But yeah, it’s Josh Hartnett, Anne Hathaway and me. I mean, obviously, everyone knows what it’s about from the book, but it’s about a ghostwriter or a writer who goes to finish the novels of this very established writer because she had been in an accident. So, she moves into the house with her and her husband and their kid and then all of these really weird twists and turns take place. It’s juicy.” Deadline also exclusively reported the casting of Ismael Cruz Cordóva (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power), Brady Wagner (Broadway’s Merrily We Roll Along), Irina Dvorovenko (And Just Like That…), K.K. Moggie (The Good Wife), and Michael Abbott Jr. (The Drama). Who else is behind the Verity film adaptation? Michael Showalter is reteaming with Anne Hathaway after they worked together on Prime Video’s The Idea of You, adapted from the bestselling book by Robinne Lee. He will direct the feature. RELATED: Ismael Cruz Cordóva, Brady Wagner, Michael Abbott Jr. \u0026 More Join Colleen Hoover Adaptation ‘Verity’ At Amazon MGM Studios Nick Antosca wrote the current script. Hillary Seitz, Angela LaManna and Will Honley \u0026 April Maguire wrote prior drafts. Antosca will produce alongside Alex Hedlund for Eat the Cat, and Showalter will produce alongside Jordana Mollick for Semi-Formal Productions. Hathaway produces for Somewhere Pictures, and Hoover produces alongside Shiny Penny and Stacey Sher for Heartbones Entertainment. Lauren Levine will executive produce for Heartbones. What is the Verity movie about? The story centers on Lowen Ashleigh, a struggling writer on the brink of financial ruin who she accepts the job offer of a lifetime. Jeremy Crawford, husband of bestselling thriller author Verity Crawford (Hathaway), has hired Ashleigh to complete the remaining books in a successful series that his wife is unable to finish after a mysterious accident. Ashleigh’s arrival at the lavish Crawford estate slowly reveals that things are not exactly as they seem when she finds an unfinished manuscript that possibly contains chilling revelations about the family’s past and Verity’s accident. As Lowen ingratiates herself with Jeremy and his young son Crew, she must discern if Verity’s writings are just scarily vivid works of fiction or an ominous warning by a deranged psychopath, who, in the books, is comatose upstairs in the master bedroom. Does Colleen Hoover have other books getting adapted into movies? Yes. After It Ends With Us landed in theaters last August, Paramount’s film adaptation of Regretting You will land in theaters in October 2025. A more recent novel from Hoover, Reminders of Him, is getting underway with casting and team behind the Universal adaptation.
