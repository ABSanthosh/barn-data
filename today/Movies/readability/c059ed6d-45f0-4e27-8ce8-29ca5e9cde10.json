It's a fascinating story of this TV crew at this moment having to decide then \u0026 there how to proceed. Great film. Here's the \"Live On Air\" promo featurette for Tim Fehlbaum's film September 5, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the official trailer for Tim Fehlbaum's September 5 right here, to see even more footage. September 5 unveils the decisive moment that forever changed media coverage and continues to impact live news today. Set during the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics, the film follows an American Sports broadcasting team that quickly adapted from sports reporting to live coverage of the Israeli athletes taken hostage. At the heart of the story is Geoff (John Magaro), an ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss, legendary TV executive Roone Arledge (Peter Sarsgaard). Together with German interpreter Marianne (Leonie Benesch) \u0026 his mentor Marvin Bader (Ben Chaplin), Geoff unexpectedly takes the helm of the live coverage. As narratives shift, time ticks away, and conflicting rumors spread, with the hostages' lives hanging in the balance, he grapples with tough decisions while confronting his own moral compass. September 5 is directed by German filmmaker Tim Fehlbaum, director of the film The Colony previously plus a few other short films. The screenplay is by Moritz Binder \u0026 Tim Fehlbaum; co-written by Alex David. Produced by Fehlbaum, Philipp Trauer, Thomas Wöbke, Sean Penn, John Ira Palmer, John Wildermuth. This first premiered at the 2024 Venice \u0026 Telluride Film Festivals. Paramount opens Fehlbaum's September 5 in select US theaters starting December 13th, 2024, then wide release January 17th, 2025 next year. Find more posts: Featurette, To Watch, Trailer",
