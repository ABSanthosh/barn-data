  "text": "On the morning of the 97th Oscar nominations, the words “nominees to be determined” were on everyone’s mind. Half of the Best Picture nominees — “The Brutalist,” “Emilia Pérez,” “I’m Still Here,” “Nickel Boys,” and “The Substance” — were announced without specific details over which producers would be eligible to attend and accept on the film‘s behalf if it were to win. Animated Feature contenders “Flow” and “Wallace \u0026 Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl” and Best Documentary Feature nominee “Sugarcane” were also announced without producers. The omissions sparked enough discussion that The Academy began selling “Nominees to Be Determined” tee shirts on its website. The Academy determined the remaining nominations on Monday, February 10, announcing the producers for each remaining film. The list came with some notable omissions, particularly in the case of “The Brutalist.” Joining Brady Corbet as nominees are producers Nick Gordon, Brian Young, Andrew Morrison, and D.J. Gugenheim — not Mona Fastvold, Corbet’s creative partner and wife who co-wrote the film. Her name being left off the producer list raised eyebrows, as she is listed as a producer on IMDB, though A24 denied that she was ever a producer on the film and said the IMDB page is being corrected. Veteran producers David Hinojosa, who executive produced “The Brutalist” along with Christine Vachon and Pamela Hoffler, did not make the cut either. The delay was a result of the vetting process, overseen by the Producers Guild of America, that determines which producers on a film are eligible for nominations. To be eligible for the Oscar, a producer must have been eligible for a PGA Award or have successfully appealed the guild’s refusal of such eligibility. Those five films did not begin the vetting process early enough to have their producers determined by nomination day. Controversy over nominated producers for Best Picture is nothing new. “Crash” financier Bob Yari famously sued the PGA and Academy over his lack of eligibility after the film won Best Picture in 2006. Cathy Schulman, who served as a producer on “Crash,” detailed the complications that arise from the vetting system in a recent op-ed column in Deadline. The complete nominee additions can be found below. BEST PICTURE “The Brutalist” (A24) Nick Gordon, Brian Young, Andrew Morrison, D.J.
