Not your standard survival thriller - this has tons of big guns in it! Have a look. Here's the official trailer (+ two posters) for Derek Barnes' thriller Whiteout, direct from YouTube: This harsh thriller film opens with an armed raid on the Russian offices of an international corporation. Brutally kidnapped \u0026 taken hostage, some workers end up in a labor camp in the middle of nowhere. Two hardened inmates, Kurt and Anthony (Douglas Nyback and Joel Labelle), save Henry (James McDougall) from the lecherous grip of another inmate and his henchman. Henry finds himself in a position to help his new associates escape, igniting a chaotic prison break that engulfs the men and the other prisoners. Those who make it out alive will face several days of deadly terrain and grueling obstacles in their journey for survival. Whiteout, also titled Walking Supply, is directed by stuntman / action filmmaker Derek Barnes, making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously; plus lots of stunt work before. The screenplay is written by Derek Barnes, James McDougall, \u0026 Douglas Nyback. Produced by James Mark, Bruno Marino, Todd Slater. It first premiered at the 2023 Another Hole in the Head Film Festival last year. Saban Films will debut Whiteout in select US theaters + on VOD starting November 22nd, 2024 this fall.
