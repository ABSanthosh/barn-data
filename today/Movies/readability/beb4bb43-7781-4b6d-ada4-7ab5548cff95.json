One of the most America! films we've posted a trailer for this year. Here's the official trailer (+ poster) for Anders Lindwall's film Green and Gold, direct from YouTube: Foreclosure looms over Wisconsin dairy farmer Buck (Craig T. Nelson). With mounting debt and the land his family has cultivated for four generations at risk, Buck refuses to give up his legacy without a fight... Buck’s granddaughter (Madison Lawlor) works alongside him but dreams of a life in music instead. Her aspirations are fanned by an emerging friendship with a famous musician (Brandon Sklenar), but chasing her dreams might take her far from the farm. With time running out, Buck places a daring Super Bowl bet on his beloved Green Bay Packers football team, risking it all to save everything he holds dear. Green and Gold is directed by newcomer filmmaker Anders Lindwall, now making his feature directorial debut after a few other short films previously. The screenplay is written by Steven Shafer, Michael Graf, Missy Mareau Garcia, and Anders Lindwall. Produced by Davin Lindwall and Aaron Boyd. Fathom will release Lindwall's Green and Gold movie in theaters nationwide starting January 31st, 2025 coming soon. Look any good? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
