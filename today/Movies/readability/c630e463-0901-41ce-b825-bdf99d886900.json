  "text": "Paramount Plus’s new TV and movie releases for June 16-22 2025 include Love Me and Noah’s Arc: The Movie premiere. On June 16, Paramount Plus subscribers can tune in to the platform to check out Love Me. Featuring Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun, this romantic drama science fiction movie is directed by Sam and Andrew Zuchero from a screenplay they co-wrote together. The story takes place across billions of years, chronicling a unique online meeting between a buoy and a satellite, after humanity’s extinction. The two then begin to understand what life was like before the same, while also learning more about themselves and falling in love with each other. Then, on June 20, Paramount Plus subscribers can check out Noah’s Arc. This film takes place after the events of Noah’s Arc: The Rona Chronicles special. The story follows Noah and Wade, who are expecting twin children. The duo soon faces a significant change in their lives after each of them is offered their dream job. However, things become complicated after the two find themselves trying to determine who will assume the traditional stay-at-home parental role. Also coming to Paramount Plus this week is Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards via on-demand. The Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards will be held at The Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, and will be hosted by Tyla. The ceremony is reportedly also expected to include a performance from KATSEYE. Moreover, Jack Black will attend the event, where he will receive the King of Comedy Award.
