Amazon has discounted the paperback boxed set of Jenny Han’s “The Summer I Turned Pretty” trilogy, on the heels of the third and final season of the hit Prime Video series. For a limited time, fans can pick up all three books, housed in a collectible box for just $19 — a 47% discount from its regular price of $35.99. The set includes “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” “It’s Not Summer Without You” and “We’ll Always Have Summer.” AMAZON DEAL The Complete Summer I Turned Pretty Trilogy (Boxed Set) “The Summer I Turned Pretty” was first published in 2009, followed by the subsequent books in 2010 and 2011. Amazon optioned the novels for series in 2021 and season one debuted in 2022. Season 3 of “The Summer I Turned Pretty” premierered July 16 on Amazon Prime Video, and will stream free for Amazon Prime subscribers (not a subscriber? Get a 30-day free trial here). The final season will consist of 11 episodes. While some fans were disappointed to know that the series would be ending, the move is not altogether unexpected, as the show is based on the Han’s trilogy, with each season corresponding to one of the three books. The author — who also wrote the “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” books — has not said that she is working on new novels for either of the series. In the meantime, get the “Summer I Turned Pretty” books on sale for just $19 on Amazon.com. As with all Amazon deals, the discount could end at anytime so add to cart while the discount is live. You can also purchase each book individually and see more boxed set options here. Per a description from publishers Simon \u0026 Schuster, “Belly has always lived for the summertime, because summer means all her favorite things: swimming, the beach, and the Fisher boys, Conrad and Jeremiah. For as long as she can remember, she’s shared her summers with the brothers at Cousins Beach. And for as long as she can remember, she’s been in love with Conrad. Then one summer it seems like he might have feelings for her too—but so does Jeremiah.” Get the book set on sale for 47% off here.",
