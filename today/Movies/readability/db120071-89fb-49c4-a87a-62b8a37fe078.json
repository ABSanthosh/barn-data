  "description": "\"This is not at all how I wanted everything to go...\" Uh oh. Dark Sky Films has released a full trailer for the Australian indie psychological horror film called Birdeater, which played at the 2024 SXSW Film Festival earlier this year. We posted a teaser back then just before its US debut - now set to hit theaters in January after a festival run this year. Birdeater is an unsettling thriller that \"represents a visually striking and daring debut from this Australian duo.\" A bride-to-be joins her fiance's bachelor party up in the remote Australian Outback. As the festivities spiral into beer-soaked chaos, uncomfortable details about their relationship are exposed, turning the celebration into a feral nightmare. Starring Shabana Azeez, Mackenzie Fearnley, Ben Hunter, Jack Bannister, Clementine Anderson, Alfie Gledhill, Harley Wilson, and Caroline McQuade. This looks super messed up and strange and extremely crazy. It's definitely not for everyone. Here's the official US trailer (+ new poster) for Jack Clark \u0026 Jim Weir's horror Birdeater, from YouTube: You can rewatch the teaser trailer for Jack Clark \u0026 Jim Weir's Birdeater horror right here, for the first look.
