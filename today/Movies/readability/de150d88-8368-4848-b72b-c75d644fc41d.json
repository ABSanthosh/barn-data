  "description": "\"What's going on? Why is everyone after you?\" Dark Sky Films has revealed a new US trailer for a French thriller film officially titled Hood Witch in English for this US release. Weird title, no? The original French title is Roqya, though that isn't any better. Here's the premise: A woman earns a living by smuggling exotic animals and illegal goods, developing a mobile app that links users with mystical marabout healers, but one of the user's consultations takes a tragic turn facing a violent backlash. Nour makes a living from smuggling exotic animals for her city's marabouts, wishing to get her son out of the city and offer him a better future. But an exorcism turns into a tragedy and Nour has to face a wave of violence that could cost their lives... Starring Golshifteh Farahani as Nour, Amine Zariouhi, Jérémy Ferrari, Denis Lavant, and Issaka Sawadogo. After premiering in 2023 at a few genre film festivals, this is ready for its release (including on VOD) in the US this spring. This looks like it gets totally crazy once they start coming after her! Watch out. Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Saïd Belktibia's thriller Hood Witch, […]",
