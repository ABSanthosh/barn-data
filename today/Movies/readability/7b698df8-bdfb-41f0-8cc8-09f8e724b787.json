  "description": "\"El Sergio is backo!\" Blue Fox Ent. has revealed an official US trailer for a fun French action comedy called The Gardener, finally getting released in the US this summer. We posted the original French trailer for this film last December because it debuted streaming on Prime Video only in France earlier this year. The movie stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Léo, an enigmatic gardener whose skills extend far beyond landscape maintenance. The story draws viewers into a murky affair of political elimination orchestrated by high level government. Serge holds a state secret. He, his family, and his gardener Leo appear on a government death list. They attempt to devise a plan to stay alive while mercenaries hunt them. The cast includes Michaël Youn, Nawell Madani, Carla Poquin, and rapper Kaaris. It is sort of a John Wick riff, about a simple guy who's actually an assassin. Though it seems more like The Beekeeper with JCVD. It looks exceptionally dumb - even the action isn't exciting. And this trailer has awful English dubbing on top of the French. Enjoy.

Here's the official US trailer (+ new poster) for David Charhon's film The Gardener, direct from YouTube: You can rewatch the original French trailer for David Charhon's The Gardener right here for more footage. Every year, the Prime Minister eliminates a list of all kinds of troublemakers in the name of raison d'état. Serge Shuster (Michaël Youn), a high-ranking civil servant with close ties to the President, finds himself at the heart of a scheme that puts his name on that kill list. Condemned to certain death, at the heart of a state secret that also puts his family in danger, Serge, his wife and children have only one hope left: their strange gardener, Léo (Jean-Claude Van Damme). The Gardener, also known as Le Jardinier in French, is directed by French writer / filmmaker David Charhon, director of the films Cyprien, On the Other Side of the Tracks, Castaways, and The Last Mercenary previously. The screenplay is written by David Charhon, Vincent De Brus, and Sebastien Fechner. Produced by Sebastien Fechner. This originally opened in France streaming on Prime Video in January earlier this year, along with Spain and the UK. Blue Fox Ent. opens Charhon's The Gardener film in select US theaters + on VOD starting June 6th, 2025 coming up. Anyone? Find more posts in: To Watch, Trailer prev next",
