This sounds \u0026 looks bonkers! Keep an eye out for it next year. Here's the first official trailer for DiMonda \u0026 Dubin's Traction Park Massacre, direct from YouTube: Gnarly horror film Traction Park Massacre is an audacious joy ride that brings together two groups of strong characters isolated in an abandoned amusement park called Action Wonerland which is now at the mercy of the Terror Twins, played by brothers Kai Thomas Schulz \u0026 Bodhi Schulz. The fictional park in the film is a dangerous local amusement park that burned to the ground 15 years earlier, supposedly killing then 10-year-old twins Otto and Emil Von Metzger, giving rise to urban legends. But the Terror Twins are alive \u0026 they hunt those thrill seekers foolish enough to attempt to find the remains of the abandoned park. Traction Park Massacre is co-written \u0026 co-directed by indie genre filmmakers Douglas DiMonda and Adam Dubin (director of Murder in the Front Row: The San Francisco Bay Area Thrash Metal Story), making their first feature film together. Produced by Jack Gulick. This hasn't premiered at any festivals or elsewhere yet - stay tuned for updates. Expected to arrive in theaters early 2025. Look good? Who's down?
