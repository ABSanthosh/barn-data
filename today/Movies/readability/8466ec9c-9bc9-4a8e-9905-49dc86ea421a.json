The action drama series focuses on the FBI’s first-ever female Black agent, Nina, trying to expose a criminal organization with the help of a skilled getaway driver, Jim. With the series coming to an end, fans have been curious about an additional number of episodes. Here’s all you need to know about the possibility of additional episodes for Duster. Duster Episode 9 release date and time explained There isn’t a Duster Episode 9 release date and time. This is because the series has a total of 8 episodes. Lately, streaming platforms have started the trend of dividing their shows’ seasons into parts. However, Duster isn’t following this release pattern as all its episodes have been released on their scheduled release date and times. Has Duster ended? Yes, Duster has finished. The show aired its last episode on July 3, 2025. Additionally, fans have been curious about the show’s next chapters. However, Duster is yet to be renewed for a second season. In a conversation with Interview Magazine, Rachel Hilson opened up on the possibility of a second season. She stated, “I wonder, if there’s a next season, if Nina would make Jim go undercover or something.” Additionally, Duster has received positive reviews from critics, increasing its chances for a second season. However, fans must wait for an official confirmation from the makers. Where to watch previous Duster episodes You can watch previous Duster episodes via HBO Max. HBO Max features Warner Bros. movies, DC and Cartoon Network content, and exclusive originals. Popular shows include Game of Thrones and The Last of Us. The series’ synopsis reads: “In 1972, the first Black female FBI agent heads to the Southwest and recruits a gutsy getaway driver in a bold effort to take down a growing crime syndicate.”",
