  "description": "\"I think something's not right.\" Viva Pictures has unveiled a teaser for an animated movie called Night of the Zoopocalypse, a surprise horror comedy creation arriving in theaters next year. This just premiered at the 2024 Sitges Film Festival in Spain (where I saw it) and will be in theaters in March 2025 - opening nationwide in the US then. A wolf and mountain lion team up when a meteor unleashes a virus turning zoo animals into zombies. They join forces with other survivors to rescue the zoo and stop the deranged mutant leader from spreading the virus. It's a horror movie made for kids (rated PG!), about zoo animals who have to save the day and stop a zombie virus from taking over. There's a cute baby hippo character and a female wolf named Gracie as the main character. With the voices of Gabbi Kosmidis as Gracie, David Harbour as Dan the Mountain Lion, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Felix, Christina Nova as Poot the Hippo, Joshua Graham, Scott Farley, and Kyle Derek. This is a fun one - keep an eye out for it next year when it drops. Here's the teaser trailer (+ poster) for Curtis \u0026 Perez-Castro's [â€¦]",

Here's the teaser trailer (+ poster) for Curtis \u0026 Perez-Castro's Night of the Zoopocalypse, on YouTube: David Harbour, famous for his role in Stranger Things, leads this fun animated horror-comedy where a meteorite crashes into a zoo, releasing a virus that turns animals into slobbering mutants. The survival of the zoo and all the living creatures inside it depends upon the joint efforts of a wolf and a mountain lion who need to work together to stop the zombie-like virus. Night of the Zoopocalypse, also known as Une nuit au Zoo (A Night at the Zoo) in French, is co-directed by animation filmmakers Ricardo Curtis (Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade, \"Young Love\") and Rodrigo Perez-Castro (director of Koati). The screenplay is written by Steven Hoban and James Kee. Produced by Yohann Comte, Steven Hoban, Joe Iacono, Wes Lui, Mark Smith. This initially premiered at the 2024 Sitges Film Festival this fall. Viva Pictures will debut Night of the Zoopocalypse in US theaters nationwide starting March 7th, 2024 early next year. Look any good? Find more posts: Animation, Horror, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
