  "text": "The first trailer for Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein movie has been released. Based on the iconic Mary Shelley novel published in 1818, Frankenstein is a new movie written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. Starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as Frankenstein’s monster, the film will be released on Netflix this coming November. Check out the Frankenstein trailer below (watch more trailers and clips): What happens in the Frankenstein trailer? The Frankenstein trailer offers some exciting new footage of Isaac and Elordi’s characters, along with others played by Mia Goth and Christoph Waltz. “Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro (Pinocchio, Cabinet of Curiosities, The Shape of Water) adapts Mary Shelley’s classic tale of Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation,” the official synopsis reads. The cast of the movie also includes Ralph Ineson, Felix Kammerer, Lars Mikkelsen, David Bradley, and Christian Convery. Andrew Garfield was initially tapped to play Frankenstein’s monster in the film; however, he dropped out due to scheduling conflicts related to the 2023 strikes and was replaced by Elordi. Del Toro has been trying to get a Frankenstein movie made for many years. He said about the movie during a Netflix event in January 2025, via Variety, “This film has been on my mind since I was a child — for fifty years. I’ve been trying to make it for 20 to 25 years. In fact, some people may even think I am a little bit obsessed with Frankenstein. And they probably would be right. You see, over the decades, the character has fused with my soul in a way that it has become an autobiography. It doesn’t get more personal than this.” Frankenstein will be released on Netflix in November 2025.",
