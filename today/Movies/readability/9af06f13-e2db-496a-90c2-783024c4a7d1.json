  "text": "Manhattan federal prosecutor Maurene Comey, who worked on the cases of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the highly publicized trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, was fired by the Department of Justice Wednesday, according to the New York Times. The decision comes eight years after her father, former FBI director James Comey, was fired by President Trump during his first term. While the reason for her termination remains unclear, some have speculated that her connection to the Epstein case, which has caused rifts in the Trump administration following a controversial attempt to bury any further investigation by Pam Bondi’s DOJ, may have contributed to the decision. Trump has largely dodged the Epstein issue following Elon Musk’s accusation that the president was on the disgraced financier’s client list, which would insinuate his involvement with acts of child sexual abuse. On Tuesday, Trump told the press outside the White House that the Epstein files were a hoax concocted by James Comey, as well as former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Popular on Variety “And I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey, they were made up by Obama, they were made up by the Biden [administration],” Trump said. “And we went through years of that with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, with all of the different things that we had to go through.” Elsewhere in the press gaggle, Trump outwardly supported Bondi’s work as attorney general and her decision to keep the Epstein files from the public eye. “The attorney general has handled that very well,” he said. “She has really done a very good job. And I think that when you look at it, you’ll understand that. I would like to see [transparency] also. But I think the attorney general — the credibility is very important. And you want credible evidence for something like that.”",
