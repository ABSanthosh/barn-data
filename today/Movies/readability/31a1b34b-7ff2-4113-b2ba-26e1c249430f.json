  "description": "All the action from the Star Trek panel at San Diego Comic-Con! Read the full article on AICN The Star Trek panel at SDCC just hit and boy did Paramount + bring the good stuff! Not only did they give us our first look at Strange New Worlds Season 3 and Lower Decks Season 5 but we were also treated to our first look at section 31, a Paramount+ Original Movie, starring Academy Award® winner Michelle Yeoh as Emperor Philippa Georgiou who joins a secret division of Starfleet tasked with some of the shadier work that comes with protecting the United Federation of Planets. Also revealed was a little bit of casting news regarding the upcoming Star Trek: Starfleet Academy series, which is bringing back Star Trek: Discovery alum Tig Notaro, Oded Fehr and Mary Wiseman and get this, Robert Picardo of Voyager and Prodigy! It would seem that the next few years will be a great time to be a Star Trek fan and I can't wait for more. Let us know what you think of the footage in the comments section below and as always, Live Long and Prosper… Finish the article on AICN",
