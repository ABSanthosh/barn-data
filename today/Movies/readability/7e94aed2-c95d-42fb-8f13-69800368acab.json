As the two actors celebrated each other’s creative achievements, the interaction sparked renewed interest in their long-standing friendship and the bond they’ve shared over the years. Here’s a closer look at their relationship and the mutual support they’ve provided through personal and professional challenges. Robert Downey Jr. calls Johnny Depp ‘brother’ after visiting his art show Robert Downey Jr. recently referred to Johnny Depp as his “brother” after attending Depp’s art exhibit, A Bunch of Stuff, in Manhattan. In a video shared on Instagram, Downey praised Depp’s artistic talents and expressed his delight in witnessing his friend’s creative growth. His caption read, “Wow…Don’t miss A Bunch of Stuff now on exhibition at the Starrett-Lehigh Building in NYC. My brother JD is an artist through and through, no surprise, just delight.” This message underscored the deep bond between the two actors. In the video, Downey begins by saying, “That’s my boy! Alright, let’s take a look at the show,” before showcasing several of Depp’s notable art pieces. This public show of support followed Depp’s attendance at Downey’s Broadway debut, McNeal, at the Vivian Beaumont Theatre on October 3. Depp shared his appreciation on Instagram, writing, “Most fortunate to witness my dear, brilliant friend Bob Downey and the superb cast of McNeal last night at @lctheater. Outstanding! Go see it if you can!!!” Downey has remained a loyal companion to Depp, standing by his side, particularly during Depp’s legal battles with Amber Heard, according to FandomWire. His admiration for Depp extends beyond art, as he has consistently supported him during challenging times. The two actors, who first worked together in 2000, have maintained a close friendship ever since, with Downey often celebrating Depp’s achievements both publicly and privately. Their mutual respect is evident, and through shared experiences, Downey and Depp’s friendship has continued to grow, cementing their bond as one of the most enduring in Hollywood.",
