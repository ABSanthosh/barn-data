  "text": "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has named former police commissioner Steve Soboroff “chief recovery officer” as the city looks toward rebuilding in the aftermath of the devastating Palisades Fire. The announcement, which came Friday, means Soboroff — a real estate developer and longtime civic leader who advised late former mayor Richard Riordan — will work directly with the mayor and associated city departments to build out a comprehensive strategy “for rebuilding and expediting the safe return of residents, workers, businesses, schools, nonprofits, libraries and parks” in fire-ravaged areas, according to the mayor’s office, per reporting by the Los Angeles Times. “I’m appointing Steve Soboroff — a longtime builder and leader here in L.A. — as the Chief Recovery Officer for the first phase of our recovery,” Bass said in a statement to X. “Our absolute number one priority is to help Angelenos return to their communities as we rebuild what has been lost.” Watch on Deadline The move comes a day after California lawmakers introduced new legislative efforts to speed up Los Angeles County’s recovery process as thousands remain permanently or temporarily displaced from their homes. In his various roles, Soboroff, who raised his family in the Pacific Palisades community, assisted in the development of Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center), as well as westside neighborhood Playa Vista, a multibillion-dollar residential, office and retail community. In 2001, he unsuccessfully ran for mayor, losing out to Democrat James Hahn. Bass said in announcing the appointment, per CBS News, “Steve Soboroff’s name is attached to hope. He will recommend a comprehensive city strategy for rebuilding and for expediting. Expediting is a very important word here. We want to expedite the return of residents, businesses, schools, nonprofits and parks. He knows our communities. He knows how to activate City Hall. He’s been in City Hall.”  According to the county’s media updates on the Palisades Fire, which erupted 11 days ago, 628 structures have been damaged and 3,857 have been destroyed, not including those believed to be destroyed and pending confirmation. Combined with the Eaton Fire not under Bass’ jurisdiction in Altadena and Pasadena, there have been 27 confirmed deaths. The Palisades Fire has burned over 23,000 acres and leveled Santa Monica Mountains communities including in Malibu, with containment at 43%.",
