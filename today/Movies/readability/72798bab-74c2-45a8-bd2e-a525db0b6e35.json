  "text": "Taylor Russell has exited her role in Amazon MGM Studios’ reimagining of “The Thomas Crown Affair,” where she was set to star opposite Michael B. Jordan. Production on the movie, directed by Jordan, is underway in London. Russell is said to have exited the part due to creative differences, and the studio will be recasting her role as progress continues toward the film’s March 5, 2027 theatrical release date. “The Thomas Crown Affair” also stars Kenneth Branagh, Lily Gladstone, Danai Gurira, Pilou Asbæk and Aiysha Hart. Drew Pearce wrote the script, with plot details being kept under wraps, following a previous draft written by Wes Tooke and Justin Britt-Gibson, which was based on the original film. Popular on Variety Jordan and Elizabeth Raposo are producing the picture for Outlier Society, alongside Charles Roven via Atlas Entertainment. Patrick McCormick and Toberoff Productions’ Marc Toberoff also serve as producers. Alan Trustman (writer of the original 1968 film starring Steve McQueen) is an executive producer. Russell is best known for her standout turns in Trey Edward Shults’ A24 feature “Waves,” for which she won the breakthrough actor award at the Gotham Awards, and Luca Guadagnino’s “Bones and All,” which earned her the emerging actress prize at the Venice Film Festival and nominations from the Gothams and Independent Spirit Awards. Upcoming, Russell will be seen in the Korean thriller “Hope” by Na Hong-jin, opposite Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander and Hoyeon; starring in Frank Ocean’s upcoming film opposite David Jonnson; and in talks for a remake of “Single White Female” with Jenna Ortega for Sony. Russell recently made her stage debut in director Jamie Lloyd’s critically acclaimed revival of Lucy Prebble’s play, “The Effect,” which had a run in London and New York. Russell made her directorial debut with the short documentary “The Heart Still Hums,” which she co-directed and won best documentary short at the Palm Springs International ShortFest. She is represented by UTA, Narrative and James Feldman. Deadline was first to report the news of Russell’s exit.",
