  "text": "Peter Kwong, who played Rain, one of the three martial arts warlocks in John Carpenter‘s 1986 action classic “Big Trouble in Little China,” has died in his sleep Tuesday night, according to one of his reps. He was 73. No further details were shared. Kwong, a Sacramento, Calif. native, began his career as a TV actor in the late-’70s and ’80s with stints in shows like “The A-Team,” “Wonder Woman,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “Miami Vice,” “The Greatest American Hero,” “Cagney \u0026 Lacey,” “Dynasty,” “MacGyver” and “227.” His most well known role came with the 1986 release of “Big Trouble in Little China,” in which he played Rain, one of three super-powered martial artists known as the Three Storms. He starred alongside Kim Cattrall and frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell. Although the film has since emerged as a cult classic, it was a commercial failure at the time of its release, grossing only $11 million against a budget of roughly $20 million. Popular on Variety Also in 1986, Kwong starred in “Never Too Young to Die” with John Stamos and Vanity, as well as “The Golden Child” with Eddie Murphy and Charles Dance.

He was on the SAG National Board of Directors for more than 10 years and was also a member of the AFTRA National Board of Directors. He also served on the Television Academy Board of Governors as well as the Actors Branch Executive Committee of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.",
