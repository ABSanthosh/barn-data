  "text": "Billie Eilish took a beat during her concert this evening in Manchester to announce that she’s working on a project being shot in 3D with director James Cameron. Though she was relatively coy about what the project would be, she did confirm that she’s filming something that requires her to be in the same outfit across her four nights at Co-op Live, where Cameron was in the audience. More details will emerge in the coming months about where the footage will end up — fans on social media were speculating that it could be a documentary, film or even music video. “So you may have noticed that there are more cameras than usual in here,” Eilish told the crowd. “Basically, I can’t say much about it but what I can say is that I’m working on something very, very special with somebody named James Cameron and it’s going to be in 3D. So, take that as you will and these four shows here in Manchester, you and me are part of a thing that I am making with him. He’s in this audience somewhere, just saying. So don’t mind that, and also I’ll probably be wearing this exact outfit for like four days in a row.” Popular on Variety In the past, Eilish has released several films, including the 2021 documentary “Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry” and the concert film “Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles.” Eilish is currently on a world tour in support of her third album “Hit Me Hard and Soft,” which released last year. She kicked off the trek in September 2024, touching down in North America and Australia before heading over to Europe. Following her shows in Manchester, she’ll perform in Japan before circling back to the United States where she’ll conclude on November 23 at San Francisco’s Chase Center.",
