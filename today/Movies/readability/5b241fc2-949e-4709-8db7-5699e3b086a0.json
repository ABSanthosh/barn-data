  "text": "Reality star James Kennedy (full name James Kennedy Georgiou) of Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules was arrested on Tuesday night for a misdemeanor domestic violence charge. As confirmed by NBC News, police responded to a call after an argument between Kennedy and another woman. Here’s what caused James Kennedy’s arrest following what police call a “domestic incident.” What did James Kennedy do to get arrested for domestic violence? James Kennedy was arrested for domestic violence after getting inebriated and grabbing an unnamed woman during an argument. According to Page Six, the 32-year-old DJ was booked at his home on Tuesday night at around 11:30 PM PT in Burbank, California several hours after he and his girlfriend, Ally Lewber, attended a holiday party hosted by Kathy Hilton of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. A witness claimed to have seen Kennedy and the woman arguing. A source speaking with People said that “James was acting super aggressive all night long” and that he was “acting so erratic, running back and forth to the bar and body-checking people along the way.” While he was mostly alone for the night, “he appeared inebriated” and was “irritated and rude” when speaking with other party-goers. Officers at the scene stated that there were no visible injuries on the woman, though formal charges remain pending by the Burbank City Attorney’s office. It is unclear whether the woman in question is Lewber, though she appeared unfazed the following day when she co-hosted the Windsor Pre-New Year’s Eve party. Kennedy did not appear at this event, though he was released from jail on a $20,000 bail. Kennedy has admitted on Vanderpump Rules that he has struggled with substance abuse, while Lewber shared that his drinking has negatively impacted their relationship in the past. Vanderpump Rules will be returning for Season 12 with a new cast that does not include Kennedy.",
