  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Japanese studio Toei Co has signed a co-production development deal with Pambili Media, founded by South African filmmaker Mandla Dube, for historical epic feature film, Yasuke – Way Of The Butterfly (working title), about a real-life African warrior who became a samurai in Japan.  Dube is writing and directing the rare Japan-South Africa collaboration, which is part of Pambili Media’s six-picture development slate backed by the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC).  Set against the rich background of Africa’s Mwenemutapa Empire and its trade ties to India, China and East Asia, the story follows Yasuke on his journey from the African continent to feudal Japan in the 16th century, where he was made a samurai after a local lord recognised his skill and dignity as a warrior. The producers describe it as “a sweeping international cinematic event rooted in untold history and cross-continental connection.” Watch on Deadline Spearheaded by Yuji Kojima, Toei Vice President and Head of Toei’s Kyoto Studios, the development deal is part of the Japanese studio’s ambitious international expansion strategy, which involves international co-productions and developing remakes and original material for global audiences. It also represents a new level of partnership between Japan and the African continent in the global media space. Dube’s credits include Netflix action thriller Silverton Siege, inspired by the real-life incident that sparked the Free Mandela movement, and Heart Of The Hunter, based on Deon Meyer’s best-selling novel that was the first African feature to debut at number one on Netflix’s global charts. The development deal for Yasuke – Way Of The Butterfly was announced at a cocktail party held in Los Angeles on April 10 and attended by Toei Co CEO Fumio Yoshimura, Yuji Kojima, Consul-General Kenko Sone of the Japanese Consulate and other dignitaries and Hollywood creators. Kojima said: “When Pambili Media first approached us with the idea of bringing Yasuke’s story to the screen, we were intrigued and inspired. This is not only an opportunity to reimagine an extraordinary historical journey, but also a mission that aligns with Toei’s long-standing tradition of producing bold, genre-defining stories. We are proud to lead this international collaboration.” Dube commented: “To work with a company of the caliber of Toei is a dream come true. In the telling of the Yasuke story, we strive for cultural authenticity while telling an entertaining story with global reach. I am deeply honored by this collaboration and look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.” Toei has a long legacy of producing samurai movies, many of which were filmed at Toei Kyoto Studios, located in the historical city of Kyoto. The producers of Yasuke expect to partially shoot the film at the Kyoto studios and are also planning to engage Japanese government support through the JLOX+ incentive scheme, which was recently extended for another year.",
