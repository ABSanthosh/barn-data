  "text": "AMC Networks has announced a partnership with Tubi to premiere “Demascus,” a new six episode half-hour comedy sci-fi series from Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm. The series stars Okieriete Onaodowan and Janet Hubert. The series will premiere exclusively on Tubi starting Thursday, Aug. 7th.  The series follows Demascus (Onaodowan), a 33-year old black man who begins on a journey to self-discovery as he begins to use “experimental reality-bending” technology.  Additional cast members for “Demascus” include Caleb Eberhardt (“Judas and the Black Messiah, “The Post”) Shakira Ja’nai Paye (“Single Drunk Female,” “black-ish”) and Martin Lawrence (“Bad Boys.”) Popular on Variety After “Demascus was previously shelved in 2023 as a result of cost cutting throughout AMC Networks, the series had previously finished production in 2022. In AMC’s SEC filing released in 2023, the prospects of “Demascus” being filed to a new platform seemed possible, with the company saying that the shelved series “may realize some future licensing and other revenue associated with some of the owned titles.” “Through his titular character Demascus, Tearrance Chisholm asks one of life’s simplest questions: What does it take to be a good man? And he answers it with some of the most surprising and nuanced revelations one could expect,” reveals executive producer, Mark Johnson. “We thank AMC Studios for sharing our belief in this seriocomic series and Tubi for its steadfast conviction that it belongs on the air.” “We’re excited to introduce audiences to “Demascus”—a bold, genre-bending blend of comedy and sci-fi that challenges conventions as much as it entertains,” said Samuel Harowitz, SVP of Content Acquisition and Partnerships at Tubi. “At Tubi, we champion stories that surprise, provoke, delight and resonate deeply with engaged fandoms, and “Demascus” is exactly the kind of original storytelling we’re proud to spotlight.” Kirk A. Moore (“American Crime,” “For Life”) and Chisholm serve as the series showrunners. “Demascus” is executive produced by Mark Johnson (“Breaking Bad,” “Better Call Saul”) and Myki Bajaj of Gran Via Productions.",
