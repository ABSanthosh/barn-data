  "text": "Few artists march to the beat of their own drum as proudly as Rick Alverson. The Virginia-based filmmaker is known for his unapologetically bleak explorations of topics that might be funny in other contexts, like the Neil Hamburger tragedy “Entertainment” and the Tim Heidecker drama “The Comedy,” applying his singular, uncompromising voice to each project. And now, he wants to teach the next generation of filmmakers how to do the same thing with their own voices. Alverson and musician Emilie Rex recently launched the Little Valley School, an arts education community in the Allegheny Highlands of Virginia. IndieWire can exclusively reveal the school’s first major program: a series of two online filmmaking workshops hosted by Guy Maddin, the director of provocative films like “My Winnipeg,” “The Saddest Music in the World” and “Rumors,” and Carlos Reygadas, the acclaimed Mexican arthouse director behind films like “Post Tenebras Lux,” “Japón,” and “Silent Light.” Each filmmaker will host a four-week online course, which will meet twice weekly. Each week will consist of a talk given by the filmmaker, an exercise designed to stimulate creativity, and shared time for the students to present their work and help each other. An official synopsis of the program describes it in terms that will likely delight fans of the three filmmakers. “In the new abnormal — where climate chaos, soaring inequality, neofascism, and runaway artificial intelligence define an increasingly dystopian present — Little Valley School asks: What is the role of art? Artists have long been beholden to the demands of a consumer product pipeline, designed primarily to extract attention and maximize value. The virtual workshops focus on art problems and process as a means of disrupting this dynamic.” Maddin will host the first workshop, currently scheduled to run from September 7-28. Reygadas’ workshop will take place in February 2026. Both workshops will be conducted online (though the Little Valley School eventually plans to expand into in-person programs) and are available to students anywhere in the world at any stage of their artistic development. The workshops are priced at $165 for four weeks, with pre-registration available for $150 until August 8. More information can be found here.
