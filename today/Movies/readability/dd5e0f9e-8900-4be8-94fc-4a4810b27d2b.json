  "text": "With the third installment of the Knives Out franchise premiering this year, Rian Johnson is advocating for a theater-going experience. Following Netflix boss Ted Sarandos‘ statement that movie theaters are “an outmoded idea” for many, the 2x Golden Globe nominee said he hopes Wake Up Dead Man gets a proper theatrical run before hitting the streaming platform. “I want this in as many theaters for as long as possible,” Johnson told Business Insider. “We’re going to push for everything we can get in terms of theatrical because I want as many people as possible to see it in that form.” Watch on Deadline Sarandos previously said at the TIME100 Summit, “What is the consumer trying to tell us? That they’d like to watch movies at home.” Although he admitted to loving the communal aspect of theaters, the CEO added, “I believe it is an outmoded idea, for most people — not for everybody.” When asked if he agrees with Sarandos’ take, Johnson said: “Obviously, I don’t, because I love movies. I love going to see movies. But also, I have a feeling talking to Ted, it would be a different thing than one quote taken and kind of tossed at me in this context. So I don’t want to phrase this as I’m having a proxy discussion with Ted right here.” Josh O’Connor as Jud Duplenticy and Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc in ‘Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery‘ (John Wilson/Netflix) Pointing to recent successes like Sinners and A Minecraft Movie, Johnson said, “I think theatrical is not going anywhere.” “I think we’ve seen if you put a movie people want to see in the theaters, they are going to show up for it, and that experience of being in a full house and having that experience is so important,” he added. “It’s something that I love and I want more of in the world.”",
