With the recent release of Episode 13, fans are curious if there are any additional episodes. Here’s all you need to know about whether there’s a possibility of a Part 2 or additional episodes for Wild Cards Season 2. Wild Cards Season 2 Episode 14 release date and time explained There isn’t a Wild Cards Season 2 Episode 14 release date and time. This is because the second installment had only 13 episodes, with the final episode having been released on April 2, 2025. Additionally, streaming platforms sometimes split seasons into several parts for added hype. However, Wild Cards doesn’t seem to be following this pattern, as there have been no announcements regarding a Season 2 Part 2. The police procedural television series focuses on Cole Ellis, a detective who is demoted to water-cop duty. Soon after, he meets con woman Max Mitchell, who helps him with an important case. Thus, the two come together to solve cases and improve their respective lives. Has Wild Cards Season 2 ended? Yes, Wild Cards Season 2 has finished. The final episode of the second installment has aired, and there have been no official announcements about any additional episodes. The second season finished airing on April 2, 2025, with the last episode showcasing Ellis learning a crucial thing about the crime boss responsible for Daniel’s death. In addition, Max, Ricky, and George attempted to crack some clues hidden in Ashford’s office. For the unversed, Wild Cards has been renewed for a third season, per The Cinemaholic. While CBC has confirmed the same, CW is yet to drop the official announcement. Where to watch previous Wild Cards Season 2 episodes You can watch previous Wild Cards Season 2 episodes via CW and CBC Gem. The CW is recognized for its focus on superhero series, teen dramas, and fantasy-based content. Meanwhile, CBC Gem hosts popular Canadian shows like Schitt’s Creek, This Hour Has 22 Minutes, and Coroner, as well as exclusive documentaries and movies. While CBC Gem’s free version comes with ads, its paid subscription helps viewers access entertaining content without ads. The series’ synopsis reads: “A spirited con woman and a demoted by-the-book detective are given the chance to redeem themselves. The catch? They have to find a way to work together each using their unique skills to solve crimes.“",
