  "text": "Because she auditioned, Amanda Seyfried has been changed for good. The Oscar nominee recently opened up about the audition process for Wicked, noting she went in “six times” for a part in Jon M. Chu‘s big screen adaptation of the Broadway musical, having previously revealed that she auditioned to play Glinda while filming Hulu’s The Dropout. “I’m in that privileged spot where I just don’t have to [audition]. But I like, of course, I talked about this a lot. I auditioned like six times for Wicked because that had to be really just right,” she recalled on Backstage’s In the Envelope podcast. “And I loved it. I was busy. I barely had time to do it, but I made it work.” Watch on Deadline Seyfried added, “I worked my ass off for years and years and years on that music. I’m competitive with myself in a really healthy way, I think.” Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo ultimately landed the leads as Glinda and Elphaba, which they reprise in the forthcoming second installment Wicked: For Good, which premieres Nov. 21 in theaters. Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba in ‘Wicked’ Universal Pictures Seyfried, who previously starred in Mamma Mia! (2008) and Les Misérables (2012), explained why she wasn’t put off by the audition process. “I actually love it, because it’s scary as hell, but I love getting notes and shifting my performance,” she said. “It’s like a puzzle for me. I love the puzzle and I love the competition,” said Seyfried. “And I love waiting for the phone call with the feedback from the casting director.” After Grande and Erivo’s casting was announced in 2021, Seyfried has since praised the movie as “fantastic,” telling People in December: “It’s an extravaganza, which is what she [Grande] does really well. And [my kids] have been playing the soundtrack nonstop. And everything is as it’s meant to be for sure.”",
