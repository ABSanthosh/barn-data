  "text": "Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali‘s film debut is finally getting released almost 25 years after being shelved. Ali plays a fictional, egotistical revolutionary leader who compares himself to Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Moses in “Taste the Revolution,” a political satire mockumentary written and directed by Dan Klein. The long lost film follows two aspiring filmmakers as they chronicle the story of a charismatic revolutionary, Mac Laslow (Ali), and the group of disillusioned college students drawn together one summer to change the world. But, per the official synopsis, “without a unifying direction or clear goals, the movement descends into chaos.” Alexander Bilu, Jeremy Dubin, Jen Nails, and Jeremy Beiler co-star alongside Ali, who also executive produces. Ali isn’t the only Hollywood star who got his start with “Revolution”: Colin Trevorrow co-wrote the script, co-stars, and also executive produces. So why was “Revolution” shelved back in 2001? Well, according to director Klein, the feature “instantly felt like an out-of-touch period piece” after the events of 9/11. “Shortly after production concluded, 9/11 permanently altered the world, and our movie instantly felt like an out-of-touch period piece, so we buried it,” Klein said in a press statement. “Fast-forward a decade and a half, our lead actor, Mahershala Ali, won his first Oscar for ‘Moonlight’ and, two years later, his second for ‘Green Book.’ I shared a clip from the movie with him, and he immediately called to implore us to finish the film.” Klein continued, “When we revisited the footage, we realized it felt even more relevant, 20 years later. Perhaps the movie will, unfortunately, be perpetually relevant, given that so many young people pass through this phase in life, where they possess little and have an abundance of time and passion, if not the perspective or insight to fully understand the nuances of the causes they champion.” The feature was written in 1999, with then-NYU acting grad school student Ali taking the lead role. “Taste the Revolution” is produced by Maury Loeb, David Linke, and Kevin Linke, with Ali, Klein, Trevorrow, and Phil Cohen executive producing. Ali and Trevorrow are currently linked due to their involvement with the “Jurassic Park” franchise. While Trevorrow directed “Jurassic World: Dominion,” Ali is set to make his debut with the franchise in “Jurassic Park: Rebirth.” Ali also was previously announced to be leading Marvel’s “Blade” despite a five-year delay in production. “Taste the Revolution” will have its world premiere at the New Orleans Film Festival on October 19. Distribution rights are currently available for the film. Check out the trailer below.",
