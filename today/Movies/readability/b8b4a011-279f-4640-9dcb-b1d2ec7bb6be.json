  "text": "EXCLUSIVE: There’s change happening in The Bachelor universe. Deadline understands that Bachelor in Paradise will have a new showrunner for Season 10. We’re hearing that Scott Teti, who has exec produced series such as ABC’s Claim to Fame and Bravo’s Summer House in addition to various Married At First Sight spinoffs, is taking over showrunner duties for the upcoming season. This comes as the show is set to return this summer for its tenth season after having not been on the air last year. ABC, instead, focused on The Golden Bachelorette, which aired last fall, following the 2023 launch of The Golden Bachelor, as well as new seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. The Bachelor returns for Season 29 on Monday. Bachelor in Paradise is produced by Warner Bros. Unscripted Television in association with Warner Horizon. Watch on Deadline Claire Freeland, Jason Ehrlich and Bennett Graebner took over as showrunners for The Bachelor franchise in 2023 – after Mike Fleiss stepped down ahead of misconduct allegations – and exec produced season nine of Bachelor in Paradise alongside Nicole Woods, Tim Warner and Louis Caric serve as executive producers. Scott Teti (Kinetic Content) Teti started his career as an editor before joining 51 Minds Entertainment, where he worked on shows such as Flavor of Love and Rock of Love. He subsequently served as showrunner on the first season of A\u0026E’s Duck Dynasty before exec producing series such as Bravo’s Spy Games and Winter House, Married At First Sight: Couples’ Cam and Unmatchables and moving to ABC’s Claim to Fame. Bachelor In Paradise, which features previous contestants who have been featured on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, is hosted by Jesse Palmer. He recently said that he was “expecting changes” to the show. “I don’t know what those changes are going to necessarily be. I certainly have my own hopes what it might be, but I’m just really excited to get back to the beach personally, and to see our lovely cast, and to hopefully see some people fall in love and get engaged,” he told Swoon. Jonathon Johnson and Hakeem Moulton, who appeared on The Bachelorette with Jenn Tran, are set to be among the cast for season ten.",
