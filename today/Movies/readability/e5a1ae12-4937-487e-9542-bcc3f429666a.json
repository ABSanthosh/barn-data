The Los Angeles wildfires area have caused widespread destruction in communities across the city since Jan. 7. Despite containment progress over the weekend, officials warn residents to stay vigilant as the Santa Ana winds are expected to return. The California Community Foundation (CCF) utilizes partnerships with community-based organizations and government agencies while using data from CalFire and the CDC’s Social Vulnerability Index to prioritize underserved communities. It also aids in rebuilding essential infrastructure like emergency communication systems and offers financial disaster assistance, labor law education, and immigration services to low-wage workers and immigrant families. The Pasadena Community Foundation (PCF) has established the Eaton Canyon Fire Relief and Recovery Fund. The fund will support immediate needs and critical long-term recovery efforts after the fires are extinguished and the community embarks upon the task of rebuilding.
