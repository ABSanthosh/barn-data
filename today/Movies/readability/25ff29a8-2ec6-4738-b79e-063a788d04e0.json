  "text": "Ever dreamed of puffers and khakis that still fit even after crawling through tunnels and standing in quicksand? Yeah, we haven’t quite either, but after watching Tim Robinson‘s viral A24 comedy “Friendship,” we are trading our Dan Flashes looks for the soft earth tones of Ocean View Dining — they fit just right. After the success of “Friendship” (which will open in theaters nationwide May 23 after having a limited release in LA and NYC), distributor A24 announced that the fictional clothing company Ocean View Dining (OVD) is now a real brand…or at least people can buy the Ocean View Dining Classic Pants, which Robinson’s character Craig Waterman dons for most of the film. “The only clothes that fit just right,” Robinson repeatedly says as he promotes the beige/brown menswear essentials brand onscreen. The actual OVD pants and Craig’s puffer coat from the film will also on display at the Alamo Drafthouse BK starting May 23. “Friendship” director Andrew DeYoung recently told IndieWire that he wrote the feature specifically for “I Think You Should Leave” creator Robinson. The duo are set to also collaborate on HBO’s half-hour comedy pilot “The Chair Company.” “Tim’s a friend, and as I wrote, I was imagining him and I never told him about it until I finished it and sent it to him,” DeYoung said. “I never tried to soften the movie. I only tried to make it feel scarier to financiers, to be honest, to see who is actually down to get in the mud with me and try something different.” “Friendship” was produced by Fifth Season and BoulderLight Pictures, with A24 acquiring it out of the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival. Paul Rudd and Kate Mara co-star. “It was less of an established friendship and more of a wanting,” DeYoung further told IndieWire of the story’s origins. “I thought there was a friendship blossoming, and that person didn’t seem to be as interested as I thought. And I’m like, wow, you see the romance version of it constantly. I’ve never seen the middle-aged version between two straight men. That’s happening all the time. Men have friendships, and they have issues with their friends, and I know it’s most predominantly portrayed in ‘I Love You, Man,’ but what’s my version of that that’s closer to my reality? And so that’s where it started from.” And now, that reality is becoming more real with the look IRL. Shop below.",
