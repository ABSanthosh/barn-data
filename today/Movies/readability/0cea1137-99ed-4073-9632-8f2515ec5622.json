  "text": "Disney announced on Wednesday that Marvel Studios is scheduled to release an untitled movie on Dec. 15, 2028. It would be the fourth feature from the division set for that calendar year, with previously announced films scheduled for release in February, May and November of 2028. Should all four films hold onto those dates — which is not nearly certain — it would be an unexpected move for the studio, given Disney CEO Bob Iger’s recent public admission that Marvel “lost a little focus by making too much.”  “We all know that in our zeal to flood our streaming platform with more content, that we turned to all of our creative engines, including Marvel, and had them produce a lot more,” Iger said during an investor call in May. “We’ve also learned over time that quantity does not necessarily beget quality. And frankly, we’ve all admitted to ourselves that we lost a little focus by making too much. By consolidating a bit and having Marvel focus much more on their films, we believe that will result in better quality.” Popular on Variety It is quite unclear, however, whether Marvel will actually release four films in 2028. Disney has a history of holding onto release dates for feature projects well past when those films could realistically make those dates to ensure they remain available for other films from the company: Marvel’s “Blade” was removed from its November 2025 release date only after Disney was ready to slot the 20th Century Studios film “Predator: Badlands” in its place. For 2026 and 2027, Marvel has significantly winnowed its feature slate. After “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” opens in July, the studio is producing two films in 2026 — “Spider-Man: Brand New Day” (a co-production with Sony Pictures) in July and  “Avengers: Doomsday” in December; and two films in 2027 — an untitled project in July and “Avengers: Secret Wars” in December. “Secret Wars” is meant to be the finale of the Multiverse Saga, after which Marvel is expected to pivot to a saga centered around two sets of characters inherited in Disney’s 2019 acquisition of 20th Century Fox: the Fantastic Four and the X-Men. For the latter, “Thunderbolts*” director Jake Schreier has been tapped to helm the MCU’s first mutant movie (although many actors from Fox’s “X-Men” movies in the 2000s, including Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, will appear in “Doomsday”). Other Marvel projects in development that could wind up opening in 2028 include the aforementioned “Blade,” “Black Panther 3,” and “Fantastic Four” sequel.",
