And not just for anime fans - check this out. Here's the main official trailer (+ poster) for Masaki Watanabe's series Sakamoto Days, from YouTube: You can watch the teaser trailer for Watanabe's series Sakamoto Days right here for the first look again. When Sakamoto meets Aoi, a convenience store clerk, it's love at first sight—and just like that, he retires. Taro Sakamoto gets married, has a daughter, opens a mom-\u0026-pop store in a quiet town, and transforms... into a plus-size man. To ensure a peaceful life with his beloved family, the legendary ex–hit man bands together with comrades to face off against the looming threat of assassins. Sakamoto and company run wild in no-holds-barred, over-the-top battles that have stolen the spotlight and captivated audiences far \u0026 wide. In a world overrun by assassins, like the special force \"The Order\" from the Japanese Association of Assassins and a mysterious individual called \"X (Slur),\" Sakamoto questions the true meaning of strength. Sakamoto Days is directed Japanese animation filmmaker Masaki Watanabe, of the series \"Bâtendâ\" and \"KADO: The Right Answer\", plus all of the \"Battle Spirits\" series and movies. Adapted by Taku Kishimoto. Based on the hit manga written \u0026 illustrated by Yuto Suzuki - who is also an executive producer. Netflix will release Sakamoto Days streaming on Netflix worldwide on January 11th, 2025 early next year. Any good? Find more posts: Animation, Streaming, To Watch, Trailer prev next",
